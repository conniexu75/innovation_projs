https://openalex.org/W2142780460,"A putative G protein-coupled transmembrane polypeptide, named Pael receptor, was identified as an interacting protein with Parkin, a gene product responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP). When overexpressed in cells, this receptor tends to become unfolded, insoluble, and ubiquitinated in vivo. The insoluble Pael receptor leads to unfolded protein-induced cell death. Parkin specifically ubiquitinates this receptor in the presence of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes resident in the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes the degradation of insoluble Pael receptor, resulting in suppression of the cell death induced by Pael receptor overexpression. Moreover, the insoluble form of Pael receptor accumulates in the brains of AR-JP patients. Here, we show that the unfolded Pael receptor is a substrate of Parkin, the accumulation of which may cause selective neuronal death in AR-JP."
https://openalex.org/W2096628719,"Serum response factor (SRF) regulates transcription of numerous muscle and growth factor-inducible genes. Because SRF is not muscle specific, it has been postulated to activate muscle genes by recruiting myogenic accessory factors. Using a bioinformatics-based screen for unknown cardiac-specific genes, we identified a novel and highly potent transcription factor, named myocardin, that is expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. Myocardin belongs to the SAP domain family of nuclear proteins and activates cardiac muscle promoters by associating with SRF. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of myocardin in Xenopus embryos interferes with myocardial cell differentiation. Myocardin is the founding member of a class of muscle transcription factors and provides a mechanism whereby SRF can convey myogenic activity to cardiac muscle genes."

https://openalex.org/W2138162648,"Circadian clock genes are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and in peripheral tissues to regulate cyclically physiological processes. Synchronization of peripheral oscillators is thought to involve humoral signals, but the mechanisms by which these are mediated and integrated are poorly understood. We report a hormone-dependent interaction of the nuclear receptors, RAR alpha and RXR alpha, with CLOCK and MOP4. These interactions negatively regulate CLOCK/MOP4:BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of clock gene expression in vascular cells. MOP4 exhibits a robust rhythm in the vasculature, and retinoic acid can phase shift Per2 mRNA rhythmicity in vivo and in serum-induced smooth muscle cells in vitro, providing a molecular mechanism for hormonal control of clock gene expression. We propose that circadian or periodic availability of nuclear hormones may play a critical role in resetting a peripheral vascular clock."
https://openalex.org/W2062469526,"Vascular development requires an orderly exchange of signals between growing vessels and their supporting tissues, but little is known of the intracellular signaling pathways underlying this communication. We find that mice with disruptions of both NFATc4 and the related NFATc3 genes die around E11 with generalized defects in vessel assembly as well as excessive and disorganized growth of vessels into the neural tube and somites. Since calcineurin is thought to control nuclear localization of NFATc proteins, we introduced a mutation into the calcineurin B gene that prevents phosphatase activation by Ca(2+) signals. These CnB mutant mice exhibit vascular developmental abnormalities similar to the NFATc3/c4 null mice. We show that calcineurin function is transiently required between E7.5 and E8.5. Hence, early calcineurin/NFAT signaling initiates the later cross-talk between vessels and surrounding tissues that pattern the vasculature."

Peripheral node addressin recognized by the MECA-79 antibody is apparently part of the L-selectin ligand, but its chemical nature has been undefined. We now identify a sulfated extended core1 mucin-type O-glycan, Gal beta 1-->4(sulfo-->6)GlcNAc beta 1-->3Gal beta 1-->3GalNAc, as the MECA-79 epitope. Molecular cloning of a HEV-expressed core1-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core1-beta 3GlcNAcT) enabled the construction of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x on extended core1 O-glycans, recapitulating the potent L-selectin-mediated, shear-dependent adhesion observed with novel L-selectin ligands derived from core2 beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I null mice. These results identify Core1-beta 3GlcNAcT and its cognate extended core1 O-glycans as essential participants in the expression of the MECA-79-positive, HEV-specific L-selectin ligands required for lymphocyte homing."
https://openalex.org/W2031552251,"STAT1 must be phosphorylated on serine 727 to be fully active in transcription. We show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its effector kinase Akt play an important role in the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and in the activation of gene expression in response to interferon-γ (IFNγ). IFNγ activates PI3K as well as Akt in a variety of cell lines. Specific inhibition of PI3K abrogates IFNγ-induced, but not interleukin-1- or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced, phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine and reduces STAT1-dependent transcription and gene expression by ∼7-fold. Constitutively active forms of PI3K or Akt activate and their dominant-negative derivatives inhibit STAT1-driven transactivation in response to IFNγ. In addition to PI3K and Akt, JAK1, JAK2, and the tyrosine 440 STAT1 docking residue of IFNGR1 are required for STAT1 to be phosphorylated on serine. Taken together, these results suggest that the following events lead to the activation of STAT1 upon IFNγ stimulation: 1) PI3K and Akt are activated by the occupied receptor and Tyr-440 is phosphorylated by the activated JAKs; 2) STAT1 docks to Tyr-440; and 3) Tyr-701 is phosphorylated by the JAKs and Ser-727 is phosphorylated by a kinase downstream of Akt.

Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 is required for STAT1 homodimers to form and subsequently to bind to the promoters of IFNγ-responsive genes through γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements (reviewed in Refs. 1Bach E.A.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been established for some time. JAK1 and JAK2, constitutively bound to specific cytoplasmic domains of the IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 subunits, phosphorylate each other when IFNγ binds and the receptor subunits aggregate. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate tyrosine 440 of IFNGR1, creating a docking site that recruits STAT1 to the receptor. STAT1 binds to phosphorylated Tyr-440 through its SH2 domain, allowing its Tyr-701 residue to be phosphorylated by the JAKs. STAT1 then dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes through reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions, and binds to IFNγ-inducible promoters.At some point, STAT1 is also phosphorylated on serine 727 independently of tyrosine phosphorylation (3Wen Z.

Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). PI3K is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in response to many growth factors and cytokines by receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity or by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. A heterodimer comprised of one of three catalytic isoforms and one of seven adaptor/regulatory proteins, PI3K, once active, catalyzes the addition of a phosphate moiety specifically to the 3′-OH position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositols (reviewed in Refs. 14Fruman D.A.

Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The resulting 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols serve as secondary messengers to activate many downstream signaling targets, initiating the physiological effects of PI3K. One of the best characterized PI3K effectors is the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt(PKB), whose activation following growth factor or cytokine stimulation is directly dependent on PI3K-derived phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (reviewed in Refs. 16Vanhaesebroeck B.

https://openalex.org/W2007810468,"We reported previously that the carbohydrate domain of the amyloid precursor protein is involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-APP interactions. Functional in vitro studies suggested that this interaction occurs through the collagen binding site of APP. The physiological significance remained unknown, because it is not understood whether and how APP dimerization occurs in vivo. Here we report that cellular APP exists as homodimers matching best with a two-site model. Consistent with our published crystallographic data, we show that a deletion of the entire sequence after the kunitz protease inhibitor domain did not abolish APP homodimerization, suggesting that two domains are critically involved but that neither is essential for homodimerization. Finally, we generated stabilized dimers by expressing mutant APP with a single cysteine in the ectodomain juxtamembrane region. Mutation of Lys624 to cysteine produced ∼6–8-fold more Aβ than cells expressing normal APP. Our results suggest that amyloid Aβ production can in principle be positively regulated by dimerizationin vivo.

Thus, APP is not required for the expression of a critical cell function but may be involved in the modulation of neuronal functions at the cellular level. The structure of APP resembles a cell surface receptor (7Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the ectodomain of APP is phosphorylated within the acidic region in the N-terminal half of the molecule (13Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

The ectodomain phosphorylation of APP is inhibited by heparin, most likely by steric hindrance through binding of heparin to the N-terminal domain (11Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Reed G. Clarris H. Moir R.

It has been shown that in brain a distinct percentage of APP is present on the cell surface as a membrane protein of type I. This cell surface APP may mediate the transduction of extracellular signals into the cell via its C-terminal tail (18Nishimoto I. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S33-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Perez R.G. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9407-9414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Involvement of APP in neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity indicated that the observed function is not restricted to secreted APP, raising the possibility that some aspects of synaptic plasticity are mediated by cell-associated APP (1Neve R.L.

Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nature. 1993; 362: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Interestingly, APP mutants of familial Alzheimer's disease can cause G0-mediated apoptosis in neuronal cells, and these same familial Alzheimer's disease mutants cause the intracellular accumulation of C100 (1Neve R.L.

Dimerization of receptors induced by ligand binding is a common means of triggering signal transduction in mammalian cells (25Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Dimerization appears to play a role in cytokine receptor signaling (26Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and conformational changes brought about by receptor oligomerization in response to ligand binding are likely to activate the tyrosine kinase receptors (25Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Evidence that dimerization of proteins involved in neurodegenerative processes could play a role in the disease state is derived from current models of the role of PrP in scrapie pathogenesis (27Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oligomeric forms of PrP are believed to facilitate a more rapid conversion of PrPc into PrPSc and were observed in scrapie-infected hamster brains (28Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This encouraged us to investigate whether cellular APP exists as a homodimer and whether dimerization can promote or attenuate the Aβ production in the β-secretory pathway of APP. Based on surface cross-linking studies, we found that APP homodimerizes efficiently in the ER and Golgi and is secreted as a soluble protein from eukaryotic cells and from yeast cells as a recombinant protein. A mutationally induced dimerization of cellular APP produced a 7-fold increase of soluble Aβ, which is central to the pathogenesis of the disease. This suggests that dimerization-mediated regulation of APP processing is likely to be physiologically relevant. APP may exist as a homodimer on the cell surface. The homodimer is stabilized as an inactive dimer by multiple dimerization interfaces. A dimerization in this manner would provide a potential mechanism for a negative regulation of proposed APP functions and a concomitant increase of amyloid formation. APP mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the megaprimer method (29Seraphin B. Kandels-Lewis S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3276-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two outside primers spanned the BglII (forward, TCG GCC TCG TCA CGT GTT C) and XmnI sites (reverse, CAA CTG GCT AAG GGG CTA TGT G) in APP while the reverse mutagenic primers introduced mutations at position 624 of APP695 (K624A, CCA ATG ATT GCA CCT GCG TTT GAA CCC; K624R, CCA ATG ATT GCA CCC CGG TTT GAA CCC; K624C, CCA ATG ATT GCA CCA CAA TTC GAA CCC). For cloning of the mutated DNA fragment the restriction enzymes XhoI and ClaI were used. The resulting cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 at SmaI and SalI sites. The SP-GFP-APP695 clone was prepared from plasmids pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and pSP65-APP695 (30Tienari P.J. Ida N. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The GFP plasmid was restricted with PstI, blunt-ended with Klenow and religated to pEGFP-C0. The signal peptide of APP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pSP65-APP695as template and pairs of primers containing an engineeredBamHI site (antisense primer: GGG GGC TAG CTC TAG ACA CTCGCA CAG CAG CGC ACT CG; sense primer: GGG GGA TCC ACC GGT ACC TCC AGC GCC CGA GCC). The DNA fragment encoding the signal sequence was amplified in pBluescript (inserted into BamHI/SmaI sites) to pBS-SP. The GFP containing pBluescript plasmid pBS-SP-GFP-APP was cloned in three-way ligations using three inserts and restriction sitesXbaI/ClaI of pBS (insert 1, pBS-SP fragmentXbaI/AgeI; insert 2, pEGFP-C0 fragmentAgeI/KpnI; insert 3, pSP65-APP695fragment KpnI/ClaI). The DNA sequence encoding the GFP-APP695 fusion protein was ligated into pCEP4 cut with NotI/XhoI. The mutant construct SP-GFP-APP695/K624C was cloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen/ITC Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) using the sites NsiI and PmlI. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The pCEP4 vectors SP-GFP-APP695, SP-GFP-APP695-K624C, and the N-terminal c-Myc-tagged APP695 and APP695-K624C (30Tienari P.J. Ida N. Ikonen E. Simons M.

Stably expressing cell lines have been obtained by transfecting the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y with the plasmids K624C, K624R, and K625A containing the entire coding region of APP. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid mix and containing F-12. For stable expression, SY5Y cells were transfected with receptor cDNAs individually or in combination, selected with hygromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and maintained in medium containing 0.3 μg/ml hygromycin. The properties of at least three different clonal lines were examined so that the influence of clonal variation on the observed phenotype could be determined. Transfected cells of a 100-mm dish grown to 70–90% confluence were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 3 ml of minimal essential medium lacking methionine (Sigma) for 30–45 min. Labeling was performed in 3 ml of minimal essential medium lacking methionine, 5% dialyzed HI-FCS (1-kDa cut off), supplemented with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5% CO2 for 4 h. Alternatively, cells were incubated in medium lacking methionine and sulfate, supplemented with 5% dialyzed HI-FCS (1-kDa cut off) and 750 μCi of carrier-free [35S]sulfate for 4 h. The construct, consisting of residues 18–350 of APP from APP770, was expressed inPichia pastoris as described (32Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture supernatant containing recombinant APP from secreted expression was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and applied onto a column of Q-Sepharose (XK-50/20; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl), eluted with 70% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1m NaCl) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min and rechromatographed onto a second column of Q-Sepharose (XK 10/5). APP-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to 250 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a Superdex 200pg (XK 16/60) column. Fractions were eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The fractions eluting from an ion exchange and a subsequent size exclusion column were analyzed for APP content by Western blotting using monoclonal 22C11 as antibody. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Chemical cross-linking reagents, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), and dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl)propionate (DTSSP) were purchased from Pierce; DTSSP is thiol-cleavable, whereas BS3 is noncleavable. Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl), and homogenized. Crude membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 800 × g and resuspended in cross-linking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5). Freshly prepared cross-linker solution was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with continuous end-over-end rotation. To quench residual cross-linker activity, the solution was adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the incubation continued for 30 min at room temperature. To analyze the tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric forms of APP, detergents Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100 were added (to final concentrations of 2%) plus protease inhibitors (Complete tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The polyclonal antiserum 22734 was used to immunoprecipitate APP as described (33Borchardt T. Camakaris J. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of recombinant APP-(18–350) was performed by using the nonreversible, homobifunctional cross-linking agent BS3 or the cleavable cross-linker DTSSP (10 mm in water) in concentrations of 0.1–1 mm, depending on experimental requirements. To 10 μg (200 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) of purified APP-(18–350) freshly prepared cross-linker was added, and cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.5). Treated and control samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with polyclonal APP antiserum or monoclonal 22C11 (34Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal APP antibody 22C11, which recognizes the N terminus of APP, and antibody W0–2, which recognizes the amino-terminal region of Aβ, have been described previously (34Hilbich C. Monning U.

Polyclonal APP antibodies 22734 were raised against recombinant APP from bacteria (22734) (33Borchardt T. Camakaris J. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), or raised against yeast APP-(18–350) (polyclonal 40090) as described earlier for recombinant APP from bacteria (20Weidemann A.

Immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit APP antiserum and monoclonal Aβ antiserum and immunodetection of APP were performed as described previously (33Borchardt T. Camakaris J. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 37Jensen M. Hartmann T. Engvall B. Wang R. Uljon S.N. Sennvik K. Naslund J. Muehlhauser F. Nordstedt C. Beyreuther K. Lannfelt L. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 291-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting of APP, samples were separated on 7.5% Tris-glycine or 7% Tris-Tricine gels and immunodetected with mAb 22C11. Aβ was separated by 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (NuPAGE; Novex), and bands were quantified with the Fuji-Bas PhosphorImager system. Data are averages for at least three separate trials. After electrophoresis, dried gels were autoradiographed to help the excision of radiolabeled APP from the gel. Protein was eluted overnight from gel slices in 0.2 m NH4HCO3with 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. To increase the yield, gel slices were transferred into 0.2 m NH4HCO3, 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% SDS and repeatedly extracted for 3 h at 37 °C. The pooled samples were dried under vacuum and stored at −20 °C before electrophoresis. In initial studies, we identified a conserved motif in the carbohydrate domain of recombinant APP for collagen binding and APP-APP interactions that were found to be modulated by N-terminal Zn(II), Cu(II), and heparin binding sites (8Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1613-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not a monomer-dimer transition of APP also occurs in vivo, we analyzed APP dimerization and showed for the first time that APP exists as dimer and higher oligomers held together by multiple noncovalent protein-protein interactions. Normally, cellular APP migrates as a single band with a molecular mass of 110-kDa upon gel electrophoresis, irrespective of whether the protein was loaded with or without reducing agent. To confirm that APP can oligomerize in vivo, APP695-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were labeled either with [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate. Radiolabeled APP was immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100 extracts and resolved by nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1,A and B). The addition of the cleavable cross-linker DTSSP to partially enriched APP resulted in strongly enhanced bands having the apparent molecular weight of APP695 dimers and tetramers (Fig. 1 A). Without the addition of cross-linker, such bands were visible as preexisting aggregates rather than functional dimers of APP obtained from crude membranes (Fig. 1 A). This point of view is supported by the observation that cross-linked material did not all return to monomeric states after the cross-linker was reduced (Fig.1 B). Under nonreducing conditions, APP migrated at the monomeric molecular mass (110 kDa; Fig. 1 A), whereas cross-linked APP migrated as dimers (∼190 kDa; Fig. 1 A) and tetramers (∼400 kDa; Fig. 1 A). To show that the APP dimers and tetramers were not covalently cross-linked and the cross-linking was not enzymatically induced by the tissue culture cells used, the different molecular forms of APP were isolated from the gel by preparative electroelution in a second experiment. APP complexes eluted from the gel were treated with DTT to cleave DTSSP bonds before running on a second SDS-PAG, and Fig. 1 B shows APP forms of each eluted fraction from experiment 1 (Fig. 1 A). As a control, size-matched gel pieces were eluted from untreated samples and failed to show any protein in electroeluted fractions from experiment 1 (data not shown). In the presence of DTT and independent from the labeling technique, APP complexes were almost completely disrupted into monomers, with remaining original material (possibly resulting from preaggregated material) migrating either at the position of dimers or tetramers, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Since we were unable to detect the presence of any proteins other than APP itself in the oligomers (even nonspecific cross-linking to other membrane proteins can be ruled out at 1 mm DTSSP), this suggests that oligomeric APP normally exists in SH-SY5Y cells as well defined dimers and tetramers. Most interestingly and as implied by the [35S]sulfate labeling of APP complexes (Fig. 1, A and B), the oligomerization of APP occurs as early as in the ER, before [35S]methionine-labeled APP complexes are exported and before maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides (38Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.G. Kang J. Müller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and tyrosine sulfation of APP (20Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) occurs. It should be emphasized that the APP oligomers formed in the ER represent immature forms. This is most evident from Fig. 1 B, where monomerized [35S]sulfate-labeled APP migrates slower than [35S]methionine-labeled APP. To investigate the possibility that APP has oligomerization domains in addition to the collagen binding site (collagen binding peptide) of APP (8Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1613-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we tested the oligomerization potential of APP-(18–350) expressed in P. pastoris by dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography (32Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using dynamic light scattering, we mainly observed dimers. The average diameter of aggregates was 4.6 ± 0.1 nm at 20 °C (data not shown). For verification of existing APP-(18–350) dimers, size exclusion chromatography was performed on a calibrated Superdex 200pg XK16/60 fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column, and fractions were analyzed for protein content (Fig.2 A). The advantage of this technique is that it reveals the molecular weight of native proteins. The column was equilibrated with protein standards as indicated in Fig.2 C. Recombinant yeast APP behaved anomalously upon gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the majority of APP eluted from gel filtration columns with a size of 113 kDa (fractions 33–36), which is much larger than expected for a monomer. A minor fraction of APP eluted at 267 kDa corresponding to tetramers (fractions 29 and 30). APP monomers were still observed with a molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig.2, A and C; fractions 41 and 42). This would be expected for a monomer-dimer equilibrium, which always has some unbound monomers. Because faster moving dimers dissociating from the monomer pool are not observed (as would be expected for a spontaneous monomer-dimer equilibrium), the equilibrium seems to be overbalanced in solution in favor of APP-(18–350) dimers (and significantly less strongly in favor of APP-(18–350) tetramers). Analysis of the eluted material by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) and Western blotting (data not shown) showed that the major peak contained APP-(18–350) with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions indicated the absence of any intermolecular disulfide-linked homo- or hetero-oligomers (data not shown). This is in agreement with biochemical 2L. Hesse, manuscript in preparation. and structural data (32Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that all cysteines of APP-(18–350) are involved in disulfide bridging. Taken together with the results from the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B), data from gel filtration experiments are consistent with the 113-kDa band being an APP-(18–350) homodimer rather than a hetero-oligomer with another unknown protein. To obtain additional evidence for the dimerization reaction of recombinant yeast APP-(18–350), the protein was cross-linked by adding the homobifunctional cross-linker DTSSP or BS3, which both cross-link primary amines (i.e. predominantly lysine (Pierce)). No high molecular weight bands were observed without the cross-linkers (Fig. 3, lanes C). Additional bands at the molecular weight of APP-(18–350) dimers and tetramers became visible when the samples had been incubated with the cross-linkers (Fig. 3). When 0.1 mmBS3 or 0.1 mm DTSSP was added, two additional bands appeared at 100 and 200 kDa, representing dimeric APP-(18–350) and tetrameric APP-(18–350) (Fig. 3 A). The distribution and intensity of those bands only slightly varied with the effective concentrations of BS3 and DTSSP, implying that a stable monomer-dimer equilibrium was already reached at cross-linker concentrations of 0.1 mm (Fig. 3, A andB). Even in the presence of excess cross-linkers, the APP-(18–350) monomer concentration remained constant, and a change in the oligomeric state of APP-(18–350) due to a shift in the ratio of dimeric to oligomeric forms could not be noticed (Fig. 3, Aand B). This indicates that collisional cross-links can be ruled out and only cross-linking of stable dimers was observed. Thus, we conclude that at least two sites are involved in APP dimerization. The ectodomain of APP695 showed an intrinsic ability to homodimerize through the collagen binding site in our earlier study (8Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2047710949,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. After release from the presynaptic terminal, glutamate acts on specific receptors that are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane. The AMPA-type glutamate receptor, a ligand-gated cation channel that opens upon glutamate binding, mediates most of the excitatory (depolarizing) postsynaptic response in glutamatergic synapses. Thus, changing the activity of AMPA receptors is a powerful way to control the strength of synaptic transmission, which is important for information storage in the brain. AMPA receptors are formed from heteromeric (probably tetrameric) combinations of subunits GluR1-4. GluR subunits can be divided into two groups, GluR1 and GluR4, and GluR2 and GluR3, based on sequence similarity of their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. In the hippocampus, GluR2 and GluR3 have short cytoplasmic tails of around 50 amino acids with a conserved C-terminal sequence (-SVKI) that binds to cytoplasmic PDZ proteins GRIP/ABP and PICK-1 (Sheng and Pak 2000Sheng M. Pak D.T.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Scannevin and Huganir 2000Scannevin R.H. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The longer GluR1 cytoplasmic tail (terminating in -ATGL) binds to a distinct set of proteins (Figure 1). In the hippocampus (part of the brain important for learning and memory and where many experiments on synaptic transmission are conducted), endogenous AMPA receptors are composed mainly of GluR1/GluR2 and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold et al. 1996Wenthold R.J. Petralia R.S. Blahos J. Niedzielski A.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work from Roberto Malinow and colleagues, culminating in a paper in Cell (Shi et al. 2001Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), has defined an important set of subunit-specific rules governing the delivery of AMPA receptors to synapses. These rules provide new insights into the postsynaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors and open inroads into the molecular mechanisms that tune synaptic strength. A simple way to modify synaptic responses is to change the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors available for activation by released glutamate. Electrophysiological and morphological evidence for such a mechanism has accumulated over the past few years, driven by the discovery of “silent synapses.” A subset of glutamatergic synapses in many parts of the CNS lack AMPA receptor currents. These so-called “silent synapses” nevertheless contain functional NMDA receptors, another type of ionotropic glutamate receptor that is permeable to calcium and that controls synaptic plasticity. Activation of NMDA receptors leads to the appearance of functional AMPA receptors (“unsilencing”) in previously silent synapses, thereby potentiating synaptic transmission (Malenka and Nicoll 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, Malinow et al. 2000Malinow R. Mainen Z.F. Hayashi Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This postsynaptic potentiation could be due to the activation of nonfunctional AMPA receptors already existing in synapses (e.g., by phosphorylation), or by the delivery of new AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane. Supporting the latter idea, the level of AMPA receptors in synapses is influenced by synaptic activity and varies greatly between different synapses, with some synapses being devoid of AMPA receptors (Nusser 2000Nusser Z. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that AMPA receptors can translocate from nonsynaptic to synaptic sites, providing a cell biological basis for controlling the synaptic level of AMPA receptors and hence postsynaptic responsiveness (Lüscher et al. 2000Lüscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, Malinow et al. 2000Malinow R. Mainen Z.F. Hayashi Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The first direct evidence for movement of AMPA receptors came when Shi et al. 1999Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Petralia R. Zaman S. Wenthold R. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar showed that following strong synaptic stimulation and NMDA receptor activation, GFP-tagged GluR1 translocated from the main shaft of dendrites into spines, specialized dendritic protrusions on which excitatory synapses are formed. Upon overexpression, GluR1 subunits form homomeric receptors that have an electrophysiological property (inward rectification) which distinguishes them from endogenous heteromeric AMPA receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The appearance of inward rectification in excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) can be used to infer the delivery of functional GluR1 receptors to postsynaptic sites. Using this “electrophysiological tagging” approach, Malinow and colleagues showed that overexpression of GluR1 in neurons by Sindbis virus infection was insufficient for GluR1 incorporation into synapses. However, homomeric GluR1 receptors were “delivered” to synapses in response to NMDA receptor stimulation and activation of CaMKII (Hayashi et al. 2000Hayashi Y. Shi S.-H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.-C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). This recruitment required the C terminus of GluR1, which binds to the PDZ protein SAP97. GluR4 behaves similarly to GluR1 in terms of NMDA receptor-dependent delivery to synapses; however, unlike GluR1, homomeric GluR4 does not require CaMKII activity (Zhu et al. 2000Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). GluR4 is expressed earlier in development than GluR1, thus these long-tailed GluR subunits may be involved in regulated synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors at different stages of brain ontogeny: GluR4 during maturation of synapses, and GluR1 during plasticity of mature synapses. A major insight from Shi et al. 2001Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar was that unlike GluR1 and GluR4, the synaptic delivery of GluR2 is constitutive and independent of activity. For this experiment, the GluR2 ion channel had to be engineered such that it was inwardly rectifying and distinguishable electrophysiologically from endogenous AMPA receptors. Electrophysiologically-tagged GluR2 homomers accumulated in synapses, as judged by inward rectification. However, there was no change in the overall amplitude of EPSCs, implying that GluR2 receptors were being exchanged for existing endogenous synaptic AMPA receptors rather than being added to them. Consistent with this interpretation is that unlike GluR1 and GluR4, GluR2 homomeric receptors were not delivered to silent synapses (which lack AMPA receptors). The synaptic accumulation of GluR2 required its C-terminal PDZ binding sequence, suggesting that interaction with GRIP/ABP or PICK-1 is important. The cytoplasmic tail of GluR2 also binds to NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), a hexameric ATPase involved in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Figure 1). The NSF binding site of GluR2 is also critical for synaptic incorporation of GluR2 receptors, though exactly how NSF acts to facilitate synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors remains elusive. Experiments with chimeric receptors and dominant interfering constructs showed that the cytoplasmic tails of GluR1 and GluR2 direct the distinctive trafficking behavior of these subunits: the long tail of GluR1 restricts the receptor from synapses in the absence of activity and mediates inducible delivery, whereas the short tail of GluR2 mediates constitutive delivery of AMPA receptors to synapses. In terms of synaptic delivery, GluR1 appears to act “dominantly” over GluR2 in heteromeric receptors, since coexpression of GluR1 prevents the constitutive synaptic incorporation of GluR2 (Shi et al. 2001Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Importantly, the heteromeric GluR1/GluR2 receptor can be driven into synapses by CaMKII activation. GluR3, often considered interchangeable with GluR2 because of sequence similarity, shows a distinct trafficking behavior (Shi et al. 2001Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). GluR3 localizes in dendritic spines like GluR2, but by itself cannot incorporate into synapses based on electrophysiological tagging assays. However, GluR3 did not prevent the constitutive delivery of heteromeric GluR2/GluR3 receptors to synapses. The subunit-dependent trafficking behavior of AMPA receptors revealed in these studies has wider implications. The large families of subunits that encode most receptors and ion channels in neurons may have evolved to allow a more sophisticated control of the subcellular targeting of receptor/channels, rather than, or in addition to, an increased diversity of electrophysiological properties. The electrophysiological tagging approach in virus-transfected brain slices is elegant in that it provides a functional assay of synaptic AMPA receptor delivery and allows a genetic dissection of the sequence determinants involved. However, it lacks the spatiotemporal resolution to uncover the precise cell biological mechanisms that underlie AMPA receptor trafficking to synapses. For instance, it is not clear whether the regulated “synaptic delivery” of electrophysiologically tagged AMPA receptors is mediated by exocytosis from intracellular pools directly into the postsynaptic membrane, or by lateral translocation from extrasynaptic regions on the neuronal surface, or both. Clearly, exocytosis of AMPA receptors is required at some point for synaptic delivery, since interfering with postsynaptic membrane fusion prevents synaptic potentiation and causes run-down of basal transmission (Lledo et al. 1998Lledo P.-M. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1998; 279: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, Lüscher et al. 1999Lüscher C. Xia H. Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that AMPA receptors are first inserted into nonsynaptic regions of the neuronal surface before translocation into synapses is raised by studies of the Stargazer mouse mutant (Chen et al. 2001Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawaski Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2001; 408: 936-943Google Scholar). Stargazin-deficient cerebellar neurons lack surface AMPA receptors, and this phenotype is rescued by transfection of wild-type Stargazin. Importantly, however, a mutant Stargazin lacking its C terminus restores the surface but not the synaptic expression of AMPA receptors. This finding implies a two-step mechanism for AMPA receptor synaptic targeting, raising the possibility that surface translocation from nonsynaptic to synaptic sites may be a regulated step in synaptic delivery. Counterbalancing delivery is the removal of AMPA receptors from synapses. Internalization of AMPA receptors from the neuronal surface is emerging as a major means for removing synaptic AMPA receptors and depressing synaptic transmission (Carroll et al. 2001Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). AMPA receptor endocytosis is enhanced by factors that induce synaptic depression, including NMDA receptor stimulation and insulin (Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Ehlers 2000Ehlers M.

Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Preventing AMPA receptor endocytosis blocks long-term synaptic depression in hippocampus and cerebellum (reviewed in Carroll et al. 2001Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). There has been substantial progress in elucidating the cell biological pathways of AMPA receptor internalization, which occurs via a dynamin-dependent mechanism. Even in basal conditions in culture, ∼10%–20% of surface AMPA receptors are internalized from the surface in 10 min, this rate depending in part on endogenous synaptic activity in culture (Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Ehlers 2000Ehlers M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The rapid rate of basal and regulated internalization appears specific for AMPA receptors, since NMDA receptors and other postsynaptic membrane proteins are relatively stable on the cell surface (Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar; Ehlers, 2000). After endocytosis, most of the internalized AMPA receptors are recycled quickly to the neuronal surface and synaptic sites (Ehlers 2000Ehlers M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). NSF is likely involved in this continuous recycling process, since disruption of the interaction between NSF and GluR2 in neurons leads to rundown of EPSCs (Carroll et al. 2001Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and references therein). Why would synapses undergo constitutive (and energetically wasteful) AMPA receptor cycling? In many metabolic pathways, “futile cycling” of substrates provides increased sensitivity of regulation, since small changes in the rate of one or both arms of the cycle result in larger changes in net flux. The cycling of AMPA receptors could offer a similar benefit of increased responsiveness of EPSC amplitude to small changes in delivery or removal rates. Not all AMPA receptors need be recycled. A subset of AMPA receptors may be diverted after internalization to non-recycling endosomes or lysosomes under particular conditions (Ehlers 2000Ehlers M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PDZ-mediated interactions may specify the intracellular sorting of AMPA receptors, as they do for other membrane receptors. Degradation of AMPA receptors after endocytosis is a possible mechanism for controlling synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the longer term. Both GluR1- and GluR2-containing receptors are internalized in neurons, but the sequence determinants that control GluR endocytosis have not been examined in neurons. Studies in heterologous cells indicate that it is GluR2 rather than GluR1 that mediates insulin-stimulated endocytosis (Man et al. 2000Man H.-Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, Lin et al. 2000Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). If borne out for activity-dependent internalization in neurons, the subunit-specific rules governing AMPA receptor endocytosis would be the opposite of those governing synaptic delivery. The subunit-specific regulation of AMPA receptor delivery to synapses inspires the following model of AMPA receptor trafficking at a hippocampal synapse (Figure 2). In basal conditions, AMPA receptors (GluR1/GluR2 or GluR2/GluR3 heteromers) are concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane but also exist abundantly in endosomal compartments. Intracellular GluR2/GluR3 receptors undergo constant recycling with surface receptors in an activity-independent fashion. This exchange requires NSF and replaces existing synaptic AMPA receptors, thereby maintaining a constant level of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Meanwhile, intracellular GluR1/GluR2 heteromeric receptors lie dormant, held in check by the dominant subunit GluR1. Upon NMDA receptor stimulation and CaMKII activation, GluR1 exocytosis is triggered, leading to surface targeting and synaptic delivery of GluR1/GluR2 heteromers. The site of surface insertion of AMPA receptors is unknown, but we propose that it occurs at extrasynaptic sites and is followed by rapid translocation into synapses. Either or both these steps require molecular interactions of the GluR1 C terminus, presumably with PDZ proteins. GluR1/GluR2-containing receptors can be recruited into synapses that lack AMPA receptors or that already have AMPA receptors, leading to unsilencing of silent synapses and enhancement of EPSCs. An important point made by Shi et al. 2001Shi S.-H. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar is that the increased level of synaptic AMPA receptors can be maintained long-term by exchange with intracellular GluR2/GluR3 heteromers, thereby stabilizing synaptic “memory.” In synaptic depression, the prevailing evidence suggests that GluR2- or GluR3-mediated endocytotic mechanisms are activated, perhaps involving phosphorylation of the GluR2/3 C terminus and consequent release from GRIP/ABP anchors (Carroll et al. 2001Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Perhaps GluR2 and/or GluR3 act as dominant subunits to control regulated endocytosis, in the same way that GluR1 appears to govern regulated delivery to synapses. It is unknown if GluR1/GluR2 and GluR2/GluR3 receptors “drift” outside of the synapse before being captured by the endocytotic machinery; however, this would facilitate the endocytosis of AMPA receptors without cointernalization of NMDA receptors and other synaptic membrane proteins. Lynch and Baudry 1984Lynch G. Baudry M. Science. 1984; 224: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar first proposed that activity-dependent changes in number or insertion of glutamate receptor to synaptic sites might underlie synaptic plasticity. Recent discoveries lend strong support to this idea; however, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms and significance of AMPA receptor trafficking. For instance, what are the kinetics of GluR exocytosis and synaptic accumulation? Where on the neuronal surface are AMPA receptors first inserted and where are they internalized? What are the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate AMPA receptor exocytosis and endocytosis? What are the molecules (Malinow's “slots”) that determine the number of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane? Are there proteins that are cointernalized and coinserted with AMPA receptors? These are questions of general significance since regulated trafficking may be a universal mechanism for regulating the density of receptors in specific cell surface microdomains and for controlling cellular responsiveness to secreted factors."

After intravenous injection of ligand·poly-l-lysine·DNA complexes targeting the asialoglycoprotein receptor, the transgene was delivered specifically to the liver, in which it expressed transiently.

However, reconstitution (annealing) of the polycation and DNA using NaCl-gradient dialysis or direct mixing of both components at low salt concentrations produces condensed DNA particles with the features of Ψ-DNA (highly ordered toroid-shaped multimolecularly condensed DNA complexes that are mutimolecular with respect to DNA) (14Perales J.C.

Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ψ-DNA features a circular dichroism spectrum that indicates chiral packing of multiple DNA helices in solution (29Maniatis T. Venable Jr., J.H. Lerman L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which is thought to be caused by base stacking in the same optical plane. Using sedimentation and light-scattering techniques, Shapiro et al. (20Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) showed that Ψ-DNA·poly-l-lysine complexes exist as roughly toroidal and highly hydrated aggregates of ∼170 nm in diameter. Thus, the simple electrostatic mixing of DNA and poly-l-lysine produces DNA particles with various structures. The two modes of binding of poly-l-lysine to DNA have been described: (a) poly-l-lysine processively binds to specific DNA molecules in a selective manner (cooperative binding), or (b) poly-l-lysine binds to a population of DNA molecules randomly in a nonselective way (noncooperative binding) (18Olins D.E.

In this paper, we evaluated the effect of NaCl on the binding mode of poly-l-lysine to DNA and the resulting structural motifs of the condensed DNA particles using DNA precipitation, DNase I resistance assays, and electron microscopy (EM).1 The structural features of the condensed DNA are correlated with its ability to withstand digestion by DNase I and with its level of expression in HuH-7 cells in vitro via the asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated pathway. These results provide the basis for a better understanding, at the molecular level, of several crucial requirements for the formation of poly-l-lysine·DNA complexes of a minimum size and its importance to allow for a receptor-mediated gene transfer process. High performance liquid chromatography-grade water (W5SK-4) was used to prepare all solutions (Fisher). All chemicals, including poly-l-lysine, α-d-galactopyranosyl phenyl isothiocyanate, asialofetuin (ASF, A 1908), DNase I (D 4527), and trypsin type I (T 8003) were obtained from Sigma. The luciferase assay system E4530 was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The DC protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. DNA size markers (1-kilobase DNA ladder) and all media such as RPMI 1640, sera, and antibiotics were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. SigmaScan® and SigmaPlot® software were purchased from SPSS, Inc. (Chicago, IL). The expression plasmid pCMV-Luc is 6.9 kilobases in length and contains the human CMV viral promoter and enhancer elements ligated to the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene. The plasmid pPEPCK-hFIX has been described previously (10Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Beegen H. Ratnoff O.D. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4086-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Perales J.C. Grossmann G.A. Molas M. Liu G. Ferkol T. Harpst J. Oda H. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

The plasmid pPEPCK-hOTC (5.3 kilobases) is identical to the pPEPCK-hFIX except for the coding region that contains the cDNA for human mitochondrial ornithine transcarbamylase (hOTC) (31Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Williams K.R. Kalousek F. Kraus J.P. Doolittle R.F. Konigsberg W. Rosenberg L.E. Science. 1984; 224: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified by double equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after alkaline lysis. The DNA was precipitated twice using one-tenth (v/v) 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol and resuspended in water, and the concentration was determined using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The DNA preparation was treated twice with RNase A and RNase T1 and resuspended to a final concentration of 1.5–2 mg/ml. No substantial contamination with bacterial genomic DNA or RNA was present in the plasmid preparations. All plasmid preparations contained less than 30% open circular or linear DNA. Our condensation method refers to the procedure of preparing condensed DNA complexes at a fixed NaCl concentration by titrating poly-l-lysine into a solution of DNA. Galactosylated poly-l-lysine (GalPLL) was prepared by galactosylating poly-l-lysine as described previously (14Perales J.C. Grossmann G.A. Molas M. Liu G. Ferkol T. Harpst J. Oda H. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7398-7408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The input molar ratio of poly-l-lysine to DNA, r, was the ratio of moles of lysine to nucleotide (NH4+/PO3−). Sixty micrograms of DNA in 365 μl of solution, adjusted to specific NaCl concentrations using a 5 m NaCl stock solution, was vortexed at 300 rpm using a VIBRAX shaking apparatus (VIBRAX-VXR, IKA Works, Inc., Wilmington, NC). Twenty-four micrograms of poly-l-lysine or GalPLL (for r = 1) in 365 μl of solution containing the identical concentration of NaCl was added dropwise to the corresponding DNA solution at the same salt concentration over a period of 80 min in 5-μl small aliquots. During the processes of titration, samples of DNA complexes with rvalues of 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 were prepared by titrating DNA with a portion of poly-l-lysine or GalPLL solutions at the same final volumes as those of samples with r = 1; the final concentrations of the DNA for all of the samples were identical (82 μg/ml). DNA precipitation experiments were performed as described by Shapiro et al. (20Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of poly-l-lysine were slowly added dropwise to vortexing solutions of plasmid DNA. After the titration, all samples were left vortexing at room temperature (25 °C) for 30 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at top speed (12,000 × g) in a Sorvall MC12C (DuPont) microcentrifuge. The absorbance of the supernatant fraction at 260 nm was determined using a spectrophotometer. DNase I activity was measured by the rapid spectrophotometric method adapted from that originally described by Kunitz and Lindberg (33Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1949; 33: 349-362Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 34Lindberg U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 82: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Lindberg U. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The method is based on the increase in the absorbance at 260 nm (hyperchromicity) when DNA is degraded by enzymatic catalysis. The bacterial plasmid pPEPCK-hOTC was used as the substrate. A typical assay was performed as follows. Different amounts of enzyme were pipetted into the substrate solution at various concentrations of NaCl containing the DNase I working buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The total reaction volume was 600 μl. Rapid vortexing ensured the complete mixing of the components. The reaction mixture was then poured into a quartz cuvette and the increase in absorbance at 260 nm was determined at 20-s intervals for 3–5 min using a spectrophotometer. One unit of DNase I activity at a specific NaCl concentration is defined as the amount of enzyme that will produce a ΔA260 of 0.001/min at pH 7.6 at 25 °C using bacterial plasmid pPEPCK-hOTC as a substrate. To evaluate the amount of DNA bound and thus protected by poly-l-lysine during the titration process, samples of DNA complexes with r values of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were incubated with 800 units of DNase I. Typically, a DNA·poly-l-lysine complex containing 4.9 μg of plasmid DNA (pPEPCK-hOTC) in a 60-μl solution was mixed with 1 μl of DNase I (800 units) and 7 μl of 10× DNase I working buffer. The final volume was then adjusted to 70 μl with water. The duration of digestion was controlled strictly at 15 min at room temperature. The DNase I was inactivated by adding 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA to the reaction mixture. Under these conditions free DNA was completely degraded to very small fragments, whereas the poly-l-lysine-bound DNA was protected. The complexed DNA was released from poly-l-lysine·DNA complexes by the digestion of poly-l-lysine with 2.5% (w/v) trypsin solution. An equal volume of the trypsin solution was added to the DNA complex and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The mixture was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1) before gel electrophoretic analysis on a 0.8% agarose gel as described previously (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Uranyl acetate (0.04%) in methanol was used in these studies as a contrast stain. Samples, either in water or 1 m NaCl or diluted in 150 mm NaCl, were applied for 3 min to a copper electron microscope grid covered with a carbon film, blotted, and allowed to dry for 30 s. A drop of the staining solution was then applied for 1 min, blotted, washed for 1 s in high performance liquid chromatography-grade water, fixed using ethanol, and allowed to air dry. The grids were examined in a JEOL-100C transmission electron microscope, and plates were exposed to the image at a magnification of 20,000–50,000. The microscope was calibrated with the 87.5-Å spacing of catalase crystals (36Kupfer J.M. Ruan X.M. Liu G. Matloff J. Forrester J. Chaux A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The major diameter, minor diameter, area, and perimeter of each condensed DNA particle on the EM images were automatically collected using the software SigmaScan® from the scanned negatives. A human hepatoma cell line, HuH-7, was maintained as a monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection was performed when cells reached ∼30% confluence, i.e. 1 day after the seeding of 1.5 × 106 cells into 60-mm plastic dishes. One microliter of 2.5 m CaCl2 was added to each milliliter of culture medium before transfection (to a final Ca2+ concentration of 3 mm in the medium). Each plate was transfected by adding a solution containing 4 μg of DNA directly to 2 ml of culture medium. The cells were exposed to the DNA complexes for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml of ASF as competitor for binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The medium was then removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then placed in fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 2 days prior to the assay of luciferase activity. The luciferase activities of cell lysates were then analyzed as recommended by the manufacturer. The cell lysates were assayed for protein content using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit, and the light units over a 10-s interval were standardized for protein content. All measurements were performed at least three times and expressed as the mean ± S.E. The data in Figs. 7 and Table I were analyzed by one way analysis of variance or unpaired t test using SigmaPlot® software.Table ISummary of the structural and functional properties of condensed DNA complexes from nine independent experimentsExperiment no.Percentage <30 nm−ASF+ASFPercentage inhibition (+/−)Statistical significanceMean ± SEMMean ± SEMr = 0.5183153.47 ± 22.8719.97 ± 9.9787**25217.10 ± 15.5717.65 ± 16.45−3N3474.26 ± 4.030.63 ± 0.0685N4280.23 ± 0.120.16 ± 0.0330N5141.28 ± 0.716.09 ± 5.55−376N617154.53 ± 106.2042.34 ± 17.6773N77855.55 ± 5.413.09 ± 2.2094***8222.88 ± 0.405.01 ± 1.31−73N962226.12 ± 59.848.04 ± 5.8896*r = 0.75173568.22 ± 51.07237.93 ± 53.0158*235245.67 ± 223.544.08 ± 3.5598N35433.84 ± 0.270.67 ± 0.1898***4250.54 ± 0.200.22 ± 0.0259N5132.05 ± 0.403.49 ± 1.75−70N619322.26 ± 96.49412.55 ± 225.27−28N787107.98 ± 17.8352.78 ± 3.6951*8562.93 ± 14.3669.15 ± 60.25−10N980461.21 ± 121.1588.05 ± 13.5781*For each experiment, the percentage of condensed DNA having a major length less than 30 nm is listed.

We first assessed the amount of DNA precipitated by poly-l-lysine at various salt concentrations. For GalPLL (poly-l-lysine with 1% of the NH4+ groups galactosylated) of various lengths, a set of precipitation assays was carried out to evaluate the effect of salt concentration on the quantitative precipitation of DNA. Using GalPLL of an average length of 256, 92, 57, and 26 amino acids, we found that a 1:1 molar equivalent precipitation (one molar equivalent of positive charge from poly-l-lysine precipitates one molar equivalent of negative charge from DNA) occurred near 1.0, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.3 m NaCl, respectively (Fig.1). For GalPLL256 at 1.1 mNaCl (Fig. 1 A), more poly-l-lysine was required to drive the precipitation of DNA by poly-l-lysine to completion. As the salt concentration was reduced to 0.9 m(Fig. 1 A), a molar equivalent of lysine residues precipitated somewhat more than a molar equivalent of nucleotide (i.e. the amount of poly-l-lysine necessary to produce complete precipitation decreases below a 1:1 charge ratio). Similar results were observed when GalPLL of shorter lengths was mixed with DNA at a NaCl concentration that was below the NaCl concentration that gave 1:1 precipitation (Fig. 1, B–D). In the absence of NaCl (Fig. 1 A), there was no decrease of DNA in solution until a threshold concentration of GalPLL256 was reached near the end of the titration. At this point most of the DNA molecules were precipitated by GalPLL256 within a very narrow range of rvalues (0.75–1) (Fig. 1 A). These curves agree with the results of poly-l-lysine-induced DNA precipitation reported previously (28Weiskopf J. Li H.J. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 669-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Li H.J. Chang C. Weiskopf J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of NaCl at which selective binding occurred, i.e. when a 1 molar equivalent of lysine precipitates a 1 molar equivalent of nucleotides during the entire titration, varies according to the length of poly-l-lysine and corresponds to the ionic strength at which cooperative association of poly-l-lysine to DNA occurs as suggested by Shapiro et al. (20Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although the NaCl concentrations at which 1:1 precipitation occurs can be determined using the DNA precipitation assay, it does not provide direct information concerning the distribution of poly-l-lysine on the DNA. For this reason, we further evaluated the presence of bound versusfree DNA in DNA complexes using a DNase I digestion assay. We first determined the specific activity of DNase I (change of absorbance at 260 nm) under 0, 0.2, and 1 m NaCl to ensure that the same specific activity of the enzyme was used in all the experiments. Using an excess of pPEPCK-hOTC plasmid DNA, the digestion process, after an initial lag phase, closely approximates a first-order reaction. At concentrations of NaCl of 0, 0.2, and 1 m the specific activities of DNase I are 4.52 × 104, 2.17 × 103, and 52.9 units/mg of protein, respectively. Thus, the ratio of DNase I specific activities at NaCl concentrations of 0:0.2:1m is close to 800:40:1. The DNase I digestion assay was repeated at least three times, and representative results are shown in Fig.2. In these experiments, plasmid DNA and GalPLL256 were used to prepare DNA·poly-l-lysine complexes of different r values at 0, 0.2, and 1m NaCl (Fig. 2, A, B, andC, respectively). After the preparation, these complexes were digested with 800 units of DNase I. The time course of DNase I digestion was strictly controlled such that most of the free DNA was degraded. DNA samples were then incubated further with trypsin to degrade GalPLL256 to evaluate the amount and form of the protected DNA in the DNA complexes. DNA complexes were analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis either directly (Fig. 2, A1, B1, and C1) or after both DNase I and trypsin digestion (Fig. 2,A2, B2, and C2). Trypsin digestion alone showed that the same amount of DNA could be recovered from GalPLL256·DNA complexes for each experimental set and was used as a loading control (data not shown). Retardation of DNA by GalPLL256 was observed in all experimental samples (bands labeled with an asterisk in Fig. 2,A1, B1, and C1) and can be explained by the neutralization and/or increased size of the GalPLL256·DNA complexes formed. At 0 m NaCl, the DNA complexes were retarded in the electrophoretic field into slower mobility species with increasing r values (smeared DNA labeled with an open bar in Fig. 2 A1). DNA was also retarded completely in the well at higher ratios of lysine/nucleotide (bands labeled with anasterisk in Fig. 2 A1). At 0.2 m NaCl (Fig. 2 B1), free DNA was retarded completely (asterisk-labeled band) when the r value was 0.5. However, at 1 m NaCl (Fig. 2 C1), there was a linear correlation between the amount of GalPLL256 (r = 0 to r = 1) and the amount of DNA completely retarded in the well. Slower mobility species generated from the DNA complexes were barely observed in Fig. 2, B1 or C1. Removal of poly-l-lysine by trypsin allowed the protected DNA to enter the gel from the loading wells and migrate as free DNA bands (Fig. 2, A2, B2, and C2). The patterns of DNase I digestion indicated that the DNA that was bound to GalPLL and thus protected from degradation by DNase I existed as either nicked (open circles), linear, or fragmented DNA. The degradation patterns shown in Fig. 2, A2, B2, andC2, were significantly different. At 0 and 0.2 mNaCl, the degraded DNA (lanes with r = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) existed as a population of fragmented DNA species (smeared, labeled with dotted lines in Fig. 2, A2 andB2) with a larger molecular weight than noted with completely degraded products (smeared, labeled with abracket in Fig. 2). In contrast, the degradation pattern of DNA complexes prepared in 1 m NaCl had the mobility of completely degraded DNA (see left bracket in Fig. 2 C2). Total protection from DNase I degradation (bands labeled with a closed circle in Fig. 2) was only observed at higher ratios of lysine/nucleotide (r = 1). Three molecular species can be inferred from our DNase I experiments: free DNA, partially bound DNA (slower mobility), and completely bound DNA (completely retarded). However, the DNase I digestion assay does not provide direct information concerning the possible structural differences among these bound DNA complexes. We therefore carried out nine separate experiments to analyze the structural and functional properties of DNA condensed with poly-l-lysine at r values of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. The DNA complexes were formed by binding GalPLL256 at 0 and 1m NaCl and were analyzed using transmission EM. DNA complexes at r = 1 routinely aggregated and precipitated; the precipitated DNA broke the supporting carbon film on the EM grids, did not produce consistent results, and were not analyzed further. Fig.3 (A–C) presents the results of Experiment 1, a DNA condensation experiment that generated small functional particles as an example of the effect of NaCl concentration on the condensation process. All nine experiments will be presented subsequently. DNA condensed by GalPLL256 at 1 m NaCl typically generated two DNA structures: free DNA and condensed DNA complexes. The free DNA appeared as thin fibers, whereas most of condensed DNA complexes were present as small spherical particles (15–30 nm). No free DNA fibers were observed to extend outside the condensed region. The binding of GalPLL256 to DNA occurred in a cooperative fashion, because there were two populations of DNA: either in a free or condensed form. Increasing the concentration of GalP"

Although some candidate Akt targets have been described, the function of Akt is not fully understood, particularly because of the cell type- and context-dependent apoptosis regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the mechanisms by which Akt antagonizes apoptosis involves the inhibition of Nur77, a transcription factor implicated in T-cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. It has been suggested that Akt phosphorylates Nur77 directly, but whether Akt suppresses biological functions of Nur77 remains unknown. We found that Akt inhibited the DNA binding activity of Nur77 and stimulated its association with 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation site-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that expression of Akt suppressed Nur77-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts and activation-induced cell death of T-cell hybridomas. The inhibition of Nur77 by Akt suggests a mechanism that explains how T-cell receptor activation can promote survival in some instances even when Nur77 is induced. Collectively, these results may suggest that Akt is a negative regulator of Nur77 in T-cell apoptosis. Akt is a common mediator of cell survival in a variety of circumstances.

The survival/death regulation of thymocytes through T-cell receptor (TCR)1 activation plays a key role in establishing a functional T-cell repertoire. In the thymus, immature T cells that moderately recognize self-peptide-MHC complexes survive and are induced to differentiate (positive selection), whereas self-reactive T cells that recognize self-peptide-MHC complexes with high affinity/avidity are induced toward cell death (negative selection), thus eliminating potentially toxic T cells (1Jameson S.C.

Immunol. 1999; 17: 829-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although both forms of thymic selection, as well as activation-induced cell death (AICD) of mature T cells, are mediated by TCR, the intracellular signaling mechanisms by which TCR regulates T-cell survival and apoptosis are not fully understood and have been subject to intense investigation. Among the molecules implicated in T-cell apoptosis is Nur77 (also known as NGFI-B or TR3), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily. Nur77 was originally identified as an immediate early gene transiently induced by serum, growth factors and nerve growth factor (3, 4). It has also been shown that Nur77 and Nor-1, a related member of the Nur77 family, are induced during TCR-mediated apoptosis (5Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M.

A. 1996; 93: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that Nur77 plays an important role in T-cell apoptosis. Nur77 transcription activity correlates well with its apoptotic function in T cells (10Kuang A.A. Cado D. Winoto A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3722-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although this might not be the case in other cell types (11Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). When Nur77 is induced by growth factors or TCR stimulation, it often becomes transcriptionally inactive due to posttranslational modification (12Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that expression of Nur77 does not necessarily correlate with induction of apoptosis. In particular, we found that TCR activation resulted in Nur77 expression even under a condition mimicking positive selection, in which TCR promotes survival (this study). This and other studies suggest the existence of a mechanism to inhibit the proapoptotic function of Nur77 (13Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that phosphorylation of Nur77 on Ser-350 negatively regulates its function. Ser-350 resides within the domain required for specific binding of Nur77 to DNA, and its phosphorylation results in reduction of both the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Nur77 in PC12 cells (12Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vivo phosphorylation of Ser-350 takes place in T cells as well as in other cells (15Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared likely that a kinase involved in survival signaling would phosphorylate Nur77 and thus antagonize the proapoptotic function of Nur77. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-Akt pathway is activated in response to TCR activation and is implicated in mediating survival signals in T cells. For instance, thymocytes derived from mice deficient in p110γ, a catalytic subunit of PI3-K, exhibited enhanced apoptosis (18Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), whereas those derived frompten −/− mice, in which the PI3-K-Akt pathway is constitutively active, were more resistant to TCR-mediated cell death and resulted in a defect in thymic negative selection (19Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W.

Moreover, both DP thymocytes and mature T cells derived from transgenic mice expressing gag-akt, a constitutively active Akt, showed enhanced viability in culture and resistance to various apoptosis-inducing stimuli such as γ-irradiation, dexamethasone, and Fas ligand, further supporting the survival-promoting function of the PI3-K-Akt pathway in T cells (21Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Akt phosphorylates Nur77 directly in vitro and in vivo (22Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, whether Akt inhibits the proapoptotic functions of Nur77 and how Akt-mediated phosphorylation inhibits Nur77 remain to be determined. In this study, we show that phosphorylation of Nur77 by Akt results in reduction of its DNA binding activity and stimulation of its association with 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation site-dependent manner. We also show that Akt suppresses Nur77-mediated cell death and thus propose an antagonistic interaction between apoptosis and survival signaling downstream of TCR. DO11.10 mouse T-cell hybridomas were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin supplemented with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes buffer, and β-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293T, Rat1a, and PLAT-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. For electroporation, 1 × 106 cells were mixed with 15 µg of plasmid DNA and electroporated with a 240-V pulse at 960 microfarads. Cell transfection was performed using FuGENE reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-TCR-β monoclonal antibody (H57-597; PharMingen) or 10 µg/ml anti-CD3ε monoclonal antibody (145-2C11; PharMingen) and 1 µg/ml anti-CD28 antibody. Cells were also treated with 10 nm PMA and 1 µm calcium ionophore (CaI) A23187 for 7 h to induce activation-induced cell death. MHC-deficient mice had been generated by crossing the I-Aβ−/− line of MHC class II-deficient mice with β2-microglobulin-deficient mice (23Grusby M.J. Auchincloss Jr., H. Lee R. Johnson R.S. Spencer J.P. Zijlstra M. Jaenisch R. Papaioannou V.E. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3913-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These mice fail to develop mature T cells, and most of the thymocytes derived from MHC knockout mice are immature, CD8+/CD4+ double-positive cells. A previous report (24Kearse K.P. Takahama Y. Punt J.A. Sharrow S.O. Singer A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggested that engagement of T cells with anti-TCR-β monoclonal antibody mimicked positive selection and differentiation, as indicated by an increase in cell surface expression of TCR-α chain and CD5 and a decrease in RAG-1 and CD4/CD8 expression. On the other hand, stimulation with anti-CD3ε antibody resulted in induction of apoptosis, mimicking negative selection (25Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Nur77 plasmid and Nur77-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (NBRE-luc) were kind gifts of Drs. Y. Katagiri, G. Guroff, and J. Milbrandt. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate a Ser-350 to Ala mutant of Nur77 using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Wild type, constitutively active, or dominant-negative Akt constructs were generously provided by Dr. D. Alessi. Each Akt mutant was inserted into expression vector pCS2+ (26Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were produced and purified using a standard GST fusion protein protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We purchased anti-Nur77, anti-TCR-β (H57-597), anti-CD3ε (145-2C11), and anti-CD28 (37.51; all from PharMingen) and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-His-tag (Novagen), and anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt (Cell Signaling) from the indicated manufacturers. Anti-phospho-Ser-350 Nur77 antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide corresponding to rat Nur77 amino acid sequence 343–353 (GRRGRLPpSKPK). Antiserum was purified as a bound fraction of the phosphopeptide-conjugated column. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates after incubation with 2 µg of appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Immunoreactive bands were detected by an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cell lysates and labeled probes were incubated for 1 h in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretically shifted bands including the complex of Nur77 and DNA were detected after autoradiography. Human CD8 sequence lacking cytoplasmic domain was subcloned into pMX-IRES retroviral vector to generate pMX-IRES-CD8. Akt mutants were inserted into this vector to generate pMX-Akt-IRES-CD8. Recombinant retroviruses were obtained by transfection of retroviral vector plasmids into ecotropic virus packaging cells (PLAT-E cells) as described elsewhere (27Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Conditioned media from these cells were collected and added to T-cell cultures and incubated for 16 h in the presence of 5 µg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Infected (CD8-positive) cells or noninfected (CD8-negative) cells were separated by the use of microbead-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody and automagnetic-activated cell sorting separation units (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody (PharMingen) or 1 ng/ml 7-amino-actinomycin D (Molecular Probes) in a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3). Labeled cells were analyzed on FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). After stimulation, the luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was normalized with co-expressed β-galactosidase activity. FTOCs were prepared essentially as described previously (28Sugawara T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Takahama Y. Immunity. 1998; 9: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal thymi were dissected from C57BL/6 mouse embryos (embryonic day 15) and incubated for 8 days at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then harvested and dissociated to analyze cell surface expression of CD8 and CD4 using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A major question in T-cell development is how TCR activation in immature CD4+/CD8+ DP thymocytes is translated into either survival (positive selection) or apoptotic (negative selection) signals (1Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Bevan M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 2Sebzda E. Mariathasan S. Ohteki T. Jones R. Bachmann M.F. Ohashi P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 829-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism to discriminate between these outcomes might be that TCR activation in negative selection, but not in positive selection, induces expression of proapoptotic proteins such as Nur77. Therefore we compared expression levels of Nur77 under conditions mimicking either positive or negative selection. Immature DP thymocytes isolated from the MHC knockout mice were treated with anti-TCR-β antibody or with anti-CD3ε/CD28 antibodies to mimic positive or negative selection, respectively (Ref. 24Kearse K.P. Takahama Y. Punt J.A. Sharrow S.O. Singer A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; see details under “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with previous reports, CD3ε/CD28 engagement in thymocytes derived from MHC knockout mice resulted in sustained expression of Nur77 protein (Fig.1). Importantly, the stimulation of thymocytes with anti-TCR-β antibody also induced expression of Nur77 protein, although the induction was transient and not robust (Fig. 1). This result suggests that Nur77 is induced to a higher level in the context of negative selection (apoptosis) compared with positive selection (survival) and also suggests that a threshold level should exist for the apoptosis-inducing function of Nur77. One mechanism for determination of such a threshold might be a survival signal that would counteract this proapoptotic function of Nur77. Although it has been shown that Akt is activated in response to TCR activation in mature T cells and contributes to their survival, it was not known whether this is also the case in immature DP thymocytes. We found that Akt became phosphorylated in response to the cross-linking of both anti-TCR-β and anti-CD3ε/CD28 to a similar extent (Fig. 1). We then asked whether the PI3-K-Akt pathway might serve as a survival promoter to counteract the proapoptotic function of Nur77 in thymocytes. To determine whether the PI3-K-Akt pathway is indeed essential for survival of immature thymocytes, we examined the effect of LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, on FTOCs. FTOCs taken from embryonic day 15 mouse embryos were incubated for 2 days in the presence or absence of LY294002, and then the numbers of double-negative (CD4−/CD8−), single-positive (CD4+/CD8− or CD4−/CD8+), and DP cells were determined by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. Treatment of FTOCs with LY294002 markedly reduced all types of immature thymocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). A low dose (5 µm) of LY294002 resulted in reduction of primarily DP cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that DP cells are most sensitive to PI3-K inhibition. This result is consistent with the recent finding that PI3-Kγ knockout mice shows moderate reduction of immature thymocytes (18Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Because the PI3-K-Akt pathway and Nur77 appear to have opposite effects on death/survival regulation of T cells, and because it has recently been reported that Akt is capable of phosphorylating Nur77 directly (22Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we asked whether Akt has an inhibitory effect on the functions of Nur77 in T lymphocytes. We first examined the transcriptional activity of endogenous Nur77 in T lymphocytes, as monitored by a luciferase gene reporter construct under the control of Nur77 binding elements. We obtained DO11.10 T-cell hybridomas stably expressing either a wild type, constitutively active, or kinase-negative form of Akt by infecting cells with a retrovirus encoding both Akt and human CD8, an expression marker, linked with a bicistronic IRES sequence (see Fig.3A). After infection, Akt-expressing cells were separated by cell surface expression of human CD8. The profile of human CD8 expression levels was not affected by the types of Akt (Fig. 3 B). In noninfected cells or in cells expressing only human CD8, the transcriptional activity of Nur77 increased 12–14-fold after TCR stimulation for 4 h and was accompanied by an increase in the level of endogenous Nur77 protein (Fig. 3 C). This increase in transcriptional activity was blocked by expression of N-terminal-truncated dominant-negative Nur77 (Fig. 3 C), confirming that this reporter assay indeed reflects the transcriptional activity of Nur77. Expression of either a wild type or constitutively active Akt, but not of a kinase-negative Akt, inhibited activation of Nur77 transcriptional activity in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. 3 C). Importantly, the level of Nur77 protein induced by TCR stimulation was not altered by expression of any of the Akt constructs (Fig. 3 C). Induction of Nur77 binding element-driven luciferase by ectopic expression of Nur77 was also suppressed when active Akt was co-expressed, whereas the level of Nur77 protein was not suppressed (Fig. 3 D). Therefore, it is likely that Akt suppresses the transcriptional activity of Nur77 in T lymphocytes through posttranslational modification, presumably through phosphorylation. How does Akt-mediated phosphorylation inhibit the transcriptional activity of Nur77? The most likely possibility may be that phosphorylation on Ser-350 reduces DNA binding activity as reported previously using recombinant Nur77 protein (29Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the DNA binding activity of endogenous Nur77 induced by T-cell activation could indeed be inhibited by expression of an active Akt. A shifted band (Nur77-DNA complex) was detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assay when control cells or cells expressing a kinase-negative Akt were stimulated with a phorbol ester (PMA) plus CaI (Fig.4). The identity of the shifted band (Nur77-DNA complex) was confirmed by supershift analysis with anti-Nur77 antibody (data not shown) and a chase experiment with cold probes (Fig. 4). Expression of an active Akt resulted in reduction of the Nur77-DNA complex (Fig. 4), although the protein levels of Nur77 were essentially unchanged between the control cell extract and the Akt-expressing cell extract used in these experiments (Fig.3 C), suggesting that Akt inhibits the DNA binding activity of Nur77. Another mechanism by which Akt-mediated phosphorylation inhibits the function of Nur77 might be phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 to Nur77. There are a large number of proteins whose functions are regulated by phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3. For example, some of the targets of Akt, such as Bad and the Forkhead family of transcription factors, bind to 14-3-3 and are functionally modulated (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar, 31Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence around Ser-350 of Nur77 corresponds to the consensus sequence for 14-3-3 binding, R-X-X-phospho-S/T-X-P when it is phosphorylated and is highly conserved among the Nur77 family (Nor-1 and Nurr1) and between species (Fig.5A). Therefore, the possibility that Nur77 forms a complex with 14-3-3 upon phosphorylation of this site is intriguing. We observed Akt phosphorylation of Nur77 on Ser-350 in vitro (Fig. 5 B) and in vivo(Fig. 5 C) by use of a phosphorylation site mutant (S350A) and phospho-Ser-350-specific antibody, which confirmed the recent finding of Pekarsky et al. (22Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We then tested whether recombinant (His-tagged) Nur77 binds to recombinant (GST-tagged) 14-3-3in vitro when it is phosphorylated by Akt using a GST pull-down assay. We found that the wild type phosphorylated His-Nur77 could be bound to GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 5 D). Neither the S350A mutant nor nonphosphorylated Nur77 was able to bind to GST-14-3-3 (Fig.5 D). We also tested their in vivo association. Myc-tagged Nur77 and FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 were co-transfected into 293T cells with or without various Akts, and co-precipitation of FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 with Myc-tagged Nur77 was observed. 14-3-3 was found to associate with wild type Nur77, but not with S350A Nur77, and did so only when active Akt was co-expressed (Fig. 5 E). These data strongly suggest that 14-3-3 binds to Nur77 phosphorylated on Ser-350 both in vitro and in vivo. Because it has been shown that some of the 14-3-3-binding proteins were excluded from the nucleus after complex formation via a mechanism utlizing a nuclear export signal of 14-3-3 protein, we examined the subcellular localization of green fluorescent protein-fused Nur77 in DO11.10 cells. However, Nur77 protein remained in the nucleus even after cells were stimulated with PMA/CaI or when active Akt was co-expressed (data not shown). Nur77 is thought to play a key role in AICD of mature T cells as well as in negative selection of immature DP thymocytes. We examined whether the activation of Akt is capable of suppressing AICD in the T-cell hybridoma DO11.10. AICD was induced by treating cells with PMA/CaI for 7 h, and dead cells were detected by use of a membrane-impermeable dye, 7-amino-actinomycin D. Cells expressing only human CD8 or a kinase-negative Akt underwent AICD to a similar extent as the control (noninfected) cells (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, expression of a wild type or constitutively active Akt markedly inhibited the cell death induced by PMA/CaI treatment (Fig.6 B), suggesting that Akt mediates survival signals to prevent AICD. This result further supports the idea that Akt might counteract the effect of Nur77 in death/survival regulation of T cells. Finally, we asked whether Akt directly inhibits the proapoptotic function of Nur77. To address this, we attempted to examine the proapoptotic function of Nur77 in T-cell hybridomas, but expression of Nur77 per se appeared insufficient for inducing apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). Therefore, we utilized Rat1a fibroblasts, in which expression of Nur77 was sufficient to induce apoptosis. Expression of active Akt suppressed apoptosis induced by Nur77 almost to the levels seen in the absence of Nur77 (Fig. 7). In contrast, active Akt was unable to inhibit apoptosis induced by the mutant Nur77 containing the Ser-350 to Ala substitution (Fig. 7). These results suggest that Akt inhibits Nur77-induced apoptosis directly through phosphorylation of Ser-350. Akt, a downstream target of PI3-K, is emerging as a common mediator of cell survival in a variety of models. Recent data suggest that Akt antagonizes the proapoptotic functions of Bad, caspase-9, the Forkhead family members, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 or activates the nuclear factor κB pathway, which may participate in the survival-promoting effects of Akt (32Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar, 33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). However, the function of Akt in T cells was still largely unknown. Our studies demonstrate that one of the mechanisms by which Akt antagonizes apoptosis involves the inhibition of Nur77. We show here that expression of an active Akt suppresses activation-induced cell death of T-cell hybridoma DO11.10, in which Nur77 plays a pivotal role. Moreover, Akt also suppresses apoptosis induced by expression of Nur77 in a phosphorylation site-dependent manner, suggesting that Akt directly inhibits the proapoptotic function of Nur77. This role in inhibition may account for the observation that Nur77 is expressed in the absence of induction of apoptosis under conditions in which TCR activation promotes survival in thymocytes, as well as in other cells. The fate of a developing thymocyte is determined by the interaction between TCR and its ligands (MHC-peptide complexes). Studies suggest that both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of TCR activation guide a T cell to either survive and mature or undergo apoptosis. In the quantitative model, strong activation signals result in cell death (negative selection), whereas moderate signals result in survival (positive selection) (34Gong Q. Cheng A.M. Akk A.M. Alberola-Ila J. Gong G. Pawson T. Chan A.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the signaling requirement for regulating strong versus weak signals from the TCR remains largely unknown, the Nur77 family proteins appear to play a qualitatively distinct role, that is, an important role only in apoptosis (negative selection), and not in survival (positive selection). In our study, the levels of Nur77 expressed in response to TCR activation under conditions mimicking either positive or negative selection were low and high, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, we would predict the existence of a threshold that determines whether Nur77 induces apoptosis or not. We propose that a survival signal via the PI3-K-Akt pathway might play a part in this threshold based on several reasons: first, the proapoptotic function of Nur77 can be antagonized by Akt-mediated phosphorylation (this study). Second, the inhibition of PI3-K induces robust apoptosis of DP thymocytes (this study and Ref.18Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A.

Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), and third, the activation of the PI3-K-Akt pathway inhibits negative selection (20Suzuki A. Yamaguchi M.T. Ohteki T. Sasaki T. Kaisho T. Kimura Y. Yoshida R. Wakeham A. Higuchi T. Fukumoto M. Tsubata T. Ohashi P.S. Koyasu S. Penninger J.M. Nakano T. Mak T.W.

The phosphorylation of Ser-350 has been shown to inhibit the transcriptional activity of Nur77 (12Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression of an active Akt consistently suppressed the transcriptional activity of both exogenous and endogenous Nur77 induced by TCR activation (this study). In this study, we have suggested possible mechanisms by which Akt inhibits the transcriptional activity of Nur77. One mechanism would be Akt inhibition of the DNA binding activity of Nur77 because we observed reduced DNA binding activity of Nur77 upon expression of Akt in T-cell hybridomas (this study) and because a previous study has shown that the phosphorylation of the recombinant DNA-binding domain of Nur77 results in reduction of the DNA binding activity in vitro (29Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism (although these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive) might be the 14-3-3 binding of Nur77 induced by the phosphorylation of Ser-350. The binding of 14-3-3 often leads to inactivation of the protein or sequestration of the protein from its functional targets (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of Nur77 with 14-3-3 might result in inactivation of its transcriptional activity or sequestration from its targets or functional compartments such as the nucleus (or the mitochondria; see below). This sequestration model is supported by the previous observations that the phosphorylated form of Nur77 is predominantly cytoplasmic (22Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F.

Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is not clear how Akt suppresses the proapoptotic function of Nur77 in T cells and fibroblasts. We show that expression of Akt suppresses both the transcriptional and proapoptotic activities of Nur77, but this does not necessarily mean that Akt inhibits Nur77-induced apoptosis through inhibition of its transcriptional activity. A recent study has shown that expression of Nur77 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCaP cells through targeting to the mitochondria even in the absence of the DNA-binding domain (11Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), which apparently contradicts the findings of other reports in which the transcriptional activity correlates well with the apoptosis-inducing activity of Nur77 (7Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Zhou T. Cheng J. Yang P. Wang Z. Liu C. Su X. Bluethmann H. Mountz J.D.

In our hands, Nur77 was localized diffusely in the nucleus and not in the mitochondria when Nur77 was ectopically expressed with either a Myc tag or a green fluorescent protein tag in T-cell hybridomas and Rat-1 fibroblasts (data not shown), although this does not exclude the possibility that a trace amount of mitochondrially targeted Nur77 is responsible for the induction of apoptosis. In that case, the 14-3-3 binding of Nur77 induced by Akt-mediated phosphorylation might play an essential role in inactivation of the proapoptotic function of Nur77. In summary, we have shown that Akt antagonizes the proapoptotic function of Nur77 through its direct phosphorylation. This finding reveals a novel nexus between apoptosis and survival signaling, which might play a critical role in determination of cell death/survival decision of T cells and other cells.

https://openalex.org/W1987926842,"The adrenal gland requires stimuli from peptides derived from the ACTH precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), to maintain its tonic state. Studies have proposed that a specific postsecretional cleavage of the nonmitogenic N-terminal 16 kDa fragment, also known as pro-gamma-melanotropin (pro-gamma-MSH), is required, releasing shorter fragments that promote adrenal growth. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by the cloning and characterization of a serine protease that is upregulated during growth of the adrenal cortex. It is expressed exclusively in the outer adrenal cortex, the site of cell proliferation, and in the Y1 adrenal cell line. We also show that it is required for growth of Y1 cells, remains bound to the cell surface, and cleaves its substrate, pro-gamma-MSH, at a specific bond."
https://openalex.org/W1972040796,"We report here the isolation and characterization of two proteins, NFAR-1 and -2, which were isolated through their ability to interact with the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR. The NFAR proteins, of 90 and 110 kDa, are derived from a single gene through alternative splicing and are evolutionarily conserved nuclear phosphoproteins that interact with double-stranded RNA. Both NFAR-1 and -2 are phosphorylated by PKR, reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate with PKR, and colocalize with the kinase in a diffuse nuclear pattern within the cell. Transfection studies indicate that the NFARs regulate gene expression at the level of transcription, probably during the processing of pre-mRNAs, an activity that was increased in fibroblasts lacking PKR. Subsequent functional analyses indicated that amino acids important for NFAR's activity were localized to the C terminus of the protein, a region that was found to specifically interact with FUS and SMN, proteins also known as regulators of RNA processing. Accordingly, both NFARs were found to associate with both pre-mRNAs and spliced mRNAs in post-transcriptional studies, similar to the known splicing factor ASF/SF-2.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). One key IFN-inducible gene is the serine/threonine, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, with a molecular mass of 68 kDa in human cells (2Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). PKR is a member of a previously described family of evolutionary conserved dsRNA binding molecules that includesEscherichia coli RNase III, Drosophila staufen, and Xenopus 4F.1 (3Bass B.L. Hurst S.R.

Interaction with dsRNA structures of greater than 35 bp causes PKR to autophosphorylate and subsequently to catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate targets, the most well characterized being the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2α (5Levin D.

Phosphorylated eIF2α effectively sequesters eIF2B, a rate-limiting component of translation, and causes a dramatic inhibition of protein synthesis in the cell (8Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 286-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of studies relating to PKR's function have focused on the kinase's participation in IFN′s retaliatory response to virus infection. For example, PKR can be activated by a number of virus specific RNAs (10Rice A.P. Kerr I.M. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 229-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Samuel C.E. Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994; 69: 1339-1347PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jimenez-Garcia L.F. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Spector D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 11-22PubMed Google Scholar). PKR-deficient mice are extremely sensitive to lethal pulmonary disease following infection with vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus, further emphasizing the importance of PKR in host defense (13Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Kipperman T. Bhalla K.N. Compans R.W. Archer D.R. Barber G.N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Since activation of PKR is highly detrimental to the virus life cycle, numerous viruses have evolved mechanisms to neutralize the function of this kinase. For example, vaccinia virus encodes two proteins capable of inhibiting PKR. The first of these products, referred to as E3L, contains a dsRNA binding domain similar to those found in PKR (14Chang H.W. Watson J.C. Jacobs B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4825-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 15Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kibler K.V.

E3L, which is primarily detected in the nucleus, competes for dsRNA activators and may even bind to and inhibit the kinase through dsRNA bridging (17Sharp T.V. Moonan F. Romashko A. Joshi B. Barber G.N. Jagus R. Virology. 1998; 250: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A second vaccinia protein, K3L, shares homology to the known PKR substrate eIF2α and is thought to function by competitively sequestering the kinase (15Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Beattie E. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Virology. 1991; 183: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O.

In addition, adenovirus may utilize VAI RNA to suppress PKR, while hepatitis C has been reported to encode PKR-interacting proteins referred to as NS5a and E2 (20Mathews M.B. Shenk T. J.

Recent data have also revealed that PKR almost certainly plays a role in signaling events in the cell, including dsRNA-induced apoptosis. For example, recombinant vaccinia viruses overexpressing wild-type PKR have been shown to induce the rapid apoptosis of HeLa cells (16Kibler K.V. Shors T. Perkins K.B. Zeman C.C. Banaszak M.P.

Murine fibroblasts deficient for PKR activity have also been reported to be more resistant to dsRNA and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (26Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that cells inducibly overexpressing functional PKR, but not a dominant-negative PKR variant, are sensitive to dsRNA-mediated and virus-induced cell death (28Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PKR-dependent apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, and was mediated through the FADD death-signaling pathway (28Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of PKR-induced apoptosis remain to be fully clarified, it has been reported that PKR may play a role in the induction of NF-κB, a key regulator of cell survival, in response to viral infection and dsRNA. For example, murine fibroblasts lacking PKR exhibit diminished responses to dsRNA signaling as indicated by reduced activity of NF-κB and IRF-1 (29Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although presently controversial, this regulation may involve PKR influencing the activity of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex leading to the autophosphorylation of IKKβ and degradation of IκB (30Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 31Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In addition to these roles, PKR may also be involved in signaling pathways involving Ras, interleukin-3, and growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (32Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that substrates of PKR other than eIF2α probably exist in the cell, although their identification and characterization have thus far remained elusive. Accordingly, to identify possible regulators and/or substrates of PKR, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate proteins that associate with this kinase. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two evolutionarily conserved, dsRNA-binding nuclear proteins, NFAR-1 and -2 (for nuclear factorsassociated with dsRNA). This work confirms that the NFAR gene on chromosome 19 gives rise to two alternatively spliced variants and correctly identifies the two NFAR proteins. Aside from demonstrating that the NFARs associate with PKR in yeast, we show that both NFAR-1 and -2 share homology with eIF2α, the known PKR cytoplasmic substrate, and are themselves substrates for PKR. In transfected cells, both NFARs were found to regulate the transcription of co-transfected reporter genes, probably at the level of mRNA elongation, an effect that was increased in PKR null fibroblasts. Transfection studies further indicated that NFAR-2 rather than NFAR-1 appeared to have more potent regulatory activity and that the C-terminal region unique to NFAR-2 exhibited constitutive activity and interacted with SMN and FUS, two proteins know to play a role in mRNA processing. Finally, we report that NFAR can associate with active splicesomes. Our data indicate that the NFARs are evolutionary conserved mediators of gene expression that may function as proximal targets for PKR and may play a role in regulating gene expression in response to dsRNA-regulated signaling events in the cell. Construction of PKR K296R in pET11a (Novagen, CA) has been previously described (33Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To fuse the GAL4 DNA binding domain in frame with PKR, the EcoRI site in pGBT9 (CLONTECH) was mutagenized to an NdeI site to create pGBT10. Full-length PKR K296R was digested withNdeI and BamHI and then inserted into similarly treated pGBT10, generating pGBT DII. The full-length cDNAs of NFAR-1 and NFAR-2 were generated by subcloning C terminus PstI-BglII NFAR fragments from yeast two-hybrid pGAD10 vectors into pGAD424 (CLONTECH). The N terminus of NFAR was amplified by PCR from cDNAs isolated by screening a Jurkat T-cell library and was joined to the C terminus of NFAR at an endogenous PstI site. An NdeI site was engineered into the N terminus of NFAR during PCR. For bacterial expression,NdeI-BglII-digested NFAR-1 and -2 from pGAD424 were subcloned into pET14b digested with NdeI andBamHI (Novagen). For mammalian cell expression, NFAR cDNAs from pGAD were digested with EcoRV, followed by treatment with Klenow fragment and dNTPs to blunt the N terminus. NFAR was then subsequently digested with BglII and subcloned intoEcoRV-BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, CA). To fuse the C terminus of NFAR-2 to the Gal4 binding domain, amino acids 666–894 of NFAR-2 were amplified by PCR using NFAR-2 as a template and subcloned into the EcoRI andPstI sites of pGBT9. NFAR-2 deletion mutations M5 (Δ7–173), M7 (Δ174–232), M8 (Δ238–384), M10 (Δ1–369), M11 (Δ1–588), and NFAR-1 M10 (Δ1–369) were created in pET14b and pcDNA3.1 vectors using the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. NFAR-2 M12 (Δ586–894) and NFAR M13 (Δ1–369, 586–894) were created by digesting the constructs with HindIII, which cuts at an endogenous site in NFAR after the dsRNA binding domains, and in the MCS of pcDNA3.1 and then religating the vector to remove the C terminus of NFAR-2. The NFAR M9 variant (amino acids 1–417) was created by cloning the NFAR NdeI-PstI fragment into pGAD424 and subsequently into pET11 and pcDNA3.1. All NFAR mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PKR DII and NFAR (amino acids 666–894) in pGBT9 were used to transfect the yeast strainsSaccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 and PJ694a, respectively, as described (CLONTECH). PKR was placed into pET14b such that the amino terminus of the kinase was fused in frame with 6× histidine residues (Novagen). The resultant plasmid (pET14bPKR) was used to transfectE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen), and PKR was purified over nickel columns as previously described (34Polyak S.J. Tang N. Wambach M. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1702-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were further purified on a gel filtration column, Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), examined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels or immunoblot using anti-PKR monoclonal antibody (35Laurent A.G. Krust B. Galabru J. Svab J. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4341-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NFAR cDNAs in pET11a were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS. Bacteria were lysed in 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm PMSF, and 100 µg/ml aprotinin. Inclusion bodies were resuspended in the above lysis buffer containing 6 m urea and applied to a nickel affinity column (Novagen). The column was washed with the above lysis buffer containing 6 m urea, followed by washes containing 60 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted with 1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm PMSF, 100 µg/ml aprotinin, and 6 m urea and dialyzed overnight (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 100 µg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol) to remove the denaturing reagent. Purified His-tagged NFAR proteins were examined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by immunoblot using a monoclonal antibody to the His tag (R & D Systems). For expression of 35S-labeled NFAR in vitro, the TNT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used to synthesize proteins from the pcDNA3.1 NFAR vectors using T7 polymerase. The dsRNA binding activity of NFAR was measured by incubating purified His-tagged NFAR proteins,35S-labeled NFAR proteins, or lysate from HeLa cells with poly(I-C)-agarose beads. The HeLa cells were lysed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm PMSF, and 1 µg/ml of aprotinin). The lysates were adjusted to 200, 500, and 1000 mm NaCl concentrations and incubated with 100 µl of poly(I-C)-agarose slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h and then washed five times with 1 ml of the binding buffer at the indicated NaCl concentrations. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in protein loading dye, boiled, and loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-NFAR antiserum or with anti-histidine monoclonal antibodies. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed at room temperature in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS, washed with 1× PBS, and permeabilized for 30 min on ice with 1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS and 0.1 m glycine. Antibodies used were anti-PKR (33Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), anti-SMN (Transduction Laboratories), and hybridoma supernatant of anti-FUS monoclonal antibody (gift from David Ron) followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were double-labeled with anti-NFAR rabbit polyclonal serum and then rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes). For in vitro assays, purified PKR was incubated with approximately stoichiometric amounts of His-tagged NFAR-1 or -2 in equal volumes of KCl buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 5% glycerol) in the presence or absence of dsRNA as described (28Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Adult and fetal human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA representing NFAR-1. Blots were washed and autoradiographed prior to being reprobed with radiolabeled actin cDNA. For in vitroanalysis, equal amounts of His-tagged PKR and NFAR-1 were incubated in binding buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) on ice for 10 min. To immunoprecipitate PKR, anti-PKR monoclonal antibody or preimmune murine IgG was added to the mix and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein G-agarose was added for 1 h. The proteins were washed four times in cold incubation buffer and boiled in protein disruption buffer, as above. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunblot using anti-NFAR rabbit serum. To immunoprecipitate NFAR, rabbit antiserum raised to NFAR-1 or control preimmune rabbit serum was added to the proteins as above. After washing, the proteins were electrophoresed as described and immunoblotted using anti-PKR monoclonal antibody. For in vivo co-immunoprecipitation analysis, HeLa cells (3 × 106/incubation) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NaF, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin) and precleared with preimmune rabbit serum or normal mouse IgG and protein G for 1 h. Anti-PKR, anti-NFAR, anti-FUS, anti-SMN, or preimmune antibodies were added to precleared cell extracts and incubated for 1.5 h. Protein G-agarose was added to the mix, and after 3 h the cells were washed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer five times. For RNase treatment, 20 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added during the third wash and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The proteins were examined by immunoblot using anti-PKR, anti-NFAR, anti-FUS, or anti-SMN antibodies. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 6 × 104 cells were plated out in 12-well dishes for luciferase assays, and 0.7 µg of the pcDNA3.1 vector and 0.3 µg of the pGL3 promoter vector were co-transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in 40 µl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm PMSF). Luciferase assays were read on a luminometer (TD 20/20; Promega). All assays were performed independently, a minimum of three times, in duplicate. Mice lacking PKR (strain 129/terSv) were courtesy of Dr. John Bell of Ontario University (36Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A.

COS-1 cells were transfected as above, except that 1 × 105 cells were seeded into six-well dishes and transfected with 1 µg of the pcDNA3.1 vector and 0.4 µg of the reporter vector. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After quantitation, the samples were treated with DNase I (Life Technologies). RT-PCR was performed using Stratagene's ProSTAR Ultra HF RT-PCR system. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. As a control for equal mRNA concentrations, β-actin was reverse transcribed using the following primers: 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′. Luciferase mRNA was reversed transcribed using 5′-CAGCGAGACGGAGTATCTTGACGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGAATCTCTCCCCTCGCGGTG-3′. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels and quantitated using the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). NFAR-1 or NFAR-2 was co-transfected with pGL3 promoter (Promega) into 100 mm dishes of 1 × 107 COS-1 cells. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold 1× SSC, collected, and resuspended in 100 µl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) by pipetting 10 times. Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min, centrifuged, and washed twice in 1 ml of the above buffer and then resuspended in 100 µl of freezing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The nuclei were thawed on ice and mixed with 100 µl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 mmMgCl2; 300 mm KCl; 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP; and 100 µCi of [α-32P]UTP, 800 Ci/mmol). Following a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, 10 mg/ml DNase I was added, and the nuclei were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Labeled RNAs were isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies). cDNAs representing the N and C terminus of luciferase as well as full-length GAPDH were denatured in NaOH for 30 min at room temperature, followed by neutralization with 6× SSC on ice. The cDNAs were applied under low vacuum to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a slot blot apparatus. The dried membrane was UV-cross-linked and incubated at 70 °C with prewarmed Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Labeled RNAs were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min before being incubated with the blot overnight at 70 °C. The blot was washed for 20 min in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 70 °C. The blot was exposed to film for 2–3 weeks. Immunoprecipitations ofin vitro splicing reactions using NFAR-specific antiserum and other control antibodies were performed as previously described (37Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 monoclonal antibody (9H10) was a generous gift from Dr. G. Dreyfuss. To identify novel proteins that interact with PKR, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and screened for proteins that associated with the full-length kinase (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Wild-type PKR is toxic to yeast, since it becomes activated in vivo and phosphorylates the yeast eIF2α homologue, SUI2, causing a block in translation (39Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Barber G.N. Wambach M. Wong M.L.

Therefore, a catalytically inactive PKR variant with an amino acid substitution in catalytic domain II (K296R) was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and used as bait to screen a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Eight positive clones from 4 × 106 transformants screened were found to be identical at the N terminus of the putative open reading frames but to differ in their carboxyl ends, indicating the existence of two related gene products, which we refer to as NFAR-1 and -2. Further isolation of cDNA clones retrieved from hybridization screening of T-cell cDNA libraries and the complete sequencing of the entire NFAR gene from PAC clones confirmed the existence of two related cDNAs that are generated through alternative splicing from a single gene on chromosome 19 (Fig. 1,A and B; Ref. 41Saunders L.R. Jurecic V. Barber G.N. Genomics. 2001; 71: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The two NFAR cDNAs represented open reading frames encoding proteins containing 702 (NFAR-1) and 894 (NFAR-2) amino acids, respectively. The coding region of both alternatively spliced variants begins in exon 2 and encodes through exon 17, at which point NFAR-1 continues to encode one additional exon, exon 18, while NFAR-2 splices to exon 19 and encodes three additional exons not contained in NFAR-1 (Fig.1 B). Data base searches revealed that amino acids 401–468 and 524–591 of both NFAR-1 and -2 represent potential dsRNA binding motifs, similar to those found in PKR (4St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 42Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, NFAR-1 and -2 are almost certainly members of the dsRNA binding family of proteins that includes theDrosophila maternal effect protein staufen and the vaccinia virus protein E3L (4St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Data bank comparative analysis further revealed that NFAR-1 and -2 are ∼75% homologous at the amino acid level with the Xenopus dsRNA-binding proteins 4F.1 and 4F.2, whose function is unknown (3Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Significantly, both NFAR proteins were also found to share homology from amino acids 166–235 with the known PKR substrate eIF2α (Fig. 1 C; 23% identity, 49% conservation over 69 amino acids). It is notable that this homologous region of eIF2α contains serine 51, the single target site for PKR phosphorylation (9Choi S.Y. Scherer B.J. Schnier J. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 286-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More extensive regions of homology exist from residue 222 to 235 and include a conserved VIRV box. This area also entirely overlaps with the vaccinia virus-encoded PKR inhibitor, K3L, an eIF2α homologue (15Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Beattie E. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Virology. 1991; 183: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been reported that K3L binds 400-fold more efficiently than eIF2α to PKR and suppresses the function of the kinase (19Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12837-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the NFAR cDNA clones were homologous to two partially overlapping clones in the data banks, referred to as MPP-4 (43Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the two MPP-4 clones are partial representations of the NFAR gene with the coding regions of these genes only extending to amino acids 404 and 611 of N"
https://openalex.org/W2053352835,"Primary erythroid progenitors can be expanded by the synergistic action of erythropoietin (Epo), stem cell factor (SCF) and glucocorticoids. While Epo is required for erythropoiesis in general, glucocorticoids and SCF mainly contribute to stress erythropoiesis in hypoxic mice. This ability of normal erythroid progenitors to undergo expansion under stress conditions is targeted by the avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV), harboring the oncogenes v-ErbB and v-ErbA. We investigated the signaling pathways required for progenitor expansion under stress conditions and in leukemic transformation. Immortal strains of erythroid progenitors, able to undergo normal, terminal differentiation under appropriate conditions, were established from fetal livers of p53−/− mice. Expression and activation of the EGF-receptor (HER-1/c-ErbB) or its mutated oncogenic version (v-ErbB) in these cells abrogated the requirement for Epo and SCF in expansion of these progenitors and blocked terminal differentiation. Upon inhibition of ErbB function, differentiation into erythrocytes occurred. Signal transducing molecules important for renewal induction, i.e. Stat5- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), are utilized by both EpoR/c-Kit and v/c-ErbB. However, while v-ErbB transformed cells and normal progenitors depended on PI3K signaling for renewal, c-ErbB also induces progenitor expansion by PI3K-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2035829259,"PEX5 functions as a mobile import receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins with a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1). A critical step within the PTS1-import pathway is the interaction between PEX5 and the peroxisome membrane-associated protein PEX14. Based on two-hybrid analyses in mammalian cells and complementary in vitro binding assays, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved pentapeptide repeat motifs, WX(E/D/Q/A/S)(E/D/Q)(F/Y), in PEX5 bind to PEX14 with high affinity. The results obtained indicate that each of the seven di-aromatic pentapeptides of human PEX5 interacts separately at the same binding site in the N terminus of PEX14 with equilibrium dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range. Mutational analysis of the PEX14-binding motifs reveals that the conserved aromatic amino acids at position 1 or 5 are essential for high affinity binding. We propose that the side chains of the aromatic amino acids are in close proximity as part of an amphipathic α-helix and together form hydrophobic anchors for binding PEX5 to individual PEX14 molecules.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The current model proposes that the receptors shuttle back to the cytoplasm after release of their substrate (5Dodt G. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 6Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PEX5 and PEX7 were identified as receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins in numerous species (for review see Ref. 7Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Both proteins are capable of interacting with peroxisomal proteins via their peroxisomal targeting signals PTS11 or PTS2. A minor class of peroxisomal proteins, recognized by PEX7, contains the PTS2 signal which consists of the sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X5(H/Q)(L/A) near the N terminus. The majority of matrix proteins that interact with PEX5 do so via their PTS1 which consists of the tripeptide SKL (or a conserved variant thereof) at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein. The hypothesis of mobile receptors is in line with the cellular distribution of both PEX5 and PEX7. In most cases only small portions of the otherwise cytosolic receptors are associated with the peroxisome (for review see Ref. 7Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Two likely candidates for the cargo-receptor docking site at the peroxisomal membrane are the proteins PEX13 and PEX14, which both interact with PEX5 and with each other via the cytoplasmic SH3-domain of PEX13 (for review see Ref.1Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 623-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the key components of the cytosolic steps of protein import, namely PEX5, PEX7, PEX13 and PEX14, are conserved in lower and higher eukaryotes, the mode of interactions appears to differ between mammalian and yeast cells in several aspects. First, the point of convergence of the PTS1 and PTS2 targeting pathways in yeast is the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane (PEX13/PEX14) (8Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Girzalsky W. Rehling P. Stein K. Kipper J. Blank L. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas in mammalian cells the PTS receptors seem to interact in the cytoplasm directly (11Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Second, in mammalian cells PEX14 provides the initial docking site for both receptors. This was suggested because PEX5 was localized mostly in the cytosol in cell lines deficient in PEX14, whereas it accumulated at peroxisomal membranes in cells overexpressing PEX14 (12Otera H.

This seems to be in disagreement with the observation that in the methylotrophic yeastHansenula polymorpha PEX5 can associate with the peroxisomal membrane in absence of PEX14 (13Salomons F.A.

Third, it was shown for several yeast species that PEX13 interacts directly with the PTS1 receptor (14Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Metzig B. America T. Tabak H.F.

Structural analysis of several mammalian and yeast PEX5 orthologs revealed that the binding regions for peroxisomal PTS1 proteins and for docking events are clearly separated. Binding of the PTS1 targeting signal requires the entire C-terminal half of PEX5 containing six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (18Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas the putative docking proteins PEX14 and PEX13 bind to the N-terminal half of the molecule (10Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4127-4136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One of the most striking structural features of the N-terminal region is the presence of multiple WXXX(F/Y) pentapeptide repeats. Di-aromatic pentapeptide motifs are found in the N-terminal halves of all PEX5 orthologs but in different numbers and spacings. The human PEX5 contains seven of these motifs. In a previous study we have proposed that recombinant human PEX5 possesses multiple binding sites for human PEX14 within its N-terminal half and that the conserved seven WXXX(F/Y) motifs may represent the binding sites on PEX5 (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate byin vitro and in vivo analyses that these repeats form individual high affinity sites for the N-terminal PEX5-binding domain of PEX14. Expression and purification of His6-tagged PEX5, PEX14-(1–78), and PEX14-(1–78) fused to the C terminus of glutathione-S transferase (GST) was carried out as described previously (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Purity of proteins was checked by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie or BCA-based colorimetric assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Alternatively the absorbance at 280 nm or 214 nm was measured. Soluble 16-mer peptides were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method of solid phase peptide chemistry on a Biosearch 9050 Pep-synthesizer (Milligen). Cleavage of the peptides from the resin and removal of the protecting groups was achieved by treating the peptide with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% phenol, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1% triisopropylsilane (all from Sigma), and 5% water (22Merrifield R.-B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2158Crossref Scopus (6655) Google Scholar). The peptides used for competition experiments were high pressure liquid chromatography-purified. Cellulose-bound peptides were generated by the Spots technique according to the manufacturer's protocol (Auto-Spot-Robot ASP 222, ABIMED) and described by Frank (23Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Analysis of the in vitro interaction of PEX14-(1–78) with PEX5-derived peptides was done using an overlay assay. 15-mer peptides were directly synthesized on a cellulose membrane (see above). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in HBS (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with HBS for 15 min at room temperature the membranes were incubated overnight with 1 μmGST-PEX14-(1–78) at 4 °C. Bound GST fusion protein was decorated with affinity-purified anti-GST antibodies and visualized by the ECL reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Sigma). For competition studies we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy with a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). Anti-GST antibodies were covalently linked to the sensor surfaces of a CM5 sensor chip as described previously (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Specific surfaces were created by capturing GST-PEX14-(1–78), or, as a control, GST without fusion part to an immobilization level of 850 and 600 resonance units, respectively. Mixtures of 50 nm PEX5 with varying amounts of W1 peptide were passed over these surfaces for 5 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The concentrations of peptide in these mixtures ranged from 68 μm to 6.8 pm in 10-fold steps. At the end of each association phase the response was recorded and the data obtained from the control surface were subtracted from the specific surface. These specific responses were plotted against the peptide concentration on a logarithmic scale. The response obtained without peptide was set to 0.68 pm because concentration less than 68 nm produced no further effect. From these data an IC50 value was extracted by using the “one site competition” model of the Prism Graph Pad Software, version 3.02 (H. J. Motulsky, Graph Pad Software Inc.). If theKD value for the competing reaction is known, the inhibitory constant, Ki, can be calculated according to the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar). Binding of tryptophan-containing peptides to PEX14-(1–78) was monitored using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Emission spectra of peptides with and without PEX14-(1–78), each at a concentration of 600 nm, were recorded from λ = 300 nm to λ = 500 nm in 150 nm NaCl and 20 nm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 20 °C. Titration curves were recorded at 340 nm by adding 20 nm (1 μl of a 16 μm stock) PEX14-(1–78) in a stepwise fashion to an 800-μl solution of peptide at 200 nm (20 °C). Excitation and emission slit widths were both set to 5 nm. The spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. A plot of the relative fluorescence intensity versusPEX14-(1–78) concentration was used to extract KDvalues. Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 were used to fit the data with the Software Graph Pad Prism 3.02.

The in vivointeraction of full-length PEX14 with PEX5 fragments was investigated using the Mammalian Matchmaker Two-Hybrid assay kit (CLONTECH). Construction of PEX14 fused to the Gal4 DNA-activating domain of the pVP16 vector was described earlier (25Will G.K. Soukupova M. Hong X. Erdmann K.S. Kiel J.A. Dodt G. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the PEX5 fragments were cloned behind the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pM vector. PEX5 fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the respective oligonucleotides. PEX5-(1–113) and PEX5-(1–131) were amplified with the T7 promotor primer (Novagen) as sense primer, the primers Ku644 (5′-CTAGGTCGACCTAGGCCAAGTCTGCCACACC-3′) and Ku582 (5′-CTAGGTCGACTATACTCCACAGCATCTCCAGC-3′) as antisense primers, and the vector pET9d-His6-PEX5L (19Schliebs W.

These vectors were cut with NcoI (blunted with Klenow polymerase) and SalI and cloned into the EcoRI (blunted) andSalI sites of the pM vector. DNA fragments encoding full-length PEX5, PEX5-(1–335), PEX5-(1–251), PEX5-(139–335), and PEX5-(214–335) were generated by polymerase chain reaction 2G. Dodt and S. J. Gould, manuscript in preparation. and cloned into theNcoI (blunted) and XbaI sites of the pM vector. PEX5-(191–251) was excised from the pM derivative encoding PEX5-(1–251) with Bsu36I (blunted) and XbaI and cloned into the pM vector digested with SmaI and XbaI. The latter was cut with BspMI (blunted) andBglII, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the pM vector digested with HindIII (blunted) and BglII to generate PEX5-(191–222). Human skin fibroblasts (GM5756) were seeded on 12-well plates and, on the next day, cotransfected with 0.24 μg of DNA of pM and pVP16 derivatives and with 0.05 μg of reporter plasmid pG5CAT (CLONTECH) using 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (CAT ELISA kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were cleared at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in lysates was determined with the CAT ELISA kit. Similar transfected cells were controlled for the presence of the fusion proteins and for CAT expression by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against the Gal4-binding domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and against CAT (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Boulder, CO). We previously demonstrated that human PEX5 possesses multiple binding sites for PEX14 and proposed that the various WXXX(F/Y) pentapeptide repeats might provide the structural basis for these interactions (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To map the PEX14-binding regions of PEX5 we expressed the long form of PEX5 and various truncated forms fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in human fibroblast cells (Fig. 1). The truncated versions of PEX5 contained either none or different numbers of WXXX(F/Y) motifs as indicated in Fig. 1. The interaction between these PEX5 fragments with PEX14 fused to the Gal4 DNA-activating domain was monitored by the expression level of the reporter protein CAT. Deletion of the complete C-terminal half of PEX5 containing the whole TPR-domain had no significant effect on the interaction with PEX14. This result is in line with two recent observations. We found that recombinant PEX5 fragments PEX5-(335–639) fused to GST and maltose binding protein did not bind recombinant PEX14 (data not shown), and Chang et al. reported that no interaction between the C-terminal half of PEX5 and PEX14 could be detected using a yeast two-hybrid assay (26Chang C.C. Warren D.S. Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, our mammalian two-hybrid results confirm our previous in vitro findings that at least two different binding sites for PEX14 exist within the N-terminal half of PEX5. This conclusion is based on the result that non-overlapping N-terminal fragments of PEX5,e.g. PEX5-(1–131) and PEX5-(139–335), respectively, are capable of interacting with PEX14. To exclude the possibility that the interaction of N-terminal PEX5 fragments with PEX14 is due to oligomerization with wild type PEX5, the two-hybrid experiments were reproduced in PBD005 fibroblast cells that lack PEX5 (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These studies gave similar results although CAT expression level was somewhat lower (data not shown). All PEX5 fragments containing WXXX(F/Y) motifs interacted in the two-hybrid assay. In contrast, two fragments without the WXXX(F/Y) motif, PEX5-(1–113) and PEX5-(191–222), did not interact with PEX14 in the assay used. Although there is not a strong correlation between the number of WXXX(F/Y) motifs and the expression level of CAT, these results indicate that the conserved pentapeptide repeats are essential for complex formation between PEX5 and PEX14. To further substantiate that the multiple di-aromatic pentapeptides determine PEX5 binding to PEX14 we measured their individual binding affinities. For this purpose, we performed fluorescence measurements with eight synthetic 16-mer peptides corresponding to different tryptophan-containing regions of PEX5 (Fig. 2 B). In addition to the seven peptides containing the consensus sequence WX(A/S/D/E/Q)(D/E/Q)(F/Y) we included an eighth one, which contained the pentapeptide sequence WDKLQ. The latter peptide was chosen because of its sequence similarity to the WXXX(F/Y) motifs and because it is a conserved pattern in the known PEX5 proteins of different organisms. The purified PEX5-binding domain of PEX14 consisting of the N-terminal 78 amino acids that does not contain tryptophan was used as a binding partner (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The emission spectra of the intrinsic tryptophan in the peptides before and after incubation with PEX14-(1–78) are shown in Fig. 3. The formation of complexes between each of the peptides W1, W2, W3, W5, W6, and W7 and PEX14-(1–78) were accompanied by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity and a significant change of the maximum emission wavelength (Fig. 3). The blue shift of ∼20 nm in fluorescence after binding of each of the peptides to PEX14-(1–78) indicated a less polar environment in the vicinity of tryptophan. Significant changes in fluorescence properties of tryptophan were not observed for peptides W4 and WQ indicating that the affinities of these peptides for PEX14-(1–78) were substantially lower.Figure 3Fluorescence emission spectra of synthetic peptides derived from tryptophan-containing regions of the N-terminal half of PEX5. The spectra of peptides W1-W7 and WQ (each at 600 nm) were recorded in the absence (dashed line) or presence (solid line) of 600 nmPEX14-(1–78). The spectrum obtained solely by PEX14-(1–78) is shown in the W1 panel (upper left, thin line). The maximum emission wavelengths at 360 nm and 340 nm are indicated byvertical dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The affinity for each peptide (at 200 nm) was quantified by PEX14-(1–78) titration. The emission was recorded at a wavelength of 340 nm (Fig. 4 A). The shapes of the titration curves obtained with W1-W7 imply that saturation of complex formation occurs for each at a concentration of ∼200 nm PEX14-(1–78), indicating a stoichiometry of 1:1 between the peptide and the PEX14 fragment. No binding at all could be observed with the WQ peptide. Equilibrium binding constants calculated from the titration curves exhibit high affinity binding in the nanomolar range for all peptides containing a WXXX(F/Y) motif (Fig. 4 B). The highest affinities were observed for the peptides W1, W2, W3, and W5 with KD values below 20 nm, whereas peptide W4 displayed lower affinity with a KD of about 100 nm. Thus, the binding affinities found by fluorescence spectroscopy for each of the peptides containing one WXXX(F/Y) motif are in the same range as that determined for full-length PEX5 toward PEX14-(1–78) using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To analyze the structural requirements for the binding of the di-aromatic peptides to PEX14 PEX5-derived 15-mer oligopeptides were synthesized on a cellulose membrane support and probed with GST-PEX14-(1–78). Specific anti-GST antibodies were used to visualize the complex formation. No staining was observed when GST without fusion protein was used (data not shown). With the exception of the WQ peptide, all seven peptides containing WXXX(F/Y) motifs (W1-W7) interacted with PEX14-(1–78) (Fig. 5). Several mutated versions of the di-aromatic motif within the W1 peptide were used to determine which of its five amino acids are strictly required. Replacing all five residues of the motif with alanine abolished binding to PEX14-(1–78) completely (Fig. 5). To identify the critical residues within this pentapeptide sequence further alanine substitutions were carried out at the conserved positions 1, 5, and 3/4 of the motif. Removing each of the aromatic side chains at the positions 1 and 5 resulted in a complete loss of binding. In contrast, mutation of the conserved charged residues at position 3 and 4 did not effect the interaction with PEX14-(1–78). Inversion of the pentapeptide sequence or exchange of the aromatic residues revealed that not only the presence of both side chains but also their positions within the motif sequence is essential for interaction with PEX14. As expected from the degeneracy of the pentapeptide motif a phenylalanine at position 5 could be replaced with a tyrosine without significant loss of binding. The results shown demonstrate that tryptophan at position 1 of the first motif is one of the two residues crucial for the high affinity interaction of the W1 peptide with PEX14-(1–78). To test if all other pentapeptide sequences (W2-W7) interact in a similar way with PEX14-(1–78) we substituted the first amino acid position of all seven di-aromatic motifs with alanine. In all cases the interaction is not detectable or significantly reduced (Fig. 5). We used competition experiments to prove that the interactions between the di-aromatic pentapeptides and PEX14 are essential for the high affinity multimeric complex formation of full-length PEX5 with PEX14-(1–78). For this purpose we performed surface plasmon resonance assays with PEX14-(1–78) immobilized to a sensor chip surface via GST fusion protein as described earlier (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The binding of full-length PEX5 (50 nm) was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of a synthetic peptide containing one single WXXX(F/Y) motif. Increasing amounts of W1 peptide (Fig. 2) resulted in a marked displacement of PEX5 (Fig.6). Half-maximal inhibition (IC50 value) was achieved at peptide concentrations of 1.43 × 10−6m. Assuming aKD of 1 nm for PEX5 (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) theKi of W1 peptide is 28 nm (see “Experimental Procedures”). Taking into account that multiple interaction sites exist the apparent Ki is in good agreement with the KD value of W1 peptide obtained by fluorescence analysis. The W1 peptide, carrying the Trp to Ala substitution was used as a control in the competition experiment. No effect on binding of PEX5 to PEX14-(1–78) was detected even at a peptide concentration of 100 μm (data not shown). The competitive effect of the W1 peptide for all PEX14-binding sites of PEX5 supports the view that all WXXX(F/Y) pentapeptides use the same binding region on the N-terminal-binding domain of PEX14. Two essential functions of the PTS1 receptor PEX5 are associated with different regions of this protein. It binds peroxisomal matrix proteins in a PTS1-dependent manner in the cytosol with the six TPR motifs in its C-terminal half (18Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, the docking event to the peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX13 and/or PEX14 requires the N-terminal half of PEX5. We reported previously that N-terminal fragments of human PEX5 form stable multimeric complexes with an N-terminal fragment of the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14 (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that multiple pentapeptide repeats in the N-terminal half of human PEX5 provide the molecular basis for this interaction. These pentapeptide repeats appear in different numbers in all known PEX5 orthologs and have been recognized previously (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), but no function could be clearly assigned to this motif. We show herein that each of the seven motifs of human PEX5 is capable of forming a single, high affinity binding site for the N-terminal PEX5-binding domain of PEX14. The consensus sequence of the PEX14-binding motif derived from human PEX5 is WX(E/D/Q/A/S)(E/D/Q)(F/Y). Our data indicate that both aromatic amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine/tyrosine at position 1 and 5, respectively, are indispensable for the high affinity interaction with PEX14. Based on secondary structure prediction we previously suggested that each WXXX(F/Y) motif forms a part of an amphipathic α-helix (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We propose from our recent data that the aromatic groups of tryptophan and phenylalanine/tyrosine, which are positioned on the same face of the α-helix, bind directly to a hydrophobic region of PEX14. The proposed binding mechanism is supported by the observed changes in the fluorescence spectra of tryptophan that were recorded before and after complex formation with PEX14 (Fig. 3). The drastic blue shift indicates a much less polar environment. A similar binding mechanism was also described for the extended A-helix of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In this case, phenylalanine 26 and tryptophan 30 as a part of the amphipathic α-helix mediate a tight intramolecular interaction by filling a deep hydrophobic pocket between the two lobes of the catalytic core (28Veron M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Tsigelny I. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10618-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with the suggested binding mechanism, the amino acids at position 3 and 4 of the WXXX(F/Y) motif do not contribute significantly to the interaction with PEX14 as indicated by mutational analysis (Fig. 5). The strong preference for glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate at these positions at the opposite side of the α-helix might indicate that these residues could be involved in other intra- or intermolecular interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that the tryptophan-dependent binding mechanism is identical for all seven PEX14-binding sites of human PEX5. First, tryptophan is an essential part of all WXXX(F/Y) peptides for the formation of stable complexes with PEX14-(1–78) as indicated by peptide spot overlay assays (Fig. 5). Second, the change of fluorescence properties during complex formation with PEX14-(1–78) for each tryptophan of six of the seven WXXX(F/Y) peptides is essentially the same (Fig. 3). Third, all seven WXXX(F/Y) peptides bind with similar high affinities with KD values in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 4). Finally, competition analysis indicates that all WXXX(F/Y) peptides can occupy the same site on the PEX14 fragment (amino acids 1–78) (Fig. 6). Binding of WXXX(F/Y) repeats to PEX14 strongly depends on their molecular environment, i.e. the accessibility of the aromatic side chains. We demonstrated previously that recombinant PEX5 formed a stable multimeric complex with the N-terminal PEX14-(1–78) fragment with a stoichiometry of 1:6–7 (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that at least six of seven WXXX(F/Y) motifs of human PEX5 provide authentic binding sites for PEX14. This must not be necessarily true for all motifs existing in other PEX5 orthologs. Two recent reports about PEX5 proteins from the yeasts Pichia pastorisand Saccharomyces cerevisiae are relevant here. In both cases no interaction between PEX5 fragments containing one or more WXXX(F/Y) motifs and PEX14 could be detected using overlay and pull-down assays (20Urquhart A.J. Kennedy D. Gould S.J. Crane D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4127-4136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Barnett P. Bottger G. Klein A.T. Tabak H.F. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6382-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Instead, the WXXX(F/Y) motifs are essential parts of much larger PEX13 binding sites. In S. cerevisiae the interaction between PEX5 and PEX13 requires in addition to both aromatic residues of the pentapeptide motif at least two negatively charged residues to the C terminus (on the same side of a proposed α-helix). These are not conserved in the context of the human PEX5 WXXX(F/Y) motifs. In P. pastoris the minimal fragment length required for binding to PEX13 comprises 114 amino acid residues including three WXXX(F/Y) motifs, and a peptide containing one single WXXX(F/Y) motif is not sufficient to compete this interaction. The data from both groups suggest that the PEX13 interacting region of these two yeast PEX5 orthologs is more complex than a single PEX14-binding site defined in human PEX5. It seems important in this context that in mammalian cells probably only PEX14 provides the initial binding protein for PEX5 at the peroxisomal membrane (12Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast both PEX13 and PEX14 can fulfill their function as docking proteins (10Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, one feature of WXXX(F/Y) motifs in both yeasts and mammals is that they mediate contact between the PTS1 receptor and the organism-specific preferred interacting partner at the peroxisomal membrane. Multiple high affinity binding sites for PEX14 on PEX5 were not expected when the former was proposed as docking protein for both cytosolic import receptors (8Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In principle, a single binding site on PEX5 could provide the structural basis for such a docking event. Therefore, it is an important question whether all binding sites on human PEX5 are occupied simultaneously or sequentially in vivo. Gouveia et al. recently isolated PEX5 from membranes of rat liver peroxisomes as a transmembrane complex with PEX14 and showed that the complex contained PEX5 and PEX14 with a 1:5 stoichiometry (30Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our in vitro data provide a rationale for the formation of such a membrane complex. It is tempting to speculate that a function of the WXXX(F/Y) pentapeptide repeats of PEX5 is first the docking of the cargo-receptor complex to the integral membrane protein PEX14 and subsequently the formation of the transmembrane multimeric complex.

It contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) through which it has been shown to block the activation of some initiator caspases. Because ARC also blocks caspase-independent events associated with apoptosis, such as hypoxia-induced cytochromec release, we examined its role in cell death triggered by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the myogenic cell line, H9c2. Cell death in this model was caspase-independent and characterized by dose-dependent reduction in ARC expression accompanied by disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and loss of plasma membrane integrity, typical of necrotic cell death. Ectopic expression of ARC prevented both H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death without affecting the stress kinase response, suggesting that ARCs protective effects were downstream of early signaling events and not due to quenching of H2O2. ARC was also effective in blocking H2O2-induced loss of membrane integrity and/or disruption of Δψm in two human cell lines in which it is not normally expressed. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its ability to block caspase-dependent and -independent events in apoptosis, ARC also prevents necrosis-like cell death via the preservation of mitochondrial function.

These interactions link proximal signals to cellular protease activation and the self-destruction of the cell and are often triggered by ligand-induced conformational changes and/or changes in the relative expression of accessory regulatory molecules. Based on sequence similarities, three prominent interaction motifs involved in apoptosis are recognized. These are the death domain, the death effector domain, and the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1 (2Hofmann K. Cell. Mol.

ARC selectively interacts with the initiator caspases 2 and 8 and significantly attenuates death receptor-induced apoptosis dependent on the activation of these caspases (14Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the H9c2 rat embryonic heart cell line, ARC expression was shown to decrease in association with activation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of ARC prevented apoptosis, protection being mediated in all or part through the blockade of hypoxia-induced cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria (15Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since small peptide broad-spectrum inhibitors of caspases had no effect on this release, these results suggested that, in addition to its potential ability to directly prevent the activation of specific initiator caspases, ARC is also capable of blocking caspase-independent events critical for the execution of apoptosis. In this study, we have examined the role of ARC in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in the rat embryonic cell line, H9c2. Cell death mediated by reactive oxygen species is a significant component of ischemia-reperfusion injury in tissues, such as the heart (16Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 17Bolli R. Jeroudi M.O. Patel B.S. DuBose C.M. Lai E.K. Roberts R. McKay P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4695-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). While ischemia causes some cell death on its own, the reintroduction of oxygen during reperfusion is associated with accelerated apoptotic cell death and necrosis, resulting, in part, from a burst of free radical production. H2O2 and its reactive by-products are potential mediators of cell death induced by diverse stimuli (18Simizu S. Takade M. Umezawa K. Imoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Jing Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S. Blood. 1999; 94: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the experiments reported in this study, H2O2 caused a dose-dependent dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, plummeting intracellular ATP levels, and loss of plasma membrane integrity linked to the early changes in mitochondrial integrity. These changes were accompanied by reduced ARC protein levels and were unaffected by a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor. Moreover, H9c2 cell lines that lacked endogenous ARC expression (H9- cells) were more sensitive to death-inducing effects of H2O2. Maintaining ARC levels in these cells as well as the parental H9c2 cells by driving exogenous ARC expression from a constitutively active promoter prevented the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the resulting cell death. H2O2-induced changes in Erk1/2 phosphorylation were unaffected by enforced ARC expression, suggesting that ARCs protective effects were not due to the direct or indirect quenching of H2O2 but to blocking downstream effects of H2O2 within the cell. We also show that ARC provides equivalent protective effects in two nonmyogenic cell lines in which H2O2 also causes necrosis-like cell death. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its ability to block caspase-dependent and -independent events in apoptosis, ARC can also prevent cellular changes associated with necrotic cell death through its ability to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to ARC was generated as previously described (15Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To remove antibodies directed against the N-terminal CARD, which ARC shares with the nucleolar protein, Nop30 (20Stoss O. Schwaiger F-W. Cooper T.A. Stamm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10951-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the antisera was affinity purified using the C-terminal proline-glutamic acid (P/E)-rich domain of ARC immobilized on nickel-saturated nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose matrix (Qiagen). The C-terminal domain of rat ARC was cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector, pTrcHis-TOPO (Invitrogen), to generate a 6Xhis-tagged protein. Expression of the protein in bacteria was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and a guanidinium hydrochloride lysate prepared and loaded onto the Ni-NTA column according to the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen). After washing the column to elute nonspecific binding and equilibrating it in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the Ni-NTA-agarose matrix with the bound 6XHis-tagged C-terminal domain of rat ARC was incubated with antisera and washed extensively in equilibration buffer. Antibodies were then eluted in 4 mMgCl2 (21Gu J. Stephenson C.G. Iadarola M.J. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight in the cold against two changes of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The H9c2 embryonal rat heart-derived cell line (21Gu J. Stephenson C.G. Iadarola M.J. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (CRL 1446) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium containing 4500 mg/liter d-glucose and 110 mg/ml pyruvate, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were routinely monitored for the presence of ARC and the myogenic determination factor, myoD. A subline of H9c2 lacking detectable ARC expression (referred to as H9−) was generated by maintaining cell cultures at high density for several weeks and then isolating clonal cell lines by limiting dilution. Cell lines in which ARC was stably expressed were generated by transfecting H9− cells with either an empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1(+)hygro) or one containing the human ARC cDNA (pcDNA3.1+hygro-hARC). Transfection was performed using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a DNA:Fugene ratio of 1:6. Hygromycin-resistant clones were selected in media containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cell viability and cytotoxicity was measured using calcein-AM (500 nm), a membrane permeant dye that in live cells is cleaved by esterases to yield cytoplasmic green fluorescence and ethidium homodimer-1 (EtD-1 (1 μm)), a red nucleic acid dye to which live cells are impermeant, but that accumulates in the nuclei of membrane-compromised cells (Molecular Probes L-3224). Staining was performed on live cells in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cell death was measured by determining the percent of EtD-1 positive cells to total cell number (EtD-1 and calcein-AM positive cells) in at least 8 fields from each experiment and then averaged over a total of three to six experiments. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined using MitoTrackerCMXRos (Molecular Probes M-7512). At the end of the experiment, medium was removed and Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium with 50 nmMitoTrackerCMXRos was added to live cells for 15 min at 37 °C. Dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by determining the percent of MitoTracker negative cells in at least 8 fields from each experiment and then averaged over a total of three to six experiments. A recombinant replication-defective adenovirus encoding human ARC was constructed using the pAdTrack shuttle vector (22He T-C. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). This contains two separate cytomegalovirus promoters to drive either transgene or green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Bacterial recombination between the shuttle vector and the replication-defective adenoviral genome, virus amplication, and virus purification were performed by the Gene Therapy Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Control virus expressed only GFP. Viral infections were performed on cells in suspension with the optimal amount of virus/cell determined empirically using the GFP marker to achieve 85–90% infection. Infection was performed in serum-free media for 2 h at 37 °C, after which serum-containing media was added and the cells plated onto tissue culture plastic. Experimental manipulations of the cells were performed 48 h after infection. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and then treated 48 h later with 400 μm peroxide in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium for 15–60 min. The cells from 3 dishes were collected for each time point by trypsinization, washed twice in fractionation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), and resuspended in 0.15 ml of fractionation buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P-8340). The cells were homogenized on ice using 100 passes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were spun down at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was spun at 14,000 rpm for 25 min to separate the “cytosolic” (supernatant) and “heavy membrane” fractions (pellet). Cytosolic protein (25 μg) was loaded onto 16% Tris glycine gels (Novex), electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinyldine fluoride membrane, and cytochrome c release detected by Western blotting as described below. ARC and cytochrome c protein levels, caspase activation/cleavage, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation/phosphorylation were measured by Western blotting. With the exception of the cytochrome cmeasurements (see above), all extracts were prepared by washing the cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then directly scraping them into 1 × SDS sample buffer without reducing agents (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), boiling the extract for 5 min, and then sonicating it to reduce viscosity. Immediately prior to electrophoresis, the sample was reduced by adding dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were heat-denatured and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels for separation. Gels were transferred to polyvinyldine fluoride membranes by semi-dry blotting in 128 mm Tris, 0.96 m glycine, 20% methanol for 2 h at a constant current of 2.5 mA/cm2 polyvinyldine fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% Amersham Pharmacia Biotech blocking reagent (RPN 2125) in Western buffer for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight in the cold with primary antibody diluted in 2.5% blocking buffer. The membranes were then washed 3 times with continuous agitation in Western buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated in 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature, washed again 3 times as above, and then developed in SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce Biochemicals) for 3 min. The sources of the antibodies used and their dilutions were: ARC (see above, 1:10,000), cytochrome c (Pharmingen 65971A, 1:1000), cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling D175, 1:1000), phospho-specific Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling 9101, 1:1000), phospho-specific p38 (Cell Signaling 9211, 1:1000), total p38 (Santa Cruz, sc-728, 1:1000), total Erk-1 (Santa Cruz, sc-94, 1:5000), and total Erk-2 (Santa Cruz, sc-1647, 1:5000). Exposing rat embryonic cardiac H9c2 cells to relatively high doses of H2O2 caused disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity, events characteristic of necrosis. Fig. 1 shows the results of staining untreated and H2O2-treated H9c2 cells with markers of Δψm (MitoTrackerCMX-Ros), loss of plasma membrane integrity (ethidium dimer-1 (EtD-1)), and cell viability (calcein-AM). In untreated cultures, the vast majority of cells were alive, impermeant to EtD-1, trapping calcein-AM within the cell, and displaying an intact Δψm (Fig. 1, B, C, andA, respectively). After exposure to 400 μmH2O2 for 12 h, however, most cells were dead, showing loss of plasma membrane integrity, as indicated by uptake of EtD-1 and failure to accumulate calcein-AM (Fig. 1, E andF), and disruption of the Δψm (Fig.1 D, respectively). Fig.2 A shows the dose response for Δψm dissipation and the appearance of dead (EtD-1+) cells after 12 h of treatment. Both serum starvation alone and in combination with a low dose of H2O2 (50 μm) caused some Δψm dissipation but without increased cell death. As the concentration of H2O2 increased, however, both the percentage of cells undergoing Δψm dissipation and EtD-1 uptake increased. At 400 μm H2O2, all of the cells showed a dramatic reduction in Δψm with 85–90% of these now permeable to EtD-1.Figure 2Dose-response and time course of H2O2-induced Δψm dissipation and cell death.

Δψm dissipation and loss of plasma membrane integrity were measured in untreated cells and cells exposed to serum withdrawal alone (no serum), and to increasing concentrations of H2O2 for 12 h.

Asterisk (*) indicates significantly different from untreated controls, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 B shows the time course of the percent of total cells undergoing Δψm disruption and cell death at 400 μm H2O2. Δψm dissipation occurred within the first hour of exposure and was apparent in nearly all of the cells by 2 h. Over this period, cellular ATP levels dropped to <10% (data not shown). The appearance of dead (EtD-1 positive) cells lagged behind the changes in Δψm suggesting that cell death as measured by EtD-1 uptake may be dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction measured here as a disruption in Δψm . To directly test this, we first pretreated cells with cyclosporin A to determine if the disruption of the Δψm could be blocked by this mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor. Fig. 3 A shows that pretreatment with 500 nm cyclosporin A markedly prevented the H2O2-induced Δψm dissipation seen after 2 h. Similar results were seen with bongkrekic acid (data not shown). Fig. 3 B shows that CsA not only prevented Δψm dissipation but also the H2O2-induced increase in EtD-1 positive cells, indicating that the loss of plasma membrane integrity was dependent, in large part, on either Δψm dissipation or MPT. Fig.4 A shows that H2O2 caused a rapid release of cytochromec from the mitochondria into the cytosol. While increases in cytosolic cytochrome c can trigger activation of caspase 9 and more distal caspase associated with apoptosis, such as caspase 3, we failed to observe caspase 3 cleavage (a measure of its activation) at any of the H2O2 doses tested (Fig.4 B). Caspase 3 cleavage, however, was readily detectable when cells were incubated with staurosporine and was blocked by preincubating the cells with the broad spectrum inhibitor of caspases, zVAD-fmk, indicating that it was due to processing by upstream caspases. To exclude the possibility that apoptosis may have occurred earlier than any of the times examined or over such an accelerated time frame that it was missed, we pretreated the cells with zVAD-fmk before exposure to H2O2. Fig. 4 C shows that this pretreatment had no effect on either Δψm dissipation or cell death. Together these results demonstrate that the necrosis-like cell death we observed with high doses of H2O2 is not a caspase-dependent event or an event secondary to caspase-dependent processes. Because ARC protein levels in H9c2s decrease in parallel with the development of apoptosis caused by hypoxia (12Yan M. Lee J. Schilbach S. Goddard A. Dixit D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10287-10292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we examined whether ARC protein levels were also altered in response to H2O2exposure and, if so, whether these changes were linked to the onset of cell death. Fig. 5 A shows a Western blot for ARC expression in various rat tissues and in H9c2 cells. ARC was detected in adult and embryonic heart but not in lung or liver, consistent with previously published Northern blotting data showing that expression of ARC mRNA is restricted to myogenic tissues and the testis (14Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The protein detected by our antibody migrates at a slower mobility (between 30 and 36 kDa) than predicted from the primary amino acid sequence of ARC (∼25Kd), due to ARCs proline-rich C-terminal domain. In addition, the protein detected in H9c2 cells (a rat myogenic cell line) migrates faster than the protein in normal rat myogenic tissues. A comparison of the DNA sequence of the ARC cDNAs isolated from H9c2 cells and the rat heart revealed the presence of a 12-amino acid deletion in the proline-rich C-terminal domain of H9c2 ARC. Whether this deletion is of any functional significance is not known, although similar deletions in this region are seen in human and mouse ARCs from both cultured cells and intact tissues. Fig. 5 B shows that increasing doses of H2O2 resulted in progressive loss of ARC from the cell. This dose-dependent decrease in expression paralleled the dose-dependent loss in Δψm and plasma membrane integrity. As a control for these measurements, Fig. 5 B also shows that hypoxia caused ARC down-regulation as described previously (15Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while staurosporine at doses sufficient to cause apoptosis did not affect ARC levels, indicating that not all cell death stimuli may alter ARC expression. To determine the functional significance of ARCs down-regulation in H2O2-induced cell death, we infected H9c2 cells with a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus encoding the cDNAs for GFP and human ARC in separate expression cassettes (AdTrack.ARC). Infected H9c2 cells expressed human ARC protein and this expression, unlike the endogenous protein, was unaffected by H2O2 (Fig. 5 C). Fig.6 A shows a representative experiment examining the effect of exogenous ARC expression on Δψm dissipation caused by 200 μmH2O2. In addition to CMXRos, unfixed cells were also incubated with EtD-1. As shown above, H2O2caused dissipation of the Δψm in the vast majority of cells. In addition, many of these cells now accumulated EtD-1 in their nuclei (Fig. 6, white arrows), indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity. zVAD-fmk or the control AdTrack virus expressing only GFP (AdTrack) had no effect on these changes induced by H2O2. In cells infected with AdTrack.ARC, however, the Δψm remained intact. Fig. 6 B shows the combined results of this and several other experiments. Infection with AdTrack.ARC reduced Δψm dissipation from >95% to less than 25% of the cells and the loss of plasma membrane integrity from ∼70% to <10% of the cells. The experiments described in Fig. 6 showed that enforced expression of ARC could protect cells from the necrotic-like cell death induced by relatively high doses of H2O2. Although endogenous ARC is down-regulated by H2O2, we wished to investigate whether endogenous ARC provided any protection at all from H2O2. To do this, we took advantage of a subline of H9c2s that does not express ARC. This ARC-deficient subline was isolated and subcloned in the laboratory as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is referred to as H9−. A Western blot of whole cell extracts from the parental H9c2 and H9− cell lines confirms that H9− cells do not express ARC (lanes 1 and2 in Fig. 7 A). Thebottom panel shows the same extracts probed for Erk1/2 expression to demonstrate that approximately equal amounts of extract were loaded for each sample. Fig. 7 B compares the response of H9c2 and H9− cells to increasing doses of H2O2 in terms of EtD-1 staining. The dose-response curve is shifted to the left for H9− cells, indicating that they are more sensitive than the parental H9c2 cells to death-inducing effects of H2O2. Since it is possible that changes in gene expression in addition to the loss of ARC expression may contribute to the increased sensitivity of H9− cells to H2O2, we introduced the human ARC cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter into H9− cells. A number of stable cell lines were isolated that expressed the transgene (lanes 3–6 in Fig. 7 A). Unlike AdTrack.ARC-infected H9c2 cells, in which transgene expression was 20–30 times that of the endogenous gene, the level of transgene expression in these stable cell lines was only 2–4 times that in the parental H9c2 cell line (lane 1). Like the recombinant adenovirally infected cells, however, transgene expression was unaltered by H2O2 in these cell lines (Fig.8 A). Fig. 8 Bdisplays the results of a number of experiments examining the effect of H2O2 in these cell lines. In all cases, the cell lines were now totally resistant to H2O2in terms of Δψm dissipation and loss of plasma membrane integrity (EtD-1 uptake), strongly suggesting that the lack of ARC expression was an important factor contributing to the increased sensitivity of H9− cells to H2O2. In addition, these results show that massive overexpression of ARC seen in the adenovirally infected cells was not necessary to provide a protective effect. In fact, the protection afforded by the H9−/hARC cell lines was greater than that seen following adenoviral delivery of ARC, presumably because of the slight cytotoxicity associated with viral infection of these cells. One possible mechanism through which ARC could protect cells from oxidative damage is through either the direct quenching of H2O2 or indirect quenching through the increased expression or activation of anti-oxidant defenses. To test this, we examined the effect of enforced ARC expression on H2O2-induced stress kinase activation. In Fig.8 C, the H2O2-induced activation of p38 and Erk1/2 was examined in H9−, parental H9c2, and three of the H9−/hARC cell lines. (No changes in JNK1/2 activation were observed under the conditions of our experiments.) Increased p38 activation as measured by changes in its phosphorylation state was evident in H9− cells and, to a much lesser degree, in one of the H9−/hARC cell lines. In contrast, activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of Erk1/2 in response to H2O2 was seen in all the different cell lines, despite difference in ARC expression. Cells that express ARC tended to have increased basal levels of Erk phosphorylation, but in all cases, peak expression was comparable, occurring between 10 and 15 min after stimulation. Th"

In addition to binding to DNA as dimers, Stat1, Stat4, and Stat5 can form dimer·dimer complexes on tandemly linked STAT binding sites (2Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J.

Mutations in two regions of Stat3 disrupted the Stat3-c-Jun interaction and decreased the cooperation between the two proteins that activate transcription (13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We now report that the STAT binding site of the α2-M enhancer actually functions together with neighboring sequences (−12 bp upstream) to form a Stat3 dimer·dimer binding site. Furthermore, purified in vitrophosphorylated Stat3 binds to the α2-M enhancer as a tetramer. Mutations in the N terminus of Stat3 (W37A,Q66A) greatly diminished Stat3 tetramer binding and the cooperative Stat3-c-Jun transcriptional activation directed by the α2-M enhancer after IL-6 induction. Human HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Human 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human IL-6 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. The recombinant soluble form of the human IL-6 receptor was purchased from R&D Systems and was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. Anti-phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705) antibody (New England Biolabs) was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) was used at a 1:5000 dilution for Western blotting. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing 5′-BamHI sites and 3′-NotI sites. Amplified products were digested with appropriate enzymes and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Construction of the expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen) containing Stat3 was as described previously (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmids containing the α2-M promoter fragment and three Ly6E sites were described previously (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). pCMVβ-gal construct was purchased from Invitrogen. The expression vector for c-Jun was a gift from Tom Curran (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). DNase I footprinting assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega) with modifications. 5–15 μg of recombinants proteins was incubated with 20,000–30,000 cpm of one end-labeled probe in 50 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol on ice for 10 min. 50 μl of room temperature Ca2+/Mg2+ solution (5 mmCaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2) was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) was diluted in 50 mm CaCl2and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9). 0.05 units of DNase I was then incubated with the mixture for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA). DNA was recovered by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitation, resuspended in loading solution (1:2 (v/v) of 0.1 mNaOH:formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and applied to 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (Amresco). The expression plasmid was cotransformed into Escherichia colistrain DH5α with pATH(Tet)-v-Abl (a gift from Ke Shuai, University of California, Los Angeles). 50 ml of an overnight culture in 2 × YT broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 20 μg/ml tryptophan was diluted into 1 liter of 2 × YT broth supplemented with the same antibiotics and amino acid. The culture was grown at 30 °C for 4 h. The expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galatopyranoside. The cells were harvested 2 h later and suspended in 1 liter of 1 × M9 broth supplemented with the same antibiotics, 5 g/ml casamino acids (Sigma), 10 μg/ml thiamine-HCl (Sigma), 0.2% glucose, and 0.1 mmCaCl2 to induce the expression of the v-Abl kinase domain. The culture was grown for another 2 h and finally collected by centrifugation. Following lysis by sonication, GST proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. GST was removed by incubating with 20 units of Factor Xa overnight at 4 °C. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Promega) was used to introduce mutations into Stat3. A pair of primers was used to introduce the W37A mutation into wild-type Stat3. They are 5′-CGGCAGTTCCTGGCACCTGCGATTGAGAGTCAAGACTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCTTGACTCTCAATCGCAGGTGCCAGGAACTGCCG. wqStat3 mutant was created by using the other pair of primers 5′-CTCTTGGGTGAAATTGACGCGCAATATAGCCGATTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAATCGGCTATATTGCGCGTCAATTTCACCCAAGAG-3′ to introduce Q66A into Stat3W. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All results shown are luciferase activities normalized against the internal control β-galactosidase activity. 100 ng of recombinant proteins was incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides for 20 min at room temperature. The protein·DNA complexes were analyzed by EMSA as described previously (15Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Whole-cell lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out by standard methods (16Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K.

The cooperation of Stat3 and c-Jun in the activation of the rat α2-M enhancer during transient transfection experiments was reported earlier (8Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To test the importance of protein-DNA interaction at the α2-M enhancer, a dominant negative mutant in the DNA binding domain of Stat3, Stat3DB, was transfected into HepG2 cells. This mutation has Glu-434 and Glu-435 residues replaced by alanines and has been proven in several cases to be an effective inhibitor of Stat3 (17Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W.

Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The previously described DNA segment from the α2-M gene (nucleotides −189 to −95) was used as the enhancer of a luciferase reporter gene construct (13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells express endogenous Stat3 and c-Jun, and cells transfected with the reporter gene construct by itself exhibited an ∼7-fold higher transcriptional response when induced by IL-6 than when uninduced. Thus, the supplemental effects of wild-type proteins or interfering effects of dominant negative mutants must be distinguished from this background because of endogenous proteins. Transfection of the α2-M reporter gene and the expression vector for wild-type Stat3 boosted the IL-6-dependent response to ∼12-fold higher than the uninduced vector alone. Transfection of the c-Jun vector increased the level of IL-6-induced transcription to a similar extent, as did the Stat3 vector. Simultaneous transfection of the vectors for wild-type Stat3 and c-Jun led to an IL-6-dependent response of the reporter gene of ∼48-fold of that of the uninduced vector alone. In a concentration-dependent manner, Stat3DB reduced both the transcriptional signal dependent on endogenous Stat3 and that achieved with extra Stat3 and c-Jun (Fig.1). We conclude that specific protein-DNA interactions are essential for the α2-M gene activation. In our previous studies, a 100-bp DNA fragment of the α2-M enhancer was used to evaluate the role of Stat3-c-Jun interaction in the activation of the IL-6-inducible α2-M reporter gene (13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 12 base pairs upstream from the previously identified Stat3 site (TTCTGGGAA, canonical sequence = TTC/GN3G/CAA), there is a Stat3-like site (TAACTGGAA) at −187 to −179 (Fig.2 A). Early studies of mapping the IL-6-response elements of the α2-M gene promoter using DNase I footprinting showed that both the Stat3 site and the Stat3-like site can be protected by factors from acute-phase rat liver nuclear extracts (7Hattori M. Abraham L.J. Northemann W. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Ito T. Tanahashi H. Misumi Y. Sakaki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Stat3 site was protected more efficiently than the Stat3-like site. To elucidate the functional importance of the two sites in the IL-6 induction of α2-M, the mutated α2-M reporter gene constructs (in which either the canonical Stat3 site was mutated toGGATGGGAA or the Stat3-like site was mutated to TAATCTTCC or both were mutated together) were used in transient transfection analysis. Compared with the maximal activation driven by the wild-type α2-M promoter, the mutant of the canonical Stat3 site and the mutant of the Stat3-like site both gave decreased IL-6-dependent transcription, and mutation at both sites (designated as Double in Fig. 2 B) showed further reduction in signal. As noted in the Introduction, Stat1, Stat4, and Stat5 are able to form dimer·dimer complexes on the promoters containing two neighboring STAT binding sites (2Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell.

To determine whether Stat3 proteins bind to the α2-M promoter as tetrameric complexes, various phosphorylated recombinant Stat3 proteins were obtained by co-expressing the v-Abl kinase domain with several vectors encoding three forms of Stat3. The N-terminal truncation (ΔntStat3) lacks the initial 131 amino acids of the protein. Similar truncations in Stat1 and Stat4 lead to the failure to form tetrameric complexes on either synthetic oligonucleotides or natural promoter segments containing two tandem STAT binding sites. The other Stat3 mutant, wqStat3, has Trp-37 and Gln-66 residues replaced by alanines. The corresponding mutations in Stat1 and Stat5 block tetramerization (2Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Using a probe containing a high affinity synthetic single Stat3 binding site, ΔntStat3 and wqStat3 exhibited DNA binding equal to that of wild-type Stat3 (wtStat3) based on binding an equal amount of 32P-labeled DNA probe (Fig.3 A, lanes 1-3). When a probe (α2-M-12bp) containing both the canonical Stat3 site and the Stat3-like site of the α2-M promoter was used, an additional slow migrating complex was observed with wtStat3 protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), which was not found with ΔntStat3 (Fig. 3 A, lane 5) or with the wqStat3 mutant (lanes 8 and 9). The faster migrating band represented the Stat3 dimer. The mobility of the slow migrating complex suggested occupation of both STAT binding sites, indicating one DNA molecule with two Stat3 dimers bound to it. These results are similar to those with Stat1 and Stat5 proteins (2Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) bound to probes containing tandem STAT binding sites. The formation of the presumed tetrameric complex was also dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7). We next evaluated the different contributions of the two Stat3 binding sites of the α2-M promoter to the formation of Stat3 tetramer. Oligonucleotides containing different mutations as described in Fig.3 B were synthesized and used together with wild-type phosphorylated Stat3 protein in EMSA. The formation of a complex between the protein and radiolabeled α2-M-12bp was allowed to occur, and various unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in molar excess as competitors after the reaction reached equilibrium. Both the dimeric and tetrameric complexes were removed by a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide (wt) and by the Stat3-like site mutant (msl; Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4) but not by the mutant of the canonical STAT site (ms) or by a double mutant (double; Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 5). Next, wtStat3 protein was incubated with the radiolabeled versions of the same oligonucleotides. The wtStat3 protein formed both dimer and tetramer on the probe with intact α2-M-12bp sequence (Fig. 3 C,lane 1). With a sequence containing a mutation in the Stat3-like site, weak tetrameric and dimeric complexes were found (Fig.3 C, lane 3). With mutations in the canonical Stat3 site or with the double mutant, no complexes were seen (Fig.3 C, lanes 2 and 4). We then tested the importance of the spacing of the canonical and Stat3-like binding sites for formation of Stat3 tetramer on the α2-M promoter. A spacing of 5, 22, and 27 bp was prepared to test in comparison with the original oligonucleotide that has 12-bp spacing (Fig. 4). The complexes were allowed to form and “chased” with unlabeled homologues of oligonucleotides. Both 5- and 27-bp spacing allowed about equal tetrameric binding, but the α2-M-22bp oligonucleotide formed somewhat fewer complexes. The stability of the preformed DNA-protein complexes showed that the original 12-bp spacing allowed the greatest stability of formed complexes to the challenge by unlabeled oligonucleotides. The functional importance of the spacing of the two sites was further examined by using the mutated α2-M reporter genes in which the canonical Stat3 site and the Stat3-like site were separated by either 5, 22, or 27 bp in transient transfection assays. No significant differences were observed between the transcription signal of wild-type reporter gene and the mutated ones (data not shown), suggesting possibly that sufficient Stat3 dimer·dimer interaction occurs in vivo or that other proteins stabilize the interaction compared with the in vitro result. To demonstrate that both the Stat3 site and the Stat3-like site of the α2-M promoter probe were occupied by Stat3 protein, in vitro DNase I footprinting was employed. A 5′ end-labeled α2-M promoter segment (from −200 to +44) was incubated with recombinant phosphorylated wtStat3, wqStat3, and ΔntStat3 proteins. wtStat3 proteins generated two major footprints (Fig.5, regions I and II), corresponding to the Stat3 site and the Stat3-like site on the α2-M promoter. Region II, the Stat3-like site, was better protected with a higher concentration of wtStat3 proteins. However, the footprints with wqStat3 and ΔntStat3 were weaker at both sites. These results confirmed that two Stat3 sites were indeed bound to the wtStat3 proteins. Therefore we conclude that the Stat3 dimer·dimer interaction occurs on the two tandemly arranged Stat3 binding sites. We also assessed the importance of Stat3 tetramerization formation in IL-6-induced α2-M gene activation by performing transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells. The same α2-M luciferase reporter construct described in Fig. 1 was co-transfected with various expression vectors encoding c-Jun, wtStat3, and wqStat3. Although overexpression of wtStat3 potently increased the IL-6-induced activity of the reporter gene, overexpression of the wqStat3 mutant showed less IL-6 inducibility of the α2-M reporter gene (Fig. 6 A). Similar results were observed with a Stat3-sensitive synthetic promoter, 3xLy6E, which has three STAT binding sites. The cooperative activation of Stat3 and c-Jun on the α2-M gene activation was also decreased by the two mutations in the N-terminal domain of Stat3. It has been reported that the W37A Stat4 mutant failed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interferon-α stimulation, indicating the controlling effect of the N-terminal domain in Stat4 activation (20Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine the activation ability of the wqStat3, both wtStat3 and wqStat3 were expressed in 293T cells because these cells are known to have relatively low levels of endogenous Stat3 proteins. Cells expressing either wtStat3 or wqStat3 were treated with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Both wtStat3 and wqStat3 were phosphorylated on tyrosine as tested by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705) antibody (Fig.6 B). The wqStat3 also showed an indistinguishable DNA binding ability from that of wtStat3 in EMSA using32P-labeled M67 probe (Fig. 6 C), indicating the successful activation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of wqStat3 proteins. The long range aim of our studies with the α2-M enhancer is first to identify proteins that bind to specific sites in the DNA, then to seek evidence for protein-protein interaction between two or more binding proteins, and ultimately to show that such contacts are important for induction of the chromosomal α2-M gene. Toward this goal we reported previously a physical contact between Stat3 and c-Jun, the binding sites in the α2-M enhancer that had been documented by others. Mutations in two regions of Stat3 greatly inhibited the c-Jun-Stat3 interaction and in transfection experiments inhibited Stat3-driven transcription (13Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In many genes in which STAT-induced transcription occurs, there is evidence for STAT dimer-dimer interaction even though canonical binding sites are not necessarily obvious in the DNA sequence. However, it was clear from early studies (2Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) that dimer-dimer interaction did not require high affinity sites, and in fact binding of tetramers to weak binding sites produced more stable complexes than single dimers bound to a high affinity site. Wegenka et al. (21Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), studying protein interaction with the α2-M enhancer before Stat3 was defined, described DNA·protein complexes that migrated slowly (suggesting higher molecular weight) that were more prominent with increasing protein concentration. From the optimum sequence of Stat3 binding (22Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), it became clear that a canonical site for Stat3 existed in the α2-M promoter. There is in addition a nearby site that is similar to a canonical site. (This was referred to earlier as a “homology” site or STAT-like site.) We have shown in this work with purified tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type Stat3 that a complex migrating more slowly than a single STAT·DNA complex, presumably a tetrameric Stat3 complex, forms on the α2-M enhancer sequence. Although Stat3 lacking the N terminus (ΔntStat3) will bind to single STAT sites approximately as equally well as wild-type protein, the truncated protein does not form tetramers. This establishes for Stat3 what was previously shown for Stat1 and Stat4, namely that tetramer formation depends on the N terminus of the protein. Mutations in Stat3 (Trp-37/Gln-66) analogous to those introduced into Stat1 and Stat5 disrupt the interaction required for tetramerization (3John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). DNase I footprints of Stat3 bound to the α2-M enhancer sequence establish stronger interaction at the canonical site than at the Stat3-like site. Also, the wqStat3 mutation shows a weaker footprint than does wild-type protein. The natural spacing between the Stat3 canonical and Stat3-like sites is 12 bp, and this spacing gives more stable complexes than other variants. However, the spacing of both 5 and 27 bp allowed about equal tetramer formation, but the complexes were less stable when challenged with unlabeled oligonucleotide. Finally, we had earlier shown, using a 100-bp region of the α2-M enhancer, that HepG2 cells supplemented with Stat3 and c-Jun gave a higher IL-6-induced transcription signal than unsupplemented cells. In the present experiments, we show that this transcriptional cooperation depends on the tetramer interaction. We therefore conclude that in the α2-M enhancer, which appears to depend on Stat3 induction, two Stat3 dimers probably associated at the N terminus of one chain in each dimer provide maximum transcriptional stimulation. We regard this as a significant step forward toward our long range goal of defining each protein-protein interaction that occurs in a STAT-dependent enhanceosome.

Whereas treatment of the human leukemia cell line HL60 with RA results in cellular differentiation, addition of the synthetic retinoid,N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR), induces HL60 cells to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment of HL60 cells as well as other cell lines (i.e. NIH3T3 cells) with RA blocks HPR-induced cell death. In attempting to discover the underlying biochemical activities that might account for these cellular effects, we found that monodansylcadaverine (MDC), which binds to the enzyme (transamidase) active site of tissue transglutaminase (TGase), eliminated RA protection against cell death and in fact caused RA to become an apoptotic factor, suggesting that the ability of RA to protect against apoptosis is linked to the expression of active TGase. Furthermore, it was determined that expression of exogenous TGase in cells exhibited enhanced GTP binding and transamidation activities and mimicked the survival advantage imparted by RA. We tested whether the ability of this dual function enzyme to limit HPR-mediated apoptosis was a result of the ability of TGase to bind GTP and/or catalyze transamidation and found that GTP binding was sufficient for the protective effect. Moreover, excessive transamidation activity did not appear to be detrimental to cell viability. These findings, taken together with observations that the TGase is frequently up-regulated by environmental stresses, suggest that TGase may function to ensure cell survival under conditions of differentiation and cell stress.

Blood. 1984; 63: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the covalent linkage to proteins may represent a key regulatory step (2Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The TGase is especially interesting because of its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP-like traditional signaling GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) (13Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A particularly well studied example involves the α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity (most likely PLC-δ, Ref. 16Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), where it was originally shown that a ∼70–80-kDa GTP-binding protein, Gh, was responsible for coupling α1-adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (17Nakaoka H.

Various studies have also suggested that the GTP binding/GTP hydrolytic activity of the TGase is closely linked to the enzymatic transamidation activity, such that the enzyme activity is off when the TGase is in the GTP-bound but not the GDP-bound state (14Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the interplay between guanine nucleotide binding and transamidation activity remains controversial, as other studies have suggested that both GTP and GDP inhibit the enzyme (19Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that TGase activity is tightly coupled to the effects of retinoic acid (RA) in various cell types (6Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bertram J.S. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 243-262Google Scholar, 8Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

In some cases, both expression and activation of the GTP binding and transamidation activities of the TGase are stimulated by RA treatment; however, in HeLa cells we found that RA promotes the activation of the TGase without having any effect on TGase expression (20Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of RA are mediated via nuclear receptor interactions (21Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G. Lee M-O. La-Vista N. Lu X-P. Piedrafita J. Ortiz A. Salbert G. Zhang X-K. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones.

Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Six retinoid receptors have been identified and can be divided into two classes, the RARs and the RXRs (each containing α, β, and γ subtypes). All trans-retinoic acid, designated simply as RA, activates RAR-RXR heterodimers, whereas 9-cis-retinoic acid activates both RAR-RXR heterodimers and RXR homodimers. These nuclear receptors function as transcriptional activators that bind to specific response elements located in the promoters of several genes. Because of its growth inhibitory activity, RA has been examined for potential use in the treatment of human cancers. However, the natural retinoids have shown only limited activity against most cancers, which has prompted efforts to examine the effects of synthetic analogs of the retinoids. One such analog, all-trans-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (fenretinamide or HPR), has received a significant amount of attention because of its promise in the treatment of breast and prostate cancers as well as other human malignancies (23Greenwald P. Kramer B. Weed D. J. Cancer Educ. 1993; 8: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Costa A. Formelli F. Chiesa F. Decensi A. De Palo G. Veronesi U.

Although it has been suggested that HPR action is mediated via retinoid receptors (27Fanjul A. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Rideout D. Qiu J. Pfahl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22441-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it is interesting that HPR appears to be consistently associated with apoptosis, whereas RA has been reported to give rise to both cellular differentiation and apoptosis (28Kalemkerian G.P. Slusher R. Ramalingam S. Gadgeel S. Mabry M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Zou C.P. Kurie J.M. Lotan D. Zou C.C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1345-1355PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to examine the actions of RA and HPR on the leukemia cell line HL60 and the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. We show that HPR but not RA induces an apoptotic response in both cell types. Pretreatment of HL60 or NIH3T3 cells with RA affords a strong protection against HPR-induced apoptosis, and this protective effect of RA can be correlated with the expression of active TGase. The binding of an active site-directed inhibitor, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), not only eliminated the ability of RA to inhibit HPR-mediated apoptosis, but also turned RA into a potent death factor. To elucidate which aspect of TGase function is important for the survival advantage, we generated mutant forms of TGase that were defective in GTP binding, transamidation, or both activities and tested the ability to promote cell viability. Our data indicate that the GTP binding activity, rather than transamidation activity, may be crucial for the survival response of the TGase. Caspase inhibitor II (Z-DEVD-FMK) and ionomycin were purchased from CalBiochem, and caspase 7 was obtained from BD PharMingen. RA, HPR, and MDC were obtained from Sigma. The TGase monoclonal antibody was from Neomarkers, and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody was from Covance. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all other materials were from Fisher unless otherwise stated. HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum with 100 units/ml penicillin. Both cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the various treatments involving retinoids, the cells were grown to subconfluence in medium containing 10% serum, and then medium containing 1.5% serum with 5 μm RA or HPR or 50 μm MDC was added for the times indicated under “Results and Discussion.” Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% NaH3, 0.004% NaF, 1 mmNaVO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.35). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The total cell lysate (60 μg) of each sample was combined with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 7.5% acrylamide gels for resolution of each protein analyzed. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked for 1 h with TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.02% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The filters were incubated with either anti-TGase, anti-actin, or anti-HA primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBST for 2 h at room temperature, then washed three times with TBST at 5-min intervals. To detect the primary antibodies, anti-mouse or -rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 in TBST was then incubated with the filters for 1 h, followed by three TBST washes. The protein bands were visualized on x-ray film after exposing the filters to chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Photoaffinity labeling of the TGase was performed by incubating 60 μg of whole cell lysates with 3 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μm AMP-PNP for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were placed in an ice bath and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min, mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters and exposure on x-ray film. Transglutaminase activity was measured as the Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [3H]putrescine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) intoN,N-dimethylcasein. Whole cell lysates (175 μg) were added to a reaction mix consisting of 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml dimethylcasein, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8% glycerol, and 250 μm[3H]putrescine (0.5 μCi) in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min and the precipitates were washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved in 100 μl of 1 n NaOH. The rate of incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting, and the transamidation activity was expressed as fold activation over control samples. For assessment of DNA fragmentation, cell pellets of samples treated with 5 μmRA or HPR for various lengths of time were solubilized in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. To the supernatant (90 μl), 10 μl of 10% SDS and 5 μl of a 10 mg/ml stock of proteinase K were added and incubated for 3 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified from solution with phenol/chloroform and then was dissolved in TE (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA). Equal amounts of sample were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well dishes and grown in complete medium for 2–3 days. The cells were then incubated in medium containing 5 μmRA or HPR with or without 50 μm MDC for different times. The cultures were then fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei and/or blebbing. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce single amino acid residue substitutions within the GTP binding and active site domains of the TGase. A tetracycline inducible vector containing HA-tagged TGase (pTRE-WT-TGase) was used as the template for each mutagenesis reaction, and the following sets of primers were used to generate each mutant: serine 171 → cysteine (S171C), 5′-GGCTTTATCTACCAGGGCTGCGCCAAGTTCATCAAGAAC and 3′-GTTCTTGATGAACTTGGCGCAGCCCTGGTAGATAAAGCCC; serine 171 → glutamic acid (S171E), 5′-GGCTTTATCTACCAGGGCGAGGCCAAGTTCATCAAGAAC and 3′-GTTCTTGATGAACTTGGCCTCGCAGCCCTGGTAGATAAAGCCC; glycine 165 → cysteine (G165V), 5′-GTCCTTACGCAACAGTGCTTCATCTACCAAGGCTCTGTC and 3′-GACAGAGCCTTGGTAGATGAAGCACTGTTGCGTAAGGAC; and cysteine 277 → valine (C277V), 5′-GTCAAGTACGGCCAGTGCTGTCGTGTTTGCAGCGGTGGCCTGC and 3′-GCAGGCCACCGCTGCAAACACGACAGCACTGGCCGTACTTGAC. Each construct was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. The overall goal of these studies was to better understand the nature of the interplay between RA and its synthetic analog, HPR, in normal and cancer cell lines. Although it was originally suspected that these retinoids would bind common receptors and potentially influence the same signaling pathways, various studies have suggested that they in fact mediate distinct biological outcomes (28Kalemkerian G.P. Slusher R. Ramalingam S. Gadgeel S. Mabry M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Zou C.P. Kurie J.M. Lotan D. Zou C.C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1345-1355PubMed Google Scholar). This is perhaps best exemplified in the human leukemia cell line HL60, where RA and HPR elicit markedly different effects; however, various other cell lines including the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 also show striking differences between RA and HPR treatments. Fig. 1 A shows that when HL60 cells were exposed to HPR for various periods of time a strong apoptotic response was observed as gauged by nuclear condensation or blebbing. HPR-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells started to occur within 6–12 h of treatment, and nearly 95% of the cells were apoptotic by 18–24 h. To confirm that these HPR-treated cells were in fact undergoing programmed cell death, an additional apoptotic assay that tests the integrity of the genomic DNA isolated from the cells was also performed. Consistent with cells undergoing programmed cell death, cytoplasmic DNA isolated from HL60 cells treated with HPR was evident and fragmented, as indicated by a resultant smearing of the ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 1 A, inset). In contrast, treatment of HL60 cells with RA for up to 72 h resulted in no detectable cell death, verifying that the apoptotic response was specific for the synthetic retinoid and consistent with previous findings that RA causes HL60 cells to undergo differentiation rather than programmed cell death (6Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bertram J.S. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 243-262Google Scholar, 8Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

We investigated whether an additional cell type might also produce physiological outcomes similar to those observed for HL60 cells treated with the two retinoids. As seen in Fig. 1 B, NIH3T3 cells incubated with HPR also induced a cell death response, but with slower kinetics than observed in HL60 cells (compare Fig. 1, A and B). Only about 20% of the cells were apoptotic after 18 h of HPR treatment and it took 72 h of exposure to HPR to produce an apoptotic rate of ∼90%. Consistent with RA stimulation of HL60 cells, incubation of NIH3T3 cells with RA for up to 72 h did not enhance cell death. We further examined the basis of HPR-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells using inhibitors against caspases and histone deacetylase. The rationale was to determine whether this apoptotic response utilized the caspase-mediated proteolysis typically involved in apoptotic responses (30Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 31Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar), or whether HPR-induced apoptosis might also require the inhibition of gene expression mediated through the deacetylation of histones. We found that treatment of HL60 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, had no effect on HPR-stimulated DNA fragmentation, whereas addition of the caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, caused a marked reduction in DNA fragmentation (Fig.2). Thus, apparently HPR induces cell death by stimulating a signaling pathway that results in caspase activation, but not through down-regulating the expression of genes important for survival. During cell differentiation, an important question concerns how cells are able to maintain cell cycle arrest without undergoing cell death. This raises the possibility that during differentiation it is necessary to activate mechanisms that provide protection against apoptosis. Given that the two retinoids, RA and HPR, appear to input into distinct cellular programs such that RA induced differentiation while HPR elicited an apoptotic response, it was interesting to examine whether RA might be able to stimulate a cellular activity that protects against HPR-mediated cell death. Fig. 3 shows that when HL60 cells were pretreated with RA for 2 days and then exposed to HPR for various times up to 24 h, the ability of HPR to stimulate an apoptotic response as visualized by DNA fragmentation was nearly eliminated. RA exhibited a very similar protective effect against HPR-promoted apoptosis of the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and the breast cancer cell line SKBR3 (data not shown). In all cases maximal protection from HPR-induced cell death required pretreating the cells with RA for 2 days. This effect elicited by RA can be distinguished from the apoptotic effects of HPR, which occur within 6–12 h of exposure of HL60 cells to the synthetic retinoid, thereby suggesting that the protective effects by RA are not simply the outcome of competing with HPR for a common receptor and/or signaling system. Overall, these results raise the question of how the two retinoids, RA and HPR, elicit different cellular effects. There have been various suggestions that agents that induce cellular differentiation stimulate the expression of an anti-apoptotic or survival activity to ensure cell viability during cell cycle arrest. It would be expected that such an agent would be selectively expressed and/or activated by RA and not by HPR. One interesting candidate for such a protective factor is the TGase, given that increased TGase activation is an outcome of RA treatment (6Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bertram J.S. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 243-262Google Scholar, 8Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3034-3040PubMed Google Scholar, 9Piacentini M. Martinet N. Beninati S. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3790-3794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 Ashows that following the addition of RA to HL60 cells, there is a progressive increase in the TGase protein levels (lower left panel) as well as a corresponding stimulation of GTP binding activity as determined from the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP (upper panel). However, as pointed out below, RA is able to stimulate the activation of the TGase in HL60 cells through a mechanism that is distinct from simply increasing TGase expression. Both maximal TGase expression and GTP binding activity occurred 2–3 days after RA treatment. A similar experiment in which NIH3T3 cells were treated with RA yielded comparable increases in TGase expression and GTP binding activity (Fig.4 B), whereas the addition of RA to HeLa cells had only modest effects on TGase expression but markedly stimulated its GTP binding, GTP hydrolytic, and transamidation activities (20Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effects of HPR stimulation on HL60 cells were very different from those of RA. The lower right panel in Fig. 4 Ashows the results of an experiment where a 10-fold greater amount of total cellular protein was examined relative to the lower left panel so that it was possible to detect the basal levels of TGase expression in cells (i.e. in the absence of RA treatment). We see that upon treatment of HL60 cells with HPR there is a steady decline in the levels of TGase, such that ultimately no TGase protein is detected. The HPR effects occur within a shorter time period compared with those of RA and are consistent with the time course for HPR-induced apoptosis. Under these conditions the TGase shows no ability to incorporate [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 4 A,upper panel). This is even the case prior to the addition of HPR. Thus, despite a detectable level of expression, the TGase apparently exists in an inactive state in the absence of RA treatment, similar to what we had earlier observed in HeLa cells (20Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When HL60 cells were first treated with RA for 2 days and then exposed to HPR, the TGase protein levels were increased and were comparable with those observed when cells were treated with RA in the absence of HPR (Fig. 5 A). Treatment with RA prior to HPR addition also yielded a fully active TGase, as indicated by the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP (Fig.5 B). It should be noted that the HPR-induced reduction in TGase levels appears to be due to effects on TGase expression rather than the result of an HPR-mediated proteolytic degradation of the TGase, as indicated by our finding that the histone deacetylase inhibitor can reverse the effects of HPR on TGase expression (data not shown). Thus, pretreatment of cells with RA ensures proper TGase expression and activation, prior to any inhibitory effects on TGase expression that accompany HPR treatment. The selective expression and activation of the TGase by RAversus HPR caused us to consider the possibility that the TGase represents a protective factor against apoptosis. This led us to examine the consequences of using the TGase inhibitor MDC (32Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We determined that treatment of HL60 cells with 100 μm MDC eliminated any protective effects afforded by RA against HPR-mediated apoptosis and in fact caused a marked enhancement in the overall apoptotic response (Fig. 6). Moreover, we found that treatment with MDC converted RA into a potent apoptotic factor. These results suggest that RA is capable of inducing an apoptotic program, perhaps much like HPR, but that the expression and activation of the TGase affords a protective effect. Elimination of TGase activity then allows the apoptotic program to dominate. Because our data strongly imply that augmentation of TGase expression and activation by RA are required for protection from HPR-induced cell death, we then asked whether simply expressing exogenous TGase in cells (without adding RA) would be sufficient to provide a protective effect from HPR-induced apoptosis. Because HL60 cells are difficult to transfect, we decided to perform this series of experiments in NIH3T3 cells. These mouse fibroblasts are a reasonable alternative for HL60 cells because they are sensitive to HPR-mediated cell death (Fig.1 A), and RA selectively up-regulates TGase expression and activation (Fig. 4 B). We initially confirmed that the exogenously expressed TGase in NIH3T3 cells was fully functional as indicated by its ability to incorporate [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 7 A, WT TG) and catalyze transamidation, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]putrescine ontoN,N-dimethylcasein (Fig. 7 B, WT TG). It is worth noting that the nucleotide binding and enzymatic activities associated with the overexpressed TGase occur without the addition of the stimulatory factor RA. We speculate that this is a result of saturating the negative regulator(s) of TGase activities that has been proposed to function in cells (20Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Compared with the TGase-expressing cells, control cells incubated with HPR were twice as sensitive to HPR-mediated cell death (Fig. 7 C). Thus, the enhanced viability of RA-treated cells from HPR-mediated apoptosis can be largely explained by the capacity of RA to modify TGase expression and activation. Several lines of evidence have implicated the transamidation function as being necessary to produce the cellular effects associated with the TGase (34Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the nucleotide binding served primarily to modulate this enzymatic activity (14Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given that our data link TGase activity to a novel role in cells, that of being a survival factor, we decided to investigate which of the activities of the TGase elicited this response. We generated a series of point mutations in TGase (initially described by Iismaa et al., Ref. 35Iismaa S.E. Wu M-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that would be defective in nucleotide binding, transamidation activity, or both activities and tested the ability to promote cell viability. Mutant forms of the TGase that were defective in GTP binding, namely mutants S171E and G165V (Fig. 7 A), were most susceptible to HPR-induced cell death (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, those TGase forms that retained the capacity to bind nucleotide, WT TG, C277V, and S171C (Fig. 7 A), all exhibited protection form the apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 7 C). Expression of WT TGase in NIH3T3 cells resulted in a 17-fold increase in transamidation activity, whereas expression of the S171C mutant caused a 13-fold increase in the enzymatic activity, as determined by the incorporation of [3H]putrescine ontoN,N-dimethylcasein (Fig. 7 B). This is particularly interesting because chronic cross-linking activity has frequently been correlated with the induction of apoptosis (34Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), yet both WT TGase and mutant S171C display elevated transamidation activity and are resistant to the effects of HPR (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, TGase transamidation activity appears not to be essential for the prosurvival function of the molecule, because the TGase mutant C277V, which can bind GTP but cannot transamidate (Fig. 7, A andB), can limit the apoptotic response similar to that of WT TG and mutant S171C (Fig. 7 C). These findings suggest that chronic transamidation activity does not necessarily have detrimental effects on cells, and that the GTP binding activity of TGase may be sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis under certain conditions. A developing question in the use of retinoids for cancer therapy is how RA and HPR produce different cellular outcomes given that they are thought to activate a similar pool of receptors and regulate the expression of a common set of genes. We found that one difference between these two retinoids is the selective up-regulation of TGase expression and activation by RA. The changes in protein and activation levels of the TGase appear not only to account for the protective effect afforded by RA from HPR-induced apoptosis, but when activity is inhibited can convert RA into a cell death signal. Our results implicating TGase as a survival factor contradict the argument that TGase serves as an apoptotic factor in cells. Increased TGase activity has most often been correlated with the induction of programmed cell death (36Gentile V. Thomazy V. Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J.A. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and use of this protein as a strategy to manage cancer has been proposed. However, two recent reports support our findings by showing that up-regulated TGase activity did not enhance cell death of a neuronal cell line (39Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V.W. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and primary thymocytes isolated from TGase knockout mice seemed to be more sensitive to cell death (40Nanda N. Iismaa S.E. Owens W.A. Husain A. Mackay F. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20673-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We are currently performing a comprehensive analysis of TGase expression and activation states in primary tumors and testing whether TGase activity in these tumors can promote resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. Another intriguing finding was that the binding of GTP to TGase might be essential for the protective effects exhibited by TGase. To our knowledge, this is the first example that implicates the ability of the TGase to bind GTP as solely responsible for a cellular outcome. Moreover, it is interesting that MDC, which is thought to be an active-site inhibitor against transamidation, prevented RA from exhibiting protection against HPR-induced apoptosis and actually turned RA into an apoptotic factor, whereas the transamidation-defective TGase (C277V) mutant still conferred protection. This may mean that that either the GTP binding or transamidation activities of TGase are capable of providing anti-apoptotic effects, or that the binding of MDC at the transamidation active site has a negative regulatory effect on the binding of guanine nucleotides. Indeed it has been shown that guanine nucleotide binding inhibits transamidation activity (14Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and so it might be expected (through the law of microscopic reversibility) that substrate or inhibitor binding interactions at the enzyme active site negatively regulate guanine nucleotide binding and thereby prevent the anti-apoptotic effects of TGase. Taken together, our findings have now caused us to consider the possibility that the TGase may transduce a signal, similar to other G-proteins, that activates an anti-apoptotic pathway. PLC-δ could be a likely candidate because it has been shown to be activated by TGase (16Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and its activity has been linked to cell survival (41Cocco L. Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Manzoli F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We are currently determining whether PLC-δ or other signaling molecules may be activated by TGase."

It has two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs), but only one is functional for TAR binding. TRBP interacts with the interferon-induced protein kinase R (PKR) and inhibits its activity. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to map the interaction sites between the two proteins. We show that TRBP and PKR-N (178 first amino acids of PKR) interact with PKR wild type and inhibit the PKR-induced yeast growth defect in this assay. We characterized two independent PKR-binding sites in TRBP. These sites are located in each dsRBD in TRBP, indicating that PKR-TRBP interaction does not require the RNA binding activity present only in dsRBD2. TRBP and its fragments that interact with PKR reverse the PKR-induced suppression of HIV-1 long terminal repeat expression. In addition, TRBP activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat expression to a larger extent than the addition of each domain. These data suggest that TRBP activates gene expression in PKR-dependent and PKR-independent manners.

The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is regulated through a large number of cellular factors including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and SP1 (1Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the basal transcriptional activity of HIV is very low, the viral Tat protein and host proteins are utilized to increase the transcription of the viral genome. In contrast to other known trans-activators, Tat acts through an RNA target called trans-activation response (TAR) located in the R region of the LTR. TAR RNA forms a stable stem-bulge-loop structure necessary for Tat trans-activation. For its trans-activating function, Tat is physically associated with cellular kinases that phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The resulting activity is an increase of transcriptional reinitiation and elongation through C-terminal domain phosphorylation by initiating the formation of an elongation-competent transcription complex (2Gatignol A. Jeang K.-T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 209-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jeang K.-T. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Jones K.A.

Similar to other viruses, HIV-1 relies on the cellular translational machinery for the synthesis of viral proteins. Initiation is the rate-limiting step of translation that determines the efficiency of protein synthesis from mRNA (6Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). Translation initiation begins with the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) to the 40S ribosomal subunit through the formation of an eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex. Formation of this complex and the delivery of Met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosomal subunit constitute the rate-limiting step of translational initiation. Cells have evolved antiviral defenses that down-modulate protein translation in virus-infected cells. This response is mediated by the production of IFNs. IFN binding to specific receptors leads to the production of more than 250 proteins by the activation of signal transduction pathways (7Landolfo S. Gribaudo G. Angeretti A. Gariglio M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 65: 415-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). IFNα transcriptionally induces elevated cellular levels of PKR, a key cellular protein kinase (8Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J.

Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PKR is activated after binding to dsRNA through its two dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and by dimerization. Both processes involve the α-helix structure of the dsRBDs through their charged residues (binding to dsRNA) and hydrophobic side (dimerization) (10Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7009-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another basic PKR domain located just upstream of the catalytic domain is also involved in PKR dimerization (11Tan S.L. Gale M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PKR undergoes a conformational change that leads to its autophosphorylation. Once active, PKR phosphorylates its substrate, the translation initiation factor eIF2α. When phosphorylated, eIF2α blocks the ability of eIF2B to renew the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex required for protein synthesis initiation (6Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). eIF2α phosphorylation dramatically alters the efficiency and rate of translational initiation and is a critical component of antiviral and cell growth pathways (12Gale M. Tan S.L. Katze M.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 239-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the PKR antiviral pathways is illustrated by the strategies that viruses have employed to avoid the activation of PKR. These include the expression of competitive inhibitory RNAs such as the VA RNA I of adenovirus, the EBER-1 and EBER-2 RNAs of the Epstein-Bar virus, and TAR RNA of HIV (13Clarke P.A. Sharp N.A. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Gunnery S. Rice A.P. Robertson H.D. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternatively, viral proteins such as HIV Tat, vaccinia E3L and K3L, influenza NS1, reovirus ς3, and hepatitis C virus NS5A can act as either direct inhibitors of PKR or competitive substrates for phosphorylation (16Cai R.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 18-28Google Scholar), is a cellular protein that binds HIV-1 TAR RNA. Two forms of the protein, TRBP1 (originally called TRBP) and TRBP2, coexist in the cell and are encoded from two alternatively initiated isoforms of mRNA that differ at their 5′ ends. TRBP2 is 21 amino acids longer than TRBP1 (26Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 28Duarte M. Graham K.

Jeang K.-T. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 217-228PubMed Google Scholar). TRBP1 and TRBP2 belong to the family of double-stranded RNA-binding proteins with clearly defined dsRBDs (30Bass B.L. Hurst S.R.

A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). TRBPs have two dsRBDs, but only one is functional for TAR binding because of the presence of a KR-helix motif. This 15-amino acid peptide motif is the TRBP minimum TAR RNA binding motif, it destabilizes the TAR RNA structure, and binds to the upper stem/loop of TAR with high affinity (31Gatignol A. Buckler C.

Biol. 1998; 279: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TRBPs are encoded by thetarbp2 gene, which has been mapped to human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15 (36, 37). Prbp, the murine homologue of TRBP, binds the 3′ untranslated region of Prm1 protamine RNA, regulates its translation, and plays a physiological role in spermatogenesis (38Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Zhong J. Peters A.H. Lee K. Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the HIV context, TRBP acts in synergy with functional Tat to stimulate the expression of the HIV-1 LTR in human and murine cells (26Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T.

All the available data suggest that TRBP facilitates viral replication by two mechanisms: direct activation of the LTR through TAR binding and inhibition of the host antiviral mechanisms leading to unhindered translation. Although TRBP-PKR interaction has been documented between the full-length TRBP protein and the catalytically inactive PKR K296R mutant, no data are available about which regions in the proteins confer heterodimerization. In this paper, we show in a two-hybrid assay that TRBP also binds to wild-type PKR (PKRwt) and reverses its growth-inhibitory activity in yeast. This binding is mediated through each dsRBD in TRBP but is independent from the RNA binding motif of the protein. In an LTR-luciferase assay, we show that TRBP reverses the PKR-induced inhibition of expression of the HIV-1 LTR. Each dsRBD of TRBP mediates this function, but full-length TRBP has a much stronger effect on gene expression than each individual domain. The yeast indicator strains HF7c and SFY526 have been described previously (42Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar, 43Feilotter H.E.

All TRBP fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into theBamHI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3.

To verify these observations in the two-hybrid system with TRBP2 (28Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.-L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.-T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Gatignol A. Duarte M. Daviet L. Chang Y.-N. Jeang K.-T.

Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), we made fusions of the two proteins (Fig.1 A) with GAL4 BD and GAL4 AD in plasmids pGBT9 and pGADGH, respectively. TRBP2 was first tested with itself and showed a similar blue-color intensity as the positive control SNF1/SNF4 in two different yeast strains. No background was observed with a control uracil DNA glycosylase (49Selig L. Benichou S. Rogel M.E. Wu L. Vodicka M.A. Sire J. Benarous R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or no protein. This result shows a strong homodimerization for the TRBP2 protein (Fig.1 B) as observed previously for TRBP1 (41Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the strain SFY526 allowed the best coloration in the β-galactosidase assay, it was chosen in all subsequent two-hybrid assays. We next wanted to determine whether TRBP interacts with an intact PKR protein (PKRwt) and which domain of the protein is involved in the interaction. We constructed plasmids in which PKRwt, PKR expressing the first 178 amino acids (PKR-N), and PKR amino acids 179–551 (PKR-C) are fused to the BD or the AD of Gal4 (shown in Fig. 1 A). The results show that TRBP2 interacted with PKR-N and not with PKR-C (Fig.1 C), which extended previous results involving the first 184 amino acids (41Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These two individual PKR fragments do not have the catalytic activity of PKR and do not exhibit toxicity when expressed in yeast. In contrast, PKRwt is known to inhibit yeast growth through the phosphorylation of the yeast homologue for eIF2α (52Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For this reason, it has not been used previously by others in two-hybrid interactions. Accordingly, we too observed a strong growth inhibition when we used PKRwt on both pGBT11 and pGAD plasmids in the two-hybrid assay with, concomitantly, no detection of β-galactosidase activity. This led us to postulate that PKRwt could be useful in the two-hybrid assay, because only functionally relevant partners for PKR would be able to inhibit the kinase activity strongly and thus allow cell growth, interaction, and development of β-galactosidase expression. Indeed, transfection of TRBP2-Gal4 BD together with PKR-Gal4 AD in this assay reveals an interaction between the two proteins (Fig.1 C). Interaction in the opposite fusion combination could not be tested, because each transfection with PKR-Gal4 BD-expressing vector resulted in an inhibition of the yeast cell growth. Taken together, our results indicate that TRBP interacts with PKRwt through its N-terminal moiety (PKR-N, 178 residues). This binding inhibits PKR strongly and reverses its growth inhibitory activity in yeast. PKR-N contains the two dsRBDs of PKR. Therefore, its interaction with TRBP occurs through these domains. TRBP has two dsRBDs, and we wanted to determine whether similar regions were involved in its dimerization. We performed a series of deletions in the TRBP protein, which excluded dsRBD1 (fragment A), dsRBD2 (fragment B), or the C-terminal part (fragment C). Each protein was called by the fragments that it has conserved (see AB, AC, and BC in Fig.1 A). We coexpressed combinations of each mutant and the full-length protein in yeast and performed two-hybrid assays. All TRBP-deleted proteins interacted with the full-length protein and each other, suggesting that two or more TRBP fragments are involved in the homodimerization (Table I).Table IAll TRBP deletion mutants homodimerize and interact with each otherTRBPTR-ABTR-ACTR-BCSNF4TRBP++++−TR-AB++++−TR-AC++++−TR-BC++++−SNF1−−−−+Two-hybrid assays using TRBP, TR-AB, TR-AC, and TR-BC in pGBT9 (vertical lane) and in pGADGH (horizontal lane). + indicates a positive β-galactosidase expression.

SNF1 and SNF4 represent the positive (bottom right) and negative controls. Independent transfections and assays were performed at least three times. These TRBP-deleted proteins were next assayed for their interaction with PKR-N and PKRwt for interaction and inhibition. Each deleted protein interacted with PKR-N in a similar profile as that with TRBP (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that TRBP-PKR interactions are also mediated through at least two independent domains in TRBP. These TRBP proteins were also tested for their interaction with PKRwt (Fig. 2 B). In this case, TRBP, TR-AB, TR-AC, and PKR-N could interact and inhibit PKR. The absence of interaction with TR-BC suggests an unfavorable folding that decreases the affinity of the protein with PKR. These results point out that PKR-N has a transdominant phenotype on PKR similar to the inhibitory effect of TRBP (Fig. 2 B). To determine which fragments in TRBP are involved in the dimerization, we constructed plasmids that express each of fragments A, B, and C (Fig.1 A) fused to Gal4-BD, and we tested them for their interaction with TRBP2, PKR-N, and PKRwt. Fragments A and B, which encompass dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, respectively, interacted with TRBP2 and PKR-N. Fragment C did not interact with any protein. In addition, fragment B showed an interaction with PKRwt, which indicates that, in contrast to fragment A, it has a strong inhibitory effect on PKR (Fig.3). Fragments A, B, and C were also assayed when fused to the Gal4 AD. They showed similar results except that TR-B-Gal4 AD inhibited yeast growth, which prevented the testing of its inhibition of PKR (data not shown). Because TRBP and PKR are both dsRNA-binding proteins, the interaction between the two proteins could be either direct or via an RNA substrate. We have shown previously that TRBP dsRBD2 harbors the main determinant for TAR RNA binding through a KR-helix motif, whereas dsRBD1 do not bind RNA significantly (34Daviet L. Erard M. Dorin D. Duarte M. Vaquero C. Gatignol A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2419-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The binding of both fragment A (including dsRBD1) and B (including dsRBD2) to TRBP and PKR shows that an RNA binding activity is not required for the interaction. To further define if the regions involved in the dimerization are located strictly within the dsRBDs, smaller domains were generated in fusion with the Gal4 BD. In a two-hybrid assay, fragments K and H representing strictly dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, respectively, interacted with TRBP and PKR-N but did not inhibit PKRwt. This suggests that the interaction of the smallest component of the dsRBD could bind PKR but in a manner that did not inhibit the activation of PKR. (Fig. 3). All together these data indicate that the TRBP has independent dimerization determinants located in each dsRBD. The interaction is independent from the KR-helix RNA binding motif, which is not present in TRBP dsRBD1. However, the inhibition of PKRwt by TRBP fragment B, but not H, shows that either a higher affinity interaction or a more intimate interaction is required to block the activation of PKR by TRBP (Fig.3). PKR influences gene expression by two main mechanisms that result in translational inhibition through the phosphorylation of eIF2α and transcriptional activation through the nuclear factor κB pathway. The first mechanism depends on the kinase activity (53Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), whereas the second one occurs by a kinase-independent mechanism (54Bonnet M.C. Weil R. Dam E. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E.F. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp40 likely interact with a wide variety of polypeptides, and thus their involvement in the folding processes is believed to be of a general and universal nature. Another major molecular chaperone, Hsp90, appears to be more specific in terms of “client” selection and has been shown to interact mainly with proteins involved in transcription regulation and signal transduction pathways, such as steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases (4Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 5Caplan A.J.

Apparently Hsp90 stabilizes these proteins and keeps them in a conformation amenable to activation under appropriate conditions. Although the extent of Hsp90 involvement in the general folding scheme of cytosolic proteins remains unclear, it has been recently suggested, from studies onDrosophila, that Hsp90 plays a major role in morphological evolution (9Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). It was proposed that Hsp90 normally suppresses morphogenic variations that become manifest upon Hsp90 impairment, leading to abrupt evolutionary changes. Although it is generally accepted that Hsp90 coordinates with other chaperones to promote the folding and assembly of the target protein by a binding and release mechanism, precisely how these processes are regulated remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that assembly of the glucocorticoid receptor-Hsp90 complex involves the sequential involvement of Hsp70 and Hsp90, both being ATP-dependent events (10Morishima Y. Murphy P.J. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). That ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential for Hsp90 function was also demonstrated using the progesterone receptor (11Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). ATP binding apparently also results in conformational changes in Hsp90 concomitant with its association with the cochaperone p23 (4Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Another less well studied phenomenon relates to Hsp90 phosphorylation, which may represent yet another level of regulation of Hsp90 function. Hsp90 can be phosphorylated in vitro at two serine residues by casein kinase II (12Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (a): 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at two threonine residues by DNA-dependent protein kinase (13Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (b): 17275-17280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp90 was shown to enhance the kinase activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase but only after prior phosphorylation of Hsp90 by casein kinase II (14Szyszka R. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In another study, treatment of cells with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid led to hyperphosphorylation of Hsp90 and decreased association between Hsp90 and pp60v-src, suggesting a link between Hsp90 phosphorylation and target protein interaction (15Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The role of Hsp90 in the folding of newly synthesized protein has not been extensively probed. Hartson et al. (16Hartson S.D. Ottinger E.A. Huang W. Barany G. Burn P. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8475-8482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) studied the folding of the lymphoid cell kinase p56lck translated in vitro and demonstrated the association of Hsp90 with newly synthesized p56lck molecules. It was further revealed that although the Src homology 2 domain folds independently of Hsp90, folding of the catalytic domain (C-terminal to the Src homology 2 domain) is Hsp90-dependent. Subsequent phosphorylation at the C-terminal domain of p56lck correlated with stabilization of the kinase, which is no longer associated with Hsp90. Another study using the heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase translated in vitro shows that Hsp90 plays an obligatory role in this kinase acquiring and maintaining a conformation that is competent for transformation into an aggregation-resistant activable kinase (17Uma S. Hartson S.D. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11648-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The in vitro translation system has also been used extensively in our laboratory to reveal the mechanisms of folding and assembly of the reovirus cell attachment protein ς1, a trimeric protein positioned at the 12 vertices of the icosahedral virion (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol.

The ς1 trimer is highly asymmetric, with an N-terminal fibrous tail that is anchored to the virion and a C-terminal globular head that interacts with the cell receptor (23Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 246-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yeung M.C. Lim D. Duncan R. Shahrabadi M.S. Cashdollar L.W. Lee P.W.K.

Evidence fromin vitro translation studies has revealed that these two structurally distinct domains are generated by separate trimerization events (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fibrous tail is highly α-helical and contains an extended heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, endowing this region with the intrinsic propensity to form a triple coiled-coil. During ς1 biogenesis, assembly of three neighboring nascent chains occurs cotranslationally (i.e. on the polysome) at the N terminus (19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This process does not involve any chaperones or ATP and results in the generation of a loose triple coiled-coil. As the triplex moves down the polysome, chaperones (e.g. Hsp70) begin to interact with the emerging residues of the elongating C termini, preventing their misfolding and aggregation. Protein ς1 leaves the polysome as a partially assembled trimer with some chaperones attached to the unassembled C termini. This type of ς1 is known as the “unstable hydra form” because it migrates as monomers even under “nondissociating” conditions (without boiling) in SDS-PAGE1 (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequent ATP-dependent release of chaperones presumably provides the opportunity for the loose coiled-coil to quickly snap together (tightening the coiled-coil), whereas the remaining portions of the three C termini are available for continued interaction with chaperones. This structure, with a stably assembled N terminus and an unassembled C terminus, is called “stable hydra form,” and it migrates as a retarded trimer in SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions. Further ATP-dependent release and rebinding of chaperones leads to global assembly and folding of the C terminus, generating mature ς1 with the characteristic lollipop-shaped structure (called the “mature compact form”), which migrates as an unretarded trimer in SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions. We have proposed that the involvement of two mechanistically distinct oligomerization events for the same molecule, one cotranslational and one posttranslational, may represent a common approach to the generation of oligomeric proteins in the cytosol (19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our previous demonstration that Hsp90 is involved in the posttranslational assembly of the ς1 globular head (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has led us to question the possible role of Hsp90 phosphorylation in this process. In the present study, we demonstrate that Hsp90 phosphorylation occurs during the posttranslational maturation of ς1 and is coupled to the assembly of the globular head. However, only the unphosphorylated form and not the phosphorylated form of Hsp90 is complexed with immature ς1, suggesting that Hsp90 phosphorylation is linked to the release of the chaperone from the target protein. Inhibiting this release using the benzoquinone ansamycin, geldanamycin (GA), also abrogates Hsp90 phosphorylation. These observations have led us to propose that Hsp90 phosphorylation is linked to its chaperoning function. The plasmids encoding the full-length and various truncated ς1 products have been described previously (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Duncan R. Horne D. Strong J.E. Leone G. Pon R.T. Yeung M.C. Lee P.W.K. Virology. 1991; 182: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All transcripts were generatedin vitro using the MEGAscriptTM Transcription Kit (Ambion) for the Sp6 polymerase promoter. A typical transcription reaction involved incubation of 1 µg of linearized plasmid DNA with the prescribed contents of the Ambion Transcription Kit (total final volume of 20 µl) for 5 h at 37 °C. The mRNA product was isolated by LiCl precipitation followed by cleanup with the Bio101, Inc. RNaid Kit. The purified mRNA was then resuspended in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of ∼0.5 µg/µl and stored at −70 °C for future use. Transcripts were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Typically, for analysis of translation products, 0.5–1.0 µg of mRNA was incubated at 37 °C with 7 µCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 µl of 1.0 mm methionine minus amino acids (Promega), and 20 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) for the duration described in the figure legends. Typically, translation was carried out for 7–9 min at 37 °C in prewarmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate. These lysates may or may not have been supplemented with [35S]methionine, depending upon the experiment (see the figure legends). Two microliters of [γ-32P]ATP was then added to each reaction (final radio-specific activity, 2 µCi/µl), and incubation was continued for the indicated times. For posttranslational chase experiments, translation was halted by either centrifugation (to pellet ribosomes) or addition of cyclohexamide (final concentration, 30 µg/ml). [γ-32P]ATP was then added, and the reactions were incubated further at 37 °C for the periods described in the figure legends. The reactions were routinely supplemented with the 20 mm leupeptin (Sigma) as protease inhibitor. Geldanamycin was prepared as a stock solution of 175 µm in 20% Me2SO, which was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 7 µm at the onset of the chase (unless stated otherwise in figure legends). Purified bovine Hsp90 was obtained from Stressgen Inc. Rabbit Hsp90 was partially purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the protocol of Iannotti et al. (28Iannotti A.M. Rabideau D.A. Dougherty J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Labeling of bovine Hsp90 was carried out by incubating 5 µg of protein in 35 µl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium metabisulfate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 7 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 unit of casein kinase II for 15 min at 37 °C. The partially purified preparation of rabbit Hsp90 protein was similarly labeled but in the absence of added casein kinase II. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed using the protocol of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). 10% SDS-PAGE was used in all experiments. The sample was incubated in protein sample buffer (final concentration, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 30 min on ice (nondissociating conditions) or, alternatively, boiled for 5 min (dissociating conditions) before SDS-PAGE. Nondissociating SDS-PAGE was routinely used to identify the three species of ς1 (unstable hydra form, stable hydra form, and mature compact form) present in the reactions (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol.

The 3G3 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the full-length ς1 protein and the N-terminal half of ς1 have been described previously (27Duncan R. Horne D. Strong J.E. Leone G. Pon R.T. Yeung M.C. Lee P.W.K. Virology. 1991; 182: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out on in vitrotranslations that were performed as outlined above. Typically, translation reactions were arrested by the addition of 5 volumes of TEM buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm ammonium molybdate, 50 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate (in the case of phosphorylation reactions). To this was added the primary antibody at a dilution of between 1:35 and 1:150, as empirically determined for each antibody. For primary antibodies of the IgG class (anti-ς1 FL, anti-N ς1, H90-10), the samples were incubated on ice for 1 h, and 20 µl of protein-A acrylic beads (Sigma) preswollen in TEM buffer was then added. For immunoprecipitations using the 3G3 antibody (IgM class), the protein A acrylic beads were preadsorbed on ice for 1 h with IgM µ chain-specific rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno-research) prior to addition to the diluted lysate. After incubation for an additional 30 min on ice, the samples were microcentrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with ice-cold TEM buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate. The pellets were then resuspended in protein sample buffer, kept on ice for 30 min (nondissociating conditions) or boiled for 5 min (dissociating conditions) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We have previously shown that Hsp90 interacts with the C-terminal half of protein ς1 and that it is required for ς1 maturation (i.e. assembly of the C-terminal globular head) (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 is a known phosphoprotein, we decided to investigate the phosphorylation status of Hsp90 during ς1 assembly. To this end, full-length ς1 was translated (for 15 min) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reactions were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibody, 3G3. At the time point chosen for immunoprecipitation, prior studies have shown that the majority of the ς1 protein has trimerized within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a subpopulation has progressed to the mature form that has also folded within the C-terminal globular domain (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of the immune pellet by SDS-PAGE revealed that a protein migrating at the ∼86-kDa position was phosphorylated (Fig. 1A,left lane). In contrast, immunoprecipitates from a translation reaction of a truncated ς1 (mutant d294) representing the N-terminal one-third of the protein, which does not associate with Hsp90 (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), did not contain a 32P-labeled 86-kDa protein (Fig. 1 A, right lane). This demonstrates that phosphorylation of the 86-kDa protein (p86) is ς1 C terminus-dependent and not a by-product of translation events. Comparison of the migration rate of phospho-p86 with that of rabbit phospho-Hsp90 and bovine phospho-Hsp90 (both precipitable with 3G3) reveals that the three proteins have identical apparent molecular masses (Fig. 1 B). These experiments therefore suggest that p86 is likely Hsp90 and is referred to as Hsp90 henceforth. We previously showed that assembly of the C-terminal globular head of ς1 occurs posttranslationally (19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that this process involves Hsp90 (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It would therefore be of interest to see whether phosphorylation of Hsp90 is also a posttranslational event. To this end, ς1 mRNA was translated only long enough to generate immature trimers. These molecules have been previously characterized as the earliest posttranslational folding intermediate of ς1 and possess loosely wound trimeric N termini and unfolded C termini (previously designated the unstable hydra form) (20Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At least three chaperones are associated with these structures: Hsp90, p23, and Hsp70 (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reactions were then centrifuged at high speed to pellet polysomes, thereby preventing further translation. The supernatants, now containing only posttranslational complexes of ς1 immature trimers, were incubated further at 37 °C with [γ-32P]ATP to promote further folding of the ς1 trimers (i.e. assembly of the C-terminal head). The lysates were then removed at various times, diluted with buffer, and immunoprecipitated using the 3G3 antibody against Hsp90. The results (Fig. 2) show that phosphorylation of Hsp90 occurred to a significant degree during further folding of the full-length ς1 but was not detectable for the C-terminal truncation mutant d294 (control), although comparable amounts of the two polypeptides were synthesized in these reactions (not shown). Similar results were obtained when cyclohexamide was used to halt translation reactions (data not shown). These results therefore suggest that phosphorylation of Hsp90 is a posttranslational event and is linked to ς1 C-terminal assembly. However, they provide no information as to whether Hsp90 phosphorylation occurs only when the target protein is folded correctly or whether interaction of Hsp90 with target sites alone is enough to trigger phosphorylation, even in the absence of maturation folding of the target protein. If binding to the target protein alone was sufficient to trigger Hsp90 phosphorylation, then ς1 mutants that contained a binding domain for Hsp90 but that could not properly fold should also trigger this phosphorylation. On the other hand, if phosphorylation was folding-dependent, then these mutants should be incapable of inducing Hsp90 phosphorylation. To resolve this issue, we used both N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of ς1. The N-terminal deletion mutants included dI and dI,II (see schematic in Fig.3A), both of which lack the coiled-coil trimerization domain and therefore do not trimerize (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have shown that N-terminal trimerization is a prerequisite for assembly of the C-terminal globular head (18Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, because both mutants contain the C-terminal half of ς1, they are nonetheless capable of interacting with Hsp90 (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For C-terminal deletion mutants, we examined d30, d90 (lacking the C-terminal 30 and 90 residues, respectively; however, both still contain Hsp90 binding sites (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), and d294, which contains no Hsp90-binding sites as negative control. All three C-terminal deletion mutants can trimerize within their N-terminal coiled-coil domains but fail to fold within vestigial regions C-terminal to it. We first tested for Hsp90 association with these two families of truncation mutants by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine- and [γ-32P]ATP-labeled reaction mixtures with the 3G3 antibody. (The reactions were also immunoprecipitated with an anti-ς1 antibody to ensure that all ς1 constructs were expressed at comparable levels; Fig. 3 B,left panel.) Immunoprecipitation with the 3G3 antibody (Fig.3 B, right panel) revealed that all nascent proteins except d294 were associated with Hsp90. We then examined the ability of each product to trigger phosphorylation of Hsp90 in these same reactions by analyzing 32P-labeled Hsp90 precipitable with 3G3. The results (Fig. 3 C) show that with the exception of d294, all the deletion mutants were able to trigger Hsp90 phosphorylation to at least the same degree as FL ς1. Thus the ability of these mutants to induce phosphorylation directly correlates with their ability to bind Hsp90, demonstrating that phosphorylation of Hsp90 is dependent on Hsp90/target protein interaction alone and not on the maturation (proper folding) of the target protein. It was of interest to determine whether the phosphorylated form of Hsp90 was in association with or free from the target protein. To this end, we performed coprecipitation experiments in which ς1 folding reactions labeled with [35S]methionine and [γ-32P]ATP were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody (anti-N) specific for the N terminus of all populations of ς1 (both mature and immature forms). This antibody does not interfere with chaperone interaction with the C-terminal domain of ς1. The results (Fig. 4A) reveal that anti-N precipitated ς1 but did not coprecipitate phospho-Hsp90 (comparelane 1 with lane 2), suggesting no association between these two proteins. On the other hand, the 3G3 antibody precipitated both phospho-Hsp90 and ς1 (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). Thus 3G3 reacted with both phosphorylated Hsp90 that was not associated with ς1 and unphosphorylated Hsp90 that was ς1-associated. This was confirmed using another anti-Hsp90 antibody, H90-10, which precipitated ς1, but not phospho-Hsp90 (Fig.4 B). Preclearing the reactions using the H90-10 antibody effectively removed the Hsp90·ς1 complex while leaving behind phospho-Hsp90 precipitable by 3G3 (Fig. 4 C). Collectively, these results suggest that ς1-associated Hsp90 is unphosphorylated and that phosphorylation of Hsp90 is coupled to its release from the target protein. If phosphorylation of Hsp90 is indeed linked to its release from ς1, then blocking this release should abrogate Hsp90 phosphorylation. In a previous study we showed that treatment of ς1 folding reaction with the Hsp90 binding drug GA blocked maturation of the ς1 trimer at a late stage intermediate (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that in the presence of GA, ς1 remains associated with Hsp90. Thus GA either prevents release of Hsp90 from the ς1·Hsp90 complex or stabilizes Hsp90/ς1 interactions concomitant with abrogation of ς1 folding. In view of the above observations regarding Hsp90 phosphorylation, one would expect that GA would block Hsp90 phosphorylation. The results (Fig.5) show that indeed, when used at a concentration that blocked formation of the mature compact form of ς1 (Fig. 5 A), GA effectively prevented Hsp90 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). This experiment therefore demonstrates that Hsp90 phosphorylation is coupled to its release from the target protein, which may represent a major regulatory mechanism for the proper assembly and/or folding of the target protein. Although it has been known for some time that Hsp90 is a phosphoprotein and that it can be phosphorylated under certain in vitro conditions, the significance of this phosphorylation event in Hsp90 function is entirely unknown. In the present study, we investigate the possibility that Hsp90 phosphorylation is linked to its chaperoning function, specifically in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptides. We show that Hsp90 is phosphorylated during thein vitro biogenesis of the reovirus attachment protein ς1 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This phosphorylation is not detectable when the N-terminal portion of ς1 is translated and is strictly dependent on the presence of the C-terminal portion of the protein. This is consistent with our previous demonstration that the N-terminal fibrous tail of ς1 trimerizes in a chaperone/ATP-independent manner, whereas formation of the C-terminal globular head requires both chaperones (including Hsp90) and ATP. Interestingly, the phosphorylated form of Hsp90 is not associated with ς1, suggesting that Hsp90 phosphorylation is linked to release of the chaperone from the target protein. Support for this notion has come from the demonstration that GA, which inhibits the release of Hsp90 from ς1, also blocks Hsp90 phosphorylation. These observations have led us to suggest that Hsp90 phosphorylation is part of the Hsp90 cycling mechanism and likely plays an important role in its chaperoning function. A most interesting observation from our present study is that the C terminus of ς1, when translated as a truncated protein and therefore unable to undergo assembly (i.e. trimerization), can also trigger Hsp90 phosphorylation. This suggests that Hsp90 phosphorylation is strictly dependent on the capacity of the target protein to interact with Hsp90 and not on proper folding of the target protein or its potential to do so. Based on the current notion that Hsp90 functions by a binding and release mechanism and in view of our present demonstration that Hsp90 phosphorylation is accompanied by release of the chaperone from the target protein, one could further deduce that even in the case of misfolded proteins, binding and release of Hsp90 occurs normally. The corollary of such a scenario would be that compared with full-length wild type ς1, which can form a functional globular head, mutants that possess Hsp90 binding sites but that cannot properly assemble should generate more phosphorylated Hsp90 because the end point could never be achieved. Preliminary data (not shown) from our laboratory appear to support this notion. Additionally, our demonstration that Hsp90 bound to ς1 is not phosphorylated suggests that only unphosphorylated Hsp90 is capable of making the initial contact with the target, although the possibility of phospho-Hsp90 being quickly dephosphorylated upon interaction with ς1 cannot be ruled out at present. The target-bound Hsp90 would remain unphosphorylated, and its subsequent release from the target would be coupled to (or triggered by) its phosphorylation. A schematic of such a model is presented in Fig. 6. Although the universality of such a mechanism remains to be seen, it is interesting to note that the Hsp90-pp60v-srcchaperone complex in v-src-transfected cells is destabilized by the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and that this is accompanied by a drastic increase in Hsp90 phosphorylation (15Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here again, binding and release from the substrate appears to be coupled to Hsp90 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. The identity of the kinase involved in ς1-mediated Hsp90 phosphorylation is unknown at present; it can be an endogenous kinase or even Hsp90 itself (i.e. autophosphorylation). So far we have not been able to demonstrate the involvement of an endogenous kinase using a variety of kinase inhibitors including a specific inhibitor for casein kinase II. None of the inhibitors had any negative effect either on folding of the target protein or phosphorylation of Hsp90 (data not shown). Because autophosphorylation activity of cytosolic Hsp90 and its ER counterpart has been reported to be insensitive to a wide spectrum of kinase inhibitors, it is likely that Hsp90 autophosphorylation plays a role here. The exact site(s) on Hsp90 that is phosphorylated in this process is presently unknown and is under investigation. Neither is it known whether Hsp90 phosphorylation is linked to its ATP binding capacity and/or its ATPase activity. Recent studies have shown that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, reduces the affinity of Hsp90 for hydrophobic residues (11Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to see whether phosphorylated Hsp90 also contains bound ATP or whether any Hsp90-bound ATP is used for the phosphorylation event. Although the possible involvement of other chaperones in ς1-induced Hsp90 phosphorylation was not probed in the present study, it is likely that they actively participate in this process. We have previously demonstrated that assembly of the C-terminal globular head of ς1 requires at least two other chaperones: Hsp70 and p23 (21Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent evidence (data not shown) from our laboratory suggests that Hsp40 and p60/Hop/Sti1 are also involved. Antibodies against each of these chaperones can precipitate immature forms of ς1. However, only the anti-p23 antibody can also precipitate phosphorylated Hsp90, suggesting that p23 remains associated with the released Hsp90. This association is not observed in the presence of GA, previously shown to prevent the release of Hsp90 from ς1 while promoting the release of p23 from the ς1-chaperone complex. This has provided yet another piece of supportive evidence for the release of Hsp90 from the substrate being associated with Hsp90 phosphorylation. Overall, the data presented in this study are in agreement with a model wherein Hsp90 phosphorylation is intimately linked to its chaperoning function. It also appears that this phosphorylation is not necessarily accompanied by correct folding of the substrate because binding and release of Hsp90 occurs normally for mutant targets and perhaps even more efficiently than for the wild type target because the end point (generation of a properly folded final product) can never be achieved. It remains to be seen whether Hsp90 phosphorylation is coupled to the ATP binding and ATPase activity of Hsp90. However, considering the highly coordinated nature of chaperone-mediated protein folding, this is most likely the case. It also seems safe to assume that other chaperones are also actively involved in this process. Clearly other systems (e.g. steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases) will need to be probed; the demonstration that Hsp90 phosphorylation also occurs in these systems would provide further support for the notion that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation represents a key regulatory mechanism for chaperone function.

Pathological examinations have demonstrated that one of the key features is the presence of amyloid plaques associated with neuritic degeneration. Senile plaques are composed predominantly of a 40–42-residue peptide, amyloid-β (Aβ40/42). The development of Alzheimer's disease pathology has been proposed to be the result of Aβ1 deposition in association with membrane structures. Recent studies have demonstrated that plaque formation may be initiated in a plasma membrane form (3Yamaguchi H. Maat-Schieman M.L.C. van Duinen S.G. Prins F.A. Neeskens P. Natte R. Roos R.A.C. J.

The presence of Aβ in distinct compartments and the proposal that lipid association is important for both neurotoxicity and fibrillogenesis suggest that the lipid composition and characteristics of these compartments may play vital roles in the disease process. Previous studies (15Yang A.J. Chandswangbhuvana D. Margol L. Glabe C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Ditaranto K. Tekirian T.L. Yang A.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 8: 19-31Google Scholar) have demonstrated accumulation of Aβ42 in lysosomal compartments that results in membrane damage as shown by release of lysosomal hydrolases and the lysosomal specific dye acridine orange. Furthermore, Aβ-synaptic plasma membrane interactions demonstrate that Aβ has a fluidizing effect on membrane structure as a result of Aβ insertion into the fatty acyl chain region of the bilayer (17Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Wood W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The role of proteins associated with synaptic plasma membranes could not be distinguished from Aβ-lipid interactions alone in this study. Therefore, we undertook the examination of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence of bilayers formed from lipids isolated from post-mortem human cortical gray matter. We chose to evaluate the membranes involved in both the production of Aβ, Golgi and endosomal, and Aβ pathology, plasma and lysosomal membranes. In order to distinguish between Aβ lipid and Aβ protein interactions in these compartments, we extracted the lipid component and used this as our model membranes. The effects of Aβ were examined as a consequence of sequence, structure, and concentration, all of which are factors affecting Aβ assembly and neurotoxicity. In order to address potential mechanisms to help explain the pathological findings, we examined the ability of these membranes to facilitate Aβ40/42 assembly into amyloid fibers by electron microscopy. Changes in the membrane physical characteristics as a result of Aβ interactions were followed by fluorescence spectroscopy using environment-specific probes. Aβ40/42, Aβ-(1–28) were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry by the Hospital for Sick Children's Biotechnology Center (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). They were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 μBondapak column. Aβ peptides were initially dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich), to ensure that the peptide remained monomeric and free of fibril seeds, diluted in distilled H2O, and immediately lyophilized (18Jao S.-C. Ma K. Talafous J. Orlando R. Zagorski M.G. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1997; 4: 240-252Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides were then dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 40% trifluoroethanol (Aldrich) in distilled H2O and stored at −20 °C until use. Bee venom mellitin was used as a control peptide (Sigma). All cellular membranes were isolated from post-mortem human gray matter of five male control subjects with post-mortem intervals of less than 15 h. The male subjects ranged in age from 76 to 80 years without documented signs of clinical dementia. The cause of death in all cases was heart failure.

Lipids were extracted from each membrane fraction using chloroform:methanol (2:1) extraction and subsequent concentration under a stream of N2. The samples were stored at −20 °C until use. Phospholipid concentration in all samples was determined using the Bartlett assay (23Bartlett G.R. Biochemistry. 1959; 342: 466-468Google Scholar), and cholesterol concentration was determined using the Amplex red assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Aβ40/42 peptides were incubated in the presence and absence of total brain lipid extract bilayers at a final peptide concentration of 100 μg/ml. The Aβ to lipid ratio was maintained at 1:20 (by weight). For negative stain electron microscopy, carbon-coated pioloform grids were floated on aqueous solutions of peptides. After the grids were blotted and air-dried, the samples were stained with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid and examined on a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope operated at 75 kV (29McLaurin J. Franklin T.

Anisotropy experiments were performed on a PTI fluorimeter equipped with manual polarizers as described previously (24Van Blitterswijk W.J. Hoeven R.P. Van Der Meer B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 644: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 360 and 425 nm with a slit width of 1 and 4 nm, respectively. Our system was initially calibrated using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in mineral oil, which should give an anisotropy equal to 1. The g factor was calculated using horizontally polarized excitation and subsequent comparison of the horizontal and vertical emissions, which for our machine is 0.883. Lipid vesicles were diluted to 250 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 20–30 min in the presence and absence of Aβ, and then subsequently incubated for a further 30 min with DPH at a 1:500 probe:lipid ratio. Fluorescence intensity was measured with the excitation polarizer in the vertical position and the analyzing emission polarizer in the vertical (IVV) and horizontal (IVH) positions; and anisotropy,r, was calculated using Equation 1, r=IVV−gIVHIVV+2gIVHEquation 1 Lipid vesicles in the absence of DPH were measured in order to evaluate the effect of light scattering on our measurements. Poly-l-lysine and bovine serum albumin were used as negative controls for the anisotropy studies. Steady state excitation and emission spectra were collected on the PTI fluorimeter. Laurdan (Molecular Probes) was added to preformed lipid vesicles in the presence and absence of Aβ at a 500:1 lipid:probe ratio. The laurdan generalized polarization (GP) parameter as developed by Parasassi et al. (25Parasassi T. DeStasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) is calculated as follows. The emission GP parameter is given by Equation 2.GPem=I400nm−I340nmI400nm+I340nmEquation 2 where I400 nm andI340 nm are the fluorescence intensities measured at all emission wavelengths within 420 and 520 nm.

N-ε-Dansyl-l-lysine (DL, Molecular Probes) was incorporated into lipid vesicles in the presence and absence of Aβ. The fluorescence spectra of DL were evaluated after 30 min of incubation at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 335 nm and emission scan monitored between 380 and 580 nm inclusive. The DL to lipid ratio was maintained at 1:500 (26Epand R.M. Leon B.T.-C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Merocyanine 540 (MC540, Molecular Probes) absorption spectra were obtained at room temperature on a Beckman spectra DU530. The dye was added to preformed vesicles at a probe:lipid ratio of 1:500 (27Luzardo M.D.C. Bernik D.L. Pazos I.F. Figueroa S. Lanio M.E. Verez V. Disalvo E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Final MC540 molar concentration in the cuvette was 21.3 × 10−6m. Absorption spectra were obtained between 400 and 600 nm with 1-nm steps. The lipid-alone base line in the absence of MC540 was subtracted from all spectra, and the corresponding spectra are shown in Equation 4, [monomer]=A−[ɛD×C/2]ɛm−ɛD/2[dimer]=(C−[monomer])2Equation 4 and were then corrected by referring the absorbances at 600 nm to 0. After this correction, the absorbance values at 569 nm were used to calculate the dimerization constant (Kd(app)) as by Bernik and Disalvo (28Bernik D.L. Disalvo E.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 82: 111-123Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), see Equation 5.Kapp=[dimer][monomer]2Equation 5 where A is the absorbance at 569 nm, ε is the constant for MC540 dimer or monomer at the given wavelength, εm = 1.511 × 105 and εD = 5400, and C is the final MC540 concentration. Lipid bilayers have been shown to affect the assembly of Aβ peptides into amyloid fibers (29McLaurin J. Franklin T. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4506-4515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Choo-Smith L.P. Surewicz W.K.

In order to determine if Aβ interactions with different cellular membranes affects fibrillogenesis, we examined Aβ structural characteristics in the presence of vesicles formed from Golgi, plasma, lysosomal and endosomal lipids by negative stain electron microscopy. In the absence of lipid, Aβ assembles into long fibers of varying length, 350–430 Å, with a characteristic helical twist of 100 Å (Fig. 1 A). These fibers demonstrated varying extent of lateral aggregation of fibers into larger bundles, from 50 Å representing single fibers to 200-Å diameter bundles. In the presence of plasma lipid vesicles, Aβ assembled into fiber bundles along the surface of the bilayer (Fig.1 B). Aβ fibers were not found on the surface of the bilayers nor in areas devoid of lipid vesicles, suggesting that Aβ assembly was driven as a result of interaction with the lipid surface. These results are similar to those that we have reported previously for Aβ interaction with phosphatidylinositol/brain phosphatidylcholine and total brain lipid vesicles (32McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Yip C.M. McLaurin J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1359-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both endosomal (data not shown) and lysosomal (Fig. 1 C) vesicles demonstrated Aβ fibers associated with both the edges and surface of the vesicles. Although no fibers were detected in the absence of lipids, the level of Aβ lateral aggregation and organization was less than that detected for the plasma membrane lipids. Aβ incubated in the presence of Golgi lipid vesicles was almost devoid of Aβ fibers (Fig. 6D). The odd fiber could be found across the grid but was not intimately associated with lipid vesicles, and many areas of lipid vesicles could be found devoid of fibers. The odd fiber detected in the presence of Golgi vesicles had morphological characteristics of Aβ protofibrils. The Golgi lipid vesicles are reminiscent of our previous results in which we were unable to identify Aβ fibrils in the presence of ganglioside/phosphatidylcholine membranes when Aβ was added as a randomly structured peptide (29McLaurin J. Franklin T. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4506-4515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In order to characterize differences in the cellular bilayer properties and determine which is most influential in determining Aβ fibrillogenesis, we examined the influence of Aβ40/42 on the physical properties of these bilayers. Many fluorescent dyes are available that penetrate to varying levels into the lipid bilayer and exhibit fluorescent properties indicative of their local environment. We can utilize these dyes to address the effects of Aβ-lipid interactions within various cellular membranes. Previous studies using synthetic lipid bilayers and synaptic plasma membranes have demonstrated a disordering of the fatty acyl chains after interaction with Aβ40 and Aβ42 (17Mason R.P. Jacob R.F.

Brain Res. 1995; 674: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In order to determine the effect of Aβ40/42 on the mobility of the fatty acyl chains within bilayers formed from Golgi, endosomal, lysosomal and plasma membrane lipids, we have examined the steady state fluorescence anisotropy using the dye, DPH (24Van Blitterswijk W.J. Hoeven R.P. Van Der Meer B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 644: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The relative motion of the DPH dye molecule within the lipid bilayer is determined by polarized fluorescence and expressed as r, the anisotropy constant. This constant is inversely proportional to the degree of membrane fluidity. The relative fluidity of the lipid membranes was found to vary considerable with Golgi lipid bilayers having the most rigid structure, whereas plasma membrane, endosomal, and lysosomal lipid bilayers were more fluid (Table I). Previous studies have shown that synthetic lipid bilayer fluidity is regulated by the amount of cholesterol, which exhibits a bimodal effect on fluidity with increasing levels of cholesterol (34Kremer J.J. Pallitto M.M. Sklansky D.J. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10309-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 37Roher A.E. Kuo Y.-M. Kokjohn K.M. Emmerling M.R. Gracon S. Amyloid: Int. J.

The cholesterol to phospholipid ratios of the bilayers were in the range of that reported previously in the literature (TableII). The differences in fluidity detected in this study are not solely related to the cholesterol content of these bilayers as the plasma and lysosomal membranes have a significant cholesterol level yet still exhibited a fluid membrane structure. Therefore, the properties of the different bilayers represent differences in the total lipid composition rather than cholesterol per se.Table ISteady state anisotropy measurements of various cellular membranes in the presence and absence of Aβ40/42SampleAnisotropyGolgiPlasma membraneEndosomalLysosomalControl0.295 ± 0.0040.221 ± 0.0000.186 ± 0.0020.232 ± 0.0002Aβ400.284 ± 0.0021-ap < 0.001.0.259 ± 0.0011-ap < 0.001.0.196 ± 0.0011-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.0.268 ± 0.00021-ap < 0.001.Aβ420.284 ± 0.0041-ap < 0.001.0.263 ± 0.0081-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.0.196 ± 0.00020.267 ± 0.0191-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.Seeded Aβ400.314 ± 0.0111-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.0.273 ± 0.0091-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.NDNDSeeded Aβ420.303 ± 0.0081-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.0.276 ± 0.0401-bp < 0.01 by Student'st test.NDNDAβ-(1–28)0.297 ± 0.0020.231 ± 0.004NDNDMellitin0.294 ± 0.0030.228 ± 0.008NDNDAnisotropy was measured using DPH fluorescence at a probe:lipid ratio of 1:500.

Many Aβ properties have been linked to the conformation and aggregation state of the peptide. In order to investigate the interactions of Aβ40 and Aβ42 with lipid bilayers, we chose to examine initially soluble, random structured peptide with bilayers. To ensure that Aβ peptides meet these criteria and are free of fibril nucleation seeds, Aβ40/42 peptides were treated with 100% trifluoroacetic acid followed by lyophilization (18Jao S.-C. Ma K. Talafous J. Orlando R. Zagorski M.G. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1997; 4: 240-252Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lyophilized peptide was immediately solubilized in 40% trifluoroethanol in order to make a 1 mg/ml stock solution. As reported previously (40McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), Aβ40/42 is partly α-helical in 40% trifluoroethanol and upon dilution into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, Aβ40/42 initially adopted a random structure. Our results demonstrate that addition of randomly structured Aβ40 and Aβ42 decreased the membrane fluidity of the plasma membrane, endosomal and lysosomal membranes in a concentration-dependent manner as illustrated by an increase in the anisotropy constant (Table I and Fig.2). We could not detect a significant difference in the effect of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on these membranes. In contrast, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 induced a significant increase in fluidity of the Golgi lipid bilayers as demonstrated by the decrease in the anisotropy constant (Table I). The disordering effect of Aβ on Golgi lipid membranes is enhanced by increasing Aβ concentration (Fig. 2). To determine the specificity of Aβ40/42-lipid interactions, we examined Aβ-(1–28), which lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic region, and bee venom mellitin, a pore-forming peptide. Neither Aβ-(1–28) nor mellitin altered the fluidity of the Golgi membranes, whereas both decreased the fluidity of plasma membranes (Table I). These results suggest that the preferential increase in Golgi membrane fluidity as a result of Aβ40/42 interaction is peptide- and sequence-specific. It is not surprising that mellitin decreases the fluidity of plasma membranes as it inserts into membranes to create pores. The structural dependence of Aβ effects on membrane fluidity of plasma membrane and Golgi lipid bilayers was examined by comparing the random structured peptide with Aβ40 and Aβ42 which exhibit β-structure. In contrast to the random structured peptides, seeded Aβ40 decreased the membrane fluidity of both plasma and Golgi membranes (Table I). Similar results were detected for Aβ42. This result suggested to us that Aβ interactions with lipid bilayers is not only dependent on the composition of the lipid bilayer but also on the structural characteristics of the peptide. Besides the packing of the lipid acyl chains, the dynamics of the polar head groups and the polarity of the lipid interface are relevant to the interaction of molecules, i.e. Aβ, with the membrane surface. In order to obtain an insight into these properties, laurdan andN-ε-dansyl-l-lysine probes were used. Laurdan naphthalene ring is located at the glycerol backbone and is anchored in the bilayer by the lauroyl moiety, thereby imparting fluorescence characteristics that are dependent on the polarity of its environment (25Parasassi T. DeStasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 41Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Fidelio G.D. Gratton E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The advantages of laurdan are that it is completely non-fluorescent in aqueous environments, is independent of pH between 4 and 10, and independent of lipid polar head group; therefore fluorescence readings reflect only the polarity of the probe associated with the bilayer. The spectral properties of laurdan have been described by the general polarization equation for both excitation and emission spectra, which render information about the lipid phase, polarity, and co-existence of multiple lipid phases within a single bilayer (25Parasassi T. DeStasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 41Bagatolli L.A. Parasassi T. Fidelio G.D. Gratton E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laurdan excitation spectra in the presence of plasma and Golgi lipid bilayers demonstrate the characteristic red excitation at 340 nm and blue excitation at 380 nm, whereas the emission spectra indicates a single maximum at 430 nm indicative of blue emission (Fig.3). The red excitation band intensity increases in polar solvents,"
https://openalex.org/W2318731296,"TEL (Translocation-ETS-Leukemia or ETV 6) is disrupted by multiple chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. The loss of heterozygosity at the TEL locus in leukemias and the hemizygous deletion of TEL that is observed in various tumors, suggests that TEL is a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of TEL alters cellular morphology and represses the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1. Based on these studies, deletion analysis was used to define the minimal repression domains of TEL. TEL-mediated repression required both the N-terminal pointed domain and a central region composed of amino acids 268-303. The mSin3A and N-CoR corepressors bind to the pointed domain and the central repression domain of TEL, respectively. Unexpectedly, histone deacetylase-3, but not other histone deacetylases, also associates with the central region of TEL. Histone deacetylase-3 interacts with a TEL mutant that cannot bind N-CoR, suggesting that this is a direct interaction with TEL. In addition, histone H3 was under-acetylated near the TEL-binding sites in the endogenous stromelysin-1 promoter when TEL was expressed. Furthermore, trichostatin A, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, impaired TEL-dependent repression of the stromelysin-1 promoter. Finally, while TEL-expression induced cellular aggregation of Ras-transformed cells, Trichostatin A reversed the TEL-induced cellular aggregation phenotype. Thus, the cumulative data suggests that histone deacetylase-3 activity is required for the transcriptional functions of TEL."
https://openalex.org/W2077675724,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV encodes the potentially oncogenic HBx protein, which mainly functions as a transcriptional co-activator involving in multiple gene deregulations. However, mechanisms underlying HBx-mediated oncogenicity remain unclear. To determine the role(s) of HBx in the early genesis of HCC, we utilized the NCI Oncochip microarray that contains 2208 human cDNA clones to examine the gene expression profiles in either freshly isolated normal primary adult human hepatocytes (Hhep) or an HCC cell line (SK-Hep-1) ecotopically expressing HBx via an adenoviral system. The gene expression profiles also were determined in liver samples from HBV-infected chronic active hepatitis patients when compared with normal liver samples. The microarray results were validated through Northern blot analysis of the expression of selected genes. Using reciprocally labeling hybridizations, scatterplot analysis of gene expression ratios in human primary hepatocytes expressing HBx demonstrates that microarrays are highly reproducible. The comparison of gene expression profiles between HBx-expressing primary hepatocytes and HBV-infected liver samples shows a consistent alteration of many cellular genes including a subset of oncogenes (such as c-myc and c-myb) and tumor suppressor genes (such as APC, p53, WAF1 and WT1). Furthermore, clustering algorithm analysis showed distinctive gene expression profiles in Hhep and SK-Hep-1 cells. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the deregulation of cellular genes by oncogenic HBx may be an early event that favors hepatocyte proliferation during liver carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020404753,"For transcription to initiate, RNA polymerase must recognize and melt promoters. Selective binding to the nontemplate strand of the -10 region of the promoter is central to this process. We show that a 48 amino acid (aa) coiled-coil from the beta' subunit (aa 262--309) induces sigma(70) to perform this function almost as efficiently as core RNA polymerase itself. We provide evidence that interaction between the beta' coiled-coil and region 2.2 of sigma(70) promotes an allosteric transition that allows sigma(70) to selectively recognize the nontemplate strand. As the beta' 262--309 peptide can function with the previously crystallized portion of sigma(70), nontemplate recognition can be reconstituted with only 47 kDa, or 1/10 of holoenzyme."

Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that NF90, NF45, and PKR form a complex in both nuclear and cytosolic extracts, and both proteins serve as substrates for PKR in vitro. NF90 is phosphorylated by PKR in its RNA-binding domain, and this reaction is partially blocked by the NF90 N-terminal region.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All of these proteins share homology at their N terminus to a mouse protein, Zfr, a protein of unknown function which has a conserved homologue in Drosophila (8Meagher M.J. Schumacher J.M. Lee K. Holdcraft R.W. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Downstream of this Zfr homology domain is a region of homology which these proteins share with NF45, which we term the NF45 homology domain. Several NF90 homologues and variants have been identified in human cells, and recent work from Duchange and colleagues (9Duchange N. Pidoux J. Camus E. Sauvaget D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) has helped clarify the relationships of several of these proteins. Alternatively spliced variants of the protein exist, including the human dsRNA-binding protein DRBP76, isolated during a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with PKR (10Patel R.C. Vestal D.J. Xu Z. Bandyopadhyay S. Guo W. Erme S.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Grabowski G.A. Mol. Genet.

Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins differ as a result of two alternative splicing events, one at exon 14 which results in the addition of four additional amino acids between the two dsRBMs, and another at exon 17 which alters the C terminus of the protein downstream of the two dsRBMs (9Duchange N. Pidoux J. Camus E. Sauvaget D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NF90 seems to be a variant of theILF3 gene, as they are nearly identical at the nucleotide level although they diverge after the second dsRBM, due to a 2-nucleotide insertion in the NF90 sequence. Proteins in this family have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Translational control protein 80 is reported to mediate the translational regulation of acid β-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease (11Xu Y.H. Grabowski G.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Xu Y.H. Busald C. Grabowski G.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), while the Xenopus homologue of NF90 was identified as part of CCAAT box transcription factor, a developmentally regulated transcription factor complex (14Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J.M. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Corthesy and Kao (1Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that antisera to NF90 and NF45 reduce transcription from a minimal promoter containing three copies of the antigen response recognition element-2 element in vitro (1Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that NF90 can serve as both a positive and negative regulator of transcription in human cells.2 NF90 and some of its homologues have been shown to interact with PKR (7Coolidge C.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and serve as a substrate for this RNA-dependent protein kinase (10Patel R.C. Vestal D.J. Xu Z.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6361-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PKR also contains two dsRBMs and binds preferentially to duplex and structured RNAs including the VA RNAs. Activation of PKR by dsRNA leads to the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 on its α subunit, resulting in the general inhibition of protein synthesis. PKR is inhibited by binding to VA RNAI or, more weakly, VA RNAII (16Pe'ery T. Mathews M.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 371-424Google Scholar). PKR activation is an aspect of the interferon-induced host antiviral mechanism (16Pe'ery T. Mathews M.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 371-424Google Scholar). In addition, PKR has been implicated in other cellular processes including apoptosis (17Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N.

While the physiological events and signaling pathways that trigger PKR activation by cellular RNA or proteins are not well established, numerous regulators of PKR have been characterized (16Pe'ery T.

Like NF90 and PKR itself, PACT, TAR RNA-binding protein, and E3L all contain dsRBMs. PKR and NF90 are both present in the cytoplasm and are associated with ribosomes (2Liao H.J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we examine the RNA binding properties of NF90, its biochemical interactions with PKR, and the enzyme/substrate relationship between the two proteins. The results show that NF90 interacts with PKR through its RNA-binding domain, which lies at the C terminus of NF90. This region of NF90 is phosphorylated by PKR, and is also capable of inhibiting PKR kinase activity in vitro. This inhibition appears to be due to competitive binding of dsRNA. The N terminus of NF90, which does not bind RNA, interacts with PKR in an RNA-independent fashion and is able to impede phosphorylation of NF90 by PKR. We propose that the N-terminal region of NF90 sterically interferes with its phosphorylation by PKR. Plasmids used for in vitrotranscription-translation were pcDNA3-DAI (37Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), pT7-luciferase (Promega), and pBSIIKS-NF90.3 obtained from P. Kao (36Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of 3′ deleted versions was prepared from pBSIIKS-NF90.3 by digesting withHindIII, ApaI, EcoRV, andSalI and religating the 5′ portion of the NF90 sequence with the vector to give the derivatives 1–591, 1–419, 1–314, and 1–150, respectively. To construct pGST-NF90, an EcoRI-SmaI fragment from pBSIIKS-NF90, which contains the NF90 cDNA, was inserted intoEcoRI- and SmaI-digested pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), creating pGEX4T-2-NF90. AnEcoRI-SalI fragment containing the 5′ end of NF90 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers fNF90 (5′-GAATTCGCGAAATGCGTCCAATGCGAATTTTTGTGAATGA-3′) and rNF90 (5′-TGACGTTAGACAGCTGCTACGACGCTAACAC-3′), withEcoRI and SalI sites shown in italics and the translational start site shown in boldface, and inserted between theEcoRI and SalI sites of pBSIIKS, creating p3′NF90. A SalI-SalI fragment from pGEX4T-2-NF90 containing the 3′ end of NF90 together with anEcoRI-SalI fragment from p3′NF90 were inserted into EcoRI- and SalI-digested pGEX 4T-2, yielding pGST-NF90. GST-90C, containing the C-terminal amino acids 334–671 was constructed by digesting GST-NF90 with EcoRI andAvrII, filling in with T4 polymerase (New England Biolabs) and re-ligating. GST-PKR was obtained from B. R. Williams (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Plasmid pRSETa-NF90 was constructed by inserting theEcoRI-SmaI fragment of NF90 from pGST-NF90 into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pRSETa (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), destroying the HindIII site in the polylinker. The C-terminal truncations pRSETa NF90 1–591, pRSETa NF90 1–334, and pRSETa NF90 1–150 were constructed by linearizing full-length pRSETa-NF90 with HindIII (1),AvrII (1), or SalI (1), filling in with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), and adding a SpeI-TTL linker (New England Biolabs). The plasmids, pRSETa-NF90 334–671 and pRSETa-NF90 334–591 were constructed by digesting pRSETa-NF90 or pRSETa NF90 1–591, respectively, with EcoRI andAvrII, filling in with T4 DNA polymerase, and religating the plasmids. The plasmids, pRSETa-476–671 and pRSETa-476–591, were made by digesting plasmids pRSETa-NF90 334–671 or pRSETa-NF90 334–591, respectively, with XhoI to remove a fragment containing the polylinker to amino acid 476, and filling in the XhoI site, as well as the upstream BamHI site in the polylinker using T4 DNA polymerase to return the protein to the proper reading frame. The plasmids pRSETa 150–419 and 150–591 were constructed by generating a polymerase chain reaction product using the upstream primer NF90Δ2 (5′-GAATTCTCTGTCGACGATGCTGCGAT-3′) and downstream primer NF90ΔR (5′GGATCCCGGCAAGCCCATGTCCTGTA-3′). This fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pRSET-b. The plasmid was then digested withSalI and BamHI and replaced with aSalI-PstI fragment (150) or aSalI-HindIII fragment (150) from pBSIIKS-NF90.3 after converting the BamHI, PstI, and HindIII sites to flush-ends. Recombinant His-tagged proteins were transformed into BL21(pLysS) bacterial strains and grown to active log phase. Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cultures were centrifuged at 3000 rpm in a Beckman J6-HC centrifuge, the supernatant was discarded, and the bacterial pellet frozen at −80 °C, and thawed at 4 °C using sonication buffer (8m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and debris was removed by spinning at 3000 rpm in a Beckman GS6R centrifuge. Cleared supernatant was allowed to incubate with metal affinity resin (TALON Beads,CLONTECH) for 30 min, and the resin was subsequently washed with 10 bed volumes of sonication buffer, 10 bed volumes of Wash Buffer 1 (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl), and 10 bed volumes of Wash Buffer 2 (5 mm imidizole, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) before eluting 4 times with 1 bed volume of elution buffer (150 mm imidizole, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, dialyzed overnight with dialysis buffer (HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), and stored at −80 °C. ssRNA and dsRNA was synthesized in vitro using pBS II KS+ (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and purified as described (39Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were conducted essentially as described (39Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled RNA was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with bacterially purified recombinant protein in a reaction volume of 20 µl in binding reaction buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg of aproptinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin/ml, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml yeast total RNA). After dilution with 10 volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), the reaction mixtures were immediately filtered in a slot-blot apparatus through a 0.45-µm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) presoaked for 20 min at room temperature in wash buffer. Each well was washed two times with 250 µl of ice cold wash buffer, and the filter was dried and exposed to a Packard Instant Imager for quantitation. Proteins were synthesized and labeled in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN) using the TNT T7 coupled wheat germ system (Promega) according to manufacturers instructions. Polyclonal antibody against NF90 was obtained from P. Kao (36Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-PKR polyclonal antibody was described previously (38Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Wheat germ translation products (10–20 µl) were treated with RNase A at 300 µg/ml for 1 h at 30 °C, mixed with other wheat germ translation products where indicated, then incubated at 4 °C in the presence of 5–10 µl of antibody for 2 h with rocking. Immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed 5 times with 500 µl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT). The beads were resuspended in 30 µl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar), boiled for 3 min, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Plasmids encoding GST, GST-NF90, GST-NF90 334–671, or GST-PKR were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Fusion protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and bacterial pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Pellets were subsequently resuspended in sonication buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, disrupted by sonication 4 times for 20 s followed by incubation on ice for 30 s. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged in an SS34 rotor at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. For assays, 10 µg of bacterial extracts and 10 µl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (pre-equilibrated in sonication buffer) were incubated, and washed with 20 volumes of buffer A1. RNase-treated radiolabeled wheat germ translation products (5 µl) were added to the beads (10 µl bed volume) and the volume was increased to 200 µl with buffer A1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rocking. The beads were centrifuged briefly, washed 5 times with 500 µl of buffer A1 with 0.75m NaCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and resuspended in 30 µl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. PKR kinase assays were carried out as previously described (39Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-µl reactions contained 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg of aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin per ml, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5–2 µl of PKR at the Mono S stage of purification (41Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and 20 ng/ml reovirus dsRNA where indicated. Reaction mixtures were assembled on ice, with the enzyme added last, and were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. The NF90 sequence predicts two dsRBMs in the proteins C-terminal half. Previous reports indicated that NF90 and some of its family members and homologues interact with dsRNA (2Liao H.J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6361-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether the two dsRBMs are involved in RNA binding, we constructed a panel of N- and C-terminal truncations (Fig.1 B), and expressed the recombinant proteins in bacteria. These proteins carry a polyhistidine tag at their N termini, allowing their purification under denaturing conditions using a metal affinity resin which binds to the His-tag (Fig. 1 C). After renaturation, the RNA binding properties of the full-length and truncated forms of NF90 were analyzed in nitrocellulose filter binding assays using dsRNA and ssRNA, 85 bases in length, synthesized in vitro (39Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Initially we assessed the ability of full-length NF90 to bind to dsRNA and ssRNA over a broad range of RNA concentrations. Although NF90 binds dsRNA preferentially at low RNA concentrations, at higher concentrations (32 nm) it binds both dsRNA and ssRNA with similar efficiency (Fig. 2A). To map the RNA binding activities, equimolar amounts (5 nm) of full-length His-tagged NF90 and its truncated derivatives were tested for their ability to bind to dsRNA and ssRNA at low (3.4 nm; Fig. 2 B) and high (32 nm; Fig.2 C) concentrations of input RNA. Full-length NF90 and all of its derivatives that retained amino acids 334–591 were able to bind to dsRNA (stippled bars) at low and high concentrations. They also bound to ssRNA (open bars) at high concentrations. These data indicate that the ssRNA and dsRNA binding activities reside in the domain of NF90 which contains the two dsRBMs, making it likely that these motifs are responsible for NF90 binding to both dsRNA and ssRNA. Interactions between some NF90 family members and PKR have been observed (7Coolidge C.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Patel R.C.

Kao P.N. Jacobs B.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6361-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) but these reports did not distinguish between direct protein-protein interactions and those mediated by RNA. We used co-immunoprecipitation assays to define the interactions between NF90 and PKR and to determine the contribution, if any, of RNA binding to these interactions. First, NF90 and PKR were synthesized by coupled transcription and translation in wheat germ extracts. In some cases [35S]methionine was included in the reaction to label the protein being synthesized. Fig.3A shows that PKR and NF90 labeled in this way were immunoprecipitated by their corresponding antibodies (lanes 1 and 5, respectively) but, as expected, neither protein was immunoprecipitated by the heterologous antiserum (lanes 2 and 6). In the presence of unlabeled PKR (lane 3), labeled NF90 was co-immunoprecipitated by antibody to PKR, consistent with the formation of a PKR·NF90 complex when wheat germ extracts containing the two proteins are mixed. The control protein luciferase did not co-immunoprecipitate under the same conditions (lane 4). Reciprocally, anti-NF90 antiserum co-immunoprecipitated PKR but not luciferase in the presence of unlabeled NF90 (lanes 7 and8). As further tests of specificity, neither anti-PKR nor anti-NF90 antisera immunoprecipitated luciferase synthesized in vitro, and preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate PKR or NF90 either singly or from mixed translation extracts (data not shown). This “35S-coIP” experiment demonstrates that PKR and NF90 interact in vitro. Similar data verify the direct interaction of NF90 and NF45 (data not shown). To test for interactions between NF90, NF45, and PKR in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from cytosolic and nuclear extracts of 293 cells using antibodies directed against each of the three proteins. Anti-actin and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibody directed against NF90 or NF45. These “IP-Western” assays revealed that NF90 and NF45 were immunoprecipitated with cognate antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated with one another, as expected (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, 4, 8, and9), but not with preimmune serum or antibody directed against actin (lanes 5, 6, 10, and 11). Additionally, NF90 and NF45 were co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against PKR (lanes 2 and 7). Since NF45 does not directly interact with PKR in vitro, 3L. M. Parker and M. B. Mathews, unpublished observations. we conclude that PKR is found in complexes with NF90 and NF45 in both cytosolic and nuclear extracts. These co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted in the presence of RNase and high salt to reduce the likelihood that the interactions were bridged by RNA. To determine explicitly whether RNA binding or the RNA-binding domain of NF90 is involved in its interactions with PKR, we examined a series of truncated forms of NF90 for their ability to bind PKR using the35S-coIP proce"

These values were compared with ligand binding initiated by rapid mixing. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the roles of several heme pocket amino acids in facilitating hexacoordination and stabilizing bound oxygen. It is demonstrated that Synechocystis hemoglobin contains a very reactive binding site and that ligand migration through the protein is rapid.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first high resolution structures have been published for the trHbs from Paramecium caudatum and C. eugametos, and several have been characterized biophysically (5Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biophysical attributes of this family show tremendous variance in association and dissociation rate constants for oxygen binding. Traditional mammalian myoglobins (Mbs) and hemoglobins (Hbs) are pentacoordinate in the ferrous, deoxygenated state and exhibit simple bimolecular ligand binding behavior. Ligand binding to pentacoordinate hemoglobins has been studied for decades and is regulated by heme iron reactivity and the steric and electrostatic configuration of the distal heme pocket (6Olson J. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 544-552Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). More recently, a new mechanism for regulating ligand binding has been observed in a growing number of heme proteins. These proteins are hexacoordinate in the absence of exogenous ligands and regulate ligand association and dissociation through displaceable intramolecular coordination of an amino acid side chain to the ligand binding site of the heme iron (7Hargrove M. Brucker E. Stec B. Sarath G. Arredondo-Peter R. Klucas R. Olson J. Phillips G. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This mechanism is utilized by the nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins (nsHbs) in which the distal histidine rapidly and reversibly binds at the ligand binding site (8Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other forms of intramolecular heme iron hexacoordination have also been demonstrated; examples include the oxygen sensor from Escherichia coli (9Delgado-Nixon V. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and the transcriptional regulator CooA (10Lanzilotta W. Schuller D. Thorsteinsson M. Kerby R. Roberts G. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 876-880Google Scholar). The degree to which the trHbs use displaceable coordination as a mechanism to regulate ligand binding remains unclear. The structure of the hemoglobin from C. eugametos was determined in the cyanide-bound form and does not provide direct information about hexacoordination (5Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, spectroscopic and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that this protein is capable of hexacoordination in both the ferrous and ferric forms, with ligand binding in the ferrous form limited by the conversion of the heme iron from a 6- to a 5-coordinate state (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The two cyanobacterial trHbs differ with respect to coordination characteristics. The protein fromN. commune (glbN) is pentacoordinate in the ferrous deoxygenated state, whereas the protein from Synechocystis(SynHb) displays absorption spectra indicating it is hexacoordinate in both the deoxygenated ferrous and ferric states (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,11Lecomte, J., Scott, N., Vu, B., and Falzone, C. (2001) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). The crystal structures of the trHbs from P. caudatum andC. eugametos reveal a novel structure that may help to explain the behavior of these proteins. The fold of each protein is an unprecedented “2 over 2” helix packing motif, which may be common to this family of hemoglobins. A by-product of this fold is a tunnel through the protein matrix that may provide a direct pathway between solvent and the heme pocket (5Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small size of the trHbs coupled with a direct pathway for ligand binding suggests that they should react very rapidly with small diatomic ligands. However, the reported rate constants for ligand binding to SynHb are very small in comparison to the trHb from N. commune (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Thorsteinsson M. Bevan D. Potts M. Dou Y. Eich R. Hargrove M. Gibson Q. Olson J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The behavioral discrepancy between these two proteins is surprising given their phylogenetic relatedness, but can be rationalized by considering the effects of intramolecular hexacoordination in SynHb. Discrepancies may also result from the techniques used to measure the rate constants, as it has been demonstrated that flash photolysis and rapid mixing are not necessarily equivalent methods for evaluating hexacoordinate hemoglobins (12Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The objectives of the work presented here were to determine the effects of hexacoordination on ligand binding in SynHb, identify amino acids associated with hexacoordination, and investigate ligand binding to SynHb using both rapid mixing and flash photolysis. We have used site-directed mutagenesis in combination with absorption spectroscopy, stopped flow rapid mixing, and laser flash photolysis to demonstrate that SynHb contains an extremely reactive ligand binding site that uses hexacoordination to regulate ligand binding. The cDNA for wild typeSynHb was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from chromosomal DNA extracted from Synechocystis PCC 6803. This cDNA was inserted into pET 29a (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid was used for the production of recombinant protein and generation of all mutant protein sequences. Site directed mutagenesis was performed using Stratagene's QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Proteins were expressed in BL21DE3 cells as described previously (12Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of the proteins investigated here expressed at levels similar to the wild type protein, and were purified without exogenous ligands or the addition of free heme. Absorbance spectra were recorded using either a Hewlett Packard diode array or a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Stopped flow and laser flash photolysis experiments were conducted using methods generally described by Olson (13Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and Quillin et al. (14Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Stopped flow measurements were performed at 20 °C using a Durrum stopped flow apparatus interfaced with a computer by On-Line Instrument Systems. For CO binding measurements, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) was bubbled to saturation with CO and N2 in separate gas tight syringes. 200 μm sodium dithionite was added as a reductant to both syringes, and different concentrations of CO were generated by mixing the appropriate volumes of CO and N2saturated buffers in another syringe. One syringe of the stopped flow reactor contained protein diluted into the N2 equilibrated buffer, and the other contained CO buffer at the concentration of interest. Laser flash photolysis of CO samples was conducted using a YAG laser apparatus as described by Hargrove (8Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A liquid dye laser was used for flash photolysis experiments with oxygenated samples. The dye laser is a Candela model LDFL-8 using rhodamine 575 dye (Exciton) dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 30 μm. The flash lamp was pulsed at 19 kV, and the 1-cm beam diameter was focused to about 5 mm (large enough to cover the probe beam diameter). Measurement of transient absorbance following laser flash was conducted using the light collecting apparatus described above for the YAG laser (8Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Oxygen dissociation was measured by rapid mixing of oxygenated protein samples with buffer containing 200 μm sodium dithionite and 1 mm CO. Rate constants obtained under these conditions were concentration-independent for both sodium dithionite (between 50 and 500 μm), and CO (between 0.1 and 1 mm). Control reactions with soybean leghemoglobin (Lba) and sperm whale Mb under these conditions resulted in oxygen dissociation rate constants consistent with published values (Table II).Table IIRate constants for ligand binding to several wild type hemoglobinsHbk′O2kO2k′COkentry, COaRef. 34.k−HkHμm−1s−1s−1μm−1s−1μm−1s−1s−1s−1Synechocystis(SynHb)2400.014909304,200N. commune(glbN)bRef. 4.3907941M. tuberculosis (HbN)250.26.8Rice (rHb1)cRef. 8.680.03861,900520Sperm whale MbdRef. 32.17150.517Human Hb α chains (R-state)eRef. 33.23112.911Human Hb β chains (R-state)eRef. 33.79287.111Soybean leghemoglobin (Lba)dRef. 32.1305.617320a Ref. 34Rohlfs R.J.

Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following mechanism describes the rate constants associated with these reactions. Hbhex ⇄kHk−H Hbpent+L ⇄kLkL′ HbL REACTION 1In Reaction 1, kH andk−H are the rate constants for association and dissociation of the hexacoordinating side chain, andk′L and kL are the bimolecular ligand binding and dissociation rate constants, respectively. Under pseudo-first order conditions with the ligand in excess, ligand binding is independent of protein concentration. Flash photolysis under these conditions yields two ligand concentration-dependent rate constants for rebinding whenk′L, kH, andk−H, are of similar order, andkL is slow with respect to the other rates (8Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The linear dependence of these two observed rate constants (γ1 and γ2) provideskH, k−H, andk′L according to the following equations. γ1+γ2=k−H+kH+kL′[L]Equation 2 γ1γ2=k−HkL′[L]Equation 3 A plot of γ1 + γ2 versus[L] produces a line with a slope equal to k′Land a y intercept of kH +k−H. The line resulting from a plot of γ1 × γ2 versus [L] yields a slope of k−H k′L with an intercept that should be near zero (8Hargrove M. Biophys.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6834-6839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Time courses for rebinding of CO to SynHb following flash photolysis are shown in Fig.1 A. Analogous data for the pentacoordinate hemoglobin Lba are shown in Fig. 1 B for comparison. Rebinding to Lba occurs as a single exponential phase with a linear dependence on [CO], whereas SynHb has two exponential processes that are both [CO] dependent. Plots of the sum and product of the two concentration dependent rates forSynHb are shown in Fig. 1 (C and D, respectively). Analyses of these plots as described above result in values of 90 μm−1 s−1, 930 s−1, and 4,200 s−1 fork′CO, k−H, andkH, respectively. A third rapid phase with a smaller amplitude is required for complete fitting of the rebinding time courses. This third phase is independent of ligand concentration and of the order expected for geminate recombination from “C” states (kCO(gem)) (16Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. McKinnie R.E. Rohlfs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10228-10239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first report of CO binding to SynHb used rapid mixing to initiate the reaction and demonstrated a complex relationship between [CO] and the observed rate constant (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows a comparison of a time course for CO binding to SynHb following rapid mixing, and a calculated time course based solely on k′CO,k−H, kH, and Equation 1. This comparison demonstrates that ligand binding following flash photolysis differs from ligand binding initiated by rapid mixing. This difference has been analyzed quantitatively using rHb1 and appears to be a common phenomenon in hexacoordinate hemoglobins (12Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Absorbance and resonance Raman spectroscopy have identified His46(E10) as a residue that coordinates the distal side of the heme iron in the deoxy ferrous state (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and this assessment was recently confirmed by NMR (11Lecomte, J., Scott, N., Vu, B., and Falzone, C. (2001) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). The superscript 46(E10) identifies His46(E10) as the 46th amino acid in the primary sequence of SynHb, with helix position homology to the traditional mammalian hemoglobin E10 residue (5Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the His46 side chain results in a protein that is predominantly pentacoordinate, with a small population of protein exhibiting hexacoordinate character (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To evaluate the kinetic behavior arising from substitution of His46 with a residue incapable of hexacoordination, time courses for CO recombination to H46A SynHb following flash photolysis were measured as a function of [CO] (Fig.3). Each of these time courses consist of two rebinding events. The faster of these two events is described by a single exponential decay that shows linear dependence on [CO]. The second phase of rebinding is slower, independent of [CO], and heterogeneous. The observed rate constants for the faster phase are plotted as a function of [CO] in Fig. 3 B. The slope of this plot (140 μm−1 s−1) is attributed to k′CO, as this is the only [CO]-dependent phase and the y intercept is near zero. The H46A mutation has interesting effects on ligand binding initiated by rapid mixing. Fig. 4 illustrates the ligand binding behavior of the H46A mutant and the wild type protein as well as the other mutant proteins to be discussed subsequently. For wild type SynHb, the time course for CO binding following rapid mixing is heterogeneous and comprises at least three phases (12Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The faster of these phases has been reported previously and is dependent on [CO] (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Time courses for CO binding to H46ASynHb following rapid mixing are biphasic, with only the faster rate dependent on [CO]. The most striking effect of the H46A substitution is the drastic increase in amplitude of the slower phase of ligand binding. More than 85% of total binding occurs on time scales greater than 10 s, with a [CO] independent rate constant of ∼0.01 s−1. The rate constant of the slowest phase of binding to the wild type protein is also ∼0.01 s−1, although it accounts for only 10% of the total amplitude of binding (12Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The faster, ligand-dependent phase of CO binding to the H46A protein (observed in Fig. 4 A as a change in absorbance between 0.001 and 0.01 s) is significantly faster than that of wild type SynHb, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 B. As reported previously, this rate constant for wild type SynHb limits at a value of ∼30 s−1 (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rate constants observed for the [CO] dependent reaction with the H46A protein are linear over the concentration range accessible to stopped flow mixing, with a bimolecular rate constant of 9 μm−1 s−1 (Fig.4 C). The distal HisE7 plays a fundamental role in regulating ligand binding in many hemoglobins (17Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (724) Google Scholar). InSynHb, the amino acid with helix position homology to position E7 is Gln43. A Gln at this position is also found in Ascaris Hb, elephant Mb, and several other bacterial and yeast hemoglobins (18Dikshit K.L. Orii Y. Navani N. Patel S. Huang H.Y. Stark B.C. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Gln43in SynHb could be a factor in the low oxygen dissociation rate constant observed for this protein (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows time courses for CO rebinding to the Q43A mutant of SynHb. These time courses are similar to those of the H46A protein in that each can be described by two phases of rebinding; the fast phase is [CO] dependent and monoexponential, whereas the slower phase is heterogeneous and independent of [CO]. Fig. 5 B is a plot of the rate constants associated with the [CO]-dependent phaseversus [CO]. These data are linear and described by a bimolecular rate constant for CO binding (k′CO) of 440 μm−1 s−1. To determine if deoxy ferrous Q43A protein is hexacoordinate like wild typeSynHb, visible absorbance spectra of the deoxy ferrous forms of each protein are overlaid in Fig. 5 C. A comparative time course for CO binding to the Q43A protein initiated by rapid mixing is shown in Fig. 4 A along with those of the wild type and H46A proteins. Q43A protein is more similar to wild typeSynHb than H46A protein, in that it shows no fast, linear dependence on [CO]. In fact, its [CO] dependence is slightly lower than wild type SynHb, limiting at a value of ∼7 s−1 (Fig. 4 B). The slower phase of CO binding to Q43A protein is similar in amplitude to the corresponding phase of wild type SynHb, and the rate constants for this binding event are nearly the same for all proteins analyzed here. The His residue at position E10 is the principle source of hexacoordination in SynHb. In the nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins, a His at E7 reversibly coordinates the heme iron (7Hargrove M. Brucker E.

With a report that the H46A protein retains some residual hexacoordination (1Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the possibility of the Gln43side chain serving as an additional source of coordination was investigated. Fig. 6 A shows derivative absorbance spectra of wild type SynHb, the H46A mutant protein, and a double mutant protein in which both His46 and Gln43 were replaced with Leu (H46L/Q43L). The presence of a hexacoordinating ligand usually results in the heme iron electrons residing in the low spin state and can be detected in the visible absorbance region as a sharp minimum at 555 nm and a sharp maximum at 560 nm in the derivative spectrum. Fig.5 C shows that the absorbance spectra of the Q43A and wild type proteins are nearly identical; Fig. 6 A demonstrates that this spectrum represents a large degree of hexacoordination. The amplitude of the 555- and 560-nm absorbance peaks in the spectrum of the H46A protein are greatly reduced, but slight minimum and maximum are still present at these wavelengths. The double mutant protein H46L/Q43L reduces the amplitude of these peaks even further, suggesting that hexacoordinate character has been reduced. A set of control experiments is shown in Fig. 6 B. A derivative spectrum of deoxy ferrous rHb1 exhibits peaks associated with hexacoordination that are very similar to those of wild typeSynHb. The dotted line in Fig.6 B is the derivative absorbance spectrum of a mutant rHb1 protein in which Gln replaces His73. This spectrum, like that of H46A SynHb, shows residual low spin character with a similar shape. The pentacoordinate rHb1 mutant H73L (8Hargrove M. Biophys.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) has a spectrum closely resembling that of the SynHb double mutant H46L/Q43L, suggesting the SynHb double mutant is pentacoordinate as well. Fig. 6 C is a magnified overlay of the SynHb H46A and rHb1 H73Q spectra, facilitating detailed comparison of the similarity. Fig. 6 suggests that the H46L/Q43L protein has less hexacoordinate character than either wild type SynHb or the H46A mutant protein. Fig. 3 Ademonstrates that, following flash photolysis, the H46A protein binds CO in a concentration dependent manner requiring only one exponential term to fit the concentration-dependent phase of rebinding. However, the rebinding time course includes a slower, heterogeneous phase that is independent of [CO]. If this slow heterogeneous phase is associated with residual hexacoordination, H46L/Q43L protein should display less of this kinetic behavior, exhibiting single exponential rebinding similar to that of leghemoglobin shown in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 7 shows time courses for CO rebinding to the H46L/Q43L protein following flash photolysis. Surprisingly, the time courses are multiphasic and include absorbance changes in the direction opposite to that associated with completion of the reaction. Controls without CO showed no change in absorbance, indicating that the time courses in Fig. 7 monitor a CO reaction initiated by flash photolysis. Data are shown for rebinding at CO concentrations of 100 and 1000 μm. Each time course contains at least three phases of rebinding. The first phase is independent of [CO] and possibly associated with geminate recombination as the absorbance change is in the expected direction. The second phase is a large absorbance change in the direction opposite of that expected for CO rebinding. The rate constant for this phase (and the third) are slightly dependent on [CO]. The direction and amplitude of the absorbance change associated with the third phase returns the system to the pre-flash level. Despite the complexity of CO rebinding after flash photolysis of the H46L/Q43L protein, results for CO binding following stopped flow mixing support the hyp"

TTF-1 is required for normal development of the forebrain, lung, and thyroid. In a search for factors that regulate TTF-1 transcriptional activity, we isolated three genes (T:G mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), and Ajuba), whose products can interact with TTF-1 in yeast and in mammalian cells. TDG is an enzyme involved in base excision repair. In the present paper, we show that TDG acts as a strong repressor of TTF-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, while HIPK2 and Ajuba display no effect on TTF-1 activity, at least under the tested conditions. TDG-mediated inhibition occurs specifically on TTF-1-responsive promoters in thyroid and non thyroid cells. TDG associates with TTF-1 in mammalian cells through the TTF-1 carboxyl-terminal activation domain and is independent of the homeodomain. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected role for the repair enzyme TDG as a transcriptional repressor and open new routes toward the understanding of the regulation of TTF-1 transcriptional activity.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The Nkx2 proteins share high similarity in their homeodomain, a 60-amino acid region involved in DNA binding. The TTF-1 homeodomain was the first one shown to bind DNA elements containing a 5′-CAAG-3′ core sequence, instead of the canonical 5′-TAAT-3′ (1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G.

Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Nkx2 proteins contain two other highly conserved regions, the tin domain (or NK decapeptide) and the NK2-specific domain (10Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The shorttin domain of unknown function is found at the N-terminal region of most NK2 proteins, while the NK2-specific domain is located in a C-terminal region separated from the homeodomain by a short amino acid stretch and is thought to mediate protein-protein interaction. During development, TTF-1 is expressed in the thyroid anlage, in restricted areas of the developing brain and in the lung bronchial epithelium (12Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is required for proper development of these tissues, since TTF-1 null mice die at birth lacking lung parenchyma and the thyroid, and have severe defects of the ventral area of the forebrain (7Sussel L. Marin O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, TTF-1 is expressed at embryonic days 8.5–9.5 in the pharyngeal floor, a portion of which evaginates and becomes the thyroid diverticulum. At the same time, other transcription factors that are required for thyroid development start to be expressed (13De Felice M. Ovitt C. Biffali E. Rodriguez-Mallon A. Arra C. Anastassiadis K.

Development. 1992; 116: 611-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, thyroid-specific gene expression is not turned on until embryonic day 15, suggesting that these transcription factors, although expressed early in development, are inactive or require additional factors to drive thyroid-specific gene expression. Besides TTF-1, other Nkx2 family members, Nkx2.5 and -2.8, are expressed very early in the pharynx (17Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P.

Biol. 1997; 188: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nkx2.8 expression is progressively lost in the pharyngeal floor, while Nkx2.5 expression becomes restricted to the thyroid primordium. The role of Nkx2.5 in thyroid development is unknown given that Nkx2.5 null embryos die before thyroid formation, from failure in the heart tube looping process (3Biben C. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in development, TTF-1 is thought to regulate tissue-specific transcription in differentiated thyroid and lung cells. The expression of thyroid-specific genes, such as thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, thyrotropin receptor, and Na-I symporter is positively controlled by TTF-1 (19Endo T. Kaneshige M. Nakazato M.

The activity of eukaryotic transcription factors can be regulated by various mechanisms, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and interaction with transcriptional modulators. We have previously shown that TTF-1 is phosphorylated on seven serine residues, three of which serve as substrates for the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (27Missero C. Pirro M.T. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M.I. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J.

Expression of oncogenic Ras in thyroid cell results in TTF-1 inactivation and loss of expression of several thyroid-specific genes. Ras inhibitory effect is at least partially mediated in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent manner (27Missero C. Pirro M.T. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

To identify other regulators of TTF-1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the full-length TTF-1 cDNA fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. We found that T:G mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), an enzyme involved in repair of methylated DNA (30Wiebauer K. Jiricny J.

TDG binds to the activation domain at the TTF-1 C terminus and suppresses TTF-1-activated transcription in thyroid and nonthyroid cells. All experiments were performed in the yeast reporter MaV203. The cDNA library was synthesized from rat FRTL-5 cell poly(A)+ RNA plasmid by Life Technologies and cloned into the pPC86GAL4AD vector. Screening of the library was performed essentially following instructions for the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Life Technologies) and has been previously described (33Vidal M. Legrain P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain/TTF-1 fusion was constructed in pPC97GAL4DB, and proper expression of the fusion protein in yeast was confirmed. Subsequently, yeasts carrying the pPC97GAL4DB-TTF-1 plasmid were transformed with the pPC86AD-cDNA library and plated onto plates lacking histidine in the presence of 3AT (aminotriazole; 10 mm). Approximately 1.2 × 106 individual clones were plated, and about 200 grew on the selective medium. Resistant colonies were grown on a master plate and then replica-plated onto selection plates to determine their ability to induce three independent reporters (HIS3, URA3, andlacZ). Seventy-five independent clones were isolated after this first screening. DNA was isolated from each positive clone and sequenced to identify the inserts. Independent pPC86AD clones were retransformed into yeast and tested for interaction with a fresh TTF-1 clone. Yeast strains expressing GAL4DB-Rb, GAL4AD-E2F, GAL4DB-Fos, GAL4AD-Jun, GAL4DB-DP1, GAL4AD-E2F1, and full-length GAL4 were obtained from M. Vidal. For the yeast two-hybrid screening, the coding sequence of rat TTF-1 was fused in frame with the GAL4DNA binding domain in the pPC97GAL4DB plasmid. TG-Luc, a plasmid in which a luciferase reporter gene is controlled by a 400-bp thyroglobulin promoter, has been previously described (21Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). C5-CAT is a reporter construct in which the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase is under the control of a promoter containing five binding sites for TTF-1 (34Missero C. Cobellis G. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ajuba full-length coding sequence was generated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (Life Technologies). The coding sequence of the interactor was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and then inserted in frame with the FLAG epitope in pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) to create mammalian expression plasmids. pRC-TTF-1, GAL4-TTF-1, TTF-1 deletion mutants, and G5-CAT were previously described (35De Felice M.

Human COS-7 cells and HeLa were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfections in FRTL-5 and HeLa cells were carried out by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation (34Missero C. Cobellis G. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, FRTL-5 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105/60-mm dish, and 48 h later C5-CAT or Tg-CAT (2.5 μg) reporter plasmids were transfected in the presence of different expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were collected 72 h after transfection. HeLa were plated the day before transfection at 8 × 105/60-mm dish. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h and then collected. Almost confluent COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). 4 μg of DNA was used for a 60-mm dish (5 × 105 cells). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection. FRTL-5 and HeLa cell extracts were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities were measured as described (34Missero C. Cobellis G. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

CAT activity was measured by incubation with 5 mm chloramphenicol and 0.1 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (1.4 Ci/mmol; 50 μCi/ml). Reactions were performed in the presence of water-insoluble scintillation fluid (Econofluor-2; Packard Bioscience) at 37 °C, and radioactivity released was counted after 5 h. Luciferase activity was measured in the presence of 0.2 mmd-luciferin (Sigma) in a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold). Approximately one-tenth of the total volume was employed for each assay. Whole-cell lysates of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were prepared in in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 120 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF). 300 μg of total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). After 2 h, immunocomplexes were washed five times in lysis buffer and resuspended in sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After transferring, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against TTF-1 was used at approximately 1 μg/ml (29Francis-Lang H. Zannini M.S. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

Seventy-five positive clones were identified after the first screening, of which 55 were sequences homologous to known genes. The number of clones found to correspond to each gene is indicated. +++, strong positive interaction; ++, intermediate interaction; +, weak interaction; −, no interaction. Interaction between TTF-1 and the isolated clones was confirmed by retransformation in yeast and test using three independent reporters (HIS3, URA3, and lacZ), in the presence of GAL4 DNA binding domain alone or of TTF-1-GAL4 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1, the strongest interaction was detected with Ajuba, UBC9, PIAS3, and the related gene PIAS1. TDG interacted also quite strongly, while interaction between TTF-1 and HIPK2 was weak. Other potential interactors such as the Hex gene and the clones Y66,Y120, and Y137, corresponding to unknown genes, scored positive in the context of one promoter but not in the context of the others and were excluded from further analysis. Thus, rat genes corresponding to TDG, UBC9, Ajuba, HIPK2, PIAS1, and PIAS3 displayed the ability to interact with TTF-1 in yeast, while the other clones selected during the first screening, including all of the unknown genes, did not. The TTF-1 interactors were further characterized for their ability to associate with TTF-1 in mammalian cells. Their coding sequences, lacking the first methionine, were fused at the N terminus to the FLAG epitope and cloned into a mammalian expression vector. Individual constructs were co-transfected with an equal amount of a TTF-1 expression vector in COS-7 cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed under mild conditions, and then immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG-specific antibody. Total cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were then run on SDS-PAGE gels under the appropriate conditions, and immunoblotting analysis was performed using either anti-FLAG or anti-TTF-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of TDG and Ajuba resulted in a readily detectable amount of TTF-1 (Fig.2, A and C). Although HIPK2 immunoprecipitation was not very efficient due to its low levels of expression, a low but significant amount of TTF-1 was detected in HIPK2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B). TTF-1 association with these proteins was specific, since no association could be detected with FLAG-UBC9 and FLAG-PIAS3, although both proteins were efficiently produced. PIAS1 was not tested in mammalian cells. On the basis of these results, TDG, HIPK2, and Ajuba were considered as potential regulators of TTF-1 activity. TDG was previously reported to interact in yeast two-hybrid assays with c-Jun and with the retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR and to weakly enhance RAR and RXR transcriptional activity (44Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar,45Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HIPK2 is a nuclear kinase that was reported to interact with NK2 family members (42Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Ajuba was recently cloned as an interactor of GRB2 and was found to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (41Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,46Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ability of these proteins to interfere with TTF-1 transcriptional activity was evaluated in thyroid and nonthyroid cells. Cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for TDG, Ajuba, or HIPK2 in the presence of either a natural TTF-1-responsive promoter (thyroglobulin) or an artificial one (C5), driving the expression of CAT. These promoters display strong basal activity in FRTL-5 cells and are activated specifically by exogenous expression of TTF-1 in nonthyroid cell lines (21Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 34Missero C. Cobellis G. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In thyroid cells, TDG expression strongly repressed C5-CAT in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum inhibition of ∼75% (Fig.3 A). The activity of the thyroglobulin promoter was similarly inhibited by TDG expression (Fig.3 B), while TDG had no effect on the CMV-Luc expression plasmid used as control (data not shown). In contrast, exogenous expression of either HIPK2 or Ajuba had no effect on TTF-1 activity as measured on C5 and thyroglobulin promoters (Fig. 3, C andD, and data not shown). To confirm and further extend these results, HeLa cells that do not express TTF-1 were transiently transfected with the TTF-1-responsive construct C5-CAT in the presence or in the absence of exogenous TTF-1. C5-CAT basal transcription was very low in nonthyroid cells, and its activity was strongly induced in the presence of TTF-1 (Fig.4 A). Expression of either Ajuba or HIPK2 had no effect on TTF-1 activity (data not shown), while TDG expression resulted in strong suppression of TTF-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). Since TDG is expressed ubiquitously (Ref. 45Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and data not shown), the endogenous protein may be sufficient to elicit an effect in the presence of low TTF-1 concentrations. Under these conditions, the addition of TDG could be inhibitory due to a nonspecific “squelching” effect rather than a biologically relevant function. To test this hypothesis, TTF-1 activity was measured in a wide variety of concentrations. In HeLa cells, TTF-1 could efficiently activate C5-CAT even at very low doses (0.05–0.1 μg), under which conditions TDG expression strongly repressed TTF-1 activity. In the presence of high doses of TTF-1 and low concentration of the TDG vector, TTF-1 transcriptional activity was still strongly inhibited by TDG expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). Similar suppression of TTF-1 activity was obtained by TDG expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts at all tested concentrations (data not shown). Thus, taken together, these data suggest that TDG associates with TTF-1 in mammalian cells, where it acts as a specific repressor of TTF-1 transcriptional activity, while Ajuba and HIPK2 are able to associate with TTF-1 but have no apparent effect on its activity at least under the tested conditions. All four TDG clones identified in the two-hybrid screening included the entire coding sequence. The longest TDG clone was 2883 bp long and included 124 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region, and 1598 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region. The open reading frame of 1158 base pairs encoded a protein of 386 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 42,454 Da (data not shown). The amino acid alignment had 88% identity with human TDG and 90% identity with mouse TDGb, while mouse and human sequences shared 86% identity (data not shown). The DNA glycosylase domain comprised amino acids 98–245 of the rat sequence and contained a single substitution Asn to Ser at position 146 of the rat sequence. No other recognizable domain could be identified in the TDG sequence. To map the TTF-1 domains responsible for the interaction with TDG, previously characterized TTF-1 deletion mutants (Fig.5 A) (35De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells either in the presence or in the absence of FLAG-TDG and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. A TTF-1 deletion mutant lacking the entire C-terminal region (Δ14) was unable to associate with TDG, while a deletion of the first 51 amino acids at the N-terminal (Δ1) could efficiently bind to TDG (Fig.5 B). The Δ35 mutant lacking most of the N-terminal domain and part of the C-terminal region (amino acids 221–295), was able to associate with TDG to the same extent of the wild type (Fig.5 B). These data suggest that TDG binds to either the homeodomain and its N-terminal proximal region (amino acids 96–221), or to the C-terminal activation domain (amino acids 295–372). To assess whether the C-terminal domain was sufficient by itself to bind to TDG in the absence of the homeodomain, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for the TTF-1 activation domains fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, in the presence or in the absence of FLAG-TDG. Immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody revealed that TDG could associate specifically with the C-terminal activation domain (amino acids 295–372) fused to GAL4, but not with the N-terminal domain (Fig. 5 D). TTF-1 deletion mutants were tested for their ability to activate C5-CAT transcription in the presence and in the absence of TDG. Similarly to the wild type TTF-1, the Δ1 mutant was strongly inhibited by TDG (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, the Δ14 mutant that was unable to associate to TDG was unaffected by TDG expression. Interestingly, the Δ35 mutant that was sufficient to bind to TDG was unaffected by TDG, suggesting that TTF-1 regions that are not involved in binding to TDG are required for TDG-dependent inhibition. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TDG associates in mammalian cells with TTF-1 specifically through a C-terminal region between amino acids 295 and 372, corresponding to the activation domain. The activation domain is by itself necessary and sufficient for TDG binding, while TDG-mediated repression requires a more extended C-terminal region. Tissue-specific gene expression is spatially and temporally regulated. TTF-1 is a critical component of the transcriptional machinery controlling the expression of thyroid- and lung-specific genes, and thus its activity is likely to be finely regulated during embryonic development and in adult life. In an attempt to isolate TTF-1 regulators, we have identified six genes (Ajuba, HIPK2, PIAS1 and -3, TDG, and UBC9), whose product can bind to TTF-1 in yeast. Among these interactors, the T:G mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase TDG displays a strong ability to repress TTF-1-activated transcription. TDG is an enzyme involved in repair of methylated DNA (30Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine generates T:G mismatches whose repair is initiated by TDG. In mammalian cells, there are only two known thymine glycosylases, TDG and MBD4 (47Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), which display no apparent amino acid sequence similarity, although they share the ability to bind methylated CpG and a very similar catalytic specificity in vitro (47Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 48Sibghat U. Gallinari P. Xu Y.Z. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. Jiricny J. Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12926-12932Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA repair has recently revealed important links to transcription. For instance, proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair are components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (49Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 114-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 50Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). TDG has been previously suggested to be involved in transcription regulation because of its ability to interact in yeast with other transcription factors such as c-Jun, the retinoic acid receptor, and p73 (44Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 45Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 51Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). TDG function in the regulation of Jun and p73 has not been explored, while TDG was reported to enhance weakly retinoic acid receptor activity (3–4-fold) (45Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, association of these transcription factors with TDG in mammalian cells was not examined. In the present study, we report that TDG not only interacts with TTF-1 in yeast but also associates with TTF-1 in mammalian cells. TDG binds to a limited portion of the TTF-1 C terminus that corresponds to the C-terminal activation domain independently of the homeodomain. Binding to the C-terminal activation domain is necessary and sufficient for TDG binding, while TDG repression occurs only in the presence of the entire carboxyl-terminal region. A deletion of the region spanning from the end of the homeodomain to the beginning of the activation domain results in a mutant that can still bind to TDG but is not significantly inhibited. Interestingly, this region comprises the NK2-specific domain that has been proposed to control the transactivation properties of the NK2 family members (10Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which TDG represses TTF-1 activity are unclear. Although TTF-1 binding to DNA in vitro is not inhibited by TDG, 2C. Missero and R. Di Lauro, unpublished data. in vivo TDG could sequester TTF-1 in a different nuclear compartment, preventing binding to target promoters. Alternatively, TDG could work as a repressor by recruiting a histone deacetylase. However, this possibility is unlikely, since TDG-mediated repression was not alleviated by the histone deacetylase trycostatin A, and exogenous expression of histone deacetylase 2 did not affect TTF-1 activity (data not shown). TDG strongly represses TTF-1-activated transcription in several cell lines; however, the functional significance of this repression in vivo is unclear. TTF-1 is expressed early in mouse development (embryonic day 8.5), although thyroid-specific gene expression is not turned on until later (embryonic day 15) (12Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that during this time TTF-1 may be kept inactive by a repressor. TDG is highly expressed during early mouse embryogenesis (52Niederreither K. Harbers M. Chambon P. Dolle P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and may prevent TTF-1-activated transcription. As a result of our search for TTF-1-interacting proteins, we have isolated also Ajuba and HIPK2. Ajuba was the only isolated TTF-1 interactor that was reported to be mainly cytoplasmic, although it contains a nuclear export signal, and it has been suggested to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (41Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ajuba belongs to the Zyxin family of LIM proteins, and it has recently been shown to induce growth inhibition and spontaneous endodermal differentiation in embryonal cells (46Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). LIM domains mediate strong protein-protein interactions, and this feature may allow nonspecific association upon overexpression. TTF-1 was exclusively located in the nucleus even upon overexpression in COS-7 cells, while Ajuba was detected primarily in the cytoplasm, and no colocalization could be detected (data not shown). Thus, the physiological significance of the interaction between TTF-1 and Ajuba remains unclear. HIPK2 was the first member of a family of HIPKs identified for their ability to bind to NK2 and NK3 and to enhance their repressor activities (42Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Subsequently, HIPKs were reported to interact also with other transcription factors, such as the androgen receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor, and p73 (51Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 53Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol.

Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of HIPKs to associate with these transcription factors in mammalian cells could not be shown. In the present study, we report for the first time the interaction between HIPK2 and a member of the family of the homeodomain-containing proteins. HIPK2 protein was difficult to detect even by exogenous expression in COS-7 cells. Given that its C terminus contains a PEST sequence, the protein may be very unstable. For these reasons, it is likely that association with other proteins in mammalian cells might have been difficult to obtain. Under our conditions, HIPK2 displays no effect on TTF-1 transcriptional activity in either thyroid or HeLa cells; thus, the role of this interaction remains to be established. The extent to which the molecules isolated in this study contribute to TTF-1 regulation in vivo remains to be elucidated. However, the identification and characterization of their interaction and, in particular, of TDG-mediated repression in culture cells sets the molecular basis to dissect their functional role in TTF-1 regulation and in thyroid gland and lung physiology.

The enzyme is able to degrade the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and activate other proteases capable of degrading ECM. To investigate the role played by this protease in the invasion of brain tumor cells, we transfected SNB19 human glioblastoma cells with a plasmid containing cathepsin B cDNA in antisense orientation. Control cells were transfected with vector alone. Clones expressing antisense cathepsin B cDNA exhibited significant reductions in cathepsin B mRNA, enzyme activity and protein compared to controls. Matrigel Invasion assay showed that the antisense-transfected cells had a markedly diminished invasiveness compared with controls. When tumor spheroids containing antisense transfected SNB19 cells expressing reduced cathepsin B were co-cultured with fetal rat brain aggregates, invasion of fetal rat brain aggregates was significantly reduced. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expressing parental cells and antisense transfectants were generated for detection in mouse brain tissue without any post-chemical treatment. Intracerebral injection of SNB19 stable antisense transfectants resulted in reduced tumor formation in nude mice. These results strongly support a role for cathepsin B in the invasiveness of human glioblastoma cells and suggest cathepsin B antisense may prove useful in cancer therapy."

As a mitogen, it first binds with high affinity to specific cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential for activating the tyrosine kinase in the receptor cytoplasmic domain, initiating a signal transduction that results in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (1Carpenter G. King L. Cohen S. Nature. 1978; 276: 409-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,2Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although EGF is a typical growth-stimulating peptide, little is known about the molecular mechanism of EGF-induced receptor dimerization. EGF was found to exist predominantly as a monomeric species in solution, and based on analyses of binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of its receptor and of the resulting dimerization of the receptor, some models have been proposed for EGF-induced dimerization of receptors (3Lemmon M.A. Bu Z.

However, all these models have yet to be verified by structural studies, the most important of which is the structural determination of the complex of EGF with its receptor.

On the other hand, it has proved to be very difficult to grow good quality EGF crystals, despite the publication of a few relevant crystallization notes (11Higuchi Y. Morimoto Y. Horinaka A.

After numerous experiments to refine crystallization conditions, using a C-terminally truncated hEGF variant, we have obtained better quality EGF crystals in two different crystal forms at near physiological pH (13Chai J.J.

Here we report the crystal structure of hEGF determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. There are two hEGF molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals that are in close end-to-end contact with each other. Analyses of the crystal structure and comparisons with NMR solution structures have revealed new details of the features and properties of the hEGF structure. The C-terminally truncated hEGF was prepared as described (14Huang B.R. Cai L.W. Liao H.T. Tang S.X. Zhou H.T. Chinese J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 14: 512-517Google Scholar). The hEGF gene encoding 51 amino acids was chemically synthesized based on preferred code usage in yeast. The gene was under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter and the α-factor lead sequence including the 85-amino acid coding sequence. A multicopy insert was constructed as a part of the expression plasmid. The yeast Pichia pastoris was transformed by the expression plasmid, and a Muts His+ cell line was screened. High cell density culture of the cell line was carried out, and the cells were induced with methyl alcohol. The human epidermal growth factor with biological activity was secreted into the medium and was purified through three chromatographic steps. The final yield was 100 mg per liter of cell culture with ∼98% homogeneity. All columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Crystallization of hEGF was performed as described (13Chai J.J. Li M. Huang B.R. Luo Y. Luo M. Bi R.-C. He C.-H. Acta Crystallogr. Series D. 2000; 56: 62-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The hEGF concentration was about 50 mg/ml. After successive rounds of crystallization refinements using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, larger hEGF crystals were grown from a solution containing 0.9 m MgCl2, 3.5 mm CYMAL-3 (cyclohexyl-propyl-b-d-maltoside) and 0.1 m Bicine (pH 8.1) at 291 K over a period of about two months. The hEGF crystals have a typical size of 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3, and can eventually reach a size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.6 mm3. These crystals belong to the space group P3121 (a =b = 61.4 Å, c = 87.0 Å). They could diffract x-ray to 3.0 Å resolution at Argonne Station of synchrotron radiation (Native 1 in Table I), and to 3.2 Å on a MarResearch IP detector, using Cu Kα x-ray from Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operating at 40 kV and 100 mA (Native 2). There are two EGF molecules (denoted by molecules A and B in the text) in the asymmetric unit of the trigonal crystals, giving a Vm of 3.82 Å3/Da (15Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) and a corresponding solvent content of 67.6%. The weak diffractability of hEGF crystals may be related to the higher solvent content. The difficulty in growing good quality EGF crystals may be caused by the marked conformational flexibility of the EGF structure, which will be discussed in detail in the text.Table IA summary of crystallography dataData collection Data setaNative1 is the data collected at Argonne Station; Native2, K2PtCl6, Hg(Ac)2, UO2 (NO3)2 are data collected at Marresearch Image Plate and were used in structural determination with the MIR method.Native1Native2K2PtCl6Hg(Ac)2UO2(NO3)2 Space groupP3121P3121P3121P3121P3121 Resolution (Å)100–3.030–3.220–4.420–4.020–4.3 Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = b = 61.43a = b = 61.21a =b = 60.86a = b = 61.17a = b = 61.03c = 87.04c = 86.88c = 86.76c = 86.80c = 87.24 Number of molecules in asymmetric unit22 Observations/Unique21097/404026521/325710710/109511950/159914001/1754 Overall completeness (%)99.096.889.791.298.5 I/ς(I) (highest shell)2.02.93.84.43.7 Rmerge(%)bRmerge = Σ‖Ii− 〈I〉‖/Σ‖Ii‖, where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection, summed over all reflections.10.410.510.99.312.3Phasing data Rcullis(acentric/centric)cRcullis = Σ∥FPH− FP‖ − FHcalc‖/Σ∥FPH‖ − ‖FP∥, where FP and FPH are protein and heavy-atom structure factors, respectively, and FHcalc is the calculated heavy-atom structure factor.0.78/0.700.82/0.790.93/0.93 Phasing power (acentric/centric)dPhasing power = Σ‖FHcalc‖/Σ∥FPH‖ − ‖FP∥.1.32/0.981.11/0.850.61/0.49 Occupancy0.4140.2180.161Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)8.0–3.0 R-factoreR-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ − ‖Fc∥/Σ‖Fo‖, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Several heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the native crystals for 3 to 7 days at 293 K in storage solution containing an appropriate concentration of dissolved heavy atom compound. Intensity data for the heavy-atom derivatives were collected at room temperature on the MarResearch IP detector, using Cu Kα x-ray from Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. All diffraction data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Oscillation Data Reduction Program in Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Molecular replacement studies with NMR models of mouse EGF (mEGF) and several EGF-like domains as the search model were carried out with both data sets, Native 1 and Native 2. However, all these efforts failed, perhaps due to the difference between the NMR model and the crystal structure to be discussed in the text. The multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) was used to determine the hEGF structure, and all calculations were performed using corresponding programs in the CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Series D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and Native 2 data. The heavy atoms in the derivative crystals were found by difference Patterson method and difference Fourier maps. Heavy atom positions were refined, and phases were calculated using the program MLPHARE with reflections of F/ς(F)>2.0, resulting in an initial figure of merit of 0.423 for data up to 4.0 Å. Solvent flattening and histogram matching improved the initial electron density using the program DM. It was finally determined at this point that there are two hEGF molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the boundaries between solvent and molecules were clearly shown in the electron density map. Based on the availability of NMR structures, the phased translation function (18Colman P.M. Fehlhammer Bartels K. Crystallographic Computing Techniques. Munksgaard, Copenhagen1976: 248Google Scholar) was calculated to position the hEGF molecules in the unit cell. The relevant programs in CCP4 were used with the mean NMR structure of mEGF (PDB code 1EPG, Ref. 9Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as the search model. Two possible model orientations obtained from the calculation of rotation function gave clear solutions of the phased translation function. Using these solutions, the initial model of hEGF crystal structure was built with program TURBO-FRODO (19Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) based on the electron density and resulted in a crystallographic R-factor of 49.4%. The refinement and rebuilding of the hEGF structure were performed, mainly using simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and group B-factor refinement protocols of the program XPLOR (20Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) as well as the program TURBO-FRODO. Data between 8–3.3 Å with reflections of F/ς(F)>2.0 were used at the early stages of refinement, later extended to 3.0 Å, and 10% data were randomly kept aside forRfree calculation. Fourier maps with coefficients (2Fo-Fc) and (Fo-Fc) were calculated in each round. In addition, simulated annealing omit maps were computed for some ambiguous regions to trace the peptide chain. During the final stages of refinement, 7 water molecules were inserted into the model. Due to the low resolution of the data, individual B-factor refinement was not carried out. The final model was characterized by the program PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Superposition between different models of the EGF structure was performed using LSQKAB in CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Series D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of NMR structures of mEGF (9Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1EPG and 1EPI, respectively. A summary of the structural analysis including data collection, phasing and refinement statistics for the hEGF crystals is presented in Table I. The values of Rcryst andRfree for the refined hEGF structure are 23.1 and 28.3%, respectively for the 8.0–3.0 Å data with F>2ς(F). Amino acid residues 1–5 in both molecules A and B and the residues 48–51 in molecule A are disordered, as these regions are poorly defined in the electron density map. 98.6% of the remaining residues have appropriate backbone torsion angles in the most favorable and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Except the two terminal segments, most main-chains in both hEGF molecules have well defined electron densities when contoured at 1ς level (Fig. 1). Most side chains are also unambiguously located in the density map, whereas some polar residues on the molecular surface have poor densities showing their conformational disorder to some extent. The three disulfide bridges, Cys6–Cys20, Cys14–Cys31, and Cys33–Cys42, are also located in clearly defined electron densities. The crystal structure of hEGF (Fig.2 a) shares main features of the NMR solution structures available. It is a structure consisting of an N-domain (residues 1–32) and a C-domain (residues 33–53). The N-domain has an irregular N-terminal peptide segment with residues 1–12 and an anti-parallel β-sheet (residues 19–23/28–32). The C-domain contains a short anti-parallel β-sheet (residues 36–38/44–46) and a C-terminal segment with residues 48–53, which are probably disordered in isolation. Despite structural similarity between molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit, large local differences are found in peptide segments 6–12, 22–29, and 48–51, respectively (Fig. 2 b). The most obvious difference is located at the N-terminal residues up to residue Gly12. Besides the disordered N-terminal segment with residues 1–5, residues 9–11 are well defined in molecule A, but not in molecule B. This difference may be caused by their different crystallographic environments. There are some intermolecular contacts between molecule A and a neighboring EGF molecule. They include three hydrogen bonds between residues Pro7, Ser9 of molecule A, and Val35, Cys33 of a neighboring molecule B in another asymmetric unit. However, there are no such kind of interactions between the N-terminal residues 6–11 of molecule B and any neighboring EGF molecules in the crystal. Another structural difference occurs at the surface turn with the residues 23–28 connecting the two anti-parallel β-strands of N-domain. The difference in the C-terminal peptide segment correlates with different exhibitions of electron densities for both molecules. In molecule B, residues 48–51 have clearly defined electron density, likely due to the intramolecular interactions between the residue 49 and other residues, such as the hydrogen bonds between Trp49-O and Arg45-NH1, Trp49-N and Asp46-O, whereas no electron density could be observed for residues 48–51 in molecule A. Based on electron density map and structural comparisons between molecules A and B, several segments with rigid or flexible conformations could be defined in the EGF structure. Fig. 2 band Table II show that the rigid segments include residues 13–21 and 30–47. The RMSD for Cα atoms of these residues between molecules A and B is 0.517 Å. Another indication of inherent rigidity of these regions is that the average B-values of these residues are 22.14 and 26.04 Å2 for main and side-chain atoms, respectively, compared with 30.07 and 36.59 Å2 for the whole molecule. Two disulfide bridges, Cys14–Cys31 and Cys33–Cys42, along with the highly conserved Gly18 and Gly39 play an important role for formation of the rigid region of the structure. The N-terminal segment (residues 1–12) and the residues 23–28 concerning the irregular β-turn between the two β-strands in the major β-sheet, which are adjacent to each other on the head of the EGF molecule, and the C-terminal segment (residues 48–53) belong to the flexible regions of the EGF structure.Table IICα atom RMS deviations calculated by least-square superposition between different models of the EGF structureModels comparedaA = molecule A; B = molecule B; N6.8 = mouse NMR structure at pH 6.8; N2 = mouse NMR structure at pH 2.0.RMS Deviations (Å)Residues 6–476–3233–4713–21, 30–3213–21, 30–47A & B3.2663.2570.3320.5290.517 (0.252)bThe values in parentheses are distances between Cα atoms of the residue Leu47.A & N22.5421.9961.0670.7571.694 (2.751)B & N23.9523.3121.0780.7021.754 (2.832)A & N6.82.4232.2341.8411.4662.224 (6.497)B & N6.83.7693.2351.7991.5582.313 (6.661)a A = molecule A; B = molecule B; N6.8 = mouse NMR structure at pH 6.8; N2 = mouse NMR structure at pH 2.0.b The values in parentheses are distances between Cα atoms of the residue Leu47. Open table in a new tab Comparisons by least-square superposition based on Cα atoms between the crystal and the NMR structures of EGF (9Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were performed, and the results are shown in Table II. The whole molecule with residues 6–47 (without the disordered terminal segments), N-domain (6–32), and C-domain (33–47) were compared separately. The comparisons of the crystal structure with the NMR structure at pH 2.0 have revealed that large structural differences are mainly located in the terminal segments, surface turns or loops, including residues 6–11, 24–27, 34–35, 39–40, and 45–47. The flexible peptide segments (residues 1–12, 22–29, and 48–53) were excluded from more accurate comparisons between the NMR structure at pH 2.0 and the crystal structure. The overall RMSD based on the whole molecule (residues 13–21 and 30–47) for both molecules A and B are about 1.7 Å. However, the RMSD values based on a single domain are much lower, namely, about 0.7 Å for residues 13–21 and 30–32, and about 1.07 Å for residues 33–47 (Table II). This difference may result from a relative rotation of the two domains around a hinge residue between them. The structural variation might be caused by acidic pH, thus resulting in a very different arrangement of the C-terminal segment in the EGF solution structure. Compared with the positions in the crystal structures of molecules A and B, the Cα atom of Leu47, a crucial residue for receptor binding (22Matsunami R.K. Yette M.L. Stevens A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), has moved by more than 2.75 Å in the NMR structure at pH 2.0. Regarding the comparisons with the NMR structure at pH 6.8, despite the closer pH values, the RMSD values are larger than those calculated with the NMR structure at pH 2.0 (Table II). This implies that the NMR structure at pH 6.8 may not be sufficiently accurate due to the much lower number of distance constraints used compared with calculation of the pH 2.0 NMR structure (9Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit are in close end-to-end contact and are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The buried area between the two molecules is ∼690 Å2, which might be enough to maintain two such small molecules together to form a dimer under certain circumstances. The dimerization interface concerns the minor β-sheets from the C-domains of the two molecules, forming a short four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The non-crystallographic 2-fold axis passes the center of this four-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 2 a). Leu15, His16, Tyr37, Arg41, Gln43, Tyr44, Arg45, and Leu47 from both hEGF molecules are involved in the intermolecular interface in the potential EGF dimer, although partial surfaces of side chains for some of these residues may be accessible. Besides the hydrogen bonds formed by atoms Gln43-O and Arg45-N in the four-stranded β-sheet, there are additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds between atoms His16-NE2 and Tyr37-OH in the dimer. The crystal structure of hEGF determined at near physiological pH shares the main features of the NMR structure of mEGF determined at pH 2.0, but structural comparisons between different models revealed further details of the EGF structure. The structural differences of hEGF molecules A and B have shown detailed flexibility of the residues 22–29 in the hEGF structure. The structural comparison with the NMR structure at pH 2.0 may provide the first indication of the existence of relative movement between the N-domain and the C-domain of the EGF molecule."

The mechanisms allowing pathogens to withstand the toxic prooxidant environment within the phagolysosome are poorly understood. We have cloned and characterized three antioxidant genes belonging to the 2-Cys family of peroxidoxins from Leishmania chagasi that may prove to provide these parasites with an enhanced defense mechanism against toxic oxidants. The 5′-untranslated regions and coding regions of each gene are highly conserved, whereas the 3′-untranslated regions have diverged significantly.

LcPxn1 appears to exist as high molecular weight multimers in vivo, and recombinant LcPxn1 was shown to detoxify hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides.

These proteins do not possess antioxidant activities found in other well known antioxidants. Peroxidoxins do not contain metal ions as seen in superoxide dismutases, they do not contain selenium-like glutathione peroxidases, nor do they contain heme like catalases (1Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene sequence and protein functions of peroxidoxins are highly conserved among organisms and are currently classified into two groups: 1-Cys and 2-Cys. The 1-Cys peroxidoxins contain a conserved cysteine residue in the amino-terminal region of the protein at amino acid position 47, whereas the 2-Cys peroxidoxin, in addition to the conserved cysteine 47 residue, also contains a second conserved cysteine residue in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein at amino acid position 170. Peroxidoxins exist predominantly as homodimers arranged in a head-to-tail orientation; however, evidence exists of multimeric forms of peroxidoxins (2Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H.

So far, the substrates of peroxidoxin include hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides (e.g. cumene andt-butyl hydroperoxides) (6McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. James E.R. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (7Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action for the detoxification of these substrates involves the oxidation of the Cys47 residue to form a sulfenic acid intermediate, which then reacts with the adjacent thiol group of the opposing subunit (Cys47 for 1-Cys peroxidoxins and Cys170 for the 2-Cys peroxidoxins) to form an intermolecular disulfide bond (6McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. James E.R. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, a third type of peroxidoxin protein has been reported that resembles the 1-Cys peroxidoxins, where instead of forming an intermolecular disulfide bond with the adjacent monomer, it forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with a cysteine residue whose surrounding residues do not share homology with any of the conserved cysteine motifs found in other peroxidoxins from other species (8Seo M.S.

The reported substrates of peroxidoxins suggest that they may play key roles in the defense against oxidative stress. H2O2, hydroperoxides, and ONOO−are all extremely reactive by-products from the molecular reduction of O2 during normal cell metabolism and within the phagolysosomes of phagocytic cells during the respiratory burst. These molecules can be produced in many reactions such as Reactions 1–R4.O2+Fe2+→O⨪2+Fe3+2O⨪2+2H+→H2O2+O2O2+NO−→ONOO−NO⋅+O⨪2→ONOO−REACTIONS1–4A molecule that is of great concern to all cells is the hydroxyl radical (⋅OH). Due to its large reduction potential, ⋅OH is the most biologically reactive molecule known to exist. ⋅OH can be produced as a result of numerous reactions such as Reactions 5–R9.O2−+H2O2→⋅OH+O2+−OHO2−+H2O2→⋅OH+O2+−OHH2O2+UV→2⋅OHO2−+H2O2→⋅OH+O2+−OHO2−+H2O2→⋅OH+O2+−OHREACTIONS5–9⋅OH reacts with all biological targets at diffusion-limited rates and like other prooxidants can lead to the peroxidation of lipids, lethal damage to DNA, and the oxidation of sugars and protein thiols (9Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). To date, no clear evidence for an enzymatic defense against⋅OH has been demonstrated. Most intracellular pathogens are heavily equipped with antioxidant defenses such as superoxide dismutase, catalases, and glutathione peroxidases in order to withstand the toxic prooxidant environment of the phagolysosome. However, many intracellular pathogens such asLeishmania lack detectable catalases and glutathione peroxidases. Leishmania is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite of mammalian macrophages. The parasites exist in two forms during their life cycle. The extracellular promastigote form is found to survive in the gut of its sandfly vector and is inoculated into its host during the bite of the sandfly. It is phagocytosed by cells such as macrophages and transforms into the intracellular amastigote form. Phagocytosis of these parasites is accompanied by an oxidative burst that results in the production of all of the reactive prooxidants aforementioned in Reactions 1–R9 (10Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Immunol. Ser. 1994; 60: 159-178PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, Leishmania parasites and other intracellular pathogens must evade the toxic effects of these prooxidants in order to survive and establish an infection. We have previously reported thatLeishmania chagasi possesses iron superoxide dismutases, which act as a first line of defense against O⨪2 (11Paramchuk W.J. Ismail S.O. Bhatia A. Gedamu L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but no efficient defense against H2O2, hydroperoxides, ONOO−, or ⋅OH has been demonstrated. This paper presents the isolation and characterization of three different peroxidoxins from L. chagasi and is the first report of the differential expression of multiple peroxidoxins in Trypanosomatids. We demonstrate that one of the recombinant L. chagasiperoxidoxins (LcPxn1)1 can detoxify both H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxidesin vitro. In addition, we present for the first time clear evidence that LcPxn1 can enzymatically detoxify ⋅OH in vitro. All enzymes, [α-32P]dCTP, Hybond N+, Rapid-Hyb buffer, and protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA and RNA molecular weight markers, agarose and parasite medium, and medium supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals unless stated otherwise were of the highest purity and purchased from Sigma. Nucleic acid quantifications were done using the Beckman DU 640 Spectrophotometer. L. chagasi (MHOM/BR/00/1669) andLeishmania donovani (1S2D kindly provided by Dr. Greg Matlashewski) promastigote parasites were cultured at 26 °C in minimal essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, minimal essential medium, essential and nonessential amino acids, glucose, sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal calf serum (inactivated at 58 °C for 30 min), 20 μg/ml Hemin, and 35 mm Hepes sodium salt (hemoflagellate minimal essential medium). Promastigotes were seeded at 1 × 106/ml and harvested at logarithmic or stationary phase, defined according to morphological characteristics as previously described (12Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated fromL. chagasi and L. donovani logarithmic promastigotes by lysing parasites in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). RNase A (100 μg ml−1) (Sigma) was added to the suspension and incubated overnight at 37 °C, after which 100 μg ml−1proteinase K (Sigma) was added and incubated at 42 °C overnight. The DNA was extracted with a phenol-chloroform treatment and ethanol-precipitated. Two primers were designed based on the sequences surrounding the two conserved cysteine residues (Cys52 and Cys173) of the 2-Cys family of peroxidoxins previously isolated from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense(GenBankTM accession number U26666): sense primer 1 (5′-TATTCGGATCCTCTCGACTTCACGTTTGTGTGCCCC-3′; antisense primer 2 (5′-TCCAGGGATCCAGTTAGCGGGGCACACCTCACCGTG-3′ (underlined sequence refers to T. brucei peroxidoxin sequence). The amino acid sequence surrounding the conserved cysteine residues in the primers are as follows: sense primer 1,45PLDFTFVCP53; antisense primer 2,169HGEVCPAN176 (underlined C represents Cys52 and Cys173, respectively). Primer 1 and primer 2 were used to PCR-amplify L. chagasiand L. donovani genomic DNA (94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min; 72 °C for 10 min) using a PHC-2 Dri-Block Cycler (Techne, Cambridge, UK). The amplified product (∼350 bp) was gel-purified and sequenced using a PCR cycle sequencing kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). L. chagasi genomic DNA was digested to completion. Restriction fragments ∼9–25 kb in size were extracted using standard low melting point-agarose protocol (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PurifiedBamHI fragments were cloned into Lambda DASHII DNA and packaged as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The ∼350-bp PCR fragment isolated above was randomly labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the T7 Quick Prime Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe to screen the Lambda DASHIIBamHI library for an individual clone containing the peroxidoxin cluster. ∼105 plaque-forming units were plated, and duplicate filters were lifted. Potential positive clones were treated to secondary screening to recover isolated clones. Isolated clones were amplified using standard protocols (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and DNA was extracted using a Lambda Maxi Kit (Qiagen). The λ DNA was digested with SalI, and a pGEM-2 plasmid library was constructed using the SalI-restricted fragments (Promega). Several potential positive clones were characterized by restriction digestion analysis and sequencing using T3, T7, and various internal primers (University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Similarly, amastigote cDNA libraries fromL. chagasi and L. donovani were screened to obtain full-length cDNAs. DNA from the isolated clones was recovered into pBluescript (pBS) vector using an in vivoexcision procedure utilizing R408 helper phage and Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA). The sequences of all isolated clones have been deposited in GenBankTM with the following accession numbers: LcPxn1, AF134161; LcPxn2, AF312397; LcPxn3, AF312398; LdPxn1, AF205887 (L. donovani clone). Genomic DNA was restricted with various enzymes and separated on a 1% agarose gel. The DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ via capillary action (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and fixed with long wave ultraviolet light for 5 min. The blots were blocked with Rapid-Hyb buffer and incubated at 65 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes for 2 h, after which the blots were washed successively with decreasing salt concentrations at 65 °C for 15 min each wash. Total RNA was isolated from promastigotes using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of total RNA was separated in a 1.2% formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, transferred onto Hybond N+ membrane via capillary action, and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. The blots were blocked with Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at 62 °C with [α-32P]dCTP random prime-labeled DNA probes for 2 h, after which the blots were washed with decreasing salt concentrations at 62 °C for 15 min each wash. All RNA blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled α-tubulin as a loading control (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Wilson (University of Iowa, Iowa City). Blots were exposed to film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.). The prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to express LcPxn1 as a GST fusion inE. coli DH5α cells. The coding region of LcPxn1 was amplified by PCR using the sense primer (Pxn1ATG) 5′-ACCAGGGATCCATGTCCTGCGGTGACGCC-3′ and the antisense primer (Pxn1TAA) 5′-ACATCGGATCCTTACTTATTGTGATCGACCTTCAGGCC-3′. Both primers contained a BamHI site (underlined) to facilitate insertion of the amplified product into the pGEX-2T vector using standard techniques (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pGEX-2T vector alone and the recombinant pGEX-2T/LcPxn1 vector were used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. Transformed cells were grown shaking at 37 °C in Luria-Burtani broth containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin for 8 h, after which 0.2 mm IPTG was added to the culture and shaken overnight. Fusion protein (GST-LcPxn1) and GST protein alone were harvested by sonication and passing over a glutathione-agarose resin column (Sigma) as described by Smith and Johnson (15Smith D.R. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The GST-LcPxn1 fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin (50 cleavage units/ml of bed resin) overnight at 24 °C and passed over a glutathione-agarose column to remove excess GST protein. Protein purity was determined on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). ∼200 μg of recombinant GST-LcPxn1 protein was purified from a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, crushed in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. The first injection was done in combination with complete Freund's adjuvant; monthly injections thereafter were done in combination with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Bleeds were taken 7 days after boosters until an acceptable titer was obtained for Western blot analysis. Hydrogen peroxide metabolism was measured as described by Thurman et al. (16Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm dithioerythritol, 50 μmH2O2 (or 50 μm t-butylhydroperoxide or 50 μm cumene hydroperoxide), and various concentrations of protein. Immediately prior to the addition of the peroxides to the reaction, the recombinant peroxidoxin protein was incubated with 0.2 mmdithioerythritol for 30 min at 37 °C in order to reduce the disulfide bridges formed between the catalytic cysteine residues. The reaction was stopped at various time intervals with the addition of 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). After the precipitated protein was removed with a quick spin, 0.2 ml of 10 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 0.1 ml of 2.5 mpotassium thiocyanate were added to the reactions and mixed thoroughly. Peroxide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 480 nm using known amounts of peroxide (1–50 μm) as a standard. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. 3 μmFeCl3 and 0.1 mm EDTA were allowed to react for 10 min at 37 °C to generate ⋅OH as described by Lim et al. (17Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Uhm T.B. Park J.W. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 0.5 mg/ml recombinant protein (preincubated with 0.2 mm dithioerythritol for 30 min at 37 °C) was then added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Peroxidoxin was inactivated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C immediately before adding it to the experimental assay. 2 μg of pGEM-2 plasmid (Promega) was then added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel at 100-V constant voltage. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. The production of⋅OH and the ⋅OH-induced damage of 2-deoxy-d-ribose were measured using the protocol described by Halliwell and Gutteridge (18Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). A 50-μl reaction mixture was set up to contain the following components to give the final concentrations as stated: 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4); 63 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm 2-deoxy-d-ribose; 0.2 mm dithioerythritol; 0.125 μg/μl peroxidoxin (preincubated in 0.2 mm dithioerythritol for 30 min at 37 °C). 21 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate was added to initiate the reaction, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. 100 μl of thiobarbituric acid (1% w/v) and 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (2.8%, w/v) were then added to the mixture and boiled for 10 min. Tubes were quick spun, and the fluorescence was then measured in a 96-well plate using a SpectraMax Gemini plate reader (Molecular Devices) with six reads/well (excitation = 532 nm; emission = 553 nm). All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. The amino acid sequences surrounding the two cysteine residues of 2-Cys peroxidoxins from a variety of organisms are highly conserved (6McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. James E.R. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Two primers were designed containing some of the conserved amino acids surrounding Cys52 and Cys173 from the 2-Cys peroxidoxin from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The Cys52 and Cys173residues are equivalent to the conserved Cys47 and Cys170 residues observed in other 2-Cys peroxidoxins. Primer 1 and primer 2 were used to PCR-amplify genomic DNA fromL. chagasi. A single ∼350-bp PCR product was obtained, and sequence analysis of the PCR fragment revealed 90.0% identity to the corresponding amino acid sequence between the two conserved cysteine residues of the Leishmania major peroxidoxin cDNA (19Webb J.R. Campos-Neto A. Ovendale P.J. Martin T.I. Stromberg E.J. Badaro R. Reed S.G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3279-3289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Levick M.P. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A Southern blot hybridization using the ∼350-bp PCR product as a probe was performed on total DNA from L. chagasi andL. donovani that was subjected to restriction digestion withBamHI, PstI, SacII, andSalI enzymes (Fig. 1). The hybridization pattern of the peroxidoxin probe appears to be very similar between L. chagasi and L. donovani. The hybridization pattern observed in Fig. 1 also reveals that the peroxidoxins are part of a multigene family and that the entire peroxidoxin cluster is contained within a single ∼23-kbBamHI restriction fragment in both strains. Partial restriction digestions with SacII, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot analyses using various different probes suggest that there are approximately six peroxidoxin genes all present on one chromosome in both L. chagasi and L. donovani (data not shown). From Fig.1 it was apparent that the entire L. chagasi peroxidoxin cluster is contained within a ∼23-kb BamHI restriction fragment. In order to obtain full-length peroxidoxin clones, a Lambda DASHII library was constructed containing large BamHI fragments. Using the ∼350-bp PCR product as a probe, a λ clone containing the peroxidoxin cluster was isolated. The λ clone was digested with SalI, and a pGEM-2 plasmid library was constructed and screened for bacterial clones containing peroxidoxin fragments. Sequence analysis of several clones revealed three different peroxidoxin genes: LcPxn1, LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 (Fig.2, A and B). In parallel, amastigote cDNA libraries from L. chagasi andL. donovani were screened. The sequence of several potential positive clones from each library corresponded to the sequence of LcPxn1 that was obtained from the genomic clones. The 5′-UTR, coding region, and 3′-UTR sequences of the clone LdPxn1 obtained from theL. donovani amastigote library were 100% identical to the LcPxn1 clone. Blast searches of LcPxn1, LcPxn2, and LcPxn3 amino acid sequences revealed significant homology to several other 2-Cys peroxidoxins from other organisms, particularly the amino acid sequence surrounding Cys52 and Cys173 (Fig.2 C). LcPxn1 consists of 190 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 21.3 kDa and theoretical pI = 6.31. Both LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 consist of 199 amino acids each with predicted molecular masses of 22.1 kDa and a theoretical pI of 7.6. The coding region of LcPxn1 is 89.4% similar to the coding regions of LcPxn2 and LcPxn3, whereas LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 are 99.5% identical to each other, the difference being a single amino acid change at amino acid position 199 (Gln in LcPxn2; Leu in LcPxn3). The carboxyl ends of LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 have diverged significantly from LcPxn1. The carboxyl terminus of LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 contains a nine-amino acid extension that is not present in LcPxn1. At the end of this extension in LcPxn3 is a putative glycosomal targeting signal sequence (SKL) (21Sommer J.M. Cheng Q-L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the one amino acid substitution (Leu for Gln) at the carboxyl terminus of LcPxn2 does not appear to code for a putative glycosomal targeting sequence or any other targeting sequence (21Sommer J.M. Cheng Q-L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). LcPxn1 lacks the nine-amino acid extension found in LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 and does not appear to possess any putative organelle targeting signal sequences. The 239 nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codons of each peroxidoxin gene are virtually identical (data not shown), whereas the 3′-UTRs are very different (Fig. 2 B). 2S. D. Barr and L. Gedamu, unpublished results. These results suggest that there are at least three different, yet highly conserved, 2-Cys peroxidoxins in L. chagasi. To study the expression pattern of peroxidoxin mRNA as the parasites progress through their life cycle, we isolated total RNA from parasites at early logarithmic phase, stationary phase, and amastigote stage (mimicked by infecting U937 macrophage-like cells). The amount of RNA loaded in each lane was normalized with a constitutively expressed α-tubulin probe (Fig. 3 E). Northern blot analysis of this total RNA using the LcPxn1 coding region as the probe revealed the presence of two different sized transcripts (∼1.6 and ∼2.4 kb) that were differentially expressed (Fig. 3 A). A 3′-UTR-specific probe from LcPxn1 hybridized to a ∼1.6-kb transcript and, after taking into account the loading controls, revealed a visually significant increase in intensity from the early logarithmic phase to the amastigote phase (Fig. 3 B). A 3′-UTR-specific probe from LcPxn2 hybridized to a ∼2.4-kb sized transcript but conversely demonstrated a significant decrease in intensity from the early logarithmic to the amastigote phase (Fig. 3 C). A 3′-UTR-specific probe from LcPxn3 hybridized to a ∼1.6-kb transcript and revealed a similar pattern of expression to the LcPxn2 transcript with a significant decrease in intensity from the early logarithmic phase to the amastigote phase (Fig. 3 D). LcPxn3 transcripts appeared to be significantly less abundant than LcPxn2 after taking into account the specific activity of the probe and that the blot had to be exposed to film for 3 days to obtain a signal with intensity close to LcPxn1 and LcPxn2. The presence of the LcPxn3 band in the Northern blot using the coding region of LcPxn1 was evident after a 3-day exposure (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that LcPxn1 is predominantly expressed in the amastigote stage, while LcPxn2 and LcPxn3 are expressed predominantly in the promastigote stage ofL. chagasi. Similar studies with RNA isolated from L. donovani revealed an identical pattern of peroxidoxin mRNA expression (data not shown). The coding region of LcPxn1 was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2T and used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. Induction of the protein expression system with 0.2 mm IPTG at 24 °C overnight resulted in a majority of the fusion protein being expressed in the soluble form (Fig.4, lanes 1 and2). Recombinant GST-LcPxn1 fusion protein was isolated by passage over glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 4, lane 3), cleaved with thrombin, and further purified by passage over fresh glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 4, lane 4). Purified LcPxn1 protein migrated with a molecular mass of ∼22 kDa under denaturing conditions, which correlates well with the predicted molecular mass of 21.3 kDa. To ascertain whether LcPxn1 mRNA is translated into protein within L. chagasiparasites, stationary phase parasite extract was separated on a polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. Western blot analysis using crude LcPxn1 polyclonal antibody resulted in a diffuse band ∼22 kDa in size (Fig. 4 B). The appearance of a diffuse band could be indicative of a high abundance of LcPxn1 protein and/or cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibody with other peroxidoxin proteins. Peroxidoxins are known to exist predominantly as homodimers in many organisms (6McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. James E.R. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), so we wanted to determine if this was the case with L. chagasi peroxidoxins. Recombinant LcPxn1 protein was separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. A Coomassie stain of this gel revealed three distinct bands ranging from ∼80 to 140 kDa (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). To determine whether this was an artifact from purification of the protein, we performed a Western blot using crude recombinant LcPxn1 antibody and parasite extract separated under nondenaturing conditions. A diffuse band was observed ranging from ∼100 to 180 kDa (Fig. 4 D, lane 2). Taken together, these results suggest that L. chagasiperoxidoxins may exist as high molecular weight multimers in vivo, a finding also observed for peroxidoxins in Crithidia fasciculata (2Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), human erythrocytes (3Sch der E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Er"

Phototransduction occurs both in rod and cone photoreceptors. During rod phototransduction, rhodopsin-activated transducin activates cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE),1 which leads to the hydrolysis of cGMP and closure of the cGMP-gated transmembrane cationic channels causing hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and photoreceptor signaling (1Pugh E.J. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The rod photoreceptor-specific cGMP-PDE is a membrane-associated heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic α- and β-subunits and two inhibitory γ-subunits (2Fung B.K.K. Young J.H. Yamane H.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each of these subunits is essential for normal cGMP-PDE activity required for phototransduction and the maintenance of retinal health. Mutations in the β-subunit of cGMP-PDE (β-PDE) are currently the most common known cause of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (3Farber D.B. Danciger M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the β-PDE gene result in congenital stationary night blindness (4Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schqwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and retinal degeneration in animal models (5Bowes C. Li T. Danciger M. Baxter L.C. Applebury M.L.

Recently, genetic defects in transcription mechanisms that control the expression of several retina-specific genes have been linked to different types of retinal disorders (9Swain P.K. Chen S.

Thus, it became important to elucidate the molecular events that regulate transcription of the β-PDE gene, because abnormalities in these control mechanisms may be detrimental for photoreceptor function and structural integrity. The objective of this investigation was to determine thecis-acting elements and the trans-acting nuclear proteins interacting with them that control the rod photoreceptor-specific transcription of the β-PDE gene using a combination of different in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches rather than a single experimental strategy. We employed the well characterized human photoreceptor-derived Y79 retinoblastoma cells, a convenient cell culture system for studying transcriptional regulation of retina-specific genes (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unlike mature photoreceptors, Y79 cells are not postmitotic and endogenously express both rod and cone phototransduction proteins including rod-specific β-PDE (14Di Polo A. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4016-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, we utilized transient transfections in dissectedXenopus laevis embryo heads maintained in culture ex vivo to study the β-PDE gene transcriptional mechanisms in the retina in situ. Although of amphibian origin, many of the photoreceptor-specific genes and their regulatory elements have been evolutionarily conserved between Xenopusand mammals (15Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For in vivo studies, we generated transgenic Xenopus tadpoles carrying various lengths of β-PDE 5′-flanking region/GFP constructs. Unlike many other experimental animal models such as mouse, there is an abundance of cone photoreceptors in Xenopus retina, which provided an excellent background for differential expression and visualization of rod-specific β-PDE promoter/GFP transgenes. The results of the various experimental approaches employed here showed that the promoter-proximal sequence from −93 to +53 was necessary and sufficient for supporting a high level of rod-specific gene expression. Two functionally relevant control elements were demonstrated within this region: βAp1/NRE containing the consensus AP-1 binding sequence partially described in the β-PDE promoter previously (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and a G/C-rich sequence, β/GC. Interactions of these ciselements with Nrl and Sp1/Sp4 DNA-binding proteins, respectively, were demonstrated and characterized in vitro. Altogether, this study provides useful insight into the combinatorial mechanisms of rod photoreceptor-specific regulation of the β-PDE gene transcription. The close agreement of the results obtained in X. laevis and in human Y79 retinoblastoma cells (both of which produce endogenous β-PDE) demonstrates the utility of these model systems for studying retinal gene expression and suggests that similar transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the β-PDE gene regulation in the amphibian and human retina. Mutant and wild-type β-PDE5′-flanking sequences were generated by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers and inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) as described previously (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion construct nomenclature (e.g. −93 to +53) refers to the 5′-most and 3′-most nucleotides in the subcloned fragment. Nucleotide substitutions were generated within the context of the −72/+53 sequence and designated by the mutated nucleotides (e.g. −51 to −49m contained substitutions in nucleotides −51 to −49). Constructs to be used for the generation of transgenic Xenopus tadpoles, pβPDE(−1356/+53)GFP and pβPDE(−93/+53)GFP, were created in the modified pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All inserts were fully sequenced in both directions to assure their identity to the β-PDE 5′-flanking region. Mutated nucleotides shown as underlined sequences are summarized at the top of each respective transfection figure. The Xenopus opsin promoter (XOP) inserted in the pGL2-Basic vector, pXOP(−503/+41)luc has been described previously (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pMT3-based expression plasmids encoding the full-length human Nrl (pMT-NRL) and the t-Nrl truncated protein with an in-frame deletion of the N-terminal P/S/T-rich region (pMT-DD10) were obtained from Dr. Anand Swaroop. t-Nrl has been reported to lack the transactivation potential of Nrl while retaining the DNA-binding and dimerization activities (18Rehemtulla A. Warwar R. Kumar R. Ji X. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The pRC/CMV-Sp1 and pRC/CMV-Sp4 plasmids expressing the wild-type Sp1 and Sp4 proteins, respectively, were gifts from Dr. Guntram Suske. In cotransfection experiments, empty expression vectors containing no inserts were used to maintain a constant amount of DNA per transfection. Xenopusembryos were prepared and transiently transfected essentially as described before (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the embryos were conceived in vitro by applying crushed Xenopus testicular tissue to the surface of freshly laid eggs contained in 10-cm glass Petri dishes. Fertilized eggs were grown at 22 °C until embryonic stages 24–28. Groups of 10–12 embryo heads dissected under the microscope in 1× MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH to 7.4) were transferred to divalent cation-free 0.1× MMR (10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm HEPES, pH to 7.4) and treated with a mixture of 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 0.5–3 min, depending on the embryo stage and batch, to create extracellular spaces and facilitate the access of the transfection mixture containing plasmid DNA to the embryonic retinal tissue. Transient transfections were performed usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Embryo heads were incubated with the transfection mixture containing 10 μg of DNA and 30 μl of DOTAP overnight, and the transfection medium was then replaced by a fresh 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented medium. Incubation was continued until 72–80 h post-fertilization. At this stage rod photoreceptors have differentiated, grown their outer segments, and are expressing the phototransduction cascade proteins (19Lolley R.N. Farber D.B. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Science. 1977; 196: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Embryo heads were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Two to four independent groups of heads were used for each DNA construct. Protein extracts from the transfected embryos were prepared in 10 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) per embryo. Duplicate aliquots of 10 μl each (equivalent to one embryo) were assayed for luciferase activity according to the standard assay procedure (Promega). Comparisons between various constructs were analyzed using analysis of variance. It was shown previously that the sample mean luciferase activity is sufficiently accurate without using an additional normalization control (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pXOP(−503/+41)luc construct was used as positive control and the promoterless pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) as negative control. As an additional control for specificity of retinal cell-type expression, the −93 to +53 construct was transfected in dissected Xenopus embryo trunks as described (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TransgenicXenopus were produced using restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) as described previously (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA [pβPDE(−1356/+53)GFP or pβPDE(−93/+53)GFP] was linearized withXhoI to enable its incorporation into the sperm chromatin and purified using High Pure polymerase chain reaction product purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with final elution in water. An interphase egg cytoplasmic extract was added to the sperm nuclei/DNA/XhoI mixture to partially decondense the chromatin for its restriction digestion and to provide ligating activity for transgene incorporation. The mixture (10 nl containing on the average one sperm nucleus) was injected into the animal poles of freshly collected and cysteine-dejellied Xenopus eggs. Several hours later, embryos that underwent normal cleavage and formed healthy neurulae were selected, transferred to a separate dish, and cultured in 0.1× MMR at 18–20 °C until approximately stage 41 (3–4 days). At that point nonmosaic green fluorescence above the weak background fluorescence from the yolk was observed in the eyes of all transgenic animals examined. The animals were grown further for 4–6 weeks until the rod photoreceptors measured >40 μm and became morphologically identifiable. Tadpoles were maintained in 0.1× MMR until metamorphosis (∼3 months at this temperature). The animals were observed for GFP fluorescence at multiple stages of development by two investigators who independently judged the expression levels. The presence of the transgene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA from a tail segment. Based on ethidium bromide staining, each animal harbored 5–20 copies of the transgene. Normal GFP-positive transgenic tadpoles were fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen sections (10–15-μm thickness) from eight transgenic animals were photographed under bright-field and fluorescent lighting conditions (20Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The images were acquired and the figures were processed using Photoshop application software (Adobe). The brightness and contrast of the images from the various transgenic tadpoles were adjusted to visualize the cellular morphology and identify the cell type expressing the GFP reporter. Y79 human retinoblastoma, 293 human embryonic kidney, and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Y79 retinoblastoma cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Y79 retinoblastoma cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293 embryonic kidney cells were transfected similarly except a glycerol shock was used to enhance transfection efficiency. All transfection reactions included the pCMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid as an internal normalization control for variations in transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed, and the relative luciferase activity was calculated as described elsewhere (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments were performed in Y79 human retinoblastoma and 293 human embryonic kidney cells. The ratios of the reporter vector to expression plasmid were determined empirically. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant at 15 μg/60-mm plate by the addition of carrier plasmid DNA. Triplicate plates were used for all transfections, and the experiments were repeated at least twice. The HeLa, 293 human embryonic kidney, and Y79 human retinoblastoma cell crude nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure described previously (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts were also prepared from adult mouse (age 2–3 months) retina, brain, and liver. All nuclear extracts were stored as concentrated stock at −80 °C and were active for at least 1 year. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out essentially as described previously (16Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For making the probe, pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized. Both strands were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and purified prior to annealing. Specific oligonucleotide sequences are shown at the bottom of EMSAs in the figures, and further details are provided in the legends. Numeric designations refer to the positions of corresponding nucleotides in the β-PDE 5′-flanking region. Each binding reaction mixture contained ∼2 ng of labeled DNA probe with 1–5 × 105 cpm, 5 μg of nuclear extract, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When appropriate, competitors were added to the reaction mixture 5 min before the addition of the probe followed by incubation with the probe for another 30 min at room temperature. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C, in 0.25× TBE buffer (22 mm Tris borate and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). For the supershift experiments, antibodies (see “Immunoblots and Antibodies”) were added to the nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature, and the incubation was continued after the addition of the probe for another 30 min at room temperature. Anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp4 antibodies recognize both human and murine proteins but do not cross-react with each other or other Sp family members (TransCruz gel supershift reagent, Santa Cruz, CA). The α2.3-Nrl antiserum prepared against full-length Nrl was provided by Dr. Thomas Kerppola. Polyclonal antibodies against conserved regions of c-Jun and c-Fos were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For Western blot analysis, 60 μg of nuclear protein extract was loaded per lane and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed using the primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Vector Labs) were used at 1:500 dilution. To determine whether the human β-PDEpromoter is active in Xenopus embryos and to test whether the proximal promoter region from −93 to +53 bp is sufficient to direct high levels of transcription as we proposed previously (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), promoter activity was analyzed using ex vivo transient transfection assays in Xenopus embryos. Human β-PDE promoter constructs from −1356 to +53, −350 to +53, or −93 to +53 were transfected into dissected Xenopusembryo heads as lipid-DNA complexes. Compared with the strongXenopus −503 to +41 opsin promoter used as positive control, prominent luciferase activity was observed with all the human β-PDE promoters tested but not with the promoterless control vector (Fig.1 A). The different length promoters showed similar levels of reporter gene expression. Thus, the human β-PDE promoter was active in the heterologousXenopus transfection system at levels high enough to allow for its mutational analysis. In contrast, the −93 to +53 construct showed no activity above background when transfected inXenopus embryo trunks that contain many different cell types including developing neurons. This provides an additional control for retina-specific expression of the β-PDE promoter. The results obtained in the transfections of human β-PDEpromoters constructs in Xenopus embryos were similar to those observed in transfections of human Y79 retinoblastoma cells (Fig.1 B). Both Xenopus and Y79 cell transfection systems exhibited slightly higher levels of transcriptional activity with the −93 to +53 sequence than with the longer −1356 to +53 fragment, confirming our previous findings (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test whether the −93 to +53 region was sufficient to support rod-specific gene expression in vivo, two β-PDEpromoter/GFP constructs (−1356 to +53 and −93 to +53) were introduced into Xenopus laevis by recombinant enzyme-mediated integration transgenesis (17Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple transgenic animals were generated with each of the two β-PDE promoter/GFP constructs (a total of 43) and evaluated for GFP fluorescence in different organs and tissues using a fluorescence dissecting microscope. Strong GFP expression was observed in the eyes of all animals carrying either the long or short β-PDE promoter transgene (data not shown and Fig. 2). The −1356 to +53 transgenic tadpoles also exhibited faint GFP expression in the brain and occasionally in the spinal cord. The −93 to +53 β-PDE/GFP transgene showed a more restricted pattern of expression with green fluorescence observed only in the eye even after long exposures. GFP expression was stable through metamorphosis, because clear fluorescence could be seen in the eyes of 3-cm-long froglets. One of the inherent limitations of the evaluation of GFP expression inXenopus tadpoles is a low level of background tissue autofluorescence (yellow-green) observed in all animals that may mask low levels of GFP expression. In addition, although it seemed that the levels of GFP fluorescence were consistently higher in the eyes of the −93 to +53 transgenic tadpoles than in those of the −1356 to +53 tadpoles, it was not possible to directly quantify expression in different animals. Each animal carried a variable number of transgenes integrated in different loci and in a different array. Rather, these results are useful for demonstrating tissue and cellular distribution of the GFP reporter expression driven by the different β-PDE promoter constructs. They should be considered in combination with ex vivo transfections in Xenopusembryos that allow quantitative comparison of the levels of luciferase reporter expression produced by the same β-PDE regulatory sequences. To identify the cell types expressing GFP, transverse sections of the eyes were analyzed by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. The levels of fluorescence were generally brighter in the −93 to +53 animals, and the exposure time for the −1356 to +53 sections was longer to compensate for this. Expression of the reporter gene was confined to the photoreceptor cells in the retina with either −1356 to +53 or −93 to +53 β-PDE upstream regions irrespective of the relative differences in fluorescence levels (data not shown and Fig. 2). Furthermore, the GFP-positive cells were identified as rod photoreceptors; they exhibited long outer segments characteristic of rods and lacked the oil droplets found only in cones (22Saxen L. Annales Acad. Sci. Fen. A. 1954; 23: 5-23Google Scholar, 23Bowmaker J.K. Knowles A. Vision Res. 1977; 17: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Ohtsuka T. Neurosci. Lett. 1984; 52: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Zhang J. Kleinschmidt J. Sun P. Witkovsky P. Vis. Neurosci. 1994; 11: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). None of the animals demonstrated a mosaic expression pattern. Thus, in transgenic Xenopus, the human β-PDE 5′-flanking region confers rod-specific expression of GFP. As an initial step toward localizing the control elements relevant to transcriptional regulation of the β-PDE gene, multiple 5′-deletion mutants were constructed and tested in the two different transfection systems, Xenopus embryos and cultured Y79 retinoblastoma cells (Fig. 3). Transient transfection assays in Y79 cells confirmed and expanded the results from previous experiments (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A deletion from −93 to −72, possibly containing part of an extended NRE-like sequence (26Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in 2- and 2.5-fold reduction of luciferase activity in Y79 cells and in Xenopus embryos, respectively. A further decrease in promoter activity was observed when the −72 to −61 sequence was deleted, which entirely eliminated the putative βAp1/NRE element, supporting its functional role. Thus, the substantial reduction in activity observed with promoter deletion from −93 to −61 suggests that an extended βAp1/NRE sequence may be present in the β-PDE promoter, similar to the extended NRE in the rhodopsin promoter (26Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar), which may have a stronger transactivation potential than the short −69/−63 AP-1-like sequence. In addition to the −69/−64 mutation shown to decrease the β-PDEpromoter activity (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), nucleotide substitutions at −62/−61 also demonstrated a reduction in promoter activity, suggesting that these nucleotides are part of the extended βAp1/NRE element (data not shown). Deletion of 16 bp from −61 to −45 resulted in a further significant decrease of luciferase activity of ∼4-fold in Y79 cells and ∼6-fold in Xenopus embryos. The deletion of this region eliminates a G/C-rich sequence similar to the consensus Sp-binding site that interacts with members of the Sp family of zinc finger transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. This region is evolutionarily conserved between the murine and human β-PDE genes suggesting its functional role. We had reported previously a protein-DNA complex detected in EMSA at the β-PDEpromoter-proximal AP-1-like site using a Y79 cell nuclear extract and a short 15-bp oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the −72/−58 sequence of the β-PDE 5′-flanking region. However, the identity of its protein component remained unknown (13Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using a longer β-PDE probe extending from −80 to −53, the βAp1/NRE probe, we performed further EMSA analyses of the βAp1/NRE-protein interactions. Utilization of a longer probe was important because a consensus AP-1 motif may potentially bind multiple ubiquitous AP-1-binding proteins, but the formation of a specific protein-βAp1/NRE complex may be enhanced by the flanking sequences. In fact, flanking sequences are crucially involved in the interactions of Nrl with the NRE site in the rhodopsin promoter (26Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar). Three retarded bands were observed when the radiolabeled βAp1/NRE probe was used (Fig.4 A). To identify which complexes were associated with the putative βAp1/NRE element, we used unlabeled βAp1/NRE oligonucleotides with and without transversion substitutions in −69/−64 and mβAp1/NRE as well as the human rhodopsin NRE sequence as competitors in EMSA. Although the wild-t"

We demonstrate that the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, supports the formation of an isolable leading strand complex that loads and replicates the lagging strand only in the presence of ATP, β, and the single-stranded DNA binding protein. The single endogenous DnaX complex within DNA polymerase III holoenzyme assembles β onto both the leading and lagging strand polymerases by an ordered mechanism. The dimeric replication complex disassembles in the opposite order from which it assembled. Upon ATPγS-induced dissociation, the leading strand polymerase is refractory to disassembly allowing cycling to occur exclusively on the lagging strand. These results establish holoenzyme as an intrinsic asymmetric dimer with distinguishable leading and lagging strand polymerases."

They play an important role in innate and acquired immune responses through the release of dense granules upon activation. Mast cell activation has also been implicated as a mediator of asthma and other inflammatory diseases. The major components of mast cell secretory granules are the tryptase serine proteases (1Schwartz L. Lewis R. Austen K. J. Biol.

The β-tryptases share greater than 99% sequence identity, with tryptase βI and βII differing by a singleN-glycosylation site. It is unclear why so many highly similar tryptases are expressed by mast cells. One possibility is that they each perform different proteolytic functions that may be reflected in their substrate specificity preferences. Indeed, it has recently been shown that a single amino acid substitution between tryptase α and tryptase βII accounts for discrimination in substrate preference for the two enzymes (9Huang C. Li L. Krilis S. Chanasyk K. Tang Y. Li Z. Hunt J. Stevens R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19670-19676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of heterologously expressed human tryptase βI and βII was defined using multiple positional scanning synthetic combinatorial tetrapeptide libraries. We show that βI and βII tryptase have a defined primary (P1) and extended substrate specificity (P4–P2). 1Nomenclature for the substrate amino acid preference is as follows: Pn, Pn-1, … P2, P1, P1′, P2′, … , Pm-1′, Pm′ with amide bond hydrolysis occurring between P1 and P1′. Sn, Sn-1, … , S2, S1, S1′, S2′, … , Sm-1′, Sm′ denotes the corresponding enzyme binding sites. The library profiles indicate that the substrate specificity is similar for the two enzymes. Furthermore, single substrates were designed and assayed to test the extended substrate specificity requirements, resulting in a sensitive and selective substrate for β-tryptases. Similarly, an irreversible inhibitor was designed from the preferred substrate sequence and shown to be a potent β-tryptase inhibitor. Structural determinants of specificity were examined through the modeling of the optimized substrate into the active site of the tryptase structure. Finally, it is noted that the specificity determined in this study correlates with the cleavage sites found in many of the characterized physiological substrates and may lead to the identification of additional substrates involved in both the immunological and pathological consequences of βI and βII tryptase release.

A tryptase-expressing clone was isolated and used for large scale expression by fermentation in buffered minimal methanol complex medium with 0.5 mg/ml heparin. Secreted mature βI and βII tryptases were purified to homogeneity using a two-column affinity chromatography procedure described previously. The enzymes were suspended in a final storage buffer containing 2 mNaCl, 10 mm MES, pH 6.1, and 10% glycerol. The proportion of catalytically active βII and βII tryptase was quantitated by active-site titration with 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (12Jameson G. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence was monitored, with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm, upon the addition of enzyme to 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate. The concentration of enzyme was determined from the increase in fluorescence based on a standard concentration curve. The recombinant human βI and βII tryptases (1 μg) and native human lung tryptase were subjected to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% TG gel (Novex). Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained by GelCode™ (Pierce) (Fig. 1) to verify size and purity. Preparation and screening of the positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library were carried out as previously described (10Harris J. Backes B. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J. Craik C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 13Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The concentration of each of the 361 substrates per well in the P1 lysine and P1 arginine libraries was 0.25 μm. The concentration of the 6859 compounds/well in the P1-diverse library was 0.013 μm. Enzyme activity of βI and βII tryptase in the positional scanning synthetic combinatorial tetrapeptide library was assayed in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0 or 0.1 mg/ml heparin at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 450 nm, respectively. Tryptase activity was monitored at 30 °C in assay buffer containing 100 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. Substrate stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO. The final concentration of substrate ranged from 0.005 to 2 mm. The concentration of Me2SO in the assay was less than 5%. The tryptase concentration was 5 nm. Hydrolysis of ACC substrates was monitored fluorometrically with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm on a Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter (JY Horiba). Progress curves were obtained for tryptase (1 nm) inactivation by multiple concentrations of Ac-PRNK-cmk (50 nm to 10 μm). Activity was monitored at 30 °C in activity buffer with 100 μm Ac-PRNK-ACC substrate. The rate constant for loss of enzyme activity,kobs, was determined from a nonlinear regression of the progress curve data. kobs varied linearly with inhibitor concentration. Therefore, ka, the rate constant for the inactivation of enzyme with inhibitor, was determined by linear regression analysis (14Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Several P1 basic-preferring proteases were monitored for inhibition by Ac-PRNK-cmk as follows. Tryptase βI (50 nm), tryptase βII (50 nm), factor Xa (50 nm), tPA (50 nm), uPA (50 nm), thrombin (1 nm), and plasmin (5 nm) were incubated for 5 min with 0, 10, and 100 μm Ac-PRNK-cmk. After incubation, residual activity was monitored as follows. Ac-PRNK-ACC was added to a final concentration of 5 μm to the samples containing tryptase βI and βII; Ac-GTAR-ACC (5 μm) was added to the factor Xa and tPA samples; Ac-QFAR-ACC (5 μm) was added to the uPA samples; Ac-nTPR-ACC (5 μm) was added to the thrombin samples; and Ac-KQWK-ACC (5 μm) was added to plasmin samples. The tryptase structure (PDB code 1a0l) was prepared for modeling by removing inhibitor and water molecules, adding hydrogens using Sybyl6.5 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO), and assigning AMBER partial atomic charges (16Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). Because the structure was solved with a covalent inhibitor, the catalytic Ser-195 was modeled to a geometry consistent with a noncovalent inhibitor by restoring the hydrogen bond with His-57. This was accomplished with a two-step torsional minimization in Sybyl (Tripos force field, ε = 1r). In the first step, the position of the Ser-195 hydroxyl hydrogen was minimized via torsion around the χ2 bond, and in the second step both the oxygen and hydrogen were minimized via torsion around the χ2 bond and χ1(CCCO) bonds. The structure of the enzyme was held rigid for the remainder of the modeling. The capped peptide backbone of Ac-PRNK-Nme was modeled into the active site of the tryptase structure as follows. The structure of the P1–P3 portion of ovomucoid (complexed to chymotrypsin; PDB code 1cho) was used as a template for the backbone configuration. This portion of the inhibitor was translated into the tryptase active site using least squares superposition of the protease active site residues His-57, Asp-102, Ser-195, and 214–216 onto the corresponding residues of the tryptase “A” protomer. The peptide side chains were then truncated at C-β, hydrogens and AMBER charges were added (as above), and the configuration of the resultant (Ace-AAA-Nme) peptide was optimized with successive minimizations in the tryptase active site. Using DOCK4.0.1 (17Ewing T.J.A. Makino S. Skillman A.G. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 411-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), the atoms of the scissile amide bond were minimized first, and then successive rigid segments of the peptide were added (with torsional angles taken from the ovomucoid inhibitor) alternating with minimization. The minimizations included rigid and flexible degrees of freedom and were performed using the simplex algorithm with up to 500 iterations for each minimization. The DOCK energy scoring, applied to both intermolecular and intramolecular atom pairs, includes the coulombic and van der Waals terms from the AMBER force field (16Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar, 18Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar) with an interatomic cut-off of 25 Å and ε = 4r. The peptide side chains (PRNK) were then added, and the conformations of the P1–P3 side chains and the P4 proline were modeled with DOCK4.0 as previously described (19Lamb M.L. Burdick K.W. Toba S. Arnold J.R. Skillman A.G. Young M. Zou X. Kuntz I.D. Proteins. 2001; 42: 296-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, 10 independent minimizations were carried out, and the lowest energy configuration was retained. Recombinant tryptase βI and βII were produced and secreted in P. pastoris as mature enzymes. The ability to produce active mature enzyme rather than the zymogen is important for substrate specificity studies, because it obviates the need to remove the propeptide through the addition of an activating protease, whose activity may complicate subsequent specificity studies. There is a single amino acid difference between tryptase βI and tryptase βII at position 113, an asparagine and a lysine, respectively. Replacement of asparagine for lysine removes an N-linked glycosylation site in tryptase βII, making it singly glycosylated. The relative degree of glycosylation can be seen in the recombinant expression of both enzymes (Fig. 1), with tryptase βI migrating as multiple glycosylated bands and tryptase βII migrating as a single glycosylated band. The only difference seen in expression and purification of the two enzymes is the final yield of active enzyme with tryptase βI expressing 10-fold more than tryptase βII. The phenomenon of reduced expression upon the removal of a glycosylation site has been observed with other proteases and has been postulated to involve decreased stability or solubility of the enzyme lacking post-translational glycosylation (20Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To explore whether this single difference in glycosylation affects the substrate specificity of tryptase βI and βII, three combinatorial peptide libraries with fluorogenic leaving groups were used. The P1 specificity was first defined using a library in which each of the P1 amino acids in a tetrapeptide was held constant while the other three positions contained an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids (cysteine was omitted, and norleucine replaced methionine). Both tryptase βI and βII prefer cleaving after lysine over arginine with no other amino acids being accepted at this position (Fig. 2). To define the extended substrate specificities of the β-tryptases as well as to determine if extended specificity is dependent on the context of the P1 amino acid, tryptase βI and βII were screened against two libraries that differed only in the P1 amino acid that was held constant, lysine and arginine. The P4–P2 extended substrate specificities of both β-tryptases reveal that the isoforms have a similar substrate preference that is not dependent on the P1 amino acid (Fig. 3,A and B). Also apparent from the specificity screen is that many suboptimal amino acids can be accommodated in the substrate, suggesting that additional mechanisms of substrate discrimination may also be in place. Both tryptases show an unusual preference for proline in the P4 position; no other serine protease has been shown to have preference to date. The P3 position shows a preference for positively charged amino acids. Finally, the P2 position shows a modest preference for asparagine (Fig. 3, A andB).Figure 3P2–P4 substrate specificity of β-tryptases. Results from the P1 Lys (A) and the P1 Arg (B) libraries are shown, where the y axis represents the rate of substrate cleavage in relative fluorescence units/second (RFU/sec) and the x axis represents the positioned P2, P3, or P4 amino acid. The two positions in the substrate that are not held constant contain an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids (Cys and Met excluded, Nle (n) included) for a total of 361 substrates/well.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantitate tryptase βI and βII dependence on extended substrate specificity, several peptide substrates were synthesized and the kinetic constants were determined for each of the enzymes. The slight preference for lysine over arginine as seen in the P1-diverse peptide library (Fig. 1) was validated with the substrates Ac-PRNK-ACC and Ac-PRNR-ACC. The Ac-PRNR-ACC substrate displays about 70–90% of the activity of the Ac-PRNK-ACC substrate; compare kcat/Km of (1.12 ± 0.14) × 106 to (1.23 ± 0.15) × 106m−1 s−1 for tryptase βI and (1.31 ± 0.19) × 106 to (1.89 ± 0.17) × 106m−1 s−1 for tryptase βII (Table I). A minimal preference, approximately 2-fold, for P2 asparagine over P2 threonine was seen for both enzymes when Ac-PRTK-ACC was compared with Ac-PRNK-ACC, kcat/Km of (0.78 ± 0.07) × 106 to (1.23 ± 0.15) × 106m−1 s−1 for tryptase βI and (1.27 ± 0.12) × 106 to (1.89 ± 0.17) × 106m−1 s−1 for tryptase βII. A major difference is seen in the P3 position, with an approximately 10-fold decrease in activity observed for Ac-PANK-ACC over Ac-PRNK-ACC; compare kcat/Km of (0.14 ± 0.01) 106 to (1.23 ± 0.15) × 106m−1 s−1 for tryptase βI and (0.18 ± 0.01) × 106m−1 s−1 to (1.89 ± 0.17) × 106m−1s−1 for tryptase βII. All of these effects are manifested in the Km term, not thekcat term. This indicates that ground state binding and recognition are important factors in tryptase catalysis. These results are consistent with the previous findings of Tanakaet al., who showed that benzyloxycarbonyl-Lys-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide was the most optimal of the 14 tripepidyl para-nitroanalide substrates tested (21Tanaka T.

The measured association rate constant, ka, of 5000 ± 200 m−1 s−1 for both βI and βII tryptase indicates that Ac-PRNK-cmk is a potent inhibitor of tryptase. Selectivity of the designed tryptase inhibitor, Ac-PRNK-cmk, was demonstrated through the measurement of inhibition of several tryptic plasma proteases, factor Xa, tPA, uPA, thrombin, and plasmin. At an inhibitor concentration of 10 μm, where tryptase is 95% inhibited, none of the proteases tested showed inhibition (Table II). At a 10-fold higher inhibitor concentration of inhibitor (100 μm), where tryptase is completely inhibited, only uPA and plasmin showed inhibition, 34 and 63% inhibition, respectively (Table II).Table IIInhibition of proteases by Ac-PRNK-cmkEnzymePercent inhibition 100 μm Ac-PRNK-cmkPercent inhibition 10 μm Ac-PRNK-cmkTryptase βI100%95%Tryptase βII100%95%Factor Xa0%0%tPA0%0%uPA34%0%Thrombin0%0%Plasmin63%0% Open table in a new tab The source of the preference for basic residues at the P1 position is well known for this class of proteolytic enzyme; Asp-189 is present in all trypsin-like serine proteases and resides at the bottom of the S1 pocket. The source of extended specificity is less apparent. The structure of tryptase is unique among serine proteases in that it is a ringlike tetramer with the four active sites in close proximity within the interior pore (2Pereira P.J.B. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner C. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Using the program DOCK with energy scoring (22Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 505-524Crossref Scopus (866) Google Scholar), the capped tripeptide Ac-PRNK-Nme was docked into the active site of BII tryptase. The docked molecule had a score of −86.34 DOCK units, consisting of an electrostatic contribution of −56.88 and a van der Waals contribution of −29.46. The unusually large electrostatic component is a result of the large negative charge concentrated within the pore of the tetramer. The model of substrate binding suggests a paired binding site, with contributions from two tryptase protomers. Specifically, docking of the optimal peptide into the active site of tryptase predicts that the P4 and P3 side chains interact with the adjacent protomer. The P4 Pro side chain interacts with the γ-carbon of Thr-96′ of the adjacent protomer (Fig. 4). A recognition site for the P3 Arg is formed by acidic residues from both protomers, Glu-217 from the cognate protomer and Asp-60B′ from the adjacent protomer (Fig. 4). Formation of the P4 and P3 side chain interactions requires a somewhat noncanonical backbone configuration, resulting in the loss of a backbone hydrogen bond. By contrast, the P2 and P1 sites make the canonical interactions seen with other members of this protease class. For example, the deep S1 pocket contains Asp-189 from the cognate protomer that interacts with P1 Lys (Fig. 4). Another consequence of the structure is that each active site has an adjacent active site in close proximity, leading to potential substrate-substrate interactions (Fig. 4). The tryptase family of serine proteases has been implicated in a variety of allergic and inflammatory diseases involving mast cells because of elevated tryptase levels found in biological fluids from patients with these disorders. However, the exact role of tryptase in the pathophysiology of disease remains to be delineated. The scope of biological functions and corresponding physiological consequences of tryptase are substantially defined by their substrate specificity. In this study, high levels of mature recombinant human βI and βII tryptases were expressed in P. pastoris (Fig. 1) for studies of primary and extended substrate specificity. Human mast cells express at least four distinct tryptases, designated α, βI, βII, and βIII. These enzymes are not controlled by blood plasma proteinase inhibitors and only cleave a few physiological substrates in vitro. It is currently unknown whether human tryptases perform redundant or unique functions in vivo. One recent study, which included a protein engineering approach, demonstrated that a single amino acid difference in one of the surface loops that forms the substrate-binding cleft led to a functional distinction between human tryptase α and βII (9Huang C. Li L. Krilis S. Chanasyk K. Tang Y. Li Z. Hunt J. Stevens R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19670-19676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, no physiological differences have been reported between βI and βII tryptases, which differ only at a single amino acid residue at position 113, leading to the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site. Based on the data presented herein, βI and βII tryptases have similar P4 to P1 substrate preferences (Figs. 2 and 3, Table I). The functional similarity observed for the two enzymes is in agreement with the reported crystal structure of βII tryptase (2Pereira P.J.B. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner C. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), in that the structure shows the glycosylation site peripheral to the active site and should therefore have minimal effect on the substrate specificity. The shared preference for peptide substrates may extend to a shared preference for physiological substrates. Indeed, the optimal sequence for β-tryptase cleavage, P4 Pro, P3 Arg/Lys, P2X, and P1 Lys/Arg, is found in many of the macromolecular substrates previously shown by others to be cleaved by tryptasein vitro. Tryptase is a potent activator of pro-uPA, the zymogen form of a protease associated with tumor metastasis and invasion. Activation of the plasminogen cascade, resulting in the destruction of extracellular matrix for cellular extravasation and migration, may be a function of tryptase activation of prourokinase plasminogen activator at the P4–P1 sequence of Pro-Arg-Phe-Lys (4Stack M. Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9416-9419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a neuropeptide that is implicated in the regulation of vascular permeability, is also cleaved by tryptase, primarily at the Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg sequence (5Tam E. Caughey G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The G-protein-coupled receptor PAR-2 can be cleaved and activated by tryptase at the Ser-Lys-Gly-Arg sequence to drive fibroblast proliferation, whereas the thrombin-activated receptor PAR-1 is inactivated by tryptase at the Pro-Asn-Asp-Lys sequence (3Molino M. Barnathan E. Numerof R. Clark J. Dreyer M. Cumashi A. Hoxie J. Schechter N. Woolkalis M. Brass L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4043-4049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Taken together, this evidence suggests a central role for tryptase in tissue remodeling as a consequence of disease. This is consistent with the profound changes observed in several mast cell-mediated disorders. One hallmark of chronic asthma and other long term respiratory diseases is fibrosis and thickening of the underlying tissues that could be the result of tryptase activation of its physiological targets. Similarly, a series of reports during the past year have shown angiogenesis to be associated with mast cell density, tryptase activity, and poor prognosis in a variety of cancers (6Coussens L.M.

Cancer. 2000; 85: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A search of the protein data bases (Swiss-Prot) has revealed other candidate physiological substrates containing the predicted sequences for β-tryptase cleavage. These macromolecules have yet to be empirically characterized as tryptase substrates, but many, such as latent transforming growth factor-β-binding protein (cytokine modulator), annexin I and II (calcium-binding proteins that participate in the regulation of early inflammatory responses), and HGF (a growth factor implicated in tumor development and progression and in angiogenesis), are particularly intriguing because they further support the concept of a prominent role for tryptase in tissue remodeling during disease pathogenesis. In this study, the kinetic constants for βI and βII tryptase were determined using four synthetic peptide substrates derived from the positional scanning combinatorial peptide library screening results (Table I). These substrates served to quantify the tryptase dependence on extended substrate specificity, indicating that the ground state binding and recognition are important factors in tryptase catalysis. The preferred tetrapeptide PRNK substrate and irreversible inhibitor, revealed from the combinatorial library screens, also formed the basis for a rapid, sensitive, and selective enzymatic assay for human β-tryptases in a variety of complex biological media, including serum and plasma. 3A. Niles and M. Haak-Frendscho, unpublished results. To explore the structural determinants of substrate binding, the Pro-Arg-Asn-Lys peptide was modeled into the active site of tryptase. The modeling results revealed several canonical substrate interactions in addition to interactions not seen with other serine proteases of the chymotrypsin fold. The unique tetrameric structure of tryptase allows for a substrate to interact with two protomers simultaneously. In addition, the close proximity of paired tryptase active sites raises the possibility of interactions between multiple substrates. Tryptase has been recognized as a viable drug target, and therapeutically useful inhibitors have been under development by several pharmaceutical companies, some even taking advantage of the bifunctional active site (15Rice K. Tanaka R. Katz B. Numerof R. Moore W. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 381-396PubMed Google Scholar, 26Burgess L. Newhouse B. Ibrahim P. Rizzi J. Kashem M. Hartman A. Brandhuber B. Wright C. Thomson D. Vigers G. Koch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8348-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Insights gained from the modeling of the optimal sequence into the active site will support further development of novel selective substrates of β-tryptases that will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of these enzymes as well as lead to the development of new and effective inhibitors. In summary, recombinant human βI and βII tryptase was expressed and used to determine an optimal sequence for β-tryptase cleavage: P4 Pro, P3 Arg/Lys, P2 X, and P1 Lys/Arg. This sequence has already proved useful for the development of pharmacological tools for the further study of tryptase. Moreover, this study of βI and βII tryptase highlights the utility of generalized positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries to functionally characterize similarities and differences between homologous enzymes, generate sensitive and selective substrates and inhibitors, and define a subset of potential physiological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1980773490,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine known to regulate cell growth, viral replication, inflammation, immune system functioning, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. These effects are mediated through two different receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 (also called p60 and p80, respectively), with p60 receptor being expressed on all cell types and p80 receptor only on cells of the immune system and on endothelial cells. Although the role of p60 receptor in TNF signaling is well established, the role of p80 is less clear. In this report, by using macrophages derived from wild-type mice (having both receptors) and mice in which the gene for either p60 (p60−/−), or p80 (p80−/−), or both (p60−/− p80−/−) receptor have been deleted, we have redefined the role of these receptors in TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and of mitogen-activated protein kinases. TNF activated NF-κB in a dose- and time-dependent manner in wild-type macrophages but not in p60−/−, p80−/−, or p60−/−p80−/− macrophages. These results correlated with the IκBα degradation needed for NF-κB activation. We also found that TNF activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase in a dose- and time-dependent manner in wild-type macrophages but not in p60−/−, p80−/−, or p60−/−p80−/− macrophages. TNF activated p38 MAPK and p44/p42 MAPK in wild-type but not in p60−/−, p80−/−, or p60−/− p80−/−macrophages. TNF induced the proliferation of wild-type macrophages, but for p60−/− and p80−/− macrophages proliferation was lower, and in p60−/−p80−/− it was absent.

Overall, our studies suggest that both types of TNF receptors are needed in macrophages for optimum TNF cell signaling. tumor necrosis factor murine tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor type 1 TNF receptor 2 electrophoretic mobility shift assay extracellular signal-regulated kinase fluorescence-activated cell sorting granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor inhibitory subunit of NF-κB c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase nuclear transcription factor-κB polymerase chain reaction death domain TNF receptor-associated factor TNFR1-associated death domain protein Fas-associated death domain base pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tumor necrosis factor (TNF1), a pleiotropic cytokine initially shown to be produced mainly by macrophages, is now known to be produced by many cell types (1Aggarwal B.B.

Depending on the cells, TNF induces proliferation, apoptosis, or differentiation; activates various kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family; and induces various transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP-1. TNF exerts these biological effects by interacting with two distinct receptors, TNFR1 (p60TNFR or CD 120a) (2Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A.

The p60 receptors are expressed in virtually all mammalian cell types, whereas the p80 receptor is expressed only on cells of the immune system and endothelial cells (5Brockhaus M. Scoenfeld H.-J.

Through its cytoplasmic death domain (DD), the p60 receptor sequentially recruits TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-2, receptor-interacting protein, and IκBα kinase, leading to NF-κB activation (7Hsu H.

TRADD can also sequentially recruit Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and FADD-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme (ICE), leading to apoptosis (11Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M.

The recruitment of TRAF2 is also known to be required for activation of JNK, p42/p44 MAPK, and p38 MAPK (13Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The p80 receptor, although lacking the death domain, is known to bind TRAF2 through another adapter protein, TRAF1 (14Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar).The reasons why there are two different TNF receptors and which signals are mediated through the p60 receptor as compared with the p80 receptor are widely debated. Most of the information on the role of each receptor in TNF signaling is based on either receptor overexpression (15Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16Haridas V. Darnay B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J.

These studies have revealed that although most TNF signals are transduced by the p60 receptor, the role of p80 remains unclear. All the model systems used in the above studies were artificial and do not delineate or mimic actual ligand-mediated signaling. There is only one report utilizing mouse embryonic fibroblasts from TNFR knockout animals, which showed that TNFR1 and TNFR2 differentially activate p44/p42 MAPK (23Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28097-28104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts, however, express only the p60 and not the p80 form of the TNF receptors (24Totpal K. LaPushin R. Kohno T. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2248-2257PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas, macrophages express both forms of the receptor (4Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G. Science. 1990; 248: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 5Brockhaus M. Scoenfeld H.-J. Schlaeger E.-J. Hunziker W. Lesslauer W. Loetscher H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate TNF signaling mediated through each receptor, we generated macrophage cell lines from wild-type mice and from mice with gene knockouts for the p60 receptor or the p80 receptor or both. Ligand-induced activation of NF-κB, JNK, p44/p42 MAPK, and p38 MAPK were examined. Our results suggest that genetic deletion of the either of the TNF receptors abolishes TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, JNK, p44/p42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and cell proliferation.RESULTSTo understand the function of each type of TNF receptor, we isolated macrophage cell lines from mice in which the gene for either of the receptors or both the receptors were deleted. Because human TNF does not bind to the murine p80 receptor (31Mackay F. Rothe J. Bluethmann H. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5274-5284PubMed Google Scholar), we used murine TNF to activate the receptors.Characterization of Wild-type and Receptor-deficient Cell LinesTo ensure that the cell lines derived from TNF receptor knockout mice are deficient in respective receptors, we performed PCR and FACS analysis. Genomic DNA from representative wild-type and p60-null (p60−/−), p80-null (p80−/−), and p60p80-null (p60−/− p80−/−) cells was analyzed using PCR primers directed against the genes for TNFR1, TNFR2, or the neomycin insert used to disrupt the genes for the two receptors. As shown in Fig. 1A, wild-type macrophages yielded two bands corresponding to TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors but not the neomycin insert, whereas p60−/− and p80−/− cells gave PCR products for TNFR2 and TNFR1, respectively, plus the neomycin insert. In double knockout cells, only the neomycin insert band was seen.The PCR data were supplemented with FACS analysis of the cell surface expression of receptors using receptor-specific antibodies. Results in Fig. 1 B indicate that wild-type cells express both TNF receptors, although the expression of p60 was low. Neither of these receptors was detected in double-knockout cells. In p60−/− cells only p80 receptors were expressed and vice versa in the case of p80−/− cells (Fig. 1 B). Thus, cell lines used in this investigation were authentic and had the expected deletion of the gene product.Both TNF Receptors Are Needed for Maximum Activation of NF-κBActivation of NFκB is one of the earliest events induced by TNF in most mammalian cells. Whether TNF-induced NF-κB activation also occurs through individual TNF receptors is not known. To understand the specific role of TNF receptors in ligand-induced NF-κB activation, we treated wild-type macrophage cell line and its TNF receptor-deficient variants with mTNF, prepared the nuclear extracts, and analyzed them by EMSA for NF-κB. As shown in Fig.2A, dose-dependent activation of NF-κB occurred in wild-type cells. No NF-κB was activated in double-knockout cells, and very little was activated in single-knockout cells at higher concentrations of TNF. The activation was higher in p80−/− than that in p60−/−cells.Figure 2Activation of NF-κB in wild-type and in TNF-receptor-knockout cells by TNF. A, dose response of NF-κB activation. Two million wild-type and TNF receptor knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 0–10 nm TNF for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB.B, NF-κB induced by TNF is composed of p50 and p65 subunits. Nuclear extract prepared by treating cells with 0.1 nm TNF was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with either no antibodies or with anti-p50 antibodies, anti-p65 antibodies, a mixture of anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies, pre-immune sera, unlabeled oligo, or mutant oligo and then assayed for NF-κB as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)EMSA of nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells showed that either anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies abrogated/supershifted the NF-κB·DNA complex, whereas preimmune sera (PIS) or irrelevant anti-cyclin D1 antibodies had no effect (Fig.2 B). Thus, NF-κB induced by TNF in macrophages derived from C57BL/6J mice contained both the p50 and p65 (RelA) subunits. The specificity of the TNF-induced NF-κB·DNA complex was further confirmed by demonstrating that the binding was disrupted in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled κB-oligonucleotide (Fig.2 B, Cold oligo) but not by mutant oligonucleotide (Mutant oligo).To determine the kinetics of NF-κB activation, all four cell lines were treated with 0.1 nm mTNF for various times, and the nuclear and the cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA for NF-κB and by Western blot for IκBα. Maximum activation of NF-κB (6.2-fold) was obtained in wild-type cells after 20 min of ligand treatment (Fig. 3A). In p80 −/− cells, NF-κB activation was extremely poor, whereas no activation was seen either in cells from p60−/− or in cells from double knockout mice (Fig.3 A).Figure 3Activation of NF-κB in wild-type and in TNF receptor knockout cells by TNF. A, time course activation of NF-κB. Two million wild-type and TNF receptor knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 0.1 nm TNF for 0–60 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB.B, time course for degradation of IκBα. Thirty micrograms of cytoplasmic extracts prepared in A were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with IκBα antibodies as stated under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because TNF-induced degradation of IκBα is a critical step in the pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB, we examined whether time-dependent NF-κB activation is correlated with IκBα degradation. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the degradation of IκBα in wild-type cells was maximum at 20 min, matching kinetics of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 A). As expected, no degradation of IκBα was noticed in p60−/− or p60−/−p80−/− cells, whereas a minor degradation was noted in p80 −/− cells. Thus, none of the receptors was sufficient by itself for significant activation of ligand-induced NF-κB in macrophages.Both TNF Receptors Are Needed for Maximum Activation of JNKJNK activation is another early event transduced by TNF (13Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Whether JNK is activated by the individual TNF receptor in response to the ligand is not well understood. To examine that, we first treated wild-type and receptor-deficient cells with different concentrations of mTNF for 15 min and performed a kinase assay. In wild-type cells dose-dependent JNK activation had occurred; the activation was highest (9.6-fold) at 10 nm TNF (Fig.4A). In contrast, TNF failed to activate JNK in macrophages from any of the knockout mice (Fig.4 A). The lower panels in Fig. 4 Arepresent loading controls and indicate that JNK activation in wild-type cells was not due to the expression of JNK1 protein.Figure 4Activation of JNK in wild-type and TNF-receptor-knockout macrophage cells by TNF. A, dose response for JNK activation. Two million wild-type and receptor knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 0–10 nmTNF for 15 min. One hundred micrograms of whole-cell protein was reacted with JNK1 antibodies and then immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose. The beads were washed and subjected to kinase assay as described under “Experiment Procedures” (upper panel). Forty micrograms of the same protein extracts was probed with JNK1 antibodies (lower panel). B, time course of JNK activation. Two million wild-type and receptor-knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 1 nm TNF for 0–30 min. One hundred micrograms of whole-cell protein was treated with JNK1 antibodies and then immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose. The beads were washed and subjected to kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” (upper panel). Forty micrograms of the same protein extracts was probed with JNK1 antibodies (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the kinetics of JNK activation by TNF, cells were treated with 1 nm mTNF for 0–30 min. As shown in Fig.4 B, JNK activation in wild-type cells was time- dependent and reached a maximum (9.8-fold) at 10 min. TNF-induced JNK activation was not observed in p60−/− and in p60−/−p80−/− cells during 30 min of treatment, whereas a feeble activation (1.5-fold) was discernible in p80−/− cells at 20 min of treatment. Thus our results suggest that, like NF-κB activation, activation of JNK requires both TNF receptors.Both TNF Receptors Are Needed for Activation of p38 MAPKLike JNK, p38 MAPK is another Ser/Thr protein kinase activated rapidly by TNF. The role of individual TNF receptors in activation of p38 MAPK is still unclear. To examine p38 MAPK, we treated wild-type and receptor-deficient cells with mTNF for different times and performed Western blot analysis using phospho (Tyr/Thr)-specific p38 MAPK antibodies. These results shows that TNF activated p38 MAPK only in wild-type cells (Fig. 5). The activation was time-dependent with a maximum at 10 min. These results suggest that TNF does not activate p38 MAPK through individual receptors.Figure 5Activation of p38 MAPK in wild-type and TNF receptor knockout macrophage cells by TNF. Two million wild-type and receptor knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 1 nm TNF for 0–60 min. Sixty micrograms of whole-cell protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures” (upper panels). The same blot was reprobed with p38 MAPK antibodies (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both TNF Receptors Are Needed for Maximum Activation of p44/p42 MAPKThrough the Ras/Raf/MEK cascade, TNF can activate ERK1/2 (32Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Which TNF receptor mediates the activation of ERK-MAPK pathway is unclear. To examine ERK1/2, whole-cell extracts from wild-type and receptor knockout cell lines treated with 1 nm TNF for different times were analyzed by Western blot using phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies. In wild-type cells, p42 MAPK was activated within 5 min of the start of TNF treatment, whereas p44 MAPK was minimally activated (Fig. 6). The duration of ERK-MAPK activation was longer than that noted with p38 MAPK, because much of residual activity was retained at 60 min. A transient activation in the initial 5 min appeared in p80−/− cells but not in the other two knockout cells (p60−/− and p60−/− p80−/−). Thus these results demonstrate that both TNF receptors are needed for optimum ligand-induced activation of p44/p42 MAPK.Figure 6Activation of p44/p42 MAPK in wild-type and TNF receptor knockout macrophage cells by TNF. Two million wild-type and receptor knockout cells per milliliter were treated with 1 nm TNF for 0–60 min. Sixty micrograms of whole-cell protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures” (upper panels). The same blot was reprobed with ERK2 antibody (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both TNF Receptors Are Needed for Maximum Ligand-induced Proliferation of CellsTNF induces proliferation in many normal and tumor cells. To dissect the function of both receptors in TNF-induced proliferation, all four cell lines were cultured for 72 h in the presence of different concentrations of TNF, and cellular proliferation was assayed by tritiated thymidine uptake. Results shown in Fig. 7indicated that TNF induced more than a 4-fold proliferation in wild-type cells, approximately a 2-fold proliferation in p80−/− cells, a 1.5-fold increase in p60−/− cells, and no increase in double knockout cells; the increases were dose-dependent (Fig. 7). These results suggests that both TNF receptors participate in TNF-induced cellular proliferation.Figure 7Proliferation of wild-type and TNF receptor knockout macrophage cells induced by TNF. Three thousand wild-type and receptor knockout cells in 0.1 ml were exposed to 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 nm TNF for 72 h and pulsed with 1 mCi of tritiated thymidine for 6-h. Thymidine uptake was then determined in a β counter as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this report, we used macrophage cell lines derived from mice in which the genes for either one or both of the TNF receptors were deleted. The deletion of either of the TNF receptors abolished ligand-induced signal transduction and abrogated mTNF- induced NF-κB activation, IκBα degradation, and activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and p44/p42 MAPK. The deletion of the genes for either the p60 or the p80 receptor abolished essentially all cellular responses to TNF, the effect being more pronounced in cells with p60−/− than in cells with p80 −/−. For optimum proliferation of macrophages to be induced by exogenous TNF, both receptors were required.Although there are several reports on the role of the two receptors in TNF signaling using various approaches, our report is the first to investigate the role of each TNF receptor side by side using stable cell lines derived from receptor knockout animals. We have demonstrated that the deletion of either of the TNF receptors eliminates most of the TNF-induced NF-κB activation in macrophages. Previously, it was shown that TNF-induced NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes and dendritic cells is abolished in p60 receptor-deficient mice (25Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A.

Another study showed that mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from p60−/− mice fail to activate NF-κB in response to TNF (23Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28097-28104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). NF-κB was found to be constitutively active in regenerating liver from wild-type animals but not in the liver from p60−/− animals (34Yamada Y. Kirrilova I. Peschon J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), again suggesting the importance of the p60 receptor in this response.Interestingly, however, our results indicate that macrophages derived from p80−/− animals also show suppression of NF-κB activation in response to TNF, thus suggesting the critical role of this receptor. The role of p80 receptor in TNF-induced NF-κB activation is highly controversial. Although most reports indicate that the p80 receptor alone is insufficient to activate NF-κB (17Hu X. Tang M. Fisher A.B. Olashaw N. Zuckerman K.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3106-3115PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chainy G.B.N. Singh S. Raju U. Aggarwal B.B. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28097-28104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have shown previously that overexpression of p80 can mediate ligand-induced NF-κB activation (16Haridas V. Darnay B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with a recent report by Abu-Amer et al. (35Abu-Amer Y. Erdmanns J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that marrow-derived macrophages from p80−/− animals had significantly suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation.Our observation that the deletion of either of the receptors abolished TNF-induced NF-κB activation, suggests that the two TNF receptors may function synergistically in activating NF-κB. This conclusion is consistent with several previous reports from our laboratory and others (16Haridas V. Darnay B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chainy G.B.N. Singh S. Raju U. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2410-2417PubMed Google Scholar, 36Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S.

For instance NF-κB-regulated genes such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS require the activation of both receptors (39Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Riches D.W.H. Chan E.D. Zahradka E.A. Wintson B.W. Remigio L.K. Lake F.R. J. Biol.

This potentiation may be mediated at the intracellular level through TRAF2, which has been shown to bind to both the receptors (36Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P.

We exploited this dichotomy through the construction of chimeric receptors and site-directed mutagenesis in order to identify domains responsible for these differences in the abilities of extracellular agonists to gate P2X receptors. Replacement of the extracellular domain of the αβmeATP-sensitive rat P2X1 subunit with that of the αβmeATP-insensitive rat P2X2 subunit resulted in a receptor that was still αβmeATP-sensitive, suggesting a non-extracellular domain was responsible for the differential gating of P2X receptors by various agonists. Replacement of the first transmembrane domain of the rat P2X2 subunit with one from an αβmeATP-sensitive subunit (either rat P2X1 or P2X3 subunit) converted the resulting chimera to αβmeATP sensitivity. This conversion did not occur when the first transmembrane domain came from a non-αβmeATP-sensitive subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the C-terminal portion of the first transmembrane domain was important in determining the agonist selectivity of channel gating for these chimeras. These results suggest that the first transmembrane domain plays an important role in the agonist operation of the P2X receptor.

Although these receptors were first described almost 20 years ago (1Friel D.D. Bean B.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the lack of useful pharmacological tools has greatly hampered the elucidation of the roles that these receptors play in ongoing physiological functions (2Dubyak G.B. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Recent advances in the molecular biology of these receptors have led to a resurgence of interest, and have served to illustrate how little is actually known about these proteins. Indeed, results from in situhybridization and immunochemical studies demonstrate that these subunits have a widespread distribution throughout the body, being present in almost all tissues (for a review, see Ref. 4Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they may have more extensive functions than appreciated previously.To date, a total of seven individual subunit genes have been cloned and their products characterized (4Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). These subunits have been demonstrated to form homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric receptors (5Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) that are non-selective cation channels with a high permeability to Ca2+ (6Evans R.J. Lewis C.

Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a property that confers the potential for important functions in excitable and secretory cells. Recent investigation into the structural features of the subunits has helped elucidate the role of the transmembrane domains in ion permeation through the channel (7Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A.

Nevertheless, the domains involved in ligand-induced opening of the channel (gating) have not yet been delineated, nor have the domains responsible for the pharmacological fingerprints of the various homo- and hetero-oligomeric P2X receptors.Originally, the P2X receptor family was distinguished from other ATP receptors (such as the G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors) by their sensitivity (EC50 ≤ 30 µm) to the ATP analog αβ-methylene-ATP (αβmeATP)1 (14Burnstock G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the cloned subunits has now shown that only two of the seven mammalian gene products have appreciable sensitivity to this analog (3North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). For this study, we sought to use chimeric P2X proteins to exploit the pharmacological differences between the αβmeATP-sensitive and -insensitive subunits in an effort to identify the domains and/or amino acid residues involved in determining agonist potencies at P2X subunits. Topological studies have shown that a P2X subunit has two transmembrane domains, with the intervening loop located extracellularly and the N and C termini located inside the cell (15Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies from other groups have provided evidence that residues in the extracellular loop near the first transmembrane domain (TMD1) can affect the binding of ATP to the receptor (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and results from our laboratories (16Haines, W. R., Voigt, M. M., Migita, K., Torres, G. E., and Egan, T. M. (2001) J. Neurosci., 21, in press.Google Scholar) suggested that mutations in TMD1 can influence channel gating and agonist potency. In this report we present further evidence that TMD1 determines the potencies of the agonists ATP and αβmeATP in gating the P2X2 receptor, leading to the interpretation that this domain is involved in the transduction pathway linking agonist binding to opening of the channel gate in this receptor family.RESULTSThe potency of ATP at the homo-oligomeric rP2X receptors falls into three categories: high (EC50 = 1–3 µm, seen at rP2X1 and rP2X3), intermediate (EC50 = 10–30 µm, seen at rP2X2, rP2X4, and rP2X5), and low (EC50 ≥ 100 µm, seen at rP2X7) (3North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). ATP has no action at P2X6, as this subunit does not appear to form homo-oligomeric receptors (5Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the ATP analog αβmeATP exhibits high potency and efficacy at only two subunits (rP2X1 and rP2X3; EC50 ≅ 1 µm), while having little or no potency at the other five subunits even at concentrations approaching the millimolar level (3North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). There are two simple hypotheses that could explain the inability of αβmeATP to operate five of the seven subunits: first, that αβmeATP does indeed bind with appreciable affinity to all receptors but is unable to induce the channel to gate in five of them (i.e. it is functionally equivalent to an antagonist), and second, that αβmeATP does not interact at the agonist binding domain with appreciable affinity and thus its binding energy is not sufficient to cause the degree of tertiary/quaternary structure perturbation necessary to result in the gating of the channel. It was important to determine which of the two hypotheses explains the αβmeATP data so that experiments to investigate the structural basis for the pharmacological differences among subunits could be designed in a rational fashion.The first hypothesis, that αβmeATP is a functional antagonist, was the most straightforward question to test, and we did so by examining the ability of a relatively high (100 µm) concentration of αβmeATP to reduce the efficacy of a co-applied dose of 10 µm ATP at the homomeric rP2X2 receptors, at which ATP has moderate and αβmeATP little potency (Fig.1a, ATP EC50 = 22 µm; αβmeATP EC50 > 300 µm). As shown in Fig. 1 b, co-application of αβmeATP did not alter the degree to which a sub-EC50concentration of ATP activated the receptor. This result rules out the hypothesis that αβmeATP binds to the agonist site on the rP2X2 receptor with appreciable affinity. This leaves the second hypothesis, that αβmeATP's inability to gate the rP2X2 subunit is due to a low binding affinity for the agonist binding domain, to be tested. This low αβmeATP affinity would presumably result from differences in the three-dimensional structure of the P2X2 receptor compared with the P2X1 or P2X3 receptors that arise from the evolutionarily derived amino acid variations present in their predicted primary sequences. We therefore exploited this sequence divergence in testing the low affinity hypothesis by constructing chimeric receptors derived from αβmeATP-sensitive and -insensitive subunits.Chimeras Formed from P2X1 and P2X2 Subunits Show Altered αβmeATP SensitivityThe first chimeric receptor constructed was composed of the αβmeATP-sensitive rP2X1subunit and the αβmeATP-insensitive rP2X2 subunit. This initial chimera, labeled 1.2.1, was a rP2X1 subunit chain in which only the extracellular domain (presumptive site of the ATP-binding domain) was replaced with the equivalent sequence of the rP2X2 subunit (schematic shown in Fig.2a). It was anticipated that this “domain swap” would yield a homo-oligomeric receptor with the pharmacology of the P2X2 receptor. In contrast to these expectations, the receptor formed from this chimeric subunit exhibited increases in both ATP and αβmeATP sensitivity (ATP: EC50 = 0.93 µm, αβmeATP: EC50= 49 µm) (Fig. 2 b). This unexpected result demonstrated that the extracellular domain of rP2X2 was indeed capable of forming a binding pocket at which αβmeATP could bind with both high affinity and efficacy and, by extension, that non-extracellular regions of a P2X subunit protein can profoundly influence the agonist binding and/or gating properties of the receptor.Figure 2Replacement of the extracellular domain of rP2X1 with that of rP2X2 still yields an αβmeATP-sensitive receptor. a, a schematic of the chimeric construct 1.2.1.

Values obtained from curve fits were ATP: EC50 = 0.93 ± 23 µm, n H = 1.1 ± 0.3; αβmeATP: EC50 = 49 ± 12 µm,n H = 1 ± 0.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Due to the nature of the 1.2.1 chimera, the increased agonist sensitivities observed would have to be attributable to one or more of the amino acid residue(s) present in the rP2X1 portion of the molecule. There are four distinct domains of rP2X1 in 1.2.1: the cytosolic N terminus, TMD1, TMD2, and the cytosolic C terminus. Recent work from our laboratories has found that point mutations in the TMD1 of rP2X2 can change the potency of ATP at the receptor as well as influence the gating properties of the channel (16Haines, W. R., Voigt, M. M., Migita, K., Torres, G. E., and Egan, T. M. (2001) J. Neurosci., 21, in press.Google Scholar). In addition, data from two other groups (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that amino acids present in the extracellular domain just C-terminal of TMD1 are involved in ATP binding. Together, those findings suggested to us that the increased potencies of both ATP and αβmeATP seen for chimera 1.2.1 might originate from amino acids present in the rP2X1-TMD1 region. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a new chimera that comprised the rP2X2subunit in which the only alteration was that its TMD1 domain was replaced by the TMD1 of rP2X1 (this chimera is labeled TM1(r1)). As seen in Fig. 3a, this chimera also had increased sensitivity to both ATP (EC50 = 1.3 µm) and αβmeATP (EC50 = 73 µm) that was virtually indistinguishable from the values seen with 1.2.1, but again much higher than those observed with wt-rP2X2. Thus, TMD1 alone was sufficient to induce the increased potencies of the two agonists observed at the 1.2.1 receptor.Figure 3Replacement of only the first transmembrane domain of rP2X2 confers changes in agonist, but not antagonist, sensitivities. a, dose-response curves for ATP- and αβmeATP-gated currents at TM1(r1) Values obtained from curve fits were ATP: EC50 = 1.3 ± 0.2 µm,n H = 1.7 ± 0.4; αβmeATP: EC50 = 73 ± 18 µm,n H = 1± 0.3. b, dose-response curves for 1 µm ATP, in the presence of increasing concentrations of the antagonist TNP-ATP, evoked at the TM1(r1) receptor. Values obtained from curve fits for TNP-ATP were: EC50 = 1.7 ± 0.2 µm,n H = −1.1 ± 0.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if the change observed in agonist potencies was found for antagonists as well, we tested the actions of the antagonist trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) on ATP-induced currents in cells expressing TM1(r1). This compound has high affinity for the P2X1 and low affinity for the P2X2 subunit (IC50 ≅ 3 nm versus 1 µm, respectively; Ref. 19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore should be a sensitive tool for detecting any global change in ligand interactions with the chimeric receptor. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the affinity (IC50 = 1.7 µm) and the Hill slope (n H = −1.1) for TNP-ATP inhibition of ATP-gated currents at TM1(r1) matched the reported values seen at the wt-rP2X2 and substantially different from what has been observed for rP2X1 (20Virginio C. Robertson G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 969-973PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of the TMD1 exchange were limited to the action of agonists at the protein.The Effects of TMD1s from Other P2X Subunits on Agonist PotenciesIt was important to assess whether the data obtained with the rP2X1-containing chimeras were due to rP2X1- specific sequences, or whether results were indicative of P2X receptor structure/function in general. We therefore constructed a chimera in which the TMD1 of rP2X2 was replaced with that of the rP2X3 subunit (this chimera is labeled TM1(r3)). rP2X3 was chosen because it is the only other rat subunit at which αβmeATP has high affinity and potency. As seen in Fig. 4a, both αβmeATP and ATP again displayed appreciably increased potencies at TM1(r3) (ATP: EC50 = 0.39 µm; αβmeATP:EC50 = 8.9 µm) when compared with wt-P2X2.Figure 4Agonist sensitivities of a chimeric receptor is determined by the first transmembrane domain. a, dose-response curves for ATP- and αβmeATP-gated currents at TM1(r3).

The αβmeATP concentration-response curve did not reach a clear maximum and was not fit by the Hill equation. (The dotted line is a polynomial fit.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To this point, results from the studies of agonists on the various chimeras suggested that the agonist pharmacology of a given receptor was determined, in large part, by the structure of its TMD1. If this were true, then replacement of the rP2X2 TMD1 with a TMD1 from a different αβmeATP-insensitive subunit should not yield a chimeric protein with enhanced agonist sensitivities. To test this hypothesis, we chose to use the TMD1 from the zebrafish P2X3 (zP2X3) subunit as previous work from our labs has demonstrated that αβmeATP has much lower potency at zP2X3 (EC50 > 100 µm) than at rP2X3, while having similar ATP sensitivity (EC50 = 1.5 µm) (21Egan T.M. Cox J.A. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, a chimera, labeled TM1(z3), containing the TMD1 of the zP2X3 subunit transplanted into rP2X2 was constructed, and dose-response curves for ATP and αβmeATP were determined. As was predicted from our working model, this construct exhibited ATP and αβmeATP sensitivities (Fig. 4 b) (ATP: EC50 = 2.15 µm; αβmeATP: EC50 > 300 µm) similar to those of the wild-type zP2X3receptor.Dependence of Agonist Efficacy on TMD1 Amino Acid CompositionAlthough the TM1(r3) and TM1(z3) chimeras had quite different sensitivities to αβmeATP, their respective TMD1 domains differed by only five residues (Fig.5a). Thus, a point mutation strategy was used in an effort to elucidate which of the amino acid differences provided the structural underpinnings of the pharmacological differences observed between the two chimeras. In this approach, the chimera TM1(z3) was used as the template in order that the end point (αβmeATP sensitivity) would be a gain of function. We tested mutations beginning with the N-terminal portion of the domain to determine which one(s) has a role in enhancing agonist potency. This was done by comparing whole cell currents elicited by 30 and 100 µm αβmeATP to that of 30 µm ATP (a concentration that elicits maximal whole cell currents). As seen in Fig. 5, the I34A and L41S mutations did not show any increased sensitivity to αβmeATP. Mutant C45G was not functional (data not shown), and therefore we made the double mutant I44V/C45G to compensate for the lethality of the single C45G mutation. This construct was functional but did not show an enhanced αβmeATP response either, thus effectively ruling out either residue as being essential for an enhanced sensitivity to agonists. Additionally, neither the double mutation I34A/L41S or the triple mutation L41S/I44V/C45G yielded increased sensitivity to low concentrations of αβmeATP. Thus, it did not appear that any one of the four N-terminal differences between the rat and zebrafish TMD1s was responsible for the increased potency of αβmeATP seen at the TM1(r3) chimera. The last single mutant, M49L, was found to have an increased αβmeATP sensitivity (also Fig.5), although αβmeATP was not as potent as ATP. As this result suggested that the C-terminal portion of TMD1 might be important in altering agonist potencies, we made the triple mutant I44V/C45G/M49L to test whether we could get full conversion of the αβmeATP response to that seen in TM1(r3). This triple mutant gave currents resembling the single mutant M49L, and dose-response curves (Fig.6) show that αβmeATP acted as a full agonist. The enhanced potency (EC50 = 155 µm) seen at the triple mutant, while greater than the value obtained at the parent chimera was still less than that observed at TM1(r3). The EC50 for ATP was not appreciably altered (1.5 µm versus the 2.15 µm seen at TM1(z3)).Figure 5No single amino acid difference between the TMD1 s of the rat and zebrafish P2X3 subunits accounts for the differences observed at the chimeras TM1(r3) and TM1(z3). a, alignment of the amino acid sequences present in the TMD1 regions of the rat (upper) and zebrafish (lower) P2X3 subunits used to construct the chimeric receptors;boxed residues are identical; αβmeATP sensitivity is indicated by + or −. b, currents evoked from cells expressing the indicated point mutations in the chimera TM1(z3).

Values obtained from curve fits were ATP: EC50 = 1.5 ± 0.1 µm,n H = 1.3 ± 0.1; αβmeATP: EC50 = 155 ± 20 µm,n H = 1.5 ± 0.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that the variation in ATP and αβmeATP potencies exhibited at various P2X homo-oligomeric receptors is derived from the structure of the first transmembrane domain present in the monomer. By simply replacing the TMD1 of an αβmeATP-insensitive subunit with the equivalent domains of αβmeATP-sensitive subunits, it was possible to increase the potencies of both αβmeATP and ATP in the chimeric receptor. Additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that this effect was not the direct result of any single amino acid substitution, but rather the product of a cumulative effect upon the overall structure of TMD1 induced by the multiple amino acid differences seen across individual subunit primary sequences.Two possible mechanisms could explain these data. The first would be that the agonist binding site conformation had changed as a result of the chimerism such that ATP and αβmeATP now interacted with higher affinity at the binding site present on the chimeras versusthe wild type rP2X2. The second possibility would be that the transduction pathway linking agonist binding to opening of the channel gate had been altered in the chimeric protein such that a less precise fit of the agonist into the binding pocket could induce gating. As has been cogently argued (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), when performing mutational analyses of ligand-gated channels, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between mutational effects on agonist binding and those on channel opening, as both steps are dependent on, and affected by, one another. One approach to resolving this dilemma is to compare at least two agonists, differing in their efficacy, at each mutant receptor rather than comparing one mutant versus another using agonists of equal efficacy. This approach was used in our study, and, based on the findings, we do not favor the hypothesis that the observed increases in agonist potencies seen at a number of the chimeras resulted from changes only at the agonist binding site. Instead, the data provides a better fit to the hypothesis that the transduction properties of the receptor have been altered.This interpretation is based on the following observations. First, ATP potency was shifted at the majority of the chimeras, whereas the αβmeATP response was increased only at a few constructs (summarized in Table I). Second, the αβmeATP response at 1.2.1 did not reach the maximum obtained with ATP, which suggests that it is acting as a partial agonist at this construct. However, at TM1(r1), TM1(r3), and the triple mutant TM1(z3) I44V/C45G/M49L, αβmeATP was as efficacious as ATP and thus was a full agonist at those constructs. Therefore, the findings from all the chimeras strongly imply that the effect of the chimerism on agonist potencies was mediated by an alteration in gating rather than a change in ligand binding. This argument is based on the logic that a mutation affecting binding only would be predicted to affect agonist potency but not alter efficacy at the mutant when compared with the parent receptor. On the other hand, if the gating efficiency (i.e. transduction) was affected, then different agonists could have differing efficacies at a mutant compared with the parent receptor due to intrinsic differences in their ability to induce channel gating; such a dependence of channel gating efficiencies on protein structure has been reported for other ligand-gated channels as well (23O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22764-22768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A third finding was that the Hill slopes for ATP were shifted toward 1.0 for many of the chimeras (Table I), again a result that is easier to explain by a change in gating efficiency of a ligand rather than a simple change in binding affinity. Thus, the simplest interpretation of all of these results is that the outcome of transplanting the rP2X1 or rP2X3 TMD1 into rP2X2 was an enhancement in the transduction, or gating, of the channel in response to occupancy of the agonist binding site rather than solely an increase in agonist affinity for the binding site. This interpretation does not rule out the possibility that agonist affinity was also altered; it just excludes it as a sole reason for the observed results. In light of the lack of a high degree of conservation in the primary sequences of the P2X1 and P2X3 TMD1s, and across P2X subunits in general (Fig. 7), it would appear that the overall topological shape of TMD1, rather than a specific amino acid or two, is an important determinant of the agonist-induced gating behavior of the P2X receptor channel.Table ISummary of dose-response dataConstructATPαβmeATPEC50n HNEC50n HNwt-rP2X222 ± 11.6 ± 0.18>300ND61.2.10.93 ± 0.231.1 ± 0.3749 ± 121 ± 0.38TM1(r1)1.3 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.4973 ± 181 ± 0.38TM1(r3)0.39 ± 0.040.9 ± 0.0758.9 ± 4.31.3 ± 0.77TM1(z3)2.15 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.37>300ND6TM1(z3) I44V/C45G/M49L1.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.110155 ± 201.5 ± 0.27TM2(r1)0.72 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.37102 ± 360.72 ± 0.28Dose-response curves were fit with the Hill equation, and the EC50 values and Hill slopes (n H) determined for the indicated agonist and construct.

https://openalex.org/W2314592767,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a cytokine that induces programmed cell death, apoptosis, in a number of cell types and is employed by cytotoxic T cells to eliminate virus infected cells. Consequently, many viruses have acquired mechanisms to undermine these host cell defense mechanisms and cause resistance to TNF-mediated apoptosis. Here we show that normal human diploid fibroblasts that express the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein have a decreased propensity to undergo apoptosis in response to TNF treatment. The ability of E7 to undermine TNF-mediated apoptosis correlates with cellular transformation. While E7 does not generally subvert signaling by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, pro-caspase 8 activation is decreased in E7-expressing cells. E7 also provides some protection from apoptosis caused by stimulation of the TNF receptor 1-related cytokine receptor Fas, where induction of apoptosis occurs much slower in this cell type. Hence, E7-expressing normal human fibroblasts exhibit a specific defect that obstructs cytokine-mediated activation of pro-caspase 8 and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2007731150,"Ionizing radiation induces p53-dependent apoptosis in the spleen, providing a model system to study p53 regulated events in a normal cell type. We have developed an in vivo model that identifies genetic differences in the regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis and addresses whether altered post-translational events in the p53-p21/Rb axis modulate the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced cell death in vivo. Splenocytes from mice with distinct genetic backgrounds (DBA/2 and C57BL/6) exhibit differences in the rate of apoptosis. Whilst no obvious strain differences in protein levels of Bcl-2 or the cyclin-CDKs were observed, early post-translational regulatory events in the p53-p21/Rb axis showed striking differences in the two mouse strains. Cells from C57BL/6 animals undergo more rapid apoptosis after irradiation resulting from elevated levels and rapid induction of p53, pronounced Rb-cleavage, and the absence of a sustained induction of p21. In contrast, cells from DBA/2 animals have a reduced rate of apoptosis following irradiation with elevated levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb and a sustained induction of the p21 protein that is coincident with the C-terminal phosphorylation of p53. These data suggest that quantitative differences in the level of p21 protein can affect the rate of apoptosis in vivo, consistent with the view that p21 is an anti-apoptotic effector of p53. However, striking differences in the Rb protein-caspase cleavage or hyperphosphorylation-in the same cell type, but in different genetic backgrounds, demonstrates that p53-dependent apoptosis can be modulated in vivo by genetic factors that impinge upon the pro- or anti-apoptotic potential of Rb. In addition, we show that Rb cleavage is p53-dependent and that its phosphorylation status can be uncoupled from p21 expression. This study highlights the possibility that genetic factors can be identified that affect differential sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation in vivo."

All the mutations severely affected MgATP binding, whereas ATP binding was close to normal in the alanine, serine, glutamine, and valine mutants. In the serine and valine mutants, the maximum rate of phosphorylation from MgATP was 8- and 600-fold lower, respectively, compared with wild type. Replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ led to a 1.5-fold enhancement of the maximum phosphorylation rate in the valine mutant and a 5-fold reduction in the wild type. The turnover of the phosphoenzyme formed from MgATP was slowed 1–2 orders of magnitude relative to wild type in the alanine, serine, and valine mutants, but was close to normal in the aspartate and cysteine mutants. Only the serine mutant formed a phosphoenzyme in the backward reaction with Pi, and the hydrolysis of this intermediate was greatly enhanced. Analysis of the functional changes in the mutants in the light of the recent high resolution structure of the Ca2+-ATPase crystallized without the MgATP substrate suggests that, in the native activated state of the enzyme, the side chain hydroxyl of Thr-353 participates in important interactions with nucleotide and phosphate, possibly in catalysis, whereas the main chain carbonyl of Thr-353, but not the side chain, may coordinate the catalytic Mg2+.

Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The formation as well as the further processing of the aspartyl phosphorylated intermediate is associated with protein conformational changes that couple the events in the catalytic site with changes in the ion binding sites leading to ion translocation across the membrane (Fig. 1). The recent 2.6-Å resolution structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase1crystallized with bound Ca2+, but without the MgATP substrate (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), has revealed that the cytoplasmic portion of the protein is made up from three distinct domains (A, P, and N) that are rather loosely attached to each other and must move considerably to accomplish substrate binding and energy transduction (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 3McIntosh D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the binding sites for ATP and the catalytic magnesium ion, as well as the conformational changes involved in energy transduction, are not well understood, and more information is clearly needed about the functions of the individual amino acid residues in the catalytic site. Thr-353 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase is located in the catalytic region (domain P (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar)) close to the phosphorylated residue, Asp-351, and is highly conserved within the family of P-type cation pumps. Maruyama and co-workers (4Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Thr-353 to serine or alanine resulted in pumps with reduced Ca2+ transport activity but with preserved ability to undergo phosphorylation. These observations led to the proposal that the main role of Thr-353 is in the events that take place following phosphorylation, i.e. the conformational changes that are required for release of Ca2+ to the lumen or the dephosphorylation (4Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that Thr-353 is the residue at the phosphorylation site that becomes oxidized by the phosphate transition-state analogue monovanadate upon UV radiation under conditions favoring accumulation of the Ca2+ boundE 1 form (5Hua S. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30546-30550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The catalytic site of the P-type ATPases seems to be homologous to that of haloacid dehalogenase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphonatase, phosphomutase, and CheY, the response regulator protein of bacterial chemotaxis (6Aravind L.

The atomic structures of phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphonatase, and CheY have demonstrated that the main chain carbonyl at the position corresponding to Thr-353 contributes to coordination of the catalytic Mg2+ (7Wang W.

Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have subjected Thr-353 of the Ca2+-ATPase to mutational analysis to elucidate its role in the catalytic cycle of the pump. Thr-353 has been replaced by serine, alanine, valine, glutamine, aspartate, cysteine, and tyrosine to study the effects of variation in the size, polarity, and charge of the side chain. Several of the reaction steps shown in Fig. 1 were examined, and the results reveal a multiplicity of important functions of the threonine. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) was carried out as described previously (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression, the wild type or mutant cDNA, inserted in the pMT2 vector (16Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was transfected into COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The concentration of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (19Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by immunoblotting (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed wild type SERCA1a, for which the concentration had been determined by measurement of the maximum capacity for phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate in the presence of 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (20Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was used as standard. For evaluation of the expression level, the concentration of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was related to the total microsomal protein concentration determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). The ATP-driven transport of45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was measured by determining the amount of Pi liberated, as described previously (20Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), under conditions corresponding to maximal activity for the wild type at 37 °C, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgATP. Following the subtraction of the background activity determined with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells, the specific activity was calculated by relating the rate of Ca2+ transport or ATP hydrolysis to the expression level. Manual mixing experiments at various buffer and temperature conditions (detailed in the figure legends) were carried out according to the principles described previously (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed using a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) as described previously (22Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In all phosphorylation experiments, acid quenching was performed with 0.5–2 volumes of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mmH3PO4. The acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0 (23Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging using a Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor System. Background phosphorylation levels were subtracted from all data points. The background was usually determined in parallel experiments with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells. In some of the dephosphorylation experiments, the constant phosphorylation level reached after the exponential decay was taken as background (maximally 10% of the initial phosphorylation level). The synthesis of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP, the photolabeling of COS-1 cell microsomes containing wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase, the inhibition by ATP, and the quantification of labeled bands by electronic autoradiography following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (24Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Generally, the concentration of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP was 3·K 0.5 in the inhibition experiments with ATP. Details of the buffer composition are given in the figure legends. The ion concentrations in the reaction buffers were calculated using the program WEBMAXC, available on the World Wide Web, and the stability constants therein (26Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.). Monoexponential functions were fitted to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation time courses. Initial phosphorylation rates per ATPase molecule in units of s−1 were obtained from the slopes of the fitted curves at time zero, following normalization of the phosphorylation levels to the enzyme concentration. The analysis of ligand concentration dependences was based on the Hill equation, [EL]=Etot·[L]n/(K0.5n+[L]n)Equation 1 For analysis of the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data, a constant or linear component was added to represent nonspecific labeling as described (24Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the Hill coefficient was set to 1. The “true” dissociation constant for ATP and MgATP binding was calculated using the previously validated equation for competitive inhibition of the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling (25McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Seven mutants with changes to Thr-353 were examined in the present study, Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Ser, Thr-353 → Gln, Thr-353 → Cys, Thr-353 → Val, Thr-353 → Asp, and Thr-353 → Tyr, all of which were expressed to levels similar to that of the wild type. Under conditions corresponding to maximal activity for the wild type at 37 °C, pH 7.0, 10–100 μm Ca2+, and 5 mm MgATP, mutant Thr-353 → Ser was able to transport Ca2+ and hydrolyze ATP at a rate of ∼20% of the wild type rate, in good agreement with previously published data (4Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all the other Thr-353 mutants, the Ca2+ transport and ATPase activity determined under these conditions constituted less than 5% of the activity corresponding to wild type (data not shown). In Fig. 2 is shown the results of experiments carried out to obtain an initial overview of the phosphorylation properties of the Thr-353 mutants. The wild type Ca2+-ATPase in the Ca2 E 1 state is able to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate by reaction with MgATP (cf. Fig.1). It can be seen in Fig.2 A that only the wild type and the mutant Thr-353 → Ser formed significant amounts of phosphoenzyme upon incubation with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 15 s at 0 °C and pH 7.0 in the presence of 100 μmCa2+ and 5 mm Mg2+ (saturating concentrations for the wild type). When, however, the incubation was carried out for 5 s at 25 °C in the presence of 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, under otherwise identical conditions, a markedly increased level of phosphorylation was seen for mutants Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Cys, Thr-353 → Asp, and, in particular, Thr-353 → Val (Fig. 2 B). It has previously been demonstrated that the catalytic Mg2+can be replaced by various other divalent cations. Among these, Mn2+ seems to be the most efficient co-substrate, both for phosphorylation from ATP (27Yamada S. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3108-3119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the backward phosphorylation from Pi (28Mintz E. Lacapere J.J. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18762-18768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titration of the Mn2+ dependence of the ATPase activity has shown that the concentration of Mn2+ required for maximum activity is lower than that of Mg2+ (29Chiesi M. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C shows the results of experiments performed under conditions similar to those in Fig.2 B except for the replacement of the 5 mmMg2+ with 0.5 mm Mn2+. This caused a further 2- to 5-fold increase in the phosphorylation level of mutants Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Cys, Thr-353 → Val, and Thr-353 → Asp, and even mutant Thr-353 → Gln now showed significant phosphorylation. Although Mn2+ forms a tighter complex with sulfur than Mg2+, allowing the use of “Mn2+ rescue” to locate metal ion binding sites (30Piccirilli J.A. Vyle J.S. Caruthers M.H. Cech T.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 31Christian E.L. Yarus M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ did not increase the phosphorylation level more in Thr-353 → Cys than in Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Val, or Thr-353 → Asp, suggesting that the side chain does not interact directly with the metal ion. In the absence of Ca2+, the Ca2+-ATPase in theE 2 form can also be phosphorylated in the backward direction of normal turnover with inorganic phosphate, resulting in the accumulation of E 2P,cf. Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 2 D, all the Thr-353 mutants displayed a severely reduced ability to undergo phosphorylation from 32Pi. Under conditions optimal for phosphorylation from Pi in the wild type, mutant Thr-353 → Ser was phosphorylated to a level of 24% that of the wild type, whereas the remaining six Thr-353 mutants showed no phosphorylation above the level of control microsomes. Contrary to the situation with phosphorylation from ATP, replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ did not increase the Pi phosphorylation levels of the mutants. Even Thr-353 → Ser showed no phosphorylation under these conditions, whereas the wild type phosphorylation level remained practically unaltered (data not shown). To investigate the consequences of mutations to Thr-353 for the binding of ATP and MgATP (the latter often being considered the “true substrate” (32Vianna A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 410: 389-406Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar)), a specific photolabeling assay was used, in which the affinities can be measured by competitive inhibition of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling (24Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The photolabeling is carried out in the absence of Ca2+ (to prevent phosphoryl transfer to the enzyme) and at pH 8.5 (to reduce nonspecific labeling to minimum and ensure that the predominant enzyme conformation is E 1 (33McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol.

Even though the photolabel may bind at a site that differs slightly from that of ATP or MgATP, there is sufficient overlap between the sites to ensure efficient competition, and we previously demonstrated that the competition assay produces highly accurate values for the ATP and MgATP binding affinities of wild type and mutant Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cells (25McIntosh D.B.

Results obtained with the Thr-353 mutants are summarized in TableI and exemplified by Thr-353 → Ala and Thr-353 → Ser in Fig. 3. For the wild type Ca2+-ATPase, the K 0.5 for TNP-8N3-MgATP photolabeling and the dissociation constant,K D, for MgATP determined in the presence of Mg2+ have previously been shown to be close to 1.0 and 0.5 μm, respectively (25McIntosh D.B.

Under the same conditions, all the Thr-353 mutants, apart from Thr-353 → Asp, showed concentration dependences for TNP-8N3-MgATP labeling quite similar to that of the wild type, indicating that Thr-353 does not contribute significantly to the binding of the photolabel (Fig. 3 A and Table I). On the other hand, the affinity for MgATP was, for all Thr-353 mutants, severalfold lower (K D increased) than that of the wild type: 6- to 10-fold for mutants Thr-353 → Ser, Thr-353 → Cys, and Thr-353 → Val, 65- to 187-fold for Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Gln, and Thr-353 → Tyr, and more than 1000-fold for Thr-353 → Asp (Fig. 3 B and Table I).Table INucleotide binding parameters of wild type and mutant Ca2+-ATPases in the presence and absence of Mg2+Mg2+/EGTA1-aMedium: 25 mmEPPS/tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (pH 8.5), 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA.EDTA1-bMedium: 25 mmEPPS/tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (pH 8.5), 20% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA.K 0.5 (TNP-8N3-MgATP)K D(MgATP)1-cThe “true”K D calculated under the assumption of competitive inhibition as previously described (24, 25).

In the absence of Mg2+ (i.e. presence of EDTA), the wild type displays a 10-fold higher affinity (decrease inK 0.5) for TNP-8N3-ATP labeling as compared with the affinity in the presence of Mg2+. By contrast, the affinity for ATP is 33-fold lower than the affinity for MgATP (33McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Like the wild type, all mutants showed higher affinity for the photolabel in the absence of Mg2+ than in its presence (Fig. 3 A and Table I). The affinity for ATP determined by competition with the photolabel was for mutant Thr-353 → Cys 35-fold lower than the affinity for MgATP (Table I), whereas mutants Thr-353 → Ser and Thr-353 → Val showed only a 4- to 7-fold decrease in the affinity upon removal of Mg2+ (compare with 33-fold for the wild type), and mutants Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Gln, Thr-353 → Asp, and Thr-353 → Tyr displayed an affinity for ATP higher than or similar to the affinity for MgATP (Fig. 3 C and Table I). In fact, the ATP affinities of Thr-353 → Ala, Thr-353 → Ser, Thr-353 → Gln, and Thr-353 → Val were rather similar to that of the wild type despite the severalfold lowering of their MgATP affinities. This shows that Thr-353 is important for the binding of MgATP but less so for the binding of ATP. It is furthermore noteworthy that mutant Thr-353 → Asp exhibited the lowest nucleotide affinity of all the Thr-353 mutants under every condition tested, suggesting electrostatic repulsion of the nucleotide by the negatively charged aspartate side chain. The time course of phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was studied for selected Thr-353 mutants under conditions identical to those corresponding to Fig. 2,B and C. In the presence of Mg2+, the wild type reaches the steady-state level of phosphorylation within a few hundred milliseconds, with a slight initial overshoot (Fig.4 A, cf. also Ref.22Sørensen T.L.

For simplicity, a monoexponential function was fitted to the data, giving an apparent rate constant k obs = 63 s−1 for the approach to steady state. Under the same conditions, the k obs was 7.3 s−1for Thr-353 → Ser, 0.9 s−1 for Thr-353 → Cys, and only 0.16 s−1 for Thr-353 → Val (Fig. 4, A andB).

The A subunit is similar in length and in sequence to the eucaryotic and eubacterial NAD-linked enzyme (EC 1.2.1.12) protomers. The B subunit has a 27- to 29-residue C-terminal extension that contains two invariant cysteines (Fig. 1). B subunits have only been found in angiosperms. In species ranging from Cyanobacteria to angiosperms, NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases are light-activated (1Anderson L.E. Callow J.A. Advances in Botanical Research. 12. Academic Press, New York1986: 1-46Google Scholar, 2Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 288: 1-9Google Scholar). Activation involves the reduction of an inhibiting disulfide bond or bonds. Although modeling indicates that two Cys residues in the A subunit are almost certainly responsible for the redox sensitivity of the enzyme in green algae and nonflowering plants (3Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the presence of the conserved Cys pair in the extended angiosperm B subunit suggests that it too might be involved in redox regulation. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine which cysteine residues in the pea chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase form cystines and are responsible for the redox sensitivity of the enzyme. The wild type NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase used in the mass mapping experiments was purified from pea plants by a modification of the method of Anderson et al. (4Anderson L.E. Goldhaber-Gordon I.M. Li D. Tang X.-y. Prakash N. Planta. 1995; 196: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Prior to the acetone fractionation step, the suspended MgCl2-polyethylene glycol fraction was passed through a DEAE column (10 ml of Sigma Fast Flow DEAE) in 10 mm KHPO4, pH 7.8 buffer. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in this fraction was not retained on the column. It emerged in a milky excluded fraction. After acetone fractionation, the cloudy 50% acetone supernatant was applied to a second 10-ml DEAE column in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and the column was washed overnight with the Tris buffer and eluted with a linear phosphate gradient (200 ml of 10 mmKHPO4, pH 7.8 and 200 ml of 0.4 mKHPO4, pH 7.0). In some experiments, including those represented by Figs. 2 and 3, 10 mm mercaptoethanol was included in the buffers. In other experiments, including the experiments represented by Figs. 4 and 5, mercaptoethanol was omitted. Essentially identical results were obtained with or without inclusion of mercaptoethanol in the buffers during isolation. Chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column (5Li A.D. Anderson L.E.

Cyanylation of the free sulfhydryl groups was accomplished during incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture of cyanylated A and B subunits of GAPDH was separated by reversed phase HPLC at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using gradient elution (10% B at 0–5 min → 40% B at 20 min → 80% B at 60 min) (solvent B was 90% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) with Waters model 6000 pumps. UV detection was done at 215 nm. A Vydac C18 column (catalog number 218TP54, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pores, 4.6 × 250 mm) was used. Fractions (∼0.8–1.0 ml) were collected manually. The masses of the collected species in each fraction were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). After reduction of the volume (to less than 5 μl) under partial vacuum, the HPLC fractions containing the cyanylated A and B subunits of GAPDH were reconstituted in 20-μl aliquots of 1.0 maqueous ammonia.

After the addition of 40 μl of 30% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to the dried cleavage products, the samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. MALDI mass spectra were obtained on a Voyager DE-STR or DE-Elite mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. The accelerating voltage in the ion source was set at 25 kV. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive linear mode of operation. For analysis of the intact enzyme subunits, the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) scale was calibrated externally using bovine ribonuclease A (average mass of protonated molecule (MH+), 13,683.2 Da) and bovine serum albumin (average mass of MH+, 66431 Da) obtained from Sigma. To analyze mixtures of CN-induced cleavage fragments, bovine ribonuclease A was added to the sample, and the m/z scale was internally calibrated on the singly and doubly protonated ribonuclease A peaks (m/z values are 13,683.2 and 6842.1, respectively). The m/z values of the two most intense peaks were then determined. Because mixing ribonuclease A with the sample caused signal suppression, several less sensitive components in the sample were not detected when the sample was mixed with ribonuclease A. These less sensitive components were detectable if the sample alone was analyzed by MALDI-MS. To determine the accurate masses of those less sensitive components, the mass spectrum of the sample alone was acquired and calibrated with the accuratem/z values of the two most intense peaks that were determined as described above. Analysis of the intact and cyanylated enzyme subunits was performed using sinapinic acid (Aldrich); all other analyses were performed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) as the matrix. Saturated matrix solutions were prepared in a 50% (v/v) aqueous solution of acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Just prior to analysis, 2 μl of matrix solution and 2 μl of sample solution were mixed in a vial, and then 2 μl of the mixed solution were applied to a stainless steel sample plate and allowed to air-dry before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. First the α carbon positions that superimposed from the x-ray crystal structures of the Sulfolobus solfataricus (PDB code 1b7g, Ref. 11Isupov M.N. Fleming T.M. Dalby A.R. Crowhurst G.S. Bourne P.C.

Bourne P.C. Littlechild J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Next a multiple alignment of the 121 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequences available in the data bases on March 25, 1998 was generated with the PileUp program in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 (Genetic Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). This alignment was used only where the two crystallographic structures differed. The sequences of the archaeal enzymes fromMethanobacterium formicicum (National Center for Biotechnology Information protein identification number gi4456664),Methanobacterium bryantii (gi1346066), Methanothermus fervidus (gi120700), Pyrococcus horikoshii (gi3258267),Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (gi3122122),Methanococcus jannaschii (gi3122125), Pyrococcus woesei (gi120706), Archaeoglobus fulgidus (gi3122123), and S. solfataricus and the sequences of the three B subunits from spinach (gi120664), pea (gi120663), andArabidopsis (gi166708) were used for the alignment of the extended C terminus. Other segments were positioned according to the multiple alignment except that the residues in the archaeal and chloroplast enzymes, which correspond to the region between Arg-281 and Val-288 in the Bacillus enzyme, were realigned against one another and the corresponding region of the Bacillus enzyme. Where warranted the alignments were optimized manually. When the enzyme purified as described under “Materials and Methods” was subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS, three species were detected with mass spectral peaks atm/z 36,218.9, 18,101.8, and 12,125.2 corresponding to the singly, doubly, and triply protonated A subunit of GAPDH (calculated mass, 36,185.4) and mass spectral peaks atm/z 39,341.3, 19,691.8, and 13,122.5 corresponding to the singly, doubly, and triply protonated B subunit of GAPDH (calculated mass, 39,304.1 Da) (Fig.2). Proteins with molecular masses of 8.0, 8.3, and 16.5 kDa were also detected. After cyanylation and HPLC separation on a C18 column, four proteins were found, two corresponding to cyanylated products of an 8.3-kDa protein (Fig. 3, HPLC peaks 1 and 2), one corresponding to the cyanylated B subunit of GAPDH (HPLC peak 4), and one corresponding to the cyanylated A subunit (HPLC peak 5) (Fig. 3) as determined by MALDI-MS analysis. The ratio of the area under the HPLC peaks corresponding to the A and B subunits was 1:1.7. As shown in Scheme FS1, cyanylation of the sulfhydryl group of a single free cysteine residue in a peptide followed by CN-induced cleavage in aqueous ammonia will produce two fragments (8Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol.

If the sequence of the peptide is known, mass mapping analysis (comparing the experimental masses determined by mass spectrometry against the calculated masses from the sequence to identify the fragments) will allow identification of the fragments. If there are n free cysteines in the peptide, n + 1 CN-induced fragments will be produced by the above chemical process. Because only free sulfhydryl groups are cyanylated and the CN-induced cleavage will only occur at cyanylated cysteine sites, mass mapping the mixture of CN-induced fragments allows identification of the free cysteine residues. As shown in Fig.4 and TableI, mass mapping analysis of the cleavage products of the cyanylated A subunit of GAPDH indicated the presence of CN-induced fragments 1–19, itz-20–153, itz-158–277, itz-278–288, and itz-289–337 (where itz = iminothiazolidine-4-carboxyl-blocked N terminus). According to the CN-induced cleavage reaction shown in Scheme FS1, fragment 1–19 resulted from CN-induced cleavage on the N-terminal side of cyanylated Cys20; and thus, in the original A subunit of GAPDH, Cys20 was a free cysteine that was not involved in a disulfide bond. Similarly Cys154, Cys158, Cys278, and Cys289, were identified as free cysteines in the original A subunit.Table IExperimental and calculated masses for protonated CN-induced cleavage fragments of the cyanylated GAPDH subunit ACN-induced fragmentCalculated massExperimental m/zDa1–192,188.6 (+1)1-a+1 designates singly protonated (also singly charged) species, and +2 designates doubly protonated (also doubly charged) species.2,188.6Itz-20–15314,087.9 (+1)14,084.77,044.5 (+2)7,042.1Itz-154–157463.5 (+1)Not detected1-bDue to signal suppression by matrix molecules in MALDI.Itz-158–27712,824.0 (+1)12,821.16,412.5 (+2)6,411.9Itz-278–2881,305.5 (+1)1,305.0Itz-289–3375,537.2 (+1)5,537.21-a +1 designates singly protonated (also singly charged) species, and +2 designates doubly protonated (also doubly charged) species.1-b Due to signal suppression by matrix molecules in MALDI. Open table in a new tab Mass mapping of the CN-induced cleavage fragments of the cyanylated B subunit indicated that there were two different subunit B species in the original sample, namely the oxidized form and the reduced form. The presence of fragments 1–18, itz-19–154, itz-159–279, itz-280–290, and itz-291–367 (Fig. 5 and TableII) in the cleavage reaction mixture indicates the presence of the oxidized form of subunit B, which has a disulfide bond between Cys354 and Cys363. The presence of fragment itz-291–367 provides evidence for the Cys354–Cys363 disulfide bond; otherwise itz-291–367 would not have been found. Cyanylation and CN-induced cleavage would have occurred at Cys354 and Cys363 had the cysteine sulfhydryls been free. The mass of the singly protonated fragment itz-291–367 resulting from CN-induced cleavage at cyanylated Cys291 was determined to be 8570.5 ± 0.3 Da (8570.5 Da is the average of 13 measurements using calibration by internal standards and 0.3 is the confidence interval at the level of 95%). Furthermore, the data are consistent with fragment itz-291–367 containing a disulfide bond, namely Cys354–Cys363 (with overall calculated mass of 8570.5 Da), rather than two free sulfhydryls at Cys354 and Cys363 (with overall calculated mass of 8572.5 Da).

Open table in a new tab Cyanylation of free cysteines followed by CN-induced cleavage under alkaline conditions is specific (9Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wakselman M. Guibe-Jampel E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1976; : 21-22Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conditions for cyanylation and CN-induced cleavage reaction have been optimized (8Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mass mapping of the CN-induced cleavage products can be used to determine the locations of the free cysteines (13Wu J. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because GAPDH was simultaneously denatured in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride and cyanylated at acidic pH (pH 3), the possibility of scrambling between thiolate ions (from ionization of the free cysteine sulfhydryl groups) and a disulfide bond was minimized. The experiments reported here demonstrate that it is feasible to determine the cysteine status of various forms (such as partially oxidized and reduced forms of GAPDH subunit B) of a protein using methodology based on cyanylation, CN-induced cleavage, and mass mapping even when these different forms cannot be separated by HPLC. As is apparent from examining Fig. 4 and Table I, the expected cleavage fragment itz-154–157 from the cyanylated A subunit was not detected by MALDI-MS because of suppression by matrix molecules used in MALDI. However, determination of the cysteine status was still possible because there were two CN-induced cleavage fragments related to cleavage at one cyanylated cysteine residue, one to the N-terminal side and the other to the C-terminal side of the cleavage site. Detecting only one of the two CN-induced cleavage fragments will allow for the identification of the cyanylated cysteine residue. This methodology, therefore, does not require complete detection of all the CN-induced cleavage fragments. Similar cases of signal suppression are shown in Fig. 5 and Tables II and III. In Fig. 3, HPLC peaks 4 and 5 (corresponding to the cyanylated B subunit and A subunit, respectively) were not completely resolved. This is reflected in the MALDI spectra (Figs. 4 and 5) of the CN-induced cleavage products of these two fractions, each of which contains minor peaks representing fragments corresponding to the CN-induced cleavage products of the other fraction. Because fractions that are not completely separated do not interfere with the determination of the cysteine status, it was not necessary to completely separate peaks 4 and 5. Most of the other MALDI peaks in Figs. 4 and 5 that were identified but not described above are from side reactions such as β-elimination (Scheme FS1) and incomplete CN-induced cleavage. These peaks do not interfere with the determination of the cysteine status of GAPDH subunits A and B. Details about these side reactions can be found elsewhere (14Qi J. Wu J. Somokuti G.A. Watson J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To predict the position of the disulfide bond in the three-dimensional structure, we simulated the structure of the B subunit using the structures of the B. stearothermophilus(PDB code 1gd1) (12Skarz⋅yński T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and the S. solfataricus (PDB code 1b7g) (11Isupov M.N. Fleming T.M. Dalby A.R. Crowhurst G.S. Bourne P.C. Littlechild J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases as models. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases from the Archaea also utilize NADP(H) as a cofactor, and like the angiosperm B subunits, they are elongated at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The overall sequence identity between the archaeal enzyme and the pea chloroplast B subunit is 16% after alignment (Fig. 1). The sequence identity between the B. stearothermophilus enzyme and the B subunit is 60%. Although the sequence identity between the S. solfataricus and the pea chloroplast B subunit is very low, there is remarkable structural homology between the S. solfataricus and the B. stearothermophilus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. A surprising 58%, 224 of 340 α carbons, are coincident despite a mere 15% identity between the sequences after alignment (15Fleming T.M. Jones C.E. Piper P.W. Cowan D.A. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 21% identity between the S. solfataricus enzyme and the pea chloroplast subunit B in those segments where the α carbons in the two crystal structures are superimposable is significantly higher than the 7% identity after alignment in regions where they are not superimposable. In the portion of the C-terminal segment where there is overlap the identity is 21%. These relative differences are also seen with the chloroplast B subunit sequences from spinach,Arabidopsis, and tobacco. For models based on sequence alignment the lowest acceptable homology (sequence identity after alignment) is usually considered to be about 30% (see Ref. 16Hilbert M. Böhm G. Jaenicke R. Proteins. 1993; 17: 138-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, however, the high percentage of superimposable α carbons in the two model enzymes and the similarities in sequence in the B subunit andSulfolobus enzyme made it seem reasonable to use the three-dimensional structure of the archaeal C terminus to predict the positions of the two Cys residues in the C-terminal segment of the chloroplastic B subunit. As modeled, the two C-terminal B subunit Cys residues lie across from one another on the opposing sides of the domain interface (Fig.6) separated at the α carbons by 11.7 Å. This is well within the range of α carbon separations that permits disulfide bond formation if there are no intervening structural elements and if the Cys-containing segments are able to move (see Ref.17Careaga C.L. Sutherland J. Sabeti J. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3048-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This disulfide would be accessible to the natural reductant reduced thioredoxin. It has been suggested that the chloroplast enzyme is present in vivo as a mixture of the A4 tetramer, the A2B2 tetramer, and higher oligomeric forms of the A2B2 tetramer. The recombinant B4 tetramer forms in the absence of the A subunit in Escherichia coli (5Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a 1.7 to 1 ratio of the B to the A subunit in the pea leaf enzyme preparation used in these experiments. There is no indication in our experiments of the presence of degradation products of the B subunit or that the shorter subunit corresponds to a mixture of A subunits and degraded B subunits. We suggest that the wild type tetramer represents at least one additional species containing at least three B subunits. More likely it represents the five possible combinations of A and B subunits in a tetramer (B4, A1B3, A2B2, A3B, and A4). The mass mapping analysis based on cyanylation and CN-induced cleavage clearly indicates that the regulatory disulfide bond in the light-activated pea chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase links the two Cys residues in the C-terminal extension of subunit B. Recently Hutchison et al. (19Hutchison R.S. Groom Q. Ort D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6679-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) determined the redox potential for the inactivating disulfide bond in the tomato leaf chloroplast enzyme. That value then represents the redox potential of the C-terminal disulfide bond. The recombinant pea B4glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expressed in E. coli is redox-sensitive (5Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistent with the present results, when the C-terminal extension is removed genetically, the resultant recombinant mutant enzyme is significantly less redox-sensitive (5Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,18Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The regulatory disulfide bonds in the redox-regulated chloroplast malate dehydrogenase (20Carr P.D. Verger D. Ashton A.R. Ollis D.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 461-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in the chloroplast fructose bisphosphatase (22Chiadmi M. Navaza A. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jacquot J.P. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6809-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) are also located in extensions or insertions. Modeling suggests that the two Cys residues in the C-terminal extension of the chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are located in different domains. If there is interdomain movement during catalysis (23Skarz⋅yński T. Wonacott A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1097-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in the NADP-linked chloroplast enzyme, cross-linking the domains would be expected to be inhibitory. In contrast, the disulfide bonds in malate dehydrogenase and fructose bisphosphatase are intradomain disulfide bonds. A crystal structure will be required to confirm our prediction that the C-terminal disulfide bond forms an interdomain cross-link in the chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. There is no experimental evidence here for a second disulfide bond in the angiosperm chloroplast enzyme, although modeling (Ref. 24Li D. Stevens F.J. Schiffer M. Anderson L.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and this study) suggests a disulfide bond between Cys20 and Cys289 in the A subunit and another one between the corresponding Cys residues in the B subunit. Similarly in both malate dehydrogenase (24Li D. Stevens F.J. Schiffer M. Anderson L.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Muslin E.H. Anderson L.E. Garab G. Photosynthesis, Mechanisms and Effects. 5. Kluwer, Boston1998: 3583-3586Crossref Google Scholar) and fructose bisphosphatase (26Jacquot J.-P. Lopez-Jaramillo J. Miginiac-Maslow M. Lemaire S. Cherfils J. Chueca A. Lopez-Gorge J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), at least one additional disulfide bond not seen in the available crystal structures seems possible. Homology modeling, based on the coordinates of the NAD-linked B. stearothermophilus enzyme in PDB code 1gd1(12Skarz⋅yński T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), implicates the Cys residues corresponding to Cys20and Cys289 in the dark inactivation of the NADP-linkedChlamydomonas reinhardtii enzyme. The algal enzyme has no C-terminal extension and, as modeled, no other Cys residues positioned to form disulfides (Ref. 3Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, PDB codes 1nlg and 1nlh). Because lower plant and algal chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases are not known to contain B subunits, it seems likely that this disulfide bond can form and does affect activity in many species. Presumably when the enzyme acquired a more effective disulfide bond in the C-terminal extension, formation of the obsolete Cys20–Cys289 disulfide was eliminated. This could have been accomplished by a change in structure and/or charge distribution. Interestingly the Sulfolobus enzyme also has an interdomain disulfide bond (11Isupov M.N. Fleming T.M. Dalby A.R. Crowhurst G.S. Bourne P.C. Littlechild J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This nonregulatory disulfide bond is thought to stabilize the enzyme in the high temperature environment where the organism exists in nature. Consistent with the mutational experiments of Baalmann et al. (18Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and of Li and Anderson (5Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the Cys residues in the extension are responsible for the redox sensitivity of the higher plant chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases that contain B subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2089760689,"Interferons (IFNs) and retinoids are potent tumor growth suppressors. We have shown earlier that the IFN-beta and all-trans retinoic acid combination, but not the single agents, induces death in several tumor cell lines. Employing a genetic approach we have recently identified several Genes associated with Retinoid-IFN induced Mortality (GRIM) that mediate the cell death effect of IFN/RA combination. One of the GRIMs, GRIM-12, was identical to human thioredoxin reductase (TR), an enzyme that controls intracellular redox state. To define the participants of TR mediated death pathway we have examined the role of thioredoxin (Trx), its downstream substrate, and its influence on IFN/RA-induced death regulation. Inhibition of the thioredoxin expression by antisense RNA suppressed cell death. Similarly, a mutant Trx1 lacking the critical cysteine residues blocked cell death. In contrast, overexpression of wildtype thioredoxin augmented cell death. This effect of Trx1 was in part due to its ability to augment cell death via caspase-8. The redox inactive Trx1 mutant inhibits the cell death induced by caspase-8 but not caspase-3. These studies identify a novel mechanism of cell death regulation by IFN/RA combination involving redox enzymes."

Among the small DNA tumor viruses, E1A and SV40 large T as well as E6 protein of HPV-16 bind to CBP/p300 and inhibit the transcriptional activity of CBP/p300 (28Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L.

Regions of CBP/p300 involved in binding to E1A have been determined (21Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two critical sequences on E1A for binding CBP/p300 have also been defined (32Wong H.K. Ziff E.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4910-4920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subspecies of p300 with high histone acetyltransferase activity has been shown to co-precipitate with Py large T (33Nemethova M. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1999; 73(2): 1734-1739Crossref Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this interaction and the binding regions involved remain unknown. In this report we identify a specific site in Py large T that is critical for binding CBP/p300 and introduce mutations to help evaluate the associated functions in cell culture and in the mouse. Using reporter gene constructs and co-transfection, we show that wild type but not mutant large T inhibits CREB-mediated transactivation. Unlike the pRb-binding mutants, which are competent both to transform cells in culture and to induce tumors in the mouse, the CBP/p300-binding mutant transforms but is defective in inducing tumors, suggesting a primary block in virus replication. NIH 3T3 cells, PyF, WOP, BR-lT, and Py6 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.375% sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% calf serum in a 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Dr. J. DeCaprio and from our laboratory (9Dey D.C. Bronson R.P. Dahl J. Carroll J.P. Benjamin T.L. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 231-237PubMed Google Scholar). These were maintained in the same medium except 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used in place of calf serum. The RB1 mutant virus expressing a large T mutant that fails to bind pRb (7Freund R.

Bronson R.T. Benjamin T.L. Virology. 1993; 196: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the mutant viral DNA (see below). GST-CBP fusion plasmids and CMV-p65relA were provided by T. Collins. GST-p300 plasmids were provided by Dr. M. Joo. CMV-p300 and CMV-E1A plasmids and AC26 antibody were provided by D. Livingston. RSV-CBP and RSV-PKA plasmids were provided by R. Goodman. To construct CMV-LT, lT cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Other plasmids used in transient transfection assays were purchased from Stratagene. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and extracted as described (36Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated with cell extracts prepared as described below for 2 h at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0. 1 37 m NaCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2,0.1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μm NaF, 0.1 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and washed five times with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TNET buffer (10 mm Tris, 2.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with F4 mouse monoclonal anti-T antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The blots were washed four times with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and then washed four times in TNE buffer. The T antigen bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). About 2 × 106 cells were extracted with 350 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 20 min at 4 °C, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of antibody against to CBP (A-22, Santa Cruz) for 4 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected by adding 40 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Research Products) and incubating samples for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by six washes with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the bound T antigen was detected with F4 antibody by Western blot analysis as described above. For CBP detection on nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blotted with mouse monoclonal anti-CBP antibody (AC26, gift from Dr. David Livingston) and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence. For virus infection and co-immunoprecipitation, about 60% confluent cells in 100-mm tissue culture plates were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cell extracts were made with the Nonidet P- 40 lysis buffer 48 h after infection. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays were performed as described above. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in six-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total amount of DNA was equalized with empty plasmids. After 5 h of transfection in 1 ml of serum-free medium, equal volume of 1% FBS (fetal bovine serum) for the experiments in Figs. 3 and 4 or 4% calf serum medium for Figs. 5and 6 was added and cells were incubated for 24 h. Medium was changed with medium containing 0.5% FBS for Figs. 3 and 4 or 2% calf serum for Figs. 5 and 6 and incubated for another 20 h before cell lysis. Extracts were prepared by lysing cells in Promega's reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed. All transfections were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Luciferase activities were measured with normalized β-galactosidase activity.

F-111 cells were transfected with viral DNAs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were plated for focus formation and for growth in soft agar as described (37Raptis L. Lamfrom H. Benjamin T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2476-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Newborn mice of the C3H/BiDa strain were inoculated at birth and followed form development of tumors as described (34Dawe C.J. Freund R. Mandel G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Talmage D.A. Benjamin T.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 127: 243-261PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the interaction between Py large T and CBP/p300, we began by comparing the amino acid sequences of Py large T with those of SV40 large T and E1A. Two short sequences in E1A have been shown to be involved in binding to CBP (32Wong H.K. Ziff E.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4910-4920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): LDQLI (residues 20–24) and QIFP (residues 64–67). The CBP-binding domain on SV40 large T has been localized within residues 500–550 (38Lill N.L. Tevethia M.J. Eckner R. Livingston D.M. Modjtahedi N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 129-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Py large T has sequences homologous to the CBP-binding domains of E1A and SV40 large T (Fig.1 A). In vitro GST pull-down assays were carried out to determine whether CBP interacts with Py large T (Fig. 1 B) using four GST-CBP fusion proteins that span the full length of CBP. These proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with extracts prepared from cells containing all three Py T antigens. The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The results indicate that two domains of CBP, the N terminus (amino acids 1–771) and a middle portion (amino acids 1069–1892), bind to Py large T antigen. The middle portion contains the C/H3 domain (amino acids 1805–1891) that is known to bind to SV40 large T and adenovirus E1A as well as to other cellular factors such as RNA helicase A and STAT1α (39Nakajima T.

Recent evidence has shown that an N-terminal fragment of CBP (amino acids 1–450) binds to E1A in vitro (21Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with GST-p300 fusion proteins (Fig.1 B). These results confirm and extend those of Nemethova and Wintersberger (33Nemethova M. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1999; 73(2): 1734-1739Crossref Google Scholar) and show that Py large T binds to regions of CBP/p300 that are also targets of SV40 large T and adenovirus E1A. Interactions between Py large T and CBP in intact cells were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-CBP or anti-T antisera. Lysates from several cell lines were used for co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.1 C). PyF and WOP cells are Py-transformed F111 rat fibroblasts and Py-transformed mouse 3T3 cells, respectively. Both cell lines express Py large, middle, and small T antigens. Anti-CBP antibody brought down large T as well as CBP, whereas normal rabbit IgG did not. These co-immunoprecipitation results show that large T forms complexes with CBP in both mouse and rat transformed cells. Neither small T nor middle T was found in these complexes, although their presence may have a role in large T:CBP binding by directly or indirectly modifying large T or CBP. To test this possibility, the BR-lT cell line expressing only large T was examined. Large T was found to co-precipitate with CBP, showing that neither small nor middle T are essential for large T:CBP interaction. Py6, a polyoma-transformed 3T3 cell line expressing a C-terminally truncated large T along with middle and small T proteins, was negative, indicating that the amino-terminal fragment of large T (roughly, residues 1–350) does not bind to CBP (data not shown). The region of SV40 large T containing the pRb-binding site has been found to be involved in CBP/p300 binding in some studies but not in others (28Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N. DeCaprio J.A. Livingston D.M. Morgan J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3454-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 38Lill N.L. Tevethia M.J. Eckner R. Livingston D.M. Modjtahedi N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 129-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a Py mutant large T unable to bind pRb (RB1) can still bind to CBP, extracts of NIH 3T3 cells infected with mutant RB1 or wild type virus were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody and blotted with anti-T antibody (Fig.2). Anti-CBP antibody did not bring down the nonspecific cellular protein from the uninfected cell extracts (lane 2), which migrated at a slightly higher molecular weight position than large T by SDS-PAGE and which was detected in whole cell extracts by anti-T antibody (lanes 1 and 3). Control antibodies (normal IgG and anti-Rho GDI antibody) did not bring down either CBP or large T (lanes 4, 5, 8, and9). Both wild type and RB1 mutant large T co-precipitated with anti-CBP antibody (lanes 6 and10). Thus a functional pRb binding site in large T is not necessary for CBP binding. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were also carried out using anti-T to precipitate and anti-CBP to blot. Results were variable in that CBP was not consistently detected (data not shown). This most likely reflects the fact that large T is more abundant than CBP and only a fraction of large T is bound to CBP. The bound fraction was estimated to be roughly 1–2% by comparing band densities of large T in input and co-IP lanes. To determine whether large T binding to CBP/p300 has functional consequences, we studied the effect of large T on transactivation by CREB, which is positively regulated by CBP (Fig.3). CBP/p300 proteins are co-activators of CREB. Adenovirus E1A is known to inhibit the transactivation activity of CREB (29Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). When CREB is phosphorylated at Ser-133 position by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), it binds to CBP/p300 and activates transcription of its target genes. For these assays, the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–280) of CREB fused with the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 and a reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc) carrying 5xGAL4 binding sequences in the promoter region that controls expression of the luciferase gene were used. p300 or CBP expression plasmids together with the GAL4-CREB expression plasmid were co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Co-transfection of the p300 expression plasmid increased the activity of CREB, whereas co-transfection of equal amount of CBP expression plasmid increased the activity of CREB only slightly. It is not clear why p300 has more effect than CBP on the activity of CREB in NIH 3T3 cells. Co-transfection of the large T expression plasmid suppressed the activity of the CREB transactivation by CBP/p300 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that suppression of CREB transactivation activities by large T may be mediated through sequestration of CBP/p300 from the phosphorylated CREB. Inhibition of CREB-mediated transactivation could result in principle from a direct interaction of large T with CREB. This was tested in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-CREB-1 and anti-CREB-2 antibodies and extracts of BR-lT cells expressing large T. Immune complexes were separated and blotted for large T. No evidence of large T co-precipitation was observed (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of transactivation results from large T binding to CBP/p300 co-activators and not to CREB. It has been reported that CBP/p300 interacts with p53 and activates p53-responsive genes such as those for p21cip/waf-1 and mdm2 (13Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 14Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). It is also known that SV40 large T forms a ternary complex with CBP/p300 and p53 (38Lill N.L. Tevethia M.J. Eckner R. Livingston D.M. Modjtahedi N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 129-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBP/p300 may therefore play a role as a bridge between polyomavirus large T and p53. We performed transient transfection assays in p53−/− MEFs using the plasmids as described above (Fig. 4 A). The reporter gene was activated 16-fold by co-transfection of RSV-PKA and GalCREB. It was further activated when CBP or p300 was co-transfected. In all cases, co-transfection of large T plasmid suppressed the transactivation activity of CREB in a dose-dependent manner. To further test whether large T interacts with CBP in the absence of p53, we performed co-immunoprecipitation with cell extracts from large T transfected p53-null MEFs. The results showed that large T was found in the immune complexes with CBP precipitated with anti-CBP antibody (Fig. 4 B). Thus, p53 is dispensable for large T:CBP interaction and for inhibition of CREB-mediated transactivation. To define the binding site of large T to CBP, mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the “QLFP” sequence (residues 668–671) homologous to the regions in E1A and SV40 lT involved in p300/CBP binding (see Fig.1 A). The mutants were then tested in CREB-mediated transactivation assays (Fig.5 A). Mutations L669H and F670Y showed little or no change in inhibitory activity. However, substitutions for the proline at position 671, either P671L or P671C, knocked out the inhibitory function of large T in this assay. To confirm that the loss of inhibitory function is due to failure of the 671 mutants to bind CBP, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with wild type and mutant proteins. Cell extracts from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with wild type and mutant Py large T cDNAs were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody and blotted with anti-T monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5 B). Wild type large T and L669H and F670Y large T mutant proteins were found in the immune complexes, whereas P671L and P671C were not detected. The levels of expression of the large T proteins were comparable in the cell extracts (Fig. 5 C). The loss of inhibitory as well as binding activity in the 671 mutants defines this region of large T as essential for interaction with CBP. Many transcription factors are known to interact with CBP/p300. Among them, p65relA of the NF-κB complex activates transcription of target genes by binding to CBP/p300 (18Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We tested by transient transfection assays whether large T inhibits NF-κB- as well as CREB-mediated transactivation. The NF-κB-Luc and the CRE-Luc reporter plasmids have five copies of NF-κB and four copies of CREB binding sites, respectively. The transactivation of luciferase reporter gene in the CRE-Luc plasmid was i"

A. 1993; 90: 11442-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Hertel R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 461-462Crossref Google Scholar, 19Venis M.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 463-465Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transgenic tobacco plants conditionally overexpressing the Arabidopsis ABP1 were shown to exhibit an increased capacity for auxin-mediated cell expansion (20Jones A.M. Im K.H. Savka M.A. Wu M.J. Dewitt N.G. Shillito R. Binns A.N. Science. 1998; 282: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of ABP1 in the early activation of the auxin-dependent electrical response at the plasma membrane has been demonstrated by using a collection of monoclonal antibodies to the tobacco protein (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a KDEL sequence at the C terminus of ABP1 acting as a retention signal in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Pelham H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 23Napier R.M. Fowke L.C. Hawes C. Lewis M. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 261-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been shown that a fraction of ABP1 reaches the plasma membrane (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H.

S. A. 1995; 92: 3425-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of ABP1 has also been proposed to be implicated in the interaction with plasma membrane components. A synthetic peptide comprising the last 12 residues of the C terminus of maize ABP1 was shown to modulate the K+currents of Vicia faba guard cells mimicking the effect of supra-optimal auxin concentrations (25Thiel G. Blatt M.R. Fricker M.D. White I.R. Millner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11493-11497Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Blatt M.R. Thiel G. Plant J. 1994; 5: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The C-terminal maize peptide was also shown to provoke a cytosolic pH alkalinization ofPaphiopedilum tonsum L. guard cells and consequently stomatal closure (27Gehring C.A. McConchie R.M. Venis M.A. Parish R.W. Planta. 1998; 205: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to increase GTPγS binding on microsomal fractions (28Millner P.A. Groarke D.A. White I.R. Plant Growth Regul. 1996; 18: 143-147Crossref Google Scholar). The same maize peptide as well as a 15-amino acid-long synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the tobacco protein and the Nt-abp1 protein itself have also been shown to induce the hyperpolarization of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts in the absence of auxin (29Barbier-Brygoo H. Zimmermann S. Thomine S. White I.R. Millner P. Guern J. Plant Growth Regul. 1996; 18: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar, 30Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The possible role of the KDEL sequence in the action of the C-terminal domain is unclear. The KDEL-truncated peptide was shown to promote GTPγS binding (28Millner P.A. Groarke D.A. White I.R. Plant Growth Regul. 1996; 18: 143-147Crossref Google Scholar) but was ineffective in altering cytosolic pH and stomatal closure suggesting that the C terminus is important in ABP1 function (27Gehring C.A. McConchie R.M. Venis M.A. Parish R.W. Planta. 1998; 205: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To analyze further the relative importance of specific residues within the C-terminal domain of ABP1 in protein folding as well as in the activation of the functional electrical response at the plasma membrane, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on highly conserved residues among ABP1 proteins. In addition to studies on the effect of each mutation in the functional assay, a detailed analysis of the dynamic interaction of the wild-type and mutated proteins with a set of mAbs recognizing distinct conformation-dependent epitopes have been performed by SPR. The influence of auxin on these interactions was also investigated. We report on the residues critical for ABP1 action at the plasma membrane. The functional assay and dynamic interaction analysis provide new insights on the structure-function relationship of ABP1. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi) were grown from seeds in a greenhouse (22 °C, 9-h photoperiod). Mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from young tobacco leaves using the procedure described by Caboche (31Caboche M. Planta. 1980; 149: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutated Nt-abp1 proteins were generated using polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis on the plasmid containing the cDNA sequence ofNt-abp1 (32Leblanc N. Roux C. Pradier J.M. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All amplifications were performed using a unique 5′ primer corresponding to the N-terminal end of Nt-abp1 and including a BamHI site 5′-ATACGGATCCATGGCTCGCCATGTTCTCGTAGTGGTAG in combination with distinct reverse primers for mutagenesis at the C terminus. A single mutation was introduced to convert Asp174 into Asn using the primer 5′-ATCTTTCCACGAAGTTGTCTGATAACATTCCTCATTACC. For ABP1-NQ, the double mutation Asp174 and Glu175 to Asn and Gln, respectively, was performed using the primer 5′-ATCTTTCCACGAAGTTGTCTGATAACATTCCTGATTACC. For ABP1-S, the Cys157 was converted into Ser using the primer 5′-ATCTTTCCACGAAGTTGTCTGATAAGATTC. The same primer was used to obtain the triple mutation of Asp174, Glu175, and Cys157 using the ABP1-NQ sequence as a template. Another triple mutation corresponding to the conversion of Asp174, Glu175, and Cys157 into Ala was achieved using the primer 5′-ATCTTTCCACGAAGTTGTCTGATAAGCTTCCGCAGCCCA. Amplified fragments were subjected to a second round of polymerase chain reaction amplification using the reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAAGCTCATCTTTCCACGAAGTTGT adding the last two codons, the stop codon and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. ABP-ΔK was generated by deletion of the last 12 nucleotides encoding the C-terminal motif KDEL (Lys184–Asp185–Glu186–Leu187) using the primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACCACGAAG-TTGTCTGATAACATTC. Each polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed usingTaq polymerase (Promega) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, then 25 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The amplification products were cloned into pBlueScript vector. Clones of each mutated Nt-abp1 were double strand-sequenced using the ABI prism Dye Terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI 373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Mutated sequences were cloned in the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). Recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli cells (M15) and purified as described previously (32Leblanc N. Roux C. Pradier J.M. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Isolation and initial characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to wild-type recombinant Nt-abp1 have been reported previously (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pairwise epitope mapping was conducted by SPR using both competitive binding and sandwich procedures as described (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Three mAbs were selected for the present work on the basis of their characteristics of interaction with ABP1: all recognize highly discontinuous epitopes, mAb12 and mAb50 are auxin antagonists on the early auxin electrical response of tobacco protoplasts and recognize non-overlapping epitopes, whereas mAb28 is hormonomimetic and overlaps with mAb12 but not with mAb50. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Biacore analytical system based on surface plasmon resonance was used to characterize extensively the interaction of mAbs raised to Nt-abp1 with wild-type and mutated proteins (33Johnsson B. Löfas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). mAb reactivity with each purified proteins was analyzed as follows. Rabbit anti-mouse (RAM) Fc affinity-purified immunoglobulins were covalently immobilized by amino linkage onto chip CM-dextran and then hybridoma supernatants of each mAb were injected for 4 min (flow 10 μl/min) to reach a level of ∼1000 resonance units. A 4-min injection of each protein followed, either in HBS buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-20) or in HBS with 5 μm NAA, and dissociation was observed for 4 min after the end of injection. Regeneration of the RAM was achieved through injection of two 3-min pulses of 10 mm HCl. For kinetics analysis of protein capture by mAbs, serial ½ dilutions of protein from 500 to 62.5 nm concentrations were injected. The association and dissociation constants (kon and koff, respectively) were calculated using BIA224 software. For each experiment, about 104protoplasts in suspension were incubated with different concentrations of mutated ABP1 for 5 min at room temperature. The transmembraneEm was then measured by the microelectrode technique as described previously (34Ephritikhine G. Barbier-Brygoo H. Muller J.F. Guern J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 801-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rona J.P. Ptiman G.M. Lüttge U. Ball E. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 57: 25-37Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Membrane potential variations (ΔEm) reported for each experimental condition correspond to the average of 15–20 individual measurements. Dose-response curves were established by plotting ΔEm values as a function of protein concentrations. For each protoplast preparation, the electrical response was investigated in response to the optimal NAA concentration of 3 × 10−6m, and in response to 10−9m Nt-abp1 was shown to induce the maximal hyperpolarization (30Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The comparison of ABP1 C-terminal domains isolated from different species has defined a consensus sequence composed of strictly conserved residues (Table I). This consensus corresponds to 8 of the last 15 residues at the C terminus of ABP1, including Trp173, Asp174, Glu175, the third cysteine (Cys177), and the C-terminal tetrapeptide KDEL (Lys184–Asp185–Glu186–Leu187). Given the intrinsic activity of the ABP1 C-terminal domain in the hyperpolarization of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts (30Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we used site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues to analyze their relative importance in the activation of the response. Single and multiple mutations were introduced on conserved residues as indicated in Table I. The Asp and Glu residues were converted into their corresponding amine, whereas the cysteine was converted into serine to remove the –SH group. A more drastic change was introduced by mutation of these 3 residues into Ala. To address in more detail the possible role of the KDEL sequence, a truncated protein was also constructed by deletion of the last 4 amino acids. After mutagenesis and systematic sequencing, the different proteins were produced in E. coliand purified as described previously (32Leblanc N. Roux C. Pradier J.M. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for further characterization. The immunoblot presented in Fig. 1 shows that mAb12, a monoclonal antibody to Nt-abp1 (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), recognized each protein. Deletion of the KDEL sequence corresponds to a decrease of 557 Da, which can be seen on the Western blot. In the case of ABP1-NQES, the protein has migrated slightly less than the wild-type protein. This reflects the charge modification introduced by mutation of the two acidic residues (Asp and Glu) into their corresponding amines (Asn and Gln) hence altering their interaction with SDS.Table ISite-directed mutagenesis at the C-terminal domain of Nt-abp1The consensus sequence results from the alignment of the tobacco (32Leblanc N.

Residue numbers are indicated on the Nt-abp1 sequence from Met1. We have previously characterized a set of monoclonal antibodies to Nt-abp1 and their interaction with the wild-type protein. Most of these mAbs were demonstrated to recognize conformational epitopes (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was used to follow the dynamic interaction of each mutated protein with three distinct mAbs to Nt-abp1. Fig.2 illustrates a selection of sensorgrams showing interaction of wild-type Nt-abp1, ABP1-ΔKDEL, and ABP1-NQES with mAbs 12, 28, and 50, respectively. Each sensorgram corresponds to the capture of the injected ABP1 (WT or mutated) at 0.25 mmon the immobilized mAb indicated. ABP1-NQES showed much lower association with each mAb than the WT and ABP1-ΔKDEL proteins. However, the association observed for ABP1-NQES, albeit low, was relatively stable. Analysis of the sensorgrams suggests that the deletion of the C-terminal KDEL tetrapeptide did not strongly affect the binding of the protein to the different mAbs but that the interaction was less stable, in particular with mAb50. To study more precisely these interactions, kinetic constants were calculated on the basis of a series of sensorgrams obtained with a whole range of concentrations of injected protein. Values ofkon, koff, and deducedKd are plotted in TableII. Analysis of association and dissociation kinetics confirmed the high affinity of the mAbs for the wild-type Nt-abp1 with a Kd value in the nanomolar range. Although drastic changes of Kd values were observed for the two mutated proteins, association and dissociation constants are more informative. For example, the increasedKd values calculated for the interaction of ABP1-NQES with mAb28 and mAb50 resulted mainly from a severe decrease in the association constant by a factor of 32 and 90, respectively. On the contrary, the increased Kd value for the interaction of ABP1-ΔKDEL with mAb50 resulted mainly from an increased dissociation by a factor of 10, whereas the association is decreased by only 4.8. Interactions of the mutated proteins with mAb12 were less affected by the modifications introduced within the sequences than for the other antibodies. Interestingly, the reduction of the association constant of ABP1-NQES with mAb12 is counteracted by an increase in the stability of the interaction.Table IICalculated kinetic constants characterizing the interaction of WT and mutated ABP1 with mAbs 12, 28, and 50kon values are expressed in ×104m−1 · s−1.koff values are expressed in ×10−4 s−1.Calculated Kd values expressed in nm.

To determine if the different mutations generated in ABP1 were able to modify the ability of the protein to activate the electrical response of tobacco protoplasts, we examined the effect of each mutated protein in this assay. The effects of single and multiple mutations are illustrated in Figs. 3 and4. Addition of ABP1-N to tobacco mesophyll protoplasts was able to induce a membrane hyperpolarization but with a reduced efficiency compared with the WT protein (Fig. 3). The mutated protein containing a Ser177 instead of Cys was unable to induce an electrical response (Fig. 3), nor were ABP1-NQES (Fig. 4) and ABP1-AAEA (not shown). An absence of signal was also observed using the ABP1-NQ protein carrying the double mutation changing the two acidic residues into amines (not shown). These mutations correspond to an important change in the charge of the C-terminal domain of the protein resulting from the removal of the two negative charges of the aspartic and glutamic acids. The membrane hyperpolarization of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts induced by ABP1-ΔKDEL is similar to the one induced by the WT protein. The maximal hyperpolarization of −5 mV was obtained for concentrations of 10−10m and over (Fig. 4). The deletion of the KDEL sequence has no effect on the capacity of the protein to activate the electrical response when acting at the plasma membrane.Figure 4Effects of multiple mutations of Nt-abp1 on the transmembrane potential of tobacco protoplasts. Mutated proteins ABP1-NQES (♦) or ABP1-ΔKDEL (○) were added to the protoplast medium. The dose-response curves were established as for Fig. 3. Data are given for one representative experiment among three or four independent experiments. The mean Em variation induced by the optimal auxin concentration (3 μm, 1-NAA) was of −3.8 mV. Maximal S.E. is indicated for each point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Nt-abp1-induced electrical membrane response was demonstrated previously (30Leblanc N. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Barbier-Brygoo H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to be related to the biological activity of auxin at the plasma membrane, both sharing the same pathway. We have already reported evidence (21Leblanc N. David K. Grosclaude J. Pradier J.M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Labiau S. Perrot-Rechenmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggesting that the activation of the auxin signal transduction cascade results from conformational change of Nt-abp1 in response to specific stimuli. To understand better the relationship between the conformation of the protein and its ability to induce a response, we have studied the interaction of the mutated forms of ABP1 with the series of mAbs in the presence of auxin. Sensorgrams and related kinetic parameters describing the interaction of wild-type ABP1, ABP1-NQES, and ABP1-ΔKDEL with mAbs 12, 28, and 50 in the presence of 5 μm NAA are presented in Fig.5 and TableIII, respectively. The curve corresponding to the interaction of the WT protein in the absence of auxin with each mAb has been plotted as a reference on each group of sensorgrams (gray curve). The interaction of Nt-abp1 with mAb12 was not modified by the addition of auxin. On the contrary, the capture of Nt-abp1 in the presence of auxin by mAb28 and mAb50 was strongly reduced as confirmed by the association constants that were decreased by a factor of 5 and 118, respectively. However, the dissociation phase was much less affected. A slight increase of 2-fold was measured for the koff value for the interaction of Nt-abp1 with mAb28, whereas for mAb50 the dissociation constants with and without auxin were identical. These two mAbs recognize highly conformation-dependent epitopes that appear to be less accessible when the protein has bound auxin.Table IIICalculated kinetic constants characterizing the interaction of WT and mutated ABP1 with mAbs 12, 28, and 50 in the presence of auxinkon values are expressed in ×104m−1 · s−1.koff values are expressed in ×10−4 s−1.Values are calculated Kd expressed in nm. Open table in a new tab kon values are expressed in ×104m−1 · s−1. koff values are expressed in ×10−4 s−1. Values are calculated Kd expressed in nm. The interaction of mAbs with mutated ABP1 in the presence of auxin was significantly altered compared with the wild-type protein. Deletion of the KDEL tetrapeptide affected the stability of the interaction with all mAbs. The most severe dissociation was observed with mAb50 with an increase in koff up to 72.5 × 10−4 s−1 compared with the wild-type protein (1.82 × 10−4 s−1) and the protein in the absence of auxin koff 18 × 10−4 s−1 (Table II). The mutation carried by ABP1-ΔKDEL destabilizes the interaction with the antibodies, and this effect is amplified in the presence of auxin. However, the auxin effect observed on the association of the wild-type protein with the different mAbs is maintained with ABP1-ΔKDEL. Indeed, the interaction of ABP1-ΔKDEL with mAb12 is not changed in the presence of auxin, whereas a marked reduction in its capture with the two other mAbs was observed. This suggests that the deletion of the KDEL sequence does not inhibit the binding of auxin to the protein. As shown in Fig. 2, the triple mutation introduced on ABP1-NQES strongly decreases the association of the protein with mAbs. Auxin has no marked effect on the interaction of this ABP1-NQES with the different mAbs (Fig. 5). However, calculation of kinetic constants revealed an attenuation of the strength of its intera"

The conserved mechanism that these proteins use to bind DNA suggests that there may be at least a partial DNA recognition code for this class of proteins. To test this idea, we have investigated the sequence-specific requirements for DNA binding and repression by the yeast α2 homeodomain protein in association with its cofactors, Mcm1 and Mata1. We have determined the contribution for each residue in the α2 homeodomain that contacts the DNA in the co-crystal structures of the protein. We have also engineered mutants in the α2 homeodomain to alter the DNA-binding specificity of the protein. Although we were unable to change the specificity of α2 by making substitutions at residues 47, 54, and 55, we were able to alter the DNA-binding specificity by making substitutions at residue 50 in the homeodomain. Since other homeodomain proteins show similar changes in specificity with substitutions at residue 50, this suggests that there is at least a partial DNA recognition code at this position.

The HD is usually 60 residues long and consists of three α-helices, which form a tight bundle (see Fig.1). The third helix in the bundle, frequently termed the “recognition helix,” lies in the major groove of the DNA and makes the majority of the base-specific and sugar phosphate backbone contacts. In most of the HD structures, there is also a flexible region, called the N-terminal arm, that extends from the N terminus of the first helix and wraps around the DNA to make base-specific and phosphate backbone contacts in the minor groove. The similarity in the mechanism of DNA binding among HD proteins is due in part to highly conserved residues, such as Trp48, Arg53, Lys55, and Lys57, that are conserved in virtually all HD proteins and together make a set of phosphate and backbone contacts with both strands of the DNA (see Fig. 1). These contacts are likely to be important to help position the recognition helix within the major groove. Asn51 is absolutely conserved in all HD proteins and makes virtually identical base-specific contacts with a conserved adenine in the binding site of every HD structure that has been determined. Given the conserved nature of the HD structure and DNA contacts among the more than 15 HDs that have been solved, along with the high sequence conservation in this family of proteins, it seems likely that most other HDs will fold and bind DNA in a similar manner. However, although HD proteins use a conserved mechanism to bind DNA, different HD proteins have very different binding specificities in vivo and in vitro. These differences in specificity are due to residues in helix 3 and the N-terminal arm that are not as well conserved among the different HD proteins. For example, residue 50 in the recognition helix makes a base-specific contact in the major groove, but, in contrast to Asn51, is relatively diversified among the different HD proteins (10Bürglin T.R. Arai R. Kato M. Doi Y. Biodiversity and Evolution. National Science Museum Foundation, Tokyo1995: 291-336Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that residue 50 is important for dictating the preference of the dinucleotide immediately 5′ to the ATTA core sequence (5′-NNATTA-3′) that is present in many HD binding sites (11Hanes S.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a partial DNA recognition code may exist for residue 50 in the HD. Although many HD proteins bind specifically to DNA in vitro, they often interact with cofactors to bind with higher affinity and specificity to their sites in vivo. Interactions with different cofactors may affect the specificity of binding by the HD protein such that its in vivo target specificity is different from its apparent binding specificity in vitro. It is important to examine the specificity of these proteins in vivo as well as in vitro. We have therefore chosen to examine the binding specificity of the Matα2 HD protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because the interactions with its cofactors, the Mata1 and Mcm1 proteins, and binding to its target sites have been well studied in vitro andin vivo. In the α cell type, α2 interacts with Mcm1, a member of the strongly conserved MADS box family of DNA-binding proteins (18Keleher C.A. Passmore S. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5228-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The α2 and Mcm1 proteins bind cooperatively as a heterotetramer complex to conserved sites upstream ofa-specific genes to repress transcription (19Keleher C.A. Goutte C. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 921-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mcm1 binds as a dimer to the center of a partially symmetric site and is flanked on either side by monomer binding sites for the α2 HD protein. Although α2 and Mcm1 can bind to these sites on their ownin vitro, both proteins are required for repression in vivo. In diploid a/α cells, α2 binds witha1, another HD protein, to repress transcription of haploid-specific genes. The α2 and a1 proteins form a heterodimer complex, with each HD binding to one half-site (21Goutte C. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structures of the α2 HD binding DNA on its own and in combination with a1 or Mcm1 have been determined (3Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Liu B. Johnson A.D. Pabo C.O.

These structural, genetic, and biochemical data provide excellent models for how the α2 protein recognizes its site alone and in combination with its cofactors (see Fig. 1). In this study, we investigated whether the sequence recognition code that has been determined for other HD proteins (11Hanes S.D. Brent R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is similar for α2 in complex with its cofactors in vitro and in vivo. Transcription reporter plasmids with wild-type or mutant α2-Mcm1 or a1-α2 binding sites were previously constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides containing these sites with TCGA overhangs into the XhoI site between the UAS and TATA elements of the CYC1-lacZ promoter of pTBA23 (27Zhong H. Vershon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8402-8409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell.

The wild-type α2-Mcm1 site used in these experiments is a symmetric site derived from a consensus of the wild-type sites found upstream of a-specific genes (27Zhong H. Vershon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8402-8409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutant derivatives of this site contain symmetric base pair substitutions in each of the α2 binding sites. The mutant sites were named by describing the original nucleotide, the positions mutated, and the substituted nucleotide. For instance, T3A is a symmetric mutant in which T at position 3 is mutated to A, and A at the symmetric position 28 is mutated to T. The a1-α2 site used in these studies is derived from a consensus of the wild-type binding sites found upstream of haploid-specific genes (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant derivatives of the a1-α2 site contain base pair substitutions only in the α2 half-site and are in the same relative position as the mutations in the α2-Mcm1 site. Derivatives of plasmid pAV115, a yeast CEN LEU2 plasmid containing a 4.3-kilobase MATα locus with wild-type α2 or the S50I, S50Q, or N47I mutant, have been described (30Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For comparison of the α2 HD with other HD structures, we have utilized the numbering system most commonly used for the 60-residue HD. Ser50 in the α2 HD therefore corresponds to Ser181 in the full-length α2 protein. Other mutants in the α2 HD were constructed by replacing fragments of pJM130 with the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the desired codon substitution (29Mead J. Zhong H. Acton T.B. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2135-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). pJM130 is a derivative of pAV115 that contains aMATα2 gene with silent and unique restriction sites engineered within the region coding for the HD. The constructs were screened by restriction digestion and verified by sequence analysis. Each of the mutants is in the context of the full-lengthMATα2 gene and is expressed from the endogenousMATα2 promoter on a low copy CEN plasmid. The α2 mutants were expressed from derivatives of the bacterial expression vectors pJM163 (29Mead J. Zhong H. Acton T.B. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2135-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and pYJ195 (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contain an N-terminal 6-His-tagged MATα2 gene coding for the full-length protein or a C-terminal fragment of residues 123–210, respectively. Derivatives of pJM163 containing mutations in α2 were constructed by replacing the 490-base pairBglII-NheI fragment of pJM164 with the 570-base pair BglII-NheI fragments from the mutants in pJM130 (29Mead J. Zhong H. Acton T.B. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2135-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutant α2 C-terminal fragment expression vectors were constructed by cloning the BamHI-NheI fragments containing the α2 mutations from pJM130 into pYJ195 (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were screened by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by sequence analysis. The haploid AJ83 (MAT a ura3 his3 leu2 trp1) and AJ126 (matΔ ura3 his3 leu2 trp1) yeast strains used in the transcription reporter experiments were described previously (30Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Derivatives of the CEN LEU2 α2 expression plasmids containing the wild-type or mutant MATα2 genes were co-transformed with 2µ URA3 CYC1-lacZ reporter promoter plasmids containing the appropriate α2-Mcm1 ora1-α2 binding sites. Cells were grown to mid-log phase, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (19Keleher C.A. Goutte C. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For each mutant binding site, β-galactosidase activities were measured from at least three independent transformants, and the values were averaged. The relative DNA-binding affinities of the different α2 proteins for the wild-type and mutant α2-Mcm1 and a1-α2 sites were determined by EMSAs. The α2 proteins used in the DNA binding assays for the α2-Mcm1 site are full-length proteins with 6 His residues fused to the N-terminal end. The α2 proteins used in the a1-α2 DNA binding assays are C-terminal fragments containing residues 123–210 with 6 His residues fused to the N-terminal end (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thea1 protein used in these experiments is the full-length protein with 6 His residues fused to the C-terminal end and was expressed and purified from strain BL21(DE3) with plasmid pYJ173 (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2 and a1 proteins were purified on nickel resin columns to >90% homogeneity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The concentration of each protein was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad) and then normalized and verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. DNA probes used in the EMSAs were synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using 32P-end-labeled primers (31Jin Y. Mead J. Li T. Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Science. 1995; 270: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Proteins were diluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For α2-Mcm1 assays, 3 µl of α2 was added to 27 µl of end-labeled fragment diluted in the assay buffer and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. For a1-α2 binding assays, 5 µl of α2-(123–210) and 5 µl of a1 were added to 40 µl of end-labeled fragment diluted in assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. In the no-protein controls, 10 µl of protein dilution buffer was added instead of the α2 or a1 protein. 20 µl of the reactions was loaded on a native 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA-6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 200 V. Gels were dried and exposed to phosphor screens, and images were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The relative α2 DNA-binding affinity for each site was calculated by comparing the percentage of fragment bound at different α2 protein concentrations. It was previously shown that residues in the α2 HD that make base-specific contacts with the DNA have important roles in DNA binding and transcriptional repression (30Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, many of these residues are not as nearly as well conserved among the different HD proteins as the residues that are involved in contacts with the sugar phosphate backbone of the DNA. We were interested in whether the strong conservation of these residues in different HD proteins is because they have an essential role in DNA binding. To test the role of these side chains, we constructed alanine substitutions of each residue in α2 that contacts DNA in the co-crystal structures (Fig. 1) (3Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Liu B. Johnson A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Li T. Jin Y. Vershon A.K. Wolberger C.

To monitor the ability of the mutants to repress transcription in complex with Mcm1, the α2 mutants were transformed into amatΔ strain bearing an integrated CYC1-lacZreporter containing an α2-Mcm1 binding site in the promoter. The ability of the α2 mutants to repress lacZ expression was measured by liquid β-galactosidase assays (TableI). The majority of the α2 alanine substitution mutants displayed significantly lower levels of repression in complex with Mcm1. Even substitutions of residues that indirectly contact DNA through water-mediated contacts, such as L26A and N47A, had a large effect on repression in complex with Mcm1, suggesting that they are making important contributions to DNA binding. Substitutions of residues in the N-terminal arm, such as Y3A, R4A, and G5A, appeared to have slightly less effect on repression than substitutions in the recognition helix. This suggests that the minor groove contacts made by these residues may not be as important for DNA binding as major groove contacts made by residues in the recognition helix.Table IEffects of alanine substitutions of α2 residues that make DNA contactsPositionα2-Mcm1 repression1-aValues shown are percent activity of repression by each mutant relative to the wild-type protein of a CYC1-lacZ reporter promoter containing a wild-type α2-Mcm1 or a1-α2 binding site.

This gave a repression ratio of 23-fold, which was set at 100% repression. Fold repression values were determined for each sample in the same manner, with β-galactosidase units within 10% error. The wild-type repression ratio was then divided by the ratios determined for the mutant proteins to give percent repression values.

Open table in a new tab The level of repression of the α2 mutants in complex witha1 was monitored in a MAT a strain with an integrated CYC1-lacZ reporter containing ana1-α2 binding site in the promoter (Table I). As we have previously observed, many of the substitutions of residues that contact the DNA have little or no effect on repression in complex witha1 (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The only substitutions that showed significant reductions in a1-α2-mediated repression were F8A and W48A. In addition to contacting the DNA, these side chains make numerous contacts with other residues in the hydrophobic core of the HD; and therefore, alanine substitutions of these residues could affect the folding or stability of the protein (3Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Liu B. Johnson A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Li T. Jin Y. Vershon A.K. Wolberger C.

However, Western blot analysis of these mutant strains showed that proteins were present at the same level as the wild-type protein, indicating that they must only affect folding (data not shown). The observation that other alanine substitutions in α2 do not affect repression in complex witha1 suggests that these mutants do not affect expression or the ability to repress transcription. Therefore, these substitutions most likely affect DNA binding in complex with Mcm1. We have tested a number of the mutants for their ability to bind DNA on their own or in complex with Mcm1 or a1 in vitroby EMSAs. As expected from the in vivo results, mutants that show large decreases in the ability to repress transcription also show large decreases in their ability to bind DNA on their own or in complex with Mcm1 (28Jin Y. Zhong H. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Mutants that had small decreases in the level of repression, such as S50A and R132A, showed only moderate reductions in DNA-binding affinity. The in vitroDNA binding data therefore agree well with the in vivorepression results and support the model that the mutants fail to repress transcription in complex with Mcm1 because they no longer bind DNA with wild-type affinity. These results show that most of the individual protein side chain contacts with the DNA observed in the α2 co-crystal structures are important for the DNA-binding activity of the protein. Among the alanine substitutions in α2, the S50A mutant showed one of the smallest decreases in repression with Mcm1 (Table I). However, in many other HD proteins, residue 50 is an important determinant of DNA-binding specificity (11Hanes S.D. Brent R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested if other amino acid substitutions of this residue would affect the DNA-binding affinity or specificity of the protein. Ser50 was substituted with amino acids that are often found at this position in other HD proteins (10Bürglin T.R. Arai R. Kato M. Doi Y. Biodiversity and Evolution. National Science Museum Foundation, Tokyo1995: 291-336Google Scholar), and the mutants were assayed for the ability to repress transcription of a promoter containing a wild-type α2-Mcm1 site (TableII, second column). Substitutions with relatively small side chains, such as S50A, S50G, S50C, and S50T, caused only moderate reductions in the level of repression in comparison with the wild-type protein. These results suggest that as long as the side chain is relatively small, there are no strong requirements for a specific amino acid at residue 50 in α2. In contrast, mutants with larger or charged side chains, such as S50I, S50H, S50Q, S50R, S50K, and S50E, showed a complete loss of repression activity, presumably because these side chains sterically interfere with DNA binding by the protein. This result shows that there are specific amino acid requirements for this residue in α2. Interestingly, although Asn at residue 50 has not been found in any other HD protein (10Bürglin T.R. Arai R. Kato M. Doi Y. Biodiversity and Evolution. National Science Museum Foundation, Tokyo1995: 291-336Google Scholar), this substitution in α2 appeared to function almost as well as the wild-type protein.Table IIEffects of Ser50 substitutions in α2 on repression with wild-type and mutant sitesα2 mutantPosition 2 mutantsPosition 3 mutantsWT (AT)A2C (CT)A2G (GT)A2T (TT)T3A (AA)T3G (AG)T3C (AC)Ser50(wild-type)1002363397840S50N67227127249S50A5210162388S50G245813345S50C2220622356S50T18975244S50I3225212S50H2122141S50Q2121111S50R311013111S50K21226151S50E1111111Values are the percent activity of repression by the wild-type (WT) protein relative to the wild-type α2-Mcm1 site.

https://openalex.org/W2043171627,"I have defined conditions under which RepFIC plasmid DNA can be maintained in a state of lowered helical density. In exponentially growing cultures, the DNA of lowered helical density is present in small amounts but never totally absent, suggesting that it is a normal variant of plasmid maintenance. It is fully methylated at frequent sites by dam-methyltransferase, some not previously recognized, further suggesting that the variant is a precursor of replication. The low-helical density plasmid is present in dam hosts, indicating that methylation is not essential for the change in helical density. The lowered helical density is stabilized in lon hosts, suggesting that Lon-protease may remove both the protein(s) that lower the helical density and the dam-methyltransferase after each round of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2040098234,"In man, activated N-, K- and H-ras oncogenes have been found in around 30% of the solid tumours tested. An exon known as IDX, which has been described previously and is located between exon 3 and exon 4A of the c-H-ras pre-mRNA, allows an alternative splicing process that results in the synthesis of the mRNA of a putative protein named p19. It has been suggested that this alternative pathway is less tumorigenic than that which results in the activation of p21. We have used the mammalian trans-splicing mechanism as a tool with which to modulate this particular pre-mRNA processing to produce mRNA similar to that of mature p19 RNA. The E4A exon of the activated H-ras gene was found to be a good target for external trans-splicing. We reprogrammed the rat carnitine octanoyltransferase exon 2 to specifically invade the terminal region of H-ras. Assays performed with this reprogrammed trans-exon showed that the trans-splicing product was obtained in competition with cis-splicing of the D intron of the H-ras gene, and was associated with concomitant down-modulation of D intron cis-splicing. We also found that the exon 4A of the human c-H-ras gene underwent successive trans-splicing rounds with an external exon."
