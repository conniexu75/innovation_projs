https://openalex.org/W2619970632,"Associating stimuli with positive or negative reinforcement is essential for survival, but a complete wiring diagram of a higher-order circuit supporting associative memory has not been previously available. Here we reconstruct one such circuit at synaptic resolution, the Drosophila larval mushroom body. We find that most Kenyon cells integrate random combinations of inputs but that a subset receives stereotyped inputs from single projection neurons. This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections found between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned behaviours. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future functional studies of this learning and memory centre."
https://openalex.org/W2742463962,"Thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism essential for survival and normal physiological functions in mammals. Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) (i.e. uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-based) and skeletal muscle (i.e. sarcolipin (SLN)-based) thermogenesis processes play important roles in temperature homeostasis, but their relative contributions differ from small to large mammals. In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between skeletal muscle- and BAT-based thermogenesis under mild versus severe cold adaptation by employing UCP1−/− and SLN−/− mice. Interestingly, adaptation of SLN−/− mice to mild cold conditions (16 °C) significantly increased UCP1 expression, suggesting increased reliance on BAT-based thermogenesis. This was also evident from structural alterations in BAT morphology, including mitochondrial architecture, increased expression of electron transport chain proteins, and depletion of fat droplets. Similarly, UCP1−/− mice adapted to mild cold up-regulated muscle-based thermogenesis, indicated by increases in muscle succinate dehydrogenase activity, SLN expression, mitochondrial content, and neovascularization, compared with WT mice. These results further confirm that SLN-based thermogenesis is a key player in muscle non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) and can compensate for loss of BAT activity. We also present evidence that the increased reliance on BAT-based NST depends on increased autonomic input, as indicated by abundant levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y. Our findings demonstrate that both BAT and muscle-based NST are equally recruited during mild and severe cold adaptation and that loss of heat production from one thermogenic pathway leads to increased recruitment of the other, indicating a functional interplay between these two thermogenic processes.

https://openalex.org/W2743233975,"Social skills training, performed by human trainers, is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches social communication skills through interaction with a computer avatar. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training only considered acoustic and linguistic information, human social skills trainers take into account visual and other non-verbal features. In this paper, we create and evaluate a social skills training system that closes this gap by considering the audiovisual features of the smiling ratio and the head pose (yaw and pitch). In addition, the previous system was only tested with graduate students; in this paper, we applied our system to children or young adults with autism spectrum disorders. For our experimental evaluation, we recruited 18 members from the general population and 10 people with autism spectrum disorders and gave them our proposed multimodal system to use. An experienced human social skills trainer rated the social skills of the users. We evaluated the system’s effectiveness by comparing pre- and post-training scores and identified significant improvement in their social skills using our proposed multimodal system. Computer-based social skills training is useful for people who experience social difficulties. Such a system can be used by teachers, therapists, and social skills trainers for rehabilitation and the supplemental use of human-based training anywhere and anytime."
https://openalex.org/W2743165995,"Neonatal (NMR), infant (IMR) and under-five (U5M) mortality rates remain high in Nigeria. Evidence-based knowledge of trends and drivers of child mortality will aid proper interventions needed to combat the menace. Therefore, this study assessed the trends and drivers of NMR, IMR, and U5M over a decade in Nigeria. A nationally representative data from three consecutive Nigeria Demographic and Household Surveys (NDHS) was used. A total of 66,158 live births within the five years preceding the 2003 (6029), 2008 (28647) and 2013 (31482) NDHS were included in the analyses. NMR was computed using proportions while IMR and U5 were computed using life table techniques embedded in Stata version 12. Probit regression model and its associated marginal effects were used to identify the predisposing factors to NMR, IMR, and U5M. The NMR, IMR, and U5M per 1000 live births in 2003, 2008 and 2013 were 52, 41, 39; 100, 75, 69; and 201, 157, 128 respectively. The NMR, IMR, and U5M were consistently lower among children whose mothers were younger, living in rural areas and from richer households. Generally, the probability of neonate death in 2003, 2008 and 2013 were 0.049, 0.039 and 0.038 respectively, the probability of infant death was 0.093, 0.071 and 0.064 while the probability of under-five death was 0.140, 0.112 and 0.092 for the respective survey years. While adjusting for other variables, the likelihood of infant and under-five deaths was significantly reduced across the survey years. Maternal age, mothers' education, place of residence, child's sex, birth interval, weight at birth, skill of birth attendant, delivery by caesarean operation or not significantly influenced NMR, IMR, and U5M. The NMR, IMR, and U5M in Nigeria reduced over the studied period. Multi-sectoral interventions targeted towards the identified drivers should be instituted to improve child survival."
https://openalex.org/W2743273192,"The evolutionary history of extant hominoids (humans and apes) remains poorly understood. The African fossil record during the crucial time period, the Miocene epoch, largely comprises isolated jaws and teeth, and little is known about ape cranial evolution. Here we report on the, to our knowledge, most complete fossil ape cranium yet described, recovered from the 13 million-year-old Middle Miocene site of Napudet, Kenya. The infant specimen, KNM-NP 59050, is assigned to a new species of Nyanzapithecus on the basis of its unerupted permanent teeth, visualized by synchrotron imaging. Its ear canal has a fully ossified tubular ectotympanic, a derived feature linking the species with crown catarrhines. Although it resembles some hylobatids in aspects of its morphology and dental development, it possesses no definitive hylobatid synapomorphies. The combined evidence suggests that nyanzapithecines were stem hominoids close to the origin of extant apes, and that hylobatid-like facial features evolved multiple times during catarrhine evolution. Description of the most complete fossil skull of an infant ape recovered from the Miocene epoch of Kenya, assigned to a new species in the genusNyanzapithecus. The Earth in the Miocene epoch (23–5.3 million years ago) was a planet of the apes, with more than 40 species in at least 30 genera. Very few, however, are known from complete cranial evidence. Only a handful of species are known from any part of the skull beyond the face and palate, limiting the information about the state of the skull in the immediate relatives of hominins and modern apes. The dearth is particularly acute in Africa, where no cranial remains are known from between 14 and 10 million years ago. Isaiah Nengo and colleagues describe the skull of an infant ape recovered from Kenya. The 13-million-year-old specimen is assigned to a new species in the genus Nyanzapithecus. The evidence shows that, although the creature shares some similarities with gibbons, these resemblances are very likely convergent and the new species is a close relative of the common ancestor of extant apes."

https://openalex.org/W2743037611,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-mediated reprogramming is a rapid, efficient, and sophisticated process that reprograms differentiated somatic cells to a pluripotent state. However, many factors in this elaborate reprogramming process remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the microRNA (miR) miR-125b is an important component of SCNT-mediated reprogramming. Luciferase reporter assay, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting demonstrated that miR-125b directly binds the 3′-untranslated region of SUV39H1, encoding the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUV39H1, to down-regulate histone H3 lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in SCNT embryos. Furthermore, the miR-125b/SUV39H1 interaction induced loss of SUV39H1-mediated H3K9me3, caused heterochromatin relaxation, and promoted the development of SCNT embryos. Transcriptome analyses of SCNT blastomeres indicated that HNF1 homeobox B (HNF1B), a gene encoding a transcription factor downstream of and controlled by the miR-125b/SUV39H1 axis, is important for conferring developmental competence on preimplantation embryos. We conclude that miR-125b promotes SCNT-mediated nuclear reprogramming by targeting SUV39H1 to decrease the deposition of repressive H3K9me3 modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2745041392,"Stunting remains a major public health concern worldwide. Although its global prevalence is slowly decreasing, the actual number of affected children is still rising in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the Central African Republic (CAR), about one third of all children below the age of five are stunted. Stunting is correlated with many long-term consequences, including poor cognitive development and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, making stunting a major contributor to poverty. In CAR, little is known about the factors that contribute to stunting. This study aimed at analysing, in a cross-sectional study, the main factors associated with stunting in a group of 414 children recruited between December 2011 and November 2013, aged five years or less and living in Bangui. For all children, demographic, socio-economic and anthropometric data were recorded and asymptomatic enteropathogen carriage was assessed in stool samples using classical microbiological assays. The study group had a mean age of 14.2±10 months. Fifty-eight percent (292/414) were boys, and 36 percent (148/414) exhibited stunted growth. Of the stunted children, 51% (75/148) showed a moderate delay in linear growth for their age group [height-for-age z-score (HAZ) between -2 and -3 SD] while 49% (73/148) presented a severe delay (HAZ < -3). Factors significantly associated with stunting included gender (aOR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.07; 2.62 for boys compared to girls) and age (aOR of 3.98 (95% CI: 2.45; 6.46) for toddlers and aOR 4.42 (95% CI: 2.36; 8.28) for children compared to infants). Most importantly, we identified being overweight [weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) > 2 SD; aOR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.50; 6.90 of overweight compared to normal weight] as also being significantly associated with stunting. This is the first study showing that even in the poorest countries of the world there is an association of stunting with being overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2743736876,"Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are biomimetic nanocarriers used for the encapsulation of a broad variety of active ingredients. Similar to surface active compounds, LNCs contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in their structure. Moreover, the components of LNCs, macrogol 15 hydroxystearate (MHS) and lecithin, are known for their surface active properties. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to investigate the capability of the LNCs to decrease surface tension using two techniques: drop tensiometry and the Wilhelmy plate method. LNCs with diameters ranging from 30 to 100 nm were successfully obtained using a phase inversion technique. The LNCs’ properties, such as size and zeta potential, depend on the composition. LNCs exhibit a lower limiting surface tension compared to MHS (34.8–35.0 mN/m and 37.7–38.8 mN/m, respectively), as confirmed by both drop tensiometry and the Wilhelmy plate method. LNCs have exhibited a saturated interfacial concentration (SIC) that was 10-fold higher than the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of MHS or the SIC of binary and ternary mixtures of LNC ingredients. The SIC of the LNC formulations depended on the mass mixing ratio of the MHS/triglycerides but not on the presence of lecithin. The CMC/SIC values measured by the Wilhelmy plate method were higher than those obtained using drop tensiometry because of the longer duration of the tensiometry measurement. In conclusion, the surfactant-like properties of the LNCs offer new possibilities for medical and pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2742976756,"Biofortification is a plant breeding method that introduces increased concentrations of minerals in staple food crops (e.g., legumes, cereal grains), and has shown success in alleviating insufficient Fe intake in various human populations. Unlike other strategies utilized to alleviate Fe deficiency, studies of the gut microbiota in the context of Fe biofortification have not yet been reported, although the consumption of Fe biofortified staple food crops has increased significantly over time. Hence, in this study, we performed a 6-week feeding trial in Gallus gallus (n = 14), aimed to investigate the alterations in the gut microbiome following administration of an Fe biofortified bean-based diet (biofortified, BFe) versus a bean based diet with poorly-bioavailable Fe (standard, SFe). Cream seeded carioca bean based diets were designed in an identical fashion to those used in a recent human clinical trial of Fe biofortified beans in Rwanda. We hypothesized that the different dietary Fe contents in the beans based diets will alter the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome. The primary outcomes were changes in the gut microbiome composition and function analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed no significant changes in phylogenetic diversity between groups. There were significant differences in the composition of the microbiota between groups, with the BFe group harboring fewer taxa participating in bacterial Fe uptake, increased abundance of bacteria involved in phenolic catabolism, and increased abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Additionally, depletion of key bacterial pathways responsible for bacterial viability and Fe uptake suggest that improvements in Fe bioavailability, in addition to increases in Fe-polyphenol and Fe-phytate complexes due to biofortification, led to decreased concentrations of cecal Fe available for bacterial utilization. Our findings demonstrate that Fe biofortification may improve Fe status without negatively altering the structure and function of the gut microbiota, as is observed with other nutritional methods of Fe supplementation. These results may be used to further improve the efficacy and safety of future biofortification efforts in eradicating global Fe deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2745055894,"The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) alters expression level of pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive mRNAs in breast cancer, and in the long run, causes multiple biological abnormalities. Identification of such interactions of miRNA-mRNA requires integrative analysis of miRNA-mRNA expression profile data. However, current approaches have limitations to consider the regulatory relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs and to implicate the relationship with phenotypic abnormality and cancer pathogenesis.We modeled causal relationships between genomic expression and clinical data using a Bayesian Network (BN), with the goal of discovering miRNA-mRNA interactions that are associated with cancer pathogenesis. The Multiple Beam Search (MBS) algorithm learned interactions from data and discovered that hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-10b, hsa-miR-448, and hsa-miR-96 interact with oncogenes, such as, CCND2, ESR1, MET, NOTCH1, TGFBR2 and TGFB1 that promote tumor metastasis, invasion, and cell proliferation. We also calculated Bayesian network posterior probability (BNPP) for the models discovered by the MBS algorithm to validate true models with high likelihood.The MBS algorithm successfully learned miRNA and mRNA expression profile data using a BN, and identified miRNA-mRNA interactions that probabilistically affect breast cancer pathogenesis. The MBS algorithm is a potentially useful tool for identifying interacting gene pairs implicated by the deregulation of expression."
https://openalex.org/W2743811642,"Hedgehog signaling plays crucial roles in the development of calvarial bone, relying on the activation of Gli transcription factors. However, the molecular mechanism of the role of regulated Gli protein level in osteogenic specification of mesenchyme still remains elusive. Here, we show by conditionally inactivating Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a critical repressor of Hedgehog signaling, in Wnt1-Cre–mediated cranial neural crest (CNC) or Dermo1-Cre–mediated mesodermal lineages that Sufu restraint of Hedgehog activity level is critical for differentiation of preosteogenic mesenchyme. Ablation of Sufu results in failure of calvarial bone formation, including CNC-derived bones and mesoderm-derived bones, depending on the Cre line being used. Although mesenchymal cells populate to frontonasal destinations, where they are then condensed, Sufu deletion significantly inhibits the proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells, and these cells no longer differentiate into osteoblasts. We show that there is suppression of Runx2 and Osterix, the osteogenic regulators, in calvarial mesenchyme in the Sufu mutant. We show that down-regulation of several genes upstream to Runx2 and Osterix is manifested within the calvarial primordia, including Bmp2 and its downstream genes Msx1/2 and Dlx5. By contrast, we find that Gli1, the Hedgehog activity readout gene, is excessively activated in mesenchyme. Deletion of Sufu in CNC leads to a discernible decrease in the repressive Gli3 form and an increase in the full-length Gli2. Finally, we demonstrate that simultaneous deletion of Gli2 and Sufu in CNC completely restores calvarial bone formation, suggesting that a sustained level of Hedgehog activity is critical in specification of the osteogenic mesenchymal cells."

This makes the identification of invasive regulator(s)/effector(s) as the potential therapeutic targets for managing BC a high priority. p63 is a member of the p53 family of tumor suppressor genes/proteins, plays a role in the differentiation of epithelial tissues, and is believed to function as a tumor suppressor. However, it remains unclear whether and how p63 functions in BC cell invasion after tumorigenesis. Here, we show that p63α protein levels were much higher in mouse high-invasive BC tissues than in normal tissues. Our results also revealed that p63α is crucial for heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression and subsequently increases the ability of BC invasion. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that p63α can transcriptionally up-regulate Hsp70 expression, thereby promoting BC cell invasion via the Hsp70/Wasf3/Wave3/MMP-9 axis. We further show that E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) mediates p63α overexpression-induced Hsp70 transcription. We also found that p63α overexpression activates E2F1 transcription, which appears to be stimulated by p63α together with E2F1. Collectively, our results demonstrate that p63α is a positive regulator of BC cell invasion after tumorigenesis, providing significant insights into the biological function of p63α in BC and supporting the notion that p63α might be a potential target for invasive BC therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2744451299,"Complexity of the spatial configuration of an aortic implant with bifurcation in the distal part is related to changes in blood hemodynamic in the area of bifurcation which may disturb blood flow and lead to thrombus formation. This study was designed to characterize parameters which define spatial configuration of an aortic implant for which the risk of thrombus formation is the smallest. We used AngioCT data from 74 patients, aged 55 ±10 years, after endovascular procedure to prepare 3D geometries of stent-grafts. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to reconstruct blood hemodynamic and simulate thrombus formation. Next, geometric parameters of stent-grafts included the ratio of volume of upper part to the bifurcations, the relation of inlet and outlet diameters of a stent-graft and deformations in the iliac part of the stent-graft were analyzed. We also analyzed tortuosities (spiral twisting of the flow around the flow direction) and bends (the largest angulation in distal part of a stent-graft). The CFD results were confronted with AngioCT data to verify if computer generated thrombus appeared in particular patient. Additionally, geometric parameters of analyzed stent-grafts were used to propose a mathematical tool for prediction of thrombus appearance. The results showed that tortuosities and bends of a stent-graft had the highest impact on thrombus formation. Formation of thrombi was observed in 22% to 31% of cases (at blood hematocrit Hct = 40%) even for small values of tortuosities and bends indicating that these parameters are dominant in determining blood clotting. Our calculated results overlapped with clinical data in 80% to 91%. Therefore, we conclude that tortuosities and bends have high impact on thrombus formation and should be under special attention during stent-graft recommendation and patients’ follow-ups."
https://openalex.org/W2744864908,"Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a rare multisystem disorder with early mortality and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) progressing to end-stage kidney disease. We hypothesized that next-generation gene panel sequencing may unsurface oligosymptomatic cases of SIOD with potentially milder disease courses. We analyzed the renal and extrarenal phenotypic spectrum and genotype-phenotype associations in 34 patients from 28 families, the largest SMARCAL1-associated nephropathy cohort to date. In 11 patients the diagnosis was made unsuspectedly through SRNS gene panel testing. Renal disease first manifested at median age 4.5 yrs, with focal segmental glmerulosclerosis or minimal change nephropathy on biopsy and rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) at median age 8.7 yrs. Whereas patients diagnosed by phenotype more frequently developed severe extrarenal complications (cerebral ischemic events, septicemia) and were more likely to die before age 10 years than patients identified by SRNS-gene panel screening (88 vs. 40%), the subgroups did not differ with respect to age at proteinuria onset and progression to ESKD. Also, 10 of 11 children diagnosed unsuspectedly by Next Generation Sequencing were small at diagnosis and all showed progressive growth failure. Severe phenotypes were usually associated with biallelic truncating mutations and milder phenotypes with biallelic missense mutations. However, no genotype-phenotype correlation was observed for the renal disease course. In conclusion, while short stature is a reliable clue to SIOD in children with SRNS, other systemic features are highly variable. Our findings support routine SMARCAL1 testing also in non-syndromic SRNS."
https://openalex.org/W2743034770,"The Gini index is a measure of the inequality of a distribution that can be derived from Lorenz curves. While commonly used in, e.g., economic research, it suffers from ambiguity via lack of Lorenz dominance preservation. Here, investigation of large sets of empirical distributions of incomes of the World’s countries over several years indicated firstly, that the Gini indices are centered on a value of 33.33% corresponding to the Gini index of the uniform distribution and secondly, that the Lorenz curves of these distributions are consistent with Lorenz curves of log-normal distributions. This can be employed to provide a Lorenz dominance preserving equivalent of the Gini index. Therefore, a modified measure based on log-normal approximation and standardization of Lorenz curves is proposed. The so-called UGini index provides a meaningful and intuitive standardization on the uniform distribution as this characterizes societies that provide equal chances. The novel UGini index preserves Lorenz dominance. Analysis of the probability density distributions of the UGini index of the World’s counties income data indicated multimodality in two independent data sets. Applying Bayesian statistics provided a data-based classification of the World’s countries’ income distributions. The UGini index can be re-transferred into the classical index to preserve comparability with previous research."

The HITSystem is an eHealth intervention that alerts staff when services are overdue or results are delayed. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 3669 HIV-exposed infants enrolled in 15 Kenya hospital EID programs and three laboratories using the HITSystem from 2011–2014. We assessed mean and median TAT from when a sample was: 1) obtained to when it was shipped to the laboratory, 2) shipped to when it was received at the laboratory, 3) received to when a result was posted, and 4) the total time from obtaining the sample (step 1) to posting the result (step 3). TAT were compared by laboratory, clinic, year, and month of sample collection. 3625 infant samples had results posted by end of 2014. Mean TAT from sample collection to shipping was 5.2 days, from shipping to laboratory receipt was 2.0 days, and from laboratory receipt to result posting was 17.4 days. Altogether, it took an average of 24.7 days from sample collection until result posting. There was significant variation between laboratories, particularly in laboratory processing times (step 3). TAT showed a decreasing trend from 2011–2014, although TAT in December remained higher. Compared with other Kenyan studies, TAT in these HITSystem enrolled settings were shorter. Significant variation between laboratories, however, indicates the need to strengthen protocols and infrastructure to ensure that all laboratories can provide rapid, high-quality services."
https://openalex.org/W2743346162,"Detection techniques of malicious content such as spam and phishing on Online Social Networks (OSN) are common with little attention paid to other types of low-quality content which actually impacts users’ content browsing experience most. The aim of our work is to detect low-quality content from the users’ perspective in real time. To define low-quality content comprehensibly, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is first used to coarsely classify low-quality tweets into four categories. Based on this preliminary study, a survey is carefully designed to gather users’ opinions on different categories of low-quality content. Both direct and indirect features including newly proposed features are identified to characterize all types of low-quality content. We then further combine word level analysis with the identified features and build a keyword blacklist dictionary to improve the detection performance. We manually label an extensive Twitter dataset of 100,000 tweets and perform low-quality content detection in real time based on the characterized significant features and word level analysis. The results of our research show that our method has a high accuracy of 0.9711 and a good F1 of 0.8379 based on a random forest classifier with real time performance in the detection of low-quality content in tweets. Our work therefore achieves a positive impact in improving user experience in browsing social media content."

A failure to account for this additional energy expenditure of turning has significant implications in the design and interpretation of health interventions. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of walking speed and angle, and their interaction, on energy expenditure in 20 healthy adults (7 female; 28±7 yrs). On two separate days, participants completed a turning protocol at one of 16 speed- (2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 km∙h-1) and angle (0, 45, 90, 180°) combinations, involving three minute bouts of walking, interspersed by three minutes seated rest. Each condition involved 5 m of straight walking before turning through the pre-determined angle with the speed dictated by a digital, auditory metronome. Tri-axial accelerometry and magnetometry were measured at 60 Hz, in addition to gas exchange on a breath-by-breath basis. Mixed models revealed a significant main effect for speed (F = 121.609, P < 0.001) and angle (F = 19.186, P < 0.001) on oxygen uptake () and a significant interaction between these parameters (F = 4.433, P < 0.001). Specifically, as speed increased, increased but significant increases in relative to straight line walking were only observed for 90° and 180° turns at the two highest speeds (4.5 and 5.5 km∙hr-1). These findings therefore highlight the importance of accounting for the quantity and magnitude of turns completed when estimating energy expenditure and have significant implications within both sport and health contexts."

However, brucellosis in sheep, goats, pigs, water buffaloes, horses and cetaceans, has not been reported in the country. We have performed a brucellosis survey in these host mammal species, from 1999–2016. In addition, we have documented the number of human brucellosis reported cases, from 2003–2016. The brucellosis seroprevalence in goat and sheep herds was 0.98% and 0.7% respectively, with no Brucella isolation. Antibodies against Brucella were not detected in feral or domestic pigs. Likewise, brucellosis seroprevalence in horse and water buffalo farms was estimated in 6.5% and 21.7%, respectively, with no Brucella isolation. Six cetacean species showed positive reactions against Brucella antigens, and B. ceti was isolated in 70% (n = 29) of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba).

Loss of [14C]DADMe-ImmH from erythrocytes in the presence of excess unlabeled DADMe-ImmH increased to a t½ of 1.6 h by preventing rebinding. Thus, in human erythrocytes, rebinding of DADMe-ImmH is 50-fold more likely than diffusional loss of the inhibitor from the erythrocyte. Humans treated with a single oral dose of DADMe-ImmH in phase 1 clinical trials exhibit regain of PNP activity with a t½ of 59 days, corresponding to the erythropoiesis rate in humans. Thus, the PNP catalytic site recapture of DADMe-ImmH is highly favored in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2745109209,"Impaired pancreatic β-cell function is the primary defect in type 2 diabetes. Glucose is an important regulator of β-cell growth and function; however, the mechanisms that are involved in the chronic adaptation of β cells to hyperglycemia remain largely unknown. In the present study, global gene expression patterns revealed that tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) was the most profound of genes that are up-regulated in rat islets exposed to high glucose. Calcium and cAMP signals synergistically mediated glucose-stimulated Tph1 transcription in β cells by activating cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and promoting its binding with a Tph1 promoter. Similar to in vitro results, in vivo infusion of high glucose also strongly induced Tph1 expression and serotonin production in rat islets, along with enhanced islet function. Inhibition or knockdown of Tph1 markedly decreased glucose-potentiated insulin secretion. In contrast, overexpression of Tph1 augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in rat islets by up-regulating the expression of genes that are related to islet function. In addition, the long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, stimulated Tph1 expression in a glucose-dependent manner. Knockdown of Tph1 inhibited exendin-4-potentiated insulin secretion in rat islets. These findings suggest that Tph1 mediates the compensation of islet function induced by glucose, and that promoting Tph1 expression in pancreatic β cells will provide a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.-Zhang, Y., Deng, R., Yang, X., Xu, W., Liu, Y., Li, F., Zhang, J., Tang, H., Ji, X., Bi, Y., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Ning, G.

https://openalex.org/W2742531675,"Background There is experimental evidence that lethal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is largely due to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, which can be prevented by cyclosporine A (CsA). The aim of our study is to show that a higher dose of CsA (10 mg/kg) injected just before ischemia or a lower dose of CsA (3 mg/kg) injected further in advance of ischemia (1 h) protects the kidneys and improves mitochondrial function. Methods All mice underwent a right unilateral nephrectomy followed by 30 min clamping of the left renal artery. Mice in the control group did not receive any pharmacological treatment. Mice in the three groups treated by CsA were injected at different times and with different doses, namely 3 mg/kg 1 h or 10 min before ischemia or 10 mg/kg 10 min before ischemia. After 24 h of reperfusion, the plasma creatinine level were measured, the histological score was assessed and mitochondria were isolated to calculate the calcium retention capacity (CRC) and level of oxidative phosphorylation. Results Mortality and renal function was significantly higher in the CsA 10 mg/kg-10 min and CsA 3mg/kg-1 h groups than in the CsA 3mg/kg-10 min group. Likewise, the CRC was significantly higher in the former two groups than in the latter, suggesting that the improved renal function was due to a longer delay in the opening of the mPTP. Oxidative phosphorylation levels were also higher 24 h after reperfusion in the protected groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that the protection afforded by CsA is likely limited by its availability. The dose and timing of the injections are therefore crucial to ensure that the treatment is effective, but these findings may prove challenging to apply in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2744215906,"The cornea must maintain homeostasis, enabling rapid response to injury and microbial insult, to protect the eye from insult and infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical to this innate immune response through the recognition and response to pathogens. Myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD88) is a key signaling molecule necessary for Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-mediated immune defense and has been shown to be necessary for corneal defense during infection. Here, we examined the intrinsic role of TLR signaling in ocular surface tissues by determining baseline levels of inflammatory mediators, the response to mechanical stimuli, and corneal infection in MyD88-deficient mice (MyD88-/-). In addition, cytokine, chemokine, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was determined in ocular surface cells exposed to a panel of TLR agonists. Compared to wild-type (WT) animals, MyD88-/- mice expressed lower MMP-9 levels in the cornea and conjunctiva. Corneal IL-1α, TNFα, and conjunctival IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-9 levels were also significantly reduced. Additionally, CXCL1 and RANTES expression was lower in both MyD88-/- tissues compared to WT and IL-1R-/- mice. Interestingly, MyD88-/- mice had lower corneal sensitivities (1.01±0.31 gm/mm2) than both WT (0.59±0.16 gm/mm2) and IL-1R-/- (0.52±0.08 gm/mm2). Following Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge, MyD88-/- mice had better clinical scores (0.5±0.0) compared to IL-1R-/- (1.5±0.6) and WT (2.3±0.3) animals, but had significantly more corneal bacterial isolates. However, no signs of infection were detected in inoculated uninjured corneas from either MyD88 or IL-1R-deficient mice. This work furthers our understanding of the importance of TLR signaling in corneal defense and immune homeostasis, showing that a lack of MyD88 may compromise the baseline innate response to insult."

We assessed the transgenerational effect of maternal Western diet (WD) consumption on offspring physical activity. Voluntary wheel running was increased in juvenile (4-7 wk of age), but decreased in adult (16-19 wk of age), F1 female WD offspring In contrast, no wheel-running differences in F1 male offspring were observed. Increased wheel running in juvenile female WD offspring was associated with up-regulated dopamine receptor (DRD)-1 and -2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and with down-regulated Lepr in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Conversely, decreased wheel running by adult female WD offspring was associated with down-regulated DRD1 in the NAc and with up-regulated Lepr in the VTA. Body fat, leptin, and insulin were increased in male, but not in female, F1 WD offspring. Recombinant virus (rAAV) leptin antagonism in the VTA decreased wheel running in standard diet but not in WD F1 female offspring. Analysis of F2 offspring found no differences in wheel running or adiposity in male or female offspring, suggesting that changes in the F1 generation were related to in utero somatic reprogramming. Our findings indicate prenatal WD exposure leads to age-specific changes in voluntary physical activity in female offspring that are differentially influenced by VTA leptin antagonism.-Ruegsegger, G.

https://openalex.org/W2743714649,"Chaotic itinerancy is a phenomenon in which the state of a nonlinear dynamical system spontaneously explores and attracts certain states in a state space. From this perspective, the diverse behavior of animals and its spontaneous transitions lead to a complex coupled dynamical system, including a physical body and a brain. Herein, a series of simulations using different types of non-linear oscillator networks (i.e., regular, small-world, scale-free, random) with a musculoskeletal model (i.e., a snake-like robot) as a physical body are conducted to understand how the chaotic itinerancy of bodily behavior emerges from the coupled dynamics between the body and the brain. A behavior analysis (behavior clustering) and network analysis for the classified behavior are then applied. The former consists of feature vector extraction from the motions and classification of the movement patterns that emerged from the coupled dynamics. The network structures behind the classified movement patterns are revealed by estimating the ""information networks"" different from the given non-linear oscillator networks based on the transfer entropy which finds the information flow among neurons. The experimental results show that: (1) the number of movement patterns and their duration depend on the sensor ratio to control the balance of strength between the body and the brain dynamics and on the type of the given non-linear oscillator networks; and (2) two kinds of information networks are found behind two kinds movement patterns with different durations by utilizing the complex network measures, clustering coefficient and the shortest path length with a negative and a positive relationship with the duration periods of movement patterns. The current results seem promising for a future extension of the method to a more complicated body and environment. Several requirements are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2745152667,"General locomotor activity (GLA) in poultry has attracted attention, as it negatively influences production costs (energy expenditure and feed consumption) and welfare parameters (bone strength, litter quality, feather pecking and cannibalism). Laying hen lines diverging in the average level of spontaneous locomotor activity in the home pen were developed by genetic selection using the founder New Hampshire line. Activity was recorded using RFID technology at around five weeks of age during four to five days in the home pen. After initial phenotyping, the least active birds were selected for the low activity line and the most active for the high activity line, with no gene transfer between lines. In each of six generations, approximately ten sires were mated to twenty dams producing 158 to 334 offspring per line per generation. The response to selection was rapid and of a considerable magnitude. In sixth generation, the level of GLA was approximately halved in the low and doubled in the high line compared to the control (7.2, 14.9 and 28.7 recordings/h). Estimated heritability of locomotor activity in the low and high line was 0.38 and 0.33, respectively. Males, in general, were more active than females. High line birds were significantly heavier than low line birds. In fourth, fifth, and sixth generation, low as well as high line birds were lighter than control line birds. This selection experiment demonstrates variation in heritability for GLA and, as a result, genetically diverged lines have been developed. These lines can be used as models for further studies of underlying physiological, neural and molecular genetic mechanisms of spontaneous locomotor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2745224196,"Background Osteoporotic vertebral fractures adversely impact quality of life and also increase the risk of infection and mortality. Alendronate treatment increases bone mass and reduces the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis by suppressing bone resorption. We investigated the relationship between alendronate treatment and infection-related death in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures from January 2001 to December 2007. The use of alendronate, glucocorticoid and medical factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, liver disease, heart disease, and pulmonary disease were analyzed. Cox regression was used to analyze the factors associated with life-threatening infections. Results A total of 210 patients (161 females and 49 males) were included with a mean age of 74.06±7.43 years. Among them, 87 had life-threatening infections and 123 did not. In Cox regression analysis, the patients who used alendronate had a significantly lower risk of life-threatening infections (p = 0.006, HR = 0.845, 95% CI 0.750–0.954), while glucocorticoid users had higher risk of death (p = 0.010, HR = 2.037, 95% CI 1.187–3.498). Conclusions Osteoporosis was associated with a high rate of life-threatening infections, and the use of alendronate had a lower rate of infection-related death. Therefore, we suggest that alendronate be used after vertebral fractures in these patients."

Thus, a comprehensive protocol has been set-up including the separation of blood cells, their in vitro treatment with nanoparticles and the extraction and characterization of metabolites by nuclear magnetic resonance. This method was applied to assess the effect of gold nanoparticles, either coated with chitosan or supported on ceria, on peripheral blood cells from healthy individuals. A clear antioxidant effect was observed for chitosan-coated gold nanoparticles by a significant increase in reduced glutathione, that was much less pronounced for gold-cerium nanoparticles. In addition, the analysis revealed significant alterations of several other pathways, which were stronger for gold-cerium nanoparticles. These results are in accordance with the toxicological data previously reported for these materials, confirming the value of the current methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2745090673,"Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and metastasis is the main attribute to cancer death. CXCR4 and its natural ligand CXCL12 have been known to play a critical role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, designing a new CXCR4 antagonist to prevent tumor metastasis will be of great significance. Herein, a novel chemically synthesized peptide (E5) that has an ability to target CXCR4/CXCL12 axis was loaded in micelle glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) block copolymer to form micelle-encapsulated E5 (M-E5). We demonstrated that M-E5 exhibited higher affinity for CXCR4-overexpressing MCF-7 and HepG2 tumor cells as compared to free E5, and efficiently inhibited the tumor cells migration. Mechanistic studies implied that PEG-PE micelle can encapsulate E5 and improve E5 targeting efficiency for CXCR4 by accumulating E5 on the tumor cell membrane. Furthermore, through encapsulation of chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) in PEG-PE micelle, we proved that PEG-PE micelle could serve as a co-carrier for both E5 and Dox (M-E5-Dox). M-E5 enhanced the efficiency of Dox by down-regulating the phosphorylation level of Akt, Erk and p38/MAPK proteins. In conclusion, PEG-PE micelle demonstrated a promising delivery system for E5, and M-E5 is expected to be a potential therapeutic agent that will help to improve the clinical benefits in current therapies used for solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2743219325,"Retinal microaneurysms, an early disease manifestation of diabetic retinopathy, are associated with retinal endothelial cell (REC) death and macular edema. We previously demonstrated that a quinic acid (QA) analog, KZ-41, promoted REC survival by blunting stress-induced p38 MAPK activation. Herein, we sought to expand our understanding of the pro-survival signal transduction pathways actuated by KZ-41. Using human RECs exposed to high glucose (25 mM, 72 hours), we demonstrated that KZ-41 blocks caspase-3 activation by triggering phosphorylation of the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85; Tyr458) and its downstream target Akt (Ser473). Akt signal transduction was accompanied by autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). IGF-1R knockdown using either the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024 or silencing RNA abolished KZ-41’s pro-survival effect. Under high glucose stress, caspase-3 activation correlated with elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and decreased insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) levels. KZ-41 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reversed the glucose-dependent reduction in IRS-1. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis for IGF-1R activation by KZ-41, we used molecular modeling and docking simulations to explore a possible protein:ligand interaction between the IGF-1R kinase domain and KZ-41. Computational investigations suggest two possible KZ-41 binding sites within the kinase domain: a region with high homology to the insulin receptor contains one potential allosteric binding site, and another potential site on the other side of the kinase domain, near the hinge domain. These data, together with previous proof-of-concept efficacy studies demonstrating KZ-41 mitigates pathologic retinal neovascularization in the murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model, suggests that QA derivatives may offer therapeutic benefit in ischemic retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2743664582,"In response to nutrient starvation, diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiate into a dormant form of haploid cell termed a spore. The dityrosine layer forms the outermost layer of the wall of S. cerevisiae spores and endows them with resistance to environmental stresses. ll-Bisformyl dityrosine is the main constituent of the dityrosine layer, but the mechanism of its assembly remains elusive. Here, we found that ll-bisformyl dityrosine, but not ll-dityrosine, stably associated in vitro with dit1Δ spores, which lack the dityrosine layer. No other soluble cytosolic materials were required for this incorporation. In several aspects, the dityrosine incorporated in trans resembled the dityrosine layer. For example, dityrosine incorporation obscured access of the dye calcofluor white to the underlying chitosan layer, and ll-bisformyl dityrosine molecules bound to dit1Δ spores were partly isomerized to the dl-form. Mutational analyses revealed several spore wall components required for this binding. One was the chitosan layer located immediately below the dityrosine layer in the spore wall. However, ll-bisformyl dityrosine did not stably bind to chitosan particles, indicating that chitosan is not sufficient for this association. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that spore-resident proteins are involved in the incorporation, including the Lds proteins, which are localized to lipid droplets attached to the developing spore wall. In conclusion, our results provide insight into the mechanism of dityrosine layer formation, and the in vitro assay described here may be used to investigate additional mechanisms in spore wall assembly."

BEASTling transforms comparatively short and human-readable configuration files into the XML files used by BEAST to specify analyses. By taking advantage of Creative Commons-licensed data from the Glottolog language catalog, BEASTling allows the user to conveniently filter datasets using names for recognised language families, to impose monophyly constraints so that inferred language trees are backward compatible with Glottolog classifications, or to assign geographic location data to languages for phylogeographic analyses. Support for the emerging cross-linguistic linked data format (CLDF) permits easy incorporation of data published in cross-linguistic linked databases into analyses. BEASTling is intended to make the power of Bayesian analysis more accessible to historical linguists without strong programming backgrounds, in the hopes of encouraging communication and collaboration between those developing computational models of language evolution (who are typically not linguists) and relevant domain experts."

Aiming to identify and assess the risk of CDE, this paper proposes a novel method of fuzzy fault tree analysis combined with the Visual Basic (VB) program. In this methodology, various potential causes of the CDE are identified and a CDE fault tree is constructed. To overcome drawbacks from the lack of exact probability data for the basic events, fuzzy set theory is employed and the probability data of each basic event is treated as intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In addition, a new approach for calculating the weighting of each expert is also introduced in this paper to reduce the error during the expert elicitation process. Specifically, an in-depth quantitative analysis of the fuzzy fault tree, such as the importance measure of the basic events and the cut sets, and the CDE occurrence probability is given to assess the explosion risk and acquire more details of the CDE. The VB program is applied to simplify the analysis process. A case study and analysis is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of this proposed method, and some suggestions are given to take preventive measures in advance and avoid CDE accidents."

Consequently, in order to continue growing in the tissues, S. enterica requires the coordinated regulation of fitness genes. Bacterial gene regulation has so far been investigated largely using exposure to artificial environmental conditions or to in vitro cultured cells, and little information is available on how S. enterica adapts in vivo to sustain cell division and survival.

However, titres that are associated with protection against acquisition of pharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis are not known. Methods Sera were obtained from the members of a household in seven countries of the African meningitis belt in which a pharyngeal carrier of N. meningitidis had been identified during a cross-sectional survey. Serum bactericidal antibody titres at baseline were compared between individuals in the household of the carrier who became a carrier of a meningococcus of the same genogroup during six months of subsequent follow-up and household members who did not become a carrier of a meningococcus of this genogroup during this period. Results Serum bacterial antibody titres were significantly higher in carriers of a serogroup W or Y meningococcus at the time of recruitment than in those who were not a carrier of N. meningitidis of the same genogroup. Serum bactericidal antibody titres to a strain of N. meningitis of the same genogroup as the index cases were no different in individuals who acquired carriage with a meningococcus of the same genogroup as the index case than in those who did not become a carrier during six months of follow-up. Conclusion Serum bacterial antibody titres to N. meningitidis of genogroup W or Y in the range of those acquired by natural exposure to meningococci of these genogroups, or with cross-reactive bacteria, are not associated with protection against acquisition of carriage with meningococci of either of these genogroups."

During the past ten years the biological function of Yki has been studied extensively in Drosophila and a few other insects, however, little is known about it in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a major research model of lepidopteran insect. Here, we describe the isolation, characterization and expression of the B. mori Yki ortholog, BmYki. The coding sequence of the BmYki was 1314 bp in length, encoding a protein of 437 amino acids containing two conserved WW domains. BmYki transcripts were ubiquitous but not abundant in all detected tissues and developmental stages. Comparatively, it was expressed at pretty high level in silk glands and at the stage of fifth-instar day-3 larvae. Overexpression of BmYki in cultured B. mori embryonic cells significantly promoted transcription of genes associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating that BmYki functions in the regulation of organ growth-related biological processes. Interestingly, transcription of silk protein-coding genes and transcription factors regulating the synthesis of silk proteins was downregulated remarkably, suggesting that BmYki was involved in the regulation of silk protein synthesis. This study provides new insights into the role of BmYki in Hpo pathway regulation in silkworm."

We examined the associations among health behavior, working conditions, and the effect of PST act via hierarchical logistic regression analyses using propensity score matching. After adjusted covariates, the risk probability was 0.288 times lower among FSWs who had remained in prostitute blocks after the PST act enforcement compared to FSWs who had worked before the PST. Similarly, the risk probability for a gonorrhea infection was 0.219 times lower among FSWs who had remained in prostitute blocks after the PST act compared to FSWs who had worked before the PST. Therefore, this study showed that, besides already known factors, the implementation and establishment of the PST Act was a strong factor that suppressed STD infections among FSWs."
https://openalex.org/W2742875515,"To support accurate memory-guided reaching, the brain must represent both the direction and amplitude of reaches in a movement plan. Several cortical areas have been shown to represent the direction of a planned reaching movement, but the neuronal representation of reach amplitude is still unclear, especially in sensory-motor integration areas. To investigate this, we recorded from neurons in the medial intraparietal area (MIP) of monkeys performing a variable amplitude memory reach task. In one monkey, we additionally recorded from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) for direct cross-area comparisons. In both areas, we found modest but significant proportions of neurons with movement-planning activity sensitive to reach amplitude. However, reach amplitude was under-represented relative to direction in the neuronal population, with approximately one third as many selective neurons. We observed an interaction between neuronal selectivity for amplitude and direction; neurons in both areas exhibited significant modulation of neuronal activity by reach amplitude in some but not all directions. Consistent with an encoding of reach goals as a position in visual space, the response patterns of MIP/PMd neurons were best predicted by 2D Gaussian position encoding model, in contrast to a number of alternative direction and amplitude tuning models. Taken together, these results suggest that amplitude and direction jointly modulate activity in MIP, as in PMd, to form representations of intended reach position."
