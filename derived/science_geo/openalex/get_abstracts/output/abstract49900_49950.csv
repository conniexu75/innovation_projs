https://openalex.org/W1982508615,"The general principles governing the nervous control of innate motor acts in vertebrates are discussed. Particular consideration is given to the control of locomotion in both mammals and lower vertebrates. One in vitro model of the lamprey central nervous system has been developed. It can be maintained in vitro for several days and the motor pattern underlying locomotion can be elicited in isolated sections of the spinal cord. These findings now allow a detailed analysis of the underlying neural mechanisms. The hypothesis that different parts of the network controlling locomotion can be used in a variety of other motor acts, including learned ones, is reviewed."

Therefore, unlike neurons of some nonprimate species, all neurons of the rhesus monkey brain are generated during prenatal and early postnatal life. A stable population of neurons in primates, including humans, may be important for the continuity of learning and memory over a lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2081608638,"In a study of the relation between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis, C3H mouse fibroblasts of the 10T 1/2 clone 8 line (10T 1/2 cells) were exposed to human neutrophils stimulated to synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates or to a cell-free enzymatic system generating superoxide (xanthine oxidase plus hypoxanthine). After exposure, the 10T 1/2 cells were either placed in tissue culture or immediately injected into athymic nude mice. Both malignant and benign tumors developed in the mice injected with treated cells, but not in those injected with control cells; in one instance cells grown from one of the benign tumors subsequently developed a malignant phenotype. Malignant transformation was also observed in treated cells in the experiments in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2029793114,"The classical transplantation antigens (the major histocompatibility complex class I antigens) play a key role in host defense against cells expressing foreign antigens. Several naturally occurring tumors and virally transformed cells show an overall suppression of these surface antigens. Since the class I molecules are required in the presentation of neoantigens on tumor cells to the cytotoxic T lymphocytes, their absence from the cell surface may lead to the escape of these tumors from immunosurveillance. To test this possibility, a functional class I gene was transfected into human adenovirus 12-transformed mouse cells that do not express detectable levels of class I antigens; the transformants were tested for expression of the transfected gene and for changes in oncogenicity. The expression of a single class I gene, introduced by DNA-mediated gene transfer into highly tumorigenic adenovirus 12-transformed cells, was sufficient to abrogate the oncogenicity of these cells. This finding has important implications for the regulation of the malignant phenotype in certain tumors and for the potential modulation of oncogenicity through derepression of the endogenous class I genes."
https://openalex.org/W2054488343,"Although antibody diversity arises mainly from apparently random combinatorial and somatic mutational mechanisms acting upon a limited number of germline antibody genes, the antibody repertoire develops in an ordered fashion during mammalian ontogeny. A series of early pre-B and B-lymphocyte cell lines were examined to determine whether an ordered rearrangement of gene families of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chains (VH) may be the basis for the programmed development of the antibody response. The results indicated that the VH repertoire of fetal B-lineage cells is largely restricted to the VH 7183 gene family and that subsequent recruitment of additional VH gene families occurs during neonatal development. These results have important implications in understanding the ontogeny of immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2024891016,"Magnetic fields and electrical potentials produced by neuronal activity have different properties that can be used for the identification of electrical sources in the human brain. Fields and potentials occurring 20 to 30 milliseconds after median nerve stimulation in human subjects were compared in order to investigate the sources of evoked potential components that have been attributed by different investigators to the thalamus or thalamocortical afferents, to separate radial sources in somatosensory cortex and motor cortex, or to a tangential source in somatosensory cortex. The magnetic and potential wave forms were highly similar in morphology, and their spatial distributions were centered over sensorimotor cortex, were dipolar in shape, and differed in orientation by approximately 90 degrees; distances between the minimum and maximum of the magnetic distributions were about 60 percent of those of the potential distributions. These results cannot be accounted for by thalamic sources or radial cortical sources alone, but are consistent with a tangential source in somatosensory cortex, with an additional smaller contribution from radial sources."
https://openalex.org/W2090242035,"The cells and tissues of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), an inherited disease characterized by a high degree of proneness to cancer, are abnormally sensitive to ionizing radiation. Noncycling cultures of normal human and A-T fibroblasts were exposed to x-rays so that the breakage and rejoining of prematurely condensed chromosomes in the G1 phase could be compared. After a dose of 6.0 grays, both cell types had the same initial frequency of breaks and the same rate for rejoining of the breaks, but the fraction of breaks that did not rejoin was five to six times greater for the A-T cells. The results also show that progression of cells into the S phase is not a prerequisite for the increased frequency of chromosome fragments that appear in mitosis after A-T cells are irradiated in the G1 or G0 phase."
https://openalex.org/W2001952162,Extravascular coagulation is a prominent feature of such important pathological processes as cellular immunity and neoplasia and has been thought to result from procoagulants associated with the inflammatory or tumor cells peculiar to these entities. It was found that increased microvascular permeability alone is sufficient to induce equivalent extravascular coagulation in several normal tissues. The results indicate that saturating levels of procoagulant are present even in normal tissues and that microvascular permeability is a rate-limiting step in extravascular coagulation.
https://openalex.org/W1534784498,"To define regions within fibronectin (Fn) recognized by platelet binding sites, inhibition of Fn binding by an Fn fragment and synthetic peptides has been analyzed. A highly purified 120-kDa chymotryptic fragment, which has cell attachment activity but did not bind to insolubilized heparin or gelatin, inhibited Fn binding to platelets with an ID50 approximately 3 microM. Previous work indicates that fibroblasts attach to an 11.5-kDa subfragment of this 120-kDa fragment, and that one of four 30-residue synthetic peptides containing sequences from this region supports cell attachment. Only the peptide containing the COOH terminus of the 11.5-kDa fragment inhibited Fn binding to platelets, with an ID50 approximately 10 microM and is the peptide which supports fibroblast attachment. Of the smaller peptides studied from this sequence, all peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser sequence, including the tetrapeptide itself, were active in inhibiting Fn binding to platelets (ID50 values approximately 10-20 microM). The same peptides support fibroblast attachment. Those which lacked this sequence including Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro and Thr-Gly-Arg-Gly (immediately adjacent tetrapeptides) lacked both activities. Further evidence for specificity of inhibition was provided by structurally modified peptides in which substitution of a Glu for Asp abolished inhibitory activity and substitution of Lys for Arg or Ala for Gly reduced activity 6- and 8-fold, respectively. In addition, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-containing peptides inhibited the rate and extent of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. These data suggest that the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser tetrapeptide contains a recognition specificity involved in the binding of Fn to platelets and that platelets share features of this recognition specificity with fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2027104051,"Transfection of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells with a plasmid carrying the ras oncogene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus (v-Ha ras) changed the growth requirements, terminal differentiation, and tumorigenicity of the recipient cells. One of the cell lines isolated after transfection (TBE-1) was studied extensively and shown to contain v-Ha ras DNA. Total cellular RNA from TBE-1 cells hybridized to v-Ha ras structural gene fragment probes five to eight times more than RNA from parental NHBE cells. The TBE-1 cells expressed phosphorylated v-Ha ras polypeptide p21, showed a reduced requirement for growth-factor supplements, and became aneuploid as an early cellular response to v-Ha ras expression. As the transfectants acquire an indefinite life-span and anchorage independence they became transplantable tumor cells and showed many phenotypic changes suggesting a pleiotropic mechanism for the role of Ha ras in human carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089068314,"Structural models of a DNA molecule containing a radiation-induced psoralen cross-link and of a DNA containing a thymine photodimer were constructed by applying energy-minimization techniques and model-building procedures to data from x-ray crystallographic studies. The helical axes of the models show substantial kinking and unwinding at the sites of the damage, which may have long-range as well as local effects arising from the concomitant changes in the supercoiling and overall structure of the DNA. The damaged areas may also serve as recognition sites for repair enzymes. These results should help in understanding the biologic effects of radiation-induced damage on cells."

https://openalex.org/W1974541129,"Concentrations of plasma homovanillic acid before treatment were highly correlated with global severity of illness in schizophrenic patients, both before and after treatment. In contrast, a fixed dose of haloperidol did not affect those concentrations. Thus, in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, plasma homovanillic acid may reflect the severity of illness, but not be influenced by short-term pharmacological perturbations by neuroleptics."
https://openalex.org/W2054993005,"A theoretical methodology for use in conjunction with experiment was applied to the neurohypophyseal hormone lysine vasopressin for elucidation of its accessible molecular conformations and associated flexibility, conformational transitions, and dynamics. Molecular dynamics and energy minimization techniques make possible a description of the conformational properties of a peptide in terms of the precise positions of atoms, their fluctuations in time, and the interatomic forces acting on them. Analysis of the dynamic trajectory of lysine vasopressin shows the ability of a flexible peptide hormone to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions. The excursions of an individual phenylalanine residue exemplify the dynamic flexibility and multiple conformational states available to small peptide hormones and their component residues, even within constraints imposed by a cyclic hexapeptide ring."
https://openalex.org/W2070456204,"Severe hypertension causes global and regional changes in myocardial perfusion and substrate utilization. Regional perfusion and fatty acid utilization were evaluated by dual-tracer autoradiography in normotensive and hypertensive rats of the Dahl strain. The regional distributions of perfusion and fatty acid utilization were homogeneous in normotensive rats. Severe hypertension was associated with a homogeneous pattern of regional perfusion, but fatty acid utilization was focally decreased in the free wall of the left ventricle. The decrease in fatty acid uptake was associated with a concomitant increase in glucose utilization. These findings suggest that severe hypertension is associated with uniform myocardial perfusion and focal alterations in the substrates used for the performance of myocardial work."
https://openalex.org/W1501390123,"S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Equilibrium sedimentation studies and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate that the native enzyme has a molecular weight of 185,000 and a subunit composition of either alpha alpha' beta 2, alpha 2 beta 2, or alpha' 2 beta 2, where alpha, alpha', and beta are polypeptide chains of molecular weight 53,000, 51,000, and 38,000. The alpha and alpha' subunits appear to be the same polypeptide and presumably differ by some kind of post-translational modification. Stoichiometric studies show that the expected products S-adenosylmethionine, pyrophosphate, and orthophosphate are generated in equimolar amounts. The enzyme exhibits linear kinetics with respect to substrate dependency and product inhibition, except for orthophosphate which shows parabolic noncompetitive inhibition with respect to ATP. Initial velocity studies of substrate dependence and product inhibition indicate a steady state mechanism that is ordered Bi Ter with ATP adding before L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine as the first product released. Pyrophosphate and orthophosphate, however, appear to be released by a random mechanism. Free Mg2+ is an essential activator with a half-maximal effect at 1.0 mM. The Km and Kia for ATP are 31 microM and 84 microM, and the Km for L-methionine is 3.3 microM. The enzyme also has tripolyphosphatase activity which is stimulated by S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1484994078,"The rates of exchange of [4-14C]cholesterol between lipid vesicles prepared with different phospholipids and with different sizes have been measured. The first-order rate constants were higher using vesicles prepared from phosphatidylcholines with highly branched or polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains than with saturated diacyl or di-O-alkyl chains. The rate measurements indicate that the affinity of cholesterol for phospholipid does not vary significantly on change of the type of linkage (ether or ester) in phosphatidylcholine (PC) or of the positions of the fatty acyl chains in 1,2-diacyl-PC bearing one saturated and one unsaturated chain; furthermore, egg phosphatidylglycerol and egg phosphatidylethanolamine appear to have comparable affinities for cholesterol. However, the molecular packing in the bilayer and nearest-neighbor interactions involving cholesterol appear tightened more by N-palmitoylsphingomyelin than by dipalmitoyl-PC; on incorporation of 44 mol % of these phospholipids (which have the same fatty acyl chain composition) into either small or large unilamellar vesicles prepared with egg phosphatidylglycerol, the exchange rates were strikingly slower when the donor species contained sphingomyelin compared with PC. The rate of cholesterol exchange was 100% faster with small unilamellar vesicles than with large unilamellar vesicles as donors, suggesting that the looser packing in the highly curved small vesicles facilitates cholesterol desorption. The cholesterol exchange rate did not vary with the size of the acceptor vesicles, which indicates that desorption is the rate-limiting step in the exchange process in the presence of excess acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2027743009,"The blood-brain barrier restricts the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain. The permeability of the barrier to iodine-125-labeled bovine serum albumin was examined in rats that had undergone adrenalectomy, adrenal demedullation, and corticosterone replacement. Adrenalectomy, but not adrenal demedullation, increased the permeability of brain tissue to the isotopically labeled macromolecule; corticosterone replacement reversed this effect. These results indicate that the blood-brain barrier may be hormonally regulated; that is, the pituitary-adrenal axis may physiologically modulate the permeability of the brain microvasculature to macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2019997262,"Damage to the central and peripheral nervous system often produces lasting functional deficits. A major focus of neuroscience research has been to enhance functional restitution of the damaged nervous system and thereby produce recovery of behavioral or physiological processes. Promising procedures include surgical, physical, and chemical manipulations to reduce scar formation and minimize the disruption of support elements, administration of growth-stimulating substances, tissue grafts to bridge gaps in fiber pathways, and embryonic brain tissue grafts to provide new cells with the potential to generate fiber systems. Two elements are required for functional nervous system repair: (i) neurons with the capacity to extend processes must be present, and (ii) the regenerating neurites must find a continuous, unbroken pathway to appropriate targets through a supportive milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2030764183,"Formaldehyde, a common environmental pollutant, inhibits repair of O6-methylguanine and potentiates the mutagenicity of an alkylating agent, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, in normal human fibroblasts. Because formaldehyde alone also causes mutations in human cells, the compound may cause genotoxicity by a dual mechanism of directly damaging DNA and inhibiting repair of mutagenic and carcinogenic DNA lesions caused by other chemical and physical carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1548057500,"Abstract The influence of peptide structure of endogenous cell-surface glycoproteins on the branching and sialylation of their asparagine-linked oligosaccharides was evaluated in a murine B cell lymphoma, AKTB-1b. This cell line simultaneously synthesizes two classes of major histocompatibility antigens that, within each class, share a high degree of amino acid sequence homology and possess potential N-linked glycosylation sites at invariant positions. [3H]Mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were released from each of 11 purified glycosylation sites by the almond peptide:N-glycosidase and analyzed by a variety of chromatographic procedures and glycosidase treatments. The data indicate: 1) a unique distribution of oligosaccharide structures is present at each glycosylation site; 2) each site-specific oligosaccharide pattern is highly reproducible, independent of the number of in vivo tumor passages. The heavy chain of the class I antigens, H-2Kk and H-2Dk contain two and three sites, respectively, in which biantennary structures predominate. However, each site varies with respect to the extent of sialylation and the proportions of more highly branched structures present. The class II antigens, I-Ak and I-Ek, each contain an alpha-chain site toward the N terminus and a single beta-chain site where the overall extent of sialylation is similar, yet the distributions of antennary structures are dramatically different for each. The alpha-chains of each class II antigen also contain a more C-terminal underglycosylated site where sialylation and branching are reduced to differing degrees depending upon the site. The influence of peptide structure on oligosaccharide microheterogeneity is manifest at two levels. First, the overall distributions of oligosaccharides at corresponding sites on structurally related glycoproteins are similar. Second, the specific fingerprint of sialylation and branching patterns at a particular site are reproducibly unique. These data suggest that subtle changes in peptide structure are reflected in the extent of sialylation and branching of oligosaccharides found at corresponding glycosylation sites of structurally related glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1596038816,"Hamster tracheal epithelial cells growing on type I collagen gel synthesize and secrete high molecular weight glycoconjugates which elute in the void volume upon Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography. The presence of any proteoglycans in this void volume material was ruled out based on both enzymatic analysis and behavior on DEAE-ion exchange chromatography. Based on the incorporation of radioactive precursors, followed by strong acid hydrolysis or neuraminidase digestion, the material was shown to contain sialic acid, fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and sulfate. Complete susceptibility to papain digestion and reductive beta-elimination suggests that the material consists of O-linked glycoproteins. The identification of N-acetylgalactosaminitol in the beta-eliminated oligosaccharides confirms this notion. The molecular weight of the oligosaccharides following beta-elimination ranges from 4,000 to 15,000. We conclude that the high molecular weight glyconjugates produced by hamster tracheal epithelial cells in primary culture are mucous glycoproteins based on size, sensitivity to alkaline borohydride treatment, and monosaccharide composition. Further characterization of these mucous glycoproteins showed both size and charge microheterogeneity among molecules. Detailed structural analysis of oligosaccharides of these mucous glycoproteins is currently under way."
https://openalex.org/W1570171942,"Weight loss often results from various experimental conditions including scurvy in guinea pigs, where we showed that decreased collagen synthesis was directly related to weight loss, rather than to defective proline hydroxylation (Chojkier, M., Spanheimer, R., and Peterkofsky, B. (1983) J. Clin. Invest. 72, 826-835). In the study described here, this effect was reproduced by acutely fasting normal guinea pigs receiving vitamin C, as determined by measuring collagen and non-collagen protein production after labeling tissues in vitro with [3H]proline. Collagen production (dpm/microgram of DNA) decreased soon after initiating fasting and by 96 h it had reached levels 8-12% of control values. Effects on non-collagen protein were much less severe, so that the percentage of collagen synthesis relative to total protein synthesis was 20-25% of control values after a 96-h fast. These effects were not due to changes in the specific radioactivity of free proline. Refeeding reversed the effects on non-collagen protein production within 24 h, but collagen production did not return to normal until 96 h. The effect of fasting on collagen production was independent of age, sex, ascorbate status, species of animal, and type of connective tissue and also was seen with in vivo labeling. Pulse-chase experiments and analysis of labeled and pre-existing proteins by gel electrophoresis showed no evidence of increased collagen degradation as a result of fasting. Procollagen mRNA was decreased in tissues of fasted animals as determined by cell-free translation and dot-blot hybridization with cDNA probes. In contrast, there was no decrease in translatable mRNAs for non-collagen proteins. These results suggest that loss of nutritional factors other than vitamin C lead to a rapid, specific decrease in collagen synthesis mainly through modulation of mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2007079954,Little is known about the digestive adaptations that enable mammals to sustain metabolic rates an order of magnitude higher than those of reptiles. Comparison of several features of digestion in mammals and lizards of similar size eating the same diet revealed that mammals processed food ten times faster and with the same or greater extraction efficiency. Transport kinetics and rates of nutrient absorption normalized to the quantity of intestinal tissue were similar in these two classes of vertebrates. The main basis for faster absorption in mammals is their much greater intestinal surface area.

https://openalex.org/W1990422782,"Cholesterol accumulates within smooth muscle cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, thereby contributing to the progressive enlargement of these lesions. The mechanism of this cellular accumulation of cholesterol is not known. The possibility that platelets may have a role in the cellular cholesterol accumulation that occurs during atherogenesis was investigated. Incubation of thrombin-activated washed rat platelets (or platelet-free supernatants prepared from thrombin-activated platelets) with cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells induced cholesteryl ester lipid droplet accumulation within the smooth muscle cells. No cholesteryl ester lipid droplets accumulated when smooth muscle cells were incubated with unactivated platelets. Smooth muscle cell lipid droplet accumulation occurred in the absence of serum lipoproteins and was not inhibited by mevinolin, a drug that blocks cholesterol synthesis. These findings suggest that activated platelets may release cholesterol, which can be accumulated by cells and stored as lipid droplets."
https://openalex.org/W1567454910,"The effect of pH on (i) the second-order rate constant for CO binding and (ii) the spectral properties of the deoxygenated derivative of several monomeric hemoproteins has been investigated in the pH range between 2.3 and 9.0. As in the case of 3-[1-imidazolyl]-propylamide monomethyl ester mesoheme, the rate constant for CO binding to sperm whale, horse, Dermochelys coriacea, Coryphaena hippurus, and Aplysia limacina myoglobins (the latter only in the presence of acetate/acetic acid mixture) increases, as the pH is lowered, to a value at least 1 order of magnitude higher than at pH 7.0. Such an effect is not observed in A. limacina myoglobin (in the absence of the acetate/acetic acid mixture) and Chironomus thummi thummi erythrocruorin. Moreover, the absorption spectrum, in the visible region, of the deoxy derivative of all these monomeric hemoproteins (with the exception of A. limacina myoglobin in the absence of the acetate/acetic acid mixture) undergoes a transition as the pH is lowered, an effect observed previously with 3-[1-imidazolyl]-propylamide monomethyl ester protoheme. On the basis of analogous spectroscopic and kinetic properties of chelated heme model compounds we attribute this behavior to the protonation of the N epsilon of the proximal imidazole involved in the bond with the iron atom. On the basis of this model the movement of the iron atom to the heme plane appears as a crucial step for CO binding, the activation free energy of the process amounting to approximately 2 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W1520114847,"We studied the kinetics of synthesis and secretion of the acute phase plasma protein, C-reactive protein, in primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from rabbits manifesting differing degrees of the acute phase response to inflammatory stimulus. In cultures prepared from progressively more responsive animals, rate of C-reactive protein secretion increased to a much greater degree than did intracellular C-reactive protein content, resulting in a progressive decrease in the ratio of intracellular content to rate of secretion. This ratio, which represents the time required to secrete the amount of C-reactive protein contained within the intracellular pool, decreased from 18 h in cultures from unstimulated rabbits to 2.5 h in cells from highly responsive animals. In contrast, these ratios for albumin were short and fell within a narrow range (0.8-2.1 h). In pulse-chase labeling experiments, the time required for secretion of 50% of pulse-labeled C-reactive protein varied markedly, ranging from well over 6 h in cells from a minimally responsive animal to about 75 min in cells from a highly responsive rabbit. In contrast, the half-time for secretion of albumin was consistently about 45 min in the same cultures. Taken together, these findings indicate that the process by which C-reactive protein is secreted becomes more efficient during the course of the acute phase response. Recent studies have indicated that secretory proteins pass from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi at different and characteristic rates, possibly by a receptor-mediated process in which rate of transfer is determined by receptor affinity. We postulate that C-reactive protein secretion is regulated, during the course of the acute phase response, either by alterations in availability of specific receptors or by competition between different secretory proteins for a common receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2170137824,"Motoneurons of the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus innervate bulbocavernosus muscles in male rats. Adult female rats normally lack both the spinal nucleus and its target muscles. Prenatal treatment of females with testosterone propionate resulted in adults having, like males, both the spinal nucleus and its target muscles. However, prenatal treatment with dihydrotestosterone propionate preserves the muscles but not the motoneurons. This paradoxical condition might result from (i) bulbocavernosus muscles without innervation; (ii) muscles innervated by morphologically unrecognizable motoneurons; (iii) muscles innervated by a very few spinal nucleus cells, each innervating many bulbocavernosus fibers; or (iv) muscles innervated by motoneurons outside their normal anatomical locus in the spinal nucleus. The results of retrograde marker injections into the bulbocavernosus muscles of females treated with androgen refute the first three possibilities and confirm the last: the different androgen treatments result in anatomically distinct spinal motor nuclei innervating bulbocavernosus muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1518431488,"The presence of a nonmetabolizable solute whose uptake is coupled to the inward translocation of Na+ has been found to enhance Na+-dependent pH homeostasis and survival of an obligately alkalophilic bacterium. Upon shift of cells of Bacillus firmus RAB from growth medium to buffers at pH 10.5, viability and maintenance of a relatively acidified cytoplasm depended upon the presence of Na+ and was augmented by the inclusion of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in the buffer. Similarly, when cells were first equilibrated at pH 8.5 and then shifted to buffer at pH 10.5, an extraordinary capacity to maintain a relatively low pHin was exhibited, but only in the presence of Na+. In this protocol, the inclusion of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid actually resulted in an early overshoot of proton influx and also rendered a suboptimal concentration of Na+ efficacious in pH homeostasis. When a protonophoric uncoupler was added to the equilibration and shift buffers, Na+-dependent acidification of the interior was inhibited at early time points. The results support the conclusion drawn from earlier work that a Na+/H+ antiporter plays a critical role in pH homeostasis in the obligately alkalophilic bacilli. Moreover, the current findings indicate that the Na+/solute symporters are a physiologically functional pathway for completing the sodium cycle that controls pHin."
https://openalex.org/W1563204321,"Upon induced variation of membrane lipid acyl chain unsaturation in Acholeplasma laidlawii, the cells strongly change in a characteristic manner the proportions of individual (charged and noncharged) polar lipids synthesized. Monolayer analysis of polar lipid extracts revealed different mean lateral molecular areas but similar surface charge densities. Microelectrophoresis of these lipids indicated an almost constant lipid membrane zeta-potential of about -35 mV. Simulation by the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) relations verified that the zeta (surface)-potentials remain constant. Exposing cells to increasing concentration of Na+ yielded a substantial increase in amounts of charged lipids synthesized. In model systems consisting of mixtures of A. laidlawii phosphatidylglycerol (anionic) and glucolipid (diglucosyldiglyceride, noncharged) microelectrophoresis showed; (i) increasing PG amounts resulted in an increased-, and (ii) increasing Na+ concentration resulted in a decreased zeta-potential, respectively, (iii) at physiological ionic strength and lipid surface charge densities the zeta-potential was approximately -35 mV, and (iv) simulation according to the GCS theory yielded an acceptable fit with experimental data. This behavior of the phosphatidylglycerol/diglucosyldiglyceride mixtures is very similar to that of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine mixtures. It is concluded that the changes in lipid surface charge densities (and surface potential) in A. laidlawii membranes brought by variation in lateral areas of lipid acyl chains and the concentration-dependent quenching of lipid charge by Na+, is compensated for by the cellular regulation of charged lipid amounts thereby maintaining a constant lipid surface potential."
https://openalex.org/W2088054439,"A relation between synaptic morphology and physiology was observed in an in vitro preparation of a sense organ (the ampulla of Lorenzini), in which activity was monitored from the primary afferent neurons before electron microscopic examination of the afferent synapses. The depth of the postsynaptic trough decreased as prefixation sensitivity of the sense organ decreased. This relation and other ultrastructural differences suggest that physiological properties of synapses are influenced by morphological features. Thus, synapses might be morphologically dynamic to modulate synaptic efficacy in relatively long-term phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2067476684,"Computer-aided techniques were used to reconstruct the complex renal tubular system in the dorsal kidney region of a marine elasmobranch fish, the little skate (Raja erinacea), from a series of light micrographs of serial sections. It was established that five individual segments of one nephron, consisting of two loops and a distal tubule, are arranged in parallel within an elongated closed tissue sac. Capillaries, which form a network around these nephron segments, enter and exit this sac at the same end. This anatomical arrangement suggests that a complex renal countercurrent multiplier system may be important in fluid regulation in these fish."
https://openalex.org/W1512610726,"Human amniotic fluid fibronectin was found to contain three types of carbohydrates: complex-type N-glycosidic glycans, lactosaminoglycans, and O-glycosidic glycans. The structures of the complex-type glycans were established by carbohydrate and methylation analysis, Smith degradation, sequential exoglycosidase treatments, lectin chromatography, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Lactosaminoglycans were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and the O-glycosidically-linked oligosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The results show that amniotic fluid fibronectin contains 2 mol of biantennary and 2-3 mol of triantennary, complex-type N-glycosidic glycans. Unlike the N-glycosidic glycans of human adult plasma fibronectin, which contain only traces of fucose and are completely sialylated, the glycans from amniotic fluid fibronectin are fucosylated and only partially sialylated. The complex-type N-glycosidic glycans present in amniotic fluid fibronectin also include a fractional amount (0.1 mol) of glycans with a polylactosaminyl structure. In addition, 4 mol of O-glycosidic oligosaccharides, which have not previously been described in fibronectins, were found in amniotic fluid fibronectin. The major oligosaccharides in this fraction have the structures Gal beta 1----3GalNAcol, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAcol and NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAcol. O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides were also detected in human adult plasma fibronectin but in smaller amounts than in amniotic fluid fibronectin. These results show that amniotic fluid fibronectin differs from plasma fibronectin with regard to the number of glycans attached to the polypeptide and that the glycans present in these two fibronectins differ in structure."

https://openalex.org/W1481202577,"Characterization of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in acinar cells from rat pancreas and lacrimal and parotid glands was achieved by binding of the reversible muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and the specific alkylating reagent [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard (PrBCM) to intact acini or dispersed acinar cells. Binding studies with [3H]QNB showed that acinar cells from pancreas contain 26,400, from parotid 21,400, and from lacrimal gland 25,700 binding sites/cell. To assess molecular size of the receptor in each gland, acini were prepared by digestion with purified collagenase and singly dispersed acinar cells were prepared by a combination of digestion with crude collagenase, hyaluronidase, and alpha-chymotrypsin and divalent cation chelation using EDTA. Muscarinic receptors on acini or dispersed cells were covalently labeled with 5 nM [3H]PrBCM, solubilized directly in hot sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer, and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When solubilized acini were electrophoresed, a major labeled peak was observed on gels along with a smaller peak of lower apparent molecular weight. For pancreatic acini, the apparent molecular weights of these peaks were 117,600 and 85,700; for parotid acini, 104,800 and 74,500; and for lacrimal acini, 87,200 and 63,100. Addition of muscarinic antagonists to the labeling medium abolished both peaks. When dispersed acinar cells were labeled, the larger peak was eliminated, and all radioactivity was concentrated in a single peak: 87,600 for pancreas, 78,000 for parotid gland, and 62,800 for lacrimal gland. Digestion of prelabeled acini with the mixture of enzymes used to produce dispersed acinar cells similarly shifted all radioactivity into this second peak. Limited digestion of acini or dispersed cells with 1 mg/ml of papain resulted in the disappearance of these higher molecular weight peaks and the appearance of a broad peak at Mr = 40,000. Cells of nonepithelial origin, IM-9 lymphocytes and NG108 neuroblastoma X glioma hybrids, also were labeled with [3H]PrBCM and electrophoresed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1523193175,"The dipyruvylated glycolipid from Mycobacterium smegmatis (Saadat, S., and Ballou, C.E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1813-1818) has been shown to have the following structure in which FA1 is tetra- or hexadecanoic acid and FA2 is 2,4-dimethyl-2-eicosenoic acid. (formula; see text) The fast atom bombardment mass spectrum showed two major ions [M - H]- at m/z 1511 and 1539 (Mr 1512 and 1540) in a ratio of 1.4:1, suggesting that the glycolipid was a mixture of homologs that differed in fatty acid composition by 2 methylene groups. Analysis revealed C14, C16, and C22 fatty acids in ratios of 0.6:0.4:1.0, indicating that 60% of the molecules contained a C14 and C22 fatty acid whereas 40% contained a C16 and C22 fatty acid. The fragmentation pattern showed that a single glucose unit along with the smaller fatty acid could be lost to yield a tetrasaccharide with attached C22 fatty acid, and a second fragmentation yielded a trisaccharide containing 2 pyruvic acids but without attached fatty acid. The C14 and C16 fatty acids were identified as myristic and palmitic acid, whereas the C22 fatty acid was 2,4-dimethyl-2-eicosenoic acid. Precise localization of the fatty acids came from periodate oxidation and methylation analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1539729022,"Several biotinyl estradiol derivatives have been prepared by coupling estradiol 7 alpha-carboxylic acid to biotin via different linear linkers. All these compounds exhibit a high affinity for the estrogen receptor as determined by competitive binding assays against [3H]estradiol. These compounds also displaced the dye 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2'-carboxylic acid from the biotin-binding sites of avidin free or immobilized on agarose. It was demonstrated that only the derivatives bearing a long spacer chain (greater than 42 A greater than) between estradiol and biotin were able to bind receptor and avidin simultaneously, suggesting some steric hindrance. The biotin-avidin system has been investigated for the purification of the cytosoluble estrogen receptor stabilized by sodium molybdate. The method relies on: 1) high biohormonal affinity of receptor for biotinyl estradiol derivative; 2) the specific selection by avidin-agarose column of biotinyl estradiol-receptor complexes; and 3) the biohormonal elution step by an excess of radioactive estradiol. Starting from unfractionated cytosol containing molybdate-stabilized nontransformed 8S estrogen receptor with estradiol 7 alpha-(CH2)10-CO-NH-(CH2)2-O-(CH2)2-O-(CH2)2-NH-CO-(CH2)3-NH-biotin, preliminary experiments using avidin-agarose chromatography and then a specific elution step by exchange with free [3H]estradiol, allowed a 500-1,500-fold purification. Further purification of estrogen receptor was obtained by ion exchange chromatography through a DEAE-Sephacel column and led to a congruent to 20% pure protein, assuming one binding site/65,000-Da unit. The hydrodynamic parameters of the purified receptor were essentially identical to those of molybdate-stabilized nontransformed receptor present in crude cytosol. The advantages of this double biotinyl steroid derivative-avidin chromatographic technique over more conventional affinity procedures are discussed and make it applicable to the purification of minute amounts of steroid receptors in a wide variety of tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1566550283,"Abstract The nitric oxide (N = O) free radical exhibits potent cytocidal, mutagenic and vasodilatory properties. We have examined the hypothesis that the hydroxynitrosamino functionality (see sequence in text), which occurs naturally in antineoplastic and antihypertensive agents, will directly generate N = O following peroxidatic 1-electron oxidation. Cupferron (see sequence in text) is indeed an excellent (k greater than 10(7) m-1 s-1) substrate for horseradish peroxidase. The products are N = O and nitrosobenzene (phi - N = O) which are generated and consumed as follows. First, cupferron is oxidized by the classical peroxidatic mechanism to form an unstable nitroxide free radical (see sequence in text) which then forms N = O and phi - N = O spontaneously (see sequence in text). The N = O then reacts with phi - N = O to reform cupferron (see sequence in text) or with the enzyme to generate the characteristic peroxidase--N = O chromophore. Simultaneously, in a competitive reaction with O2, the N = O is converted to NO-2 (4N = O + O2 + 2H2O------------4NO-2 + 4H+). The reactivity of hydroxynitrosamino compounds with horseradish peroxidase is in the order cupferron greater than hydroxynitrosaminomethane greater than alanosine. These model reactions, involving direct oxidation of the hydroxynitrosamino moiety, comprise a novel pathway for the biological production of N = O."
https://openalex.org/W1544370755,"Creatinine iminohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.21), which catalyzes hydrolysis of creatinine to N-methylhydantoin and ammonia, was purified from Flavobacterium filamentosum. The average molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 272,480, and the subunit molecular weight was 44,300. Extensive specificity studies indicated that the enzyme utilized cytosine (Km, 0.62 mM; Vm, 20.1 units/mg) as well as creatinine (Km, 5.00 mM; Vm, 40.4 units/mg) as a substrate. Each was a competitive inhibitor toward hydrolysis of the other compound. Dialysis of creatinine iminohydrolase in the presence of 0.01 M Tris phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1,10-phenanthroline decreased activity by 98%. Reactivation was accomplished by incubating the apoenzyme in the presence of certain divalent metal chlorides, listed in decreasing order of effectiveness: iron(II), zinc, cobalt(II), cadmium, and nickel. The extent of reactivation depended on the substrate and on which metal ion was added to the apoenzyme. Creatinine to cytosine activity ratios varied from 1:3.75 (iron(II) chloride), to 1:0.9 (zinc chloride), to 1:0.06 (nickel chloride). For different preparations of the holoenzyme that ratio ranged from 1:0.45 to 1:1.10. Variable but significant quantities of zinc and iron were present in all preparations of the purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2009205874,"Ethanol-induced intoxication and hypothermia were studied in rats approximately 7 months after severe thiamine deficiency, when treated rats appeared to have recovered their physical health. Previously induced thiamine deficiency without prior ethanol exposure significantly decreased the area under the curve plotted for the concentration of ethanol in blood and also decreased behavioral impairment and hypothermia due to ethanol exposure. Pathophysiologic changes resulting from thiamine deficiency may contribute to both the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic tolerance to ethanol in chronic alcoholics."

https://openalex.org/W1548482402,Rat adrenal mitochondria have an active rotenone-insensitive outer mitochondrial membrane NADH-semidehydroascorbate (NADH-SDA) reductase which supports cholesterol side chain cleavage at a rate equal to that supported by malate. Side chain cleavage activity supported by both of these electron donor systems is equally inhibited by cycloheximide. Catalase or butylated hydroxyanisole are required for the NADH-SDA reductase-supported cholesterol side chain cleavage. This requirement can be removed by briefly subjecting the mitochondrial preparations to -20 degrees C. Ascorbic acid alone or with malate is either inhibitory or has no effect on side chain cleavage activity. These observations demonstrate that outer mitochondrial membrane NADH-SDA reductase in rat adrenal functions to provide cytoplasmic reducing equivalents to intramitochondrial cytochrome P-450scc and provides a new explanation for the function of ascorbic acid in corticosteroidogenesis.
