https://openalex.org/W2804567596,"Background Currently available treatments for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SPMS) have limited efficacy and/or safety concerns. Adipose-mesenchymal derived stem cells(AdMSCs) represent a promising option and can be readily obtained using minimally invasive procedures. Patients and methods In this triple-blind, placebo-controlled study, cell samples were obtained from consenting patients by lipectomy and subsequently expanded. Patients were randomized to a single infusion of placebo, low-dose(1x106cells/kg) or high-dose(4x106cells/kg) autologous AdMSC product and followed for 12 months. Safety was monitored recording adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs and spirometry. Expanded disability status score (EDSS), magnetic-resonance-imaging, and other measures of possible treatment effects were also recorded. Results Thirty-four patients underwent lipectomy for AdMSCs collection, were randomized and thirty were infused (11 placebo, 10 low-dose and 9 high-dose); 4 randomized patients were not infused because of karyotype abnormalities in the cell product. Only one serious adverse event was observed in the treatment arms (urinary infection, considered not related to study treatment). No other safety parameters showed changes. Measures of treatment effect showed an inconclusive trend of efficacy. Conclusion Infusion of autologous AdMSCs is safe and feasible in patients with SPMS. Larger studies and probably treatment at earlier phases would be needed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of this technique."

https://openalex.org/W2803907654,"The wild boar is an important crop raider as well as a reservoir and agent of spread of swine diseases. Due to increasing densities and expanding ranges worldwide, the related economic losses in livestock and agricultural sectors are significant and on the rise. Its management and control would strongly benefit from accurate and detailed spatial information on species distribution and abundance, which are often available only for small areas. Data are commonly available at aggregated administrative units with little or no information about the distribution of the species within the unit. In this paper, a four-step geostatistical downscaling approach is presented and used to disaggregate wild boar population density statistics from administrative units of different shape and size (polygons) to 5 km resolution raster maps by incorporating auxiliary fine scale environmental variables. 1) First a stratification method was used to define homogeneous bioclimatic regions for the analysis; 2) Under a geostatistical framework, the wild boar densities at administrative units, i.e. subnational areas, were decomposed into trend and residual components for each bioclimatic region. Quantitative relationships between wild boar data and environmental variables were estimated through multiple regression and used to derive trend components at 5 km spatial resolution. Next, the residual components (i.e., the differences between the trend components and the original wild boar data at administrative units) were downscaled at 5 km resolution using area-to-point kriging. The trend and residual components obtained at 5 km resolution were finally added to generate fine scale wild boar estimates for each bioclimatic region. 3) These maps were then mosaicked to produce a final output map of predicted wild boar densities across most of Eurasia. 4) Model accuracy was assessed at each different step using input as well as independent data. We discuss advantages and limits of the method and its potential application in animal health."
https://openalex.org/W2803503605,"The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival in vitro. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells in vitro and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2803944892,"Acupuncture has been used in the therapy of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, its neural mechanisms are still unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of acupuncture on the functional connectivity in AD by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Twenty-eight subjects (14 AD and 14 normal controls) participated in this study. The rs-fMRI data were acquired before and after acupuncture stimulation at the acupoints of Tai chong (Liv3) and Hegu (LI4). During the baseline resting state, by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), we found a significantly decreased or increased ALFF in the AD patients relative to the controls. These regions were located in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left postcentral gyrus, subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), right middle cingulate cortex (MCC), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right hippocampus and the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Then, we selected these brain regions as seeds to investigate whether regional activity and functional connectivity could be modulated by acupuncture in the AD patients. When compared to the pre-acupuncture stage, several of the above regions showed an increased or decreased ALFF after acupuncture in the AD patients. In addition, the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the precentral gyrus showed enhancement after acupuncture in the AD patients. Finally, there were close correlations between the functional activity, connectivity and clinical performance in the AD patients. The current study confirmed that acupuncture at Tai chong (Liv3) and He gu (LI4) can modulate functional activity and connectivity of specific cognition-related regions in AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2756050524,"Background The use of mobile technology such as phone applications (apps) has been proposed as an efficient means of providing health and clinical information in a variety of healthcare settings. We developed the Health-e Babies app as an Android smart phone application for pregnant women attending a tertiary hospital in a low socio-economic community, with the objective of providing health information about early pregnancy that would increase maternal confidence and reduce anxiety. Based on our earlier research, this form of health communication was viewed as a preferred source of information for women of reproductive age. However, the pilot study had a poor participation rate with 76% (n = 94) not completing the study requirements. These initial findings raised some very important issues in relation to the difficulties of engaging women with a pregnancy app. This paper analyses the characteristics of the participants who did not complete the study requirements in an attempt to identify potential barriers associated with the implementation of a pregnancy app. Methods This retrospective review of quantitative and qualitative data collected at the commencement of the Health-e Babies App trial, related to the participant’s communication technology use, confidence in knowing where to seek help and mental health status, maternal-fetal attachment and parenting confidence. Engagement and use of the Health-e Babies App was measured by the completion of a questionnaire about the app and downloaded data from participant’s phones. Mental health status, confidence and self-efficacy were measured by questionnaires. Results All women were similar in terms of age, race, marital status and level of education. Of the 94 women (76%) who did not complete the trial, they were significantly more anxious as indicated by State Trait Anxiety Inventory (p = 0.001 Student T-test) and more likely to be unemployed (50% vs 31%, p = 0.012 Student T-Test). Conclusion This study provides important information about the challenges associated with the implementation of a pregnancy app in a socially disadvantaged community. The data suggests that factors including social and mental health issues, financial constraints and technological ability can affect women’s engagement with a mobile phone app."
https://openalex.org/W2803285381,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 has become a global public health and a food safety problem. Despite the implementation of control strategies that guarantee the safety in various products, outbreaks persist and new alternatives are necessary to reduce this pathogen along the food chain. Recently, our group isolated and characterised lytic bacteriophages against E. coli O157:H7 with potential to be used as biocontrol agents in food. To this end, phages need certain requirements to allow their manufacture and application. The aim of this study was to determine the physical stability and allergenic potential of free and microencapsulated (ME) bacteriophage cocktails against E. coli O157:H7. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to determine phage survival under different pH, gastrointestinal conditions, temperature and UV light intensities. Results showed that the stability of ME phages was significantly (P<0.05) higher than free phages after ultraviolet irradiation, pH conditions between 3 to 7, and exposure to temperatures between at -80°C and 70°C. Both formulations were highly sensitive to very low pH in simulated gastric fluid, but stable in bile salts. In vivo studies in mice confirmed these phages passed through the gastrointestinal tract and were excreted in faeces. In silico, full-length alignment analysis showed that all phage proteins were negative for allergenic potential, but different predicting criteria classified seven phage proteins with a very low probability to be an allergen. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that microencapsulation provided a greater stability to phage formulation under stress conditions and assure a more suitable commercial formulation for the biological control of E. coli O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W2803225056,"The pro-oncogenic kinase PKCε is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and cooperates with loss of the tumor suppressor Pten for the development of prostatic adenocarcinoma. However, the effectors driving PKCε-mediated phenotypes remain poorly defined. Here, using cellular and mouse models, we showed that PKCε overexpression acts synergistically with Pten loss to promote NF-κB activation and induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, phenotypic traits which are also observed in human prostate tumors. Targeted disruption of PKCε from prostate cancer cells impaired COX-2 induction and PGE2 production. Notably, COX-2 inhibitors selectively killed prostate epithelial cells overexpressing PKCε, and this ability was greatly enhanced by Pten loss. Long-term COX-2 inhibition markedly reduced adenocarcinoma formation, as well as angiogenesis in a mouse model of prostate-specific PKCε expression and Pten loss. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of the canonical NF-κB pathway and its target gene COX2 as PKCε effectors, and highlight the potential of PKCε as a useful biomarker for the use of COX inhibition for chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic purposes in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2804765270,"Pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous condition with an overall bad prognosis. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize homogeneous phenotypes by a cluster analysis in SSc patients with PH. Patients were identified from two prospective cohorts from the US and France. Clinical, pulmonary function, high-resolution chest tomography, hemodynamic and survival data were extracted. We performed cluster analysis using the k-means method and compared survival between clusters using Cox regression analysis. Cluster analysis of 200 patients identified four homogenous phenotypes. Cluster C1 included patients with mild to moderate risk pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with limited or no interstitial lung disease (ILD) and low DLCO with a 3-year survival of 81.5% (95% CI: 71.4-88.2). C2 had pre-capillary PH due to extensive ILD and worse 3-year survival compared to C1 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.14; 95% CI 1.66-5.94; p = 0.0004). C3 had severe PAH and a trend towards worse survival (HR 2.53; 95% CI 0.99-6.49; p = 0.052). Cluster C4 and C1 were similar with no difference in survival (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.19-2.27, p = 0.507) but with a higher DLCO in C4. PH in SSc can be characterized into distinct clusters that differ in prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2803447495,"While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980-2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980-2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change."
https://openalex.org/W2804204431,"Hsp70 chaperones bind to various protein substrates for folding, trafficking, and degradation. Considerable structural information is available about how prokaryotic Hsp70 (DnaK) binds substrates, but less is known about mammalian Hsp70s, of which there are 13 isoforms encoded in the human genome. Here, we report the interaction between the human Hsp70 isoform heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (Hsc70 or HSPA8) and peptides derived from the microtubule-associated protein Tau, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease. For structural studies, we used an Hsc70 construct (called BETA) comprising the substrate-binding domain but lacking the lid. Importantly, we found that truncating the lid does not significantly impair Hsc70's chaperone activity or allostery in vitro. Using NMR, we show that BETA is partially dynamically disordered in the absence of substrate and that binding of the Tau sequence GKVQIINKKG (with a KD = 500 nm) causes dramatic rigidification of BETA. NOE distance measurements revealed that Tau binds to the canonical substrate-binding cleft, similar to the binding observed with DnaK. To further develop BETA as a tool for studying Hsc70 interactions, we also measured BETA binding in NMR and fluorescent competition assays to peptides derived from huntingtin, insulin, a second Tau-recognition sequence, and a KFERQ-like sequence linked to chaperone-mediated autophagy. We found that the insulin C-peptide binds BETA with high affinity (KD 100 μm). Together, our findings reveal several similarities and differences in how prokaryotic and mammalian Hsp70 isoforms interact with different substrate peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2803372696,"This study aimed to evaluate the associations between types of night shift work and different indices of obesity using the baseline information from a prospective cohort study of night shift workers in China.A total of 3,871 workers from five companies were recruited from the baseline survey. A structured self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the participants' demographic information, lifetime working history, and lifestyle habits. Participants were grouped into rotating, permanent and irregular night shift work groups. Anthropometric parameters were assessed by healthcare professionals. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between night shift work and different indices of obesity.Night shift workers had increased risk of overweight and obesity, and odds ratios (ORs) were 1.17 (95% CI, 0.97-1.41) and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.74-2.18), respectively. Abdominal obesity had a significant but marginal association with night shift work (OR = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.01-1.43). A positive gradient between the number of years of night shift work and overweight or abdominal obesity was observed. Permanent night shift work showed the highest odds of being overweight (OR = 3.94, 95% CI, 1.40-11.03) and having increased abdominal obesity (OR = 3.34, 95% CI, 1.19-9.37). Irregular night shift work was also significantly associated with overweight (OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.13-2.14), but its association with abdominal obesity was borderline (OR = 1.26, 95% CI, 0.94-1.69). By contrast, the association between rotating night shift work and these parameters was not significant.Permanent and irregular night shift work were more likely to be associated with overweight or abdominal obesity than rotating night shift work. These associations need to be verified in prospective cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W2804443912,"P values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of P values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of P values and the occurrence of significant P values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant P values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on P values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of P values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on P values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported P values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported P values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on P values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome."
https://openalex.org/W2804467266,"Background Health care professionals, especially medical students, are at greater risk of contracting hepatitis B and C virus infections due to their occupational exposure to percutaneous injuries and other body fluids. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and C virus infections among medicine and health science students in Northeast Ethiopia and to assess their knowledge and practice towards the occupational risk of viral hepatitis. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among a total of 408 medicine and health science students during the period from March to September 2017. A pre-coded self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on students’ socio- demographic characteristics, knowledge and practice of hepatitis B and C infections. Blood samples were collected and screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies. SPSS version 20 statistical software was used for data analysis. Results The seroprevalence of HBV infection was 4.2% (95% CI 2.5 to 6.1%) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.0 to 1.7%) for HCV. Older age (AOR = 15.72, 95% CI 1.57–157.3) and exposure to needlestick injury (AOR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.10–10.73) were associated with a higher risk of HBV infection. Majority of the students (80.1%) had an adequate knowledge about hepatitis B and C infection, mode of transmission and preventive measures. Only 50.0% of students had safe practice towards occupational risk of viral hepatitis infection. Almost half (49.8%) of students experienced a needlestick injury; of which, 53.2% reported the incidence, and only 39.4% had screening test result for viral hepatitis. Conclusion A high seroprevalence but poor practice of hepatitis B and C virus infection was found in the study area despite their good knowledge towards occupational risk of viral hepatitis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2803177263,"The conformational changes of a calcium transport ATPase were investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements to determine the significance of a discrete structural element for regulation of the conformational dynamics of the transport cycle. Previous MD simulations indicated that a loop in the cytosolic domain of the SERCA calcium transporter facilitates an open-to-closed structural transition. To investigate the significance of this structural element, we performed additional MD simulations and new biophysical measurements of SERCA structure and function. Rationally designed in silico mutations of three acidic residues of the loop decreased SERCA domain-domain contacts and increased domain-domain separation distances. Principal component analysis of MD simulations suggested decreased sampling of compact conformations upon N-loop mutagenesis. Deficits in headpiece structural dynamics were also detected by measuring intramolecular FRET of a Cer-YFP-SERCA construct (2-color SERCA). Compared with WT, the mutated 2-color SERCA shows a partial FRET response to calcium, whereas retaining full responsiveness to the inhibitor thapsigargin. Functional measurements showed that the mutated transporter still hydrolyzes ATP and transports calcium, but that maximal enzyme activity is reduced while maintaining similar calcium affinity. In live cells, calcium elevations resulted in concomitant FRET changes as the population of WT 2-color SERCA molecules redistributed among intermediates of the transport cycle. Our results provide novel insights on how the population of SERCA pumps responds to dynamic changes in intracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2804437289,"This study describes the pathologic findings of 24 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) found stranded along the Brazilian coast from 2004 to 2016. Eighteen (75%) animals evaluated were found stranded alive. From these, 13 died naturally on shore and five were euthanized. Six died at sea and were washed ashore. Of the 24, 19 (79.2%) were calves, four (16.7%) were juveniles, and one (4.2%) was an adult. The most probable cause of stranding and/or death (CSD) was determined in 23/24 (95.8%) individuals. In calves, CSD included neonatal respiratory distress (13/19; 68.4%), infectious disease (septicemia, omphaloarteritis and urachocystitis; 3/19; 15.8%), trauma of unknown origin (2/19; 10.5%), and vehicular trauma (vessel strike; 1/19; 5.3%). In juveniles and adult individuals, CSD was: emaciation (2/5; 40%), sunlight-thermal burn shock (1/5; 20%); and discospondylitis (1/5; 20%). In one juvenile, the CSD was undetermined (1/5; 20%). This study integrates novel findings and published case reports to delineate the pathology of a South-western Atlantic population of humpback whales. This foundation will aid in the assessment of the population health and establish a baseline for development of conservation policies."
https://openalex.org/W2805018658,"Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chronic inflammatory responses, as well as alter sphingolipid metabolism. Disruptions in ER stress and sphingolipid metabolism have also been implicated in intestinal inflammation. Therefore, to elucidate the roles of SFAs in ER stress and inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells, we examined myristate (C14:0) and palmitate (C16:0). Myristate, but not palmitate, induced ER stress signaling, including activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) signaling. Myristate significantly increased C14-ceramide levels, whereas palmitate increased several long-chain ceramides. To define the role of ceramide synthases (CerSs) in myristate-induced ER stress, we used the pharmacologic inhibitor, fumonisin B1 (FB1), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) for CerS5 and 6, the primary isoforms that are involved in C14-ceramide generation. FB1 and siRNA for CerS5 or 6 suppressed myristate-induced C14-ceramide generation and XBP1 splicing (XBP1s). Moreover, increased XBP1s induced the downstream expression of IL-6 in a CerS5/6-dependent manner. In addition, a myristate-enriched milk fat-based diet, but not a lard-based diet, increased C14-ceramide, XBP1s, and IL-6 expression in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that myristate modulates ER stress and cytokine production in the intestinal epithelium via CerS5/6 and C14-ceramide generation.-Choi, S., Snider, J. M., Olakkengil, N., Lambert, J. M., Anderson, A. K., Ross-Evans, J. S., Cowart, L. A., Snider, A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2805032000,"Purpose The objective of this project is to study the willingness to pay (WTP) for health insurance (HI) of individuals working in the informal sector in Sierra Leone, using a purposely-designed survey of a representative sample of this sector. Methods We elicit the WTP using the Double-Bounded Dichotomous Choice with Follow Up method. We also examine the factors that are positively and negatively associated with the likelihood of the respondents to answer affirmatively to joining a HI scheme and to paying three different possible premiums, to join the HI scheme. We additionally analyze the individual and household characteristics associated with the maximum amount the household is willing to pay to join the HI scheme. Results The results indicate that the average WTP for the HI is 20,237.16 SLL (3.6 USD) per adult but it ranges from about 14,000 SLL (2.5 USD) to about 35,000 SLL (6.2 USD) depending on region, occupation, household and respondent characteristics. The analysis of the maximum WTP indicates that living outside the Western region and working in farming instead of petty trade are associated with a decrease in the maximum premium respondents are WTP for the HI scheme. Instead, the maximum WTP is positively associated to being a driver or a biker; having secondary or tertiary education (as opposed to not having any); the number of pregnant women in the household; having a TV; and, having paid for the last medical requirement. Conclusions In summary, the various analyses show that a premium for the HI package could be set at approximately 20,000 SLL (3.54 USD) but also that establishing a single premium for all individuals in the informal sector could be risky. The efficient functioning of a HI scheme relies on covering as much of the population as possible, in order to spread risks and make the scheme viable. The impact of the various population characteristics raises the issue of how to rate premiums. In other words, setting a premium that may be too high for a big proportion of the population could mean losing many potential enrollees and might have viability consequences for the operation of the scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2803482196,"Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders."

To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal ad libitum ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5-8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), H19, Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N (Snrpn) and Paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3), which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the Igf2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR), Igf2 differentially methylated region 1, Snrpn ICR and Peg3 ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene Igf2 was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller H19 was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased Snrpn expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta."
https://openalex.org/W2803881875,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2803244848,"Proteins belonging to the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) are believed to be important in tumorigenesis. LUBAC has been demonstrated to be composed of RBCK1, RNF31 and SHARPIN. The aim of this study was to explore all members of the LUBAC complex as novel biomarkers in breast cancer. We have already reported that RNF31 mRNA levels are higher in breast cancer samples compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue. In this study we extend these findings by demonstrating that the mRNA levels of RBCK1 and SHARPIN are also higher in tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue in the same cross sectional study of samples (p < 0.001). In addition, up-regulated mRNA expression of all three members of the LUBAC complex displayed high predictive value in distinguishing tumor tissues from adjacent non-tumor tissue as determined by ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is an association between the mRNA and protein expression levels of RBCK1, RNF31 and SHARPIN and clinicopathological parameters including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status and found that RNF31 protein is significantly higher in ERalpha-negative tumors than ERalpha-positive tumors (p = 0.034). Collectively, our findings indicate that up-regulated mRNA expression of RNF31, RBCK1 and SHARPIN could potentially be diagnostic biomarkers of breast cancer and RNF31 might be a drug target for ERalpha-negative breast cancers."

Two phosphorylcholine transferases, LicD1 and LicD2, mediate the attachment of P-Cho to the O-6 positions of the two GalpNAc residues present in each repeating unit of pneumococcal TAs (pnTAs), of which only LicD1 has been determined to be essential. At the molecular level, the specificity of the P-Cho attachment to pnTAs by LicD1 and LicD2 remains still elusive. Here, using detailed structural analyses of pnTAs from a LicD2-deficient strain, we confirmed the specificity in the attachment of P-Cho residues to pnTA. LicD1 solely transfers P-Cho to α-d-GalpNAc moieties, whereas LicD2 attaches P-Cho to β-d-GalpNAc. Further, we investigated the role of the pneumococcal phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce) in the modification of the P-Cho substitution pattern of pnTAs. To clarify the specificity of Pce-mediated P-Cho hydrolysis, we evaluated different concentrations and pH conditions for the treatment of pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid with purified Pce. We show that Pce can hydrolyze both P-Cho residues of the terminal repeat of the pnTA chain and almost all P-Cho residues bound to β-d-GalpNAc in vitro. However, hydrolysis in vivo was restricted to the terminal repeat. In summary, our findings indicate that LicD1 and LicD2 specifically transfer P-Cho to α-d-GalpNAc and β-d-GalpNAc moieties, respectively, and that Pce removes distinct P-Cho substituents from pnTAs.

It was shown that human l-ficolin directly interacts with P-Cho residues of the pneumococcal teichoic acids (pnTAs), inducing thereby activation of the lectin complement pathway (13Vassal-Stermann E.

S. pneumoniae depends on the nutritional uptake of choline, which is further metabolized by a cascade of three enzymes (LicA, LicB, and LicC). Subsequently, two additional enzymes, LicD1 and LicD2, mediate the attachment of P-Cho to pnTA precursor chains. P-Cho is attached specifically to the O-6 positions of the two GalpNAc residues, which are present in each repeating unit (RU) of pnTAs (Fig. 1). LicD1 is assumed to incorporate one of these P-Cho residues and has been shown to be essential (14Zhang J.R. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Fischer W. Tuomanen E.I. Pneumococcal licD2 gene is involved in phosphorylcholine metabolism.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31 (10200966): 1477-148810.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01291.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). LicD2 probably transfers the second P-Cho residue but is a nonessential enzyme (15Denapaite D. Brückner R. Hakenbeck R. Vollmer W.

Resist. 2012; 18 (22432701): 344-35810.1089/mdr.2012.0026Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the specificity of the LicD1- and LicD2-mediated P-Cho transfer to pnTAs has remained elusive so far. We have shown earlier that the terminal RU of pnTAs can occur in different variants with regard to its P-Cho content. In pnLTA isolated from strain D39ΔcpsΔlgt, both GalpNAc residues of the terminal repeat were almost completely substituted with P-Cho independently of the pH value of the culture medium. In contrast, the pnLTA isolated from strain TIGR4Δcps possessed a terminus in which one or both of these P-Cho residues were significantly reduced or even absent, but only when bacteria had been cultured under mild acidic conditions (1Gisch N.

However, the enzyme(s) involved in this specific modification have not been definitely identified so far. The most likely candidate is the pneumococcal phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce). Pce is a member of the CBP family, and its enzymatic activity was first described in 1974 (16Höltje J.V. Tomasz A. Teichoic acid phosphorylcholine esterase: a novel enzyme activity in pneumococcus.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249 (4153792): 7032-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that Pce is able to hydrolyze about 30% of the total P-Cho residues attached to the GalpNAc moieties of WTA and LTA in vitro (17Vollmer W. Tomasz A. Identification of the teichoic acid phosphorylcholine esterase in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Mol.

The crystal structure of Pce revealed the presence of two structural modules, the catalytic module (residues 1–300) and the choline-binding module (residues 313–540). Both are joined by a small linker, which comprises residues 301–312. Analysis of the crystal structure suggested that the removal of P-Cho residues is limited by the configuration of the active site of Pce in such a way that only residues on the end of the TA chains are accessible to the catalytic center (18Hermoso J.A.

In this study, we investigated the structural specificity of Pce-mediated removal of P-Cho residues from pnLTA. Therefore, LTA from a Pce-deficient S. pneumoniae strain was isolated, incubated with enzymatic active, recombinant Pce under various conditions, and analyzed by high-resolution MS and NMR. Furthermore, using an LicD2-deficient strain, the specific attachment of P-Cho residues by LicD1 and LicD2 was clarified. The prerequisite for a reliable analysis of the Pce-mediated P-Cho hydrolysis was the availability of completely P-Cho substituted pnLTA molecules. Therefore, we isolated the LTA of a Pce-deficient strain in the nonencapsulated TIGR4 background (TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce). The LTA was de-O-acylated by hydrazine treatment and purified by gel permeation chromatography as described previously (23Hess N. Waldow F. Kohler T.P. Rohde M. Kreikemeyer B. Gómez-Mejia A. Hain T.

Furthermore, the spectrum indicates that all de-O-acylated pnLTA molecules of this preparation are completely P-Cho–substituted. The respective 31P NMR spectrum is depicted in the top panel of Fig. 2A, and the corresponding chemical structure for de-O-acyl pnLTA (1Gisch N. Kohler T. Ulmer A.J. Müthing J. Pribyl T. Fischer K.

In 31P NMR, LTA of the Pce-deficient strain displays P-Cho signals at δP 0.33 ppm for P-Cho at β-d-GalpNAc moieties (residues D and G, Fig. 2C), at δP 0.12 ppm for P-Cho at the terminal α-d-GalpNAc (residue H) and at δP −0.15 ppm for P-Cho at all other α-d-GalpNAc moieties (residue E). Signals for ribitol-P (residues C′/C) occur at δP 1.89/1.80 ppm. To determine the specificity and efficiency of P-Cho hydrolysis mediated by Pce, we used the above described, completely P-Cho–substituted LTA of pneumococcal strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce in its native and therefore acylated form. An earlier study showed that Pce has its highest activity against p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine and cell wall components at pH 8.0 (17Vollmer W. Tomasz A. Identification of the teichoic acid phosphorylcholine esterase in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39 (11260477): 1610-162210.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02349.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To further evaluate this finding, we treated purified pnLTA with different concentrations of heterologously expressed Pce and compared the enzyme activity at physiological pH value (pH 7.4) and a more basic pH of 8.0. Subsequently, Pce-treated pnLTAs were treated with anhydrous hydrazine and purified by gel permeation chromatography, to avoid aggregates or micelle formation and thus to obtain reliable 1H and 31P NMR integral values. Analysis of the Pce-treated LTA from strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce (pH 7.4) by 31P and 1H NMR revealed changes in the P-Cho substitution pattern depending on the Pce concentrations used (80, 160, or 240 μg of Pce/mg of isolated LTA; Fig. 2A and Table 1). At 80 μg of Pce/mg of isolated LTA, partial hydrolysis of the P-ChoD+G and P-ChoH moieties could be observed. An increase of the Pce concentration to 160 μg/mg showed only an effect on the hydrolysis of these P-Cho moieties, whereas the amount of Rib-ol-PC/C′ and P-ChoE remained unaltered. At this concentration, almost all P-ChoH moieties have been hydrolyzed, and the amount of P-ChoD+G was lowered by more than half. An increase of the Pce concentration from 160 to 240 μg/mg had only a marginal effect. In Fig. 2B, the respective MS spectra recorded from these preparations are depicted, focusing on de-O-acylated LTA molecules with 6 RUs (the full versions of these MS spectra are shown in Figs. S2–S4). Molecular mass differences of 165 Da between two mass peaks are indicated, which corresponds to the loss of one P-Cho moiety each. In total, we observed the loss of up to seven P-Cho residues (7 × −165 Da). In combination with the 31P NMR results for P-ChoH and P-ChoD+G, this indicates that both P-Cho residues from the terminal RU and all P-Cho substituents at β-d-GalpNAc moieties within the RU (residue D) can be hydrolyzed. However, mass peak VI (7054.44 Da) is of highest abundance in the preparations after treatment with 160 or 240 μg of Pce/mg of LTA, whereas mass peak VII (6889.39 Da) is only marginally present. Whether this is a specific P-Cho moiety that is not efficiently hydrolyzed (e.g. P-ChoD of the first RU) can only be speculated. The observed masses for all LTA molecules are in agreement with their respective calculated masses and are listed in Table 2. A change in the pH value from pH 7.4 to pH 8.0 improved the efficiency of hydrolysis on P-ChoH for the concentration of 80 μg/mg LTA (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Nonetheless, pH 8.0 shows a hydrolysis behavior with a lower overall efficiency for P-Cho attached to residues D and G. An increase of the Pce concentration from 80 μg/mg LTA to 160 μg/mg LTA at pH 8.0 resulted in no further significant change of the hydrolysis of moieties P-ChoD+G. In summary, our in vitro analysis clearly demonstrates that Pce hydrolyzes only the moieties P-ChoD+G and terminal P-ChoH. P-ChoE and Rib-ol-PC/C′ moieties are not hydrolyzed by Pce.Table 1Integration values from 31P NMR spectra from native LTA of TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce before and after treatment with the indicated amounts of Pce shown in Fig. 2ATIGR4Rib-PĆ/ Rib-PCP-ChoD+GP-ChoHP-ChoEΔcpsΔpce6.776.651.005.67ΔcpsΔpce + 80 μg of Pce/mg of LTA6.774.47 ± 0.140.58 ± 0.035.69 ± 0.06ΔcpsΔpce + 160 μg of Pce/mg of LTA6.772.73 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.015.81 ± 0.01ΔcpsΔpce + 240 μg of Pce/mg of LTA6.772.61 ± 0.070.04 ± 0.045.81 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Table 2Calculated and observed masses as well as the mass accuracy of de-O-acylated pnLTA molecules with 6 RU, considering different numbers of missing P-Cho residues (signals I–VII in Fig. 2B for LTA of TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce treated with 80 μg of Pce/mg of LTA)Signal no.De-O-acyl pnLTA with 6 RUChemical formulaMonoisotopic massAccuracyCalculatedObservedDappm0 P-Cho missingC279H528O194N36P188044.788044.77−1.2I1 P-Cho missingC274H516O191N35P177879.737879.72−1.3II2 P-Cho missingC269H504O188N34P167714.677714.66−1.3III3 P-Cho missingC264H492O185N33P157549.627549.61−1.3IV4 P-Cho missingC259H480O182N32P147384.567384.55−1.4V5 P-Cho missingC254H468O179N31P137219.517219.50−1.4VI6 P-Cho missingC249H456O176N30P127054.457054.44−1.4VII7 P-Cho missingC244H444O173N29P116889.406889.39−1.5 Open table in a new tab Table 3Integration values from 31P NMR spectra from native LTA of TIGR4ΔcpsΔpce before and after treatment with the indicated amounts of Pce at pH 8.0 shown in Fig. 3TIGR4Rib-PC′/ Rib-PCP-ChoD+GP-ChoHP-ChoEΔcpsΔpce6.596.541.005.57ΔcpsΔpce + 80 μg of Pce/mg of LTA6.594.82 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.035.52 ± 0.02ΔcpsΔpce + 160 μg of Pce/mg of LTA6.594.30 ± 0.02ND5.53 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab To study the specificity of the attachment of P-Cho residues by LicD2, we isolated and analyzed LTAs of LicD2-deficient strains.

All NMR data for the hydrazine-treated LTA of TIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD2 are listed in Table 4, and a section of the respective 1H,13C HSQC NMR is shown in Fig. S5, including assignment of signals. In the MS analysis of this de-O-acyl LTA, only the expected masses for pnLTA with one P-Cho residue per RU were observed (Fig. 4B, top). The observed mass for such LTA molecules with 6 RUs is 7054.44 Da (calculated monoisotopic mass: 7054.45 Da; Fig. 4B (top; the complete MS spectrum is shown in Fig. S6) and Table 5), which corresponds to a mass difference of 990 Da compared with the respective LTA molecules with complete P-Cho substitution (calculated monoisotopic mass: 8044.78 Da; Fig. 2B (top panel) and Table 2). This is equivalent to 6 P-Cho residues less in these LTA molecules of strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD2. In the MS analysis of de-O-acyl LTA of strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD2, the above described Pce-mediated hydrolysis of P-Cho residues at the α-d-GalpNAc of the terminus (P-ChoH) is clearly visible (Fig. 4B (middle panel; the complete MS spectrum is shown in Fig. S7) and Table 5). Notably, LTA chains of strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD2 tended to be slightly longer, as observed for TIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD2. 31P NMR analysis of the corresponding PGN-WTA complexes after LytA treatment indicated the same P-Cho substitution pattern for both LicD2-deficient strains (Fig. 5), further strengthening our findings that solely LicD2 is mediating the attachment of P-Cho substituents to β-d-GalpNAc moieties in pnTAs.Table 41H NMR (700.4 MHz), 13C NMR (176.1 MHz) and 31P NMR (283.5 MHz) chemical shift data (δ, ppm) (J, Hz) of hydrazine-treated LTA of S. pneumoniae strain TIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table 5Calculated and observed masses as well as the mass accuracy of de-O-acyl pnLTA isolated from LicD2-deficient strains TIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD2 and TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD2 as well as for LTA of TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD2 treated with PceLTA speciesChemical formulaMonoisotopic massAccuracyStrainRUCalculatedObservedDappmTIGR4ΔcpsΔpceΔlicD24C169H310O120N20P84787.674787.670.05C209H383O148N25P105921.065921.060.06C249H456O176N30P127054.457054.44−1.47C289H529O204N35P148187.848187.83−1.28C329H602O232N40P169322.24aSecond isotopic peak.9322.22aSecond isotopic peak.−2.1TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD25C209H383O148N25P105921.065921.060.0−1 P-ChoC204H371O145N24P95756.005756.000.06C249H456O176N30P127054.457054.450.0−1 P-ChoC244H444O173N29P116889.406889.39−1.57C289H529O204N35P148187.848187.840.0−1 P-ChoC284H517O201N34P138022.798022.78−1.28C329H602O232N40P169321.209321.222.1−1 P-ChoC324H590O229N39P159156.189156.17−1.19C369H675O260N45P1810454.6310454.60−2.9−1 P-ChoC364H663O257N44P1710290.57aSecond isotopic peak.10290.56aSecond isotopic peak.−1.0TIGR4ΔcpsΔlicD2 + 160 μg of Pce/mg of LTA4C164H298O117N19P74622.624622.61−2.25C204H371O145N24P95756.005756.000.06C244H444O173N29P116889.406889.39−1.57C284H517O201N34P138022.798022.78−1.28C324H590O229N39P159156.189156.16−2.29C364H663O257N44P1710289.5710,289.635.8a Second isotopic peak.

https://openalex.org/W2804707664,"Grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 108 transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector Colomerus vitis. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2804382237,"Computational speech segregation attempts to automatically separate speech from noise. This is challenging in conditions with interfering talkers and low signal-to-noise ratios. Recent approaches have adopted deep neural networks and successfully demonstrated speech intelligibility improvements. A selection of components may be responsible for the success with these state-of-the-art approaches: the system architecture, a time frame concatenation technique and the learning objective. The aim of this study was to explore the roles and the relative contributions of these components by measuring speech intelligibility in normal-hearing listeners. A substantial improvement of 25.4 percentage points in speech intelligibility scores was found going from a subband-based architecture, in which a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classifier predicts the distributions of speech and noise for each frequency channel, to a state-of-the-art deep neural network-based architecture. Another improvement of 13.9 percentage points was obtained by changing the learning objective from the ideal binary mask, in which individual time-frequency units are labeled as either speech- or noise-dominated, to the ideal ratio mask, where the units are assigned a continuous value between zero and one. Therefore, both components play significant roles and by combining them, speech intelligibility improvements were obtained in a six-talker condition at a low signal-to-noise ratio."

The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes. Methods The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle<10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI). Results Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5. Modic changes were significantly correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration (r = 0.414, p<0.01); the amount of Modic changes were significantly correlated with LL (r = -0.562, p = 0.012), SS (r = -0.46, p = 0.048), PT (r = 0.516, p = 0.024). Conclusions Most of the Modic changes of vertebral endplates in DTK/LK patients are type II which are prevalently located at L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1.

https://openalex.org/W2803497085,"Splicing factor 3B1 (SF3B1) is a core splicing protein that stabilizes the interaction between the U2 snRNA and the branch point in the mRNA target during splicing. SF3B1 is heavily phosphorylated at its N terminus and a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Although SF3B1 phosphorylation coincides with splicing catalysis, the functional significance of SF3B1 phosphorylation is largely undefined. Here, we show that SF3B1 phosphorylation follows a dynamic pattern during cell cycle progression that depends on CDK activity. SF3B1 is known to interact with chromatin, and we found that SF3B1 maximally interacts with nucleosomes during G1/S and that this interaction requires CDK2 activity. In contrast, SF3B1 disassociates from nucleosomes at G2/M, coinciding with a peak in CDK1-mediated SF3B1 phosphorylation. Thus, CDK1 and CDK2 appear to have opposing roles in regulating SF3B1–nucleosome interactions. Importantly, these interactions were modified by the presence and phosphorylation status of linker histone H1, particularly the H1.4 isoform. Performing genome-wide analysis of SF3B1–chromatin binding in synchronized cells, we observed that SF3B1 preferentially bound exons. Differences in SF3B1 chromatin binding to specific sites, however, did not correlate with changes in RNA splicing, suggesting that the SF3B1–nucleosome interaction does not determine cell cycle–dependent changes to mRNA splicing. Our results define a cell cycle stage–specific interaction between SF3B1 and nucleosomes that is mediated by histone H1 and depends on SF3B1 phosphorylation. Importantly, this interaction does not seem to be related to SF3B1's splicing function and, rather, points toward its potential role as a chromatin modifier.

SF3B1 has long been known to be a substrate protein for cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), although current understanding of the function of CDK-dependent phosphorylation is relatively sparse in light of the number of phosphosites potentially utilized by these kinases (Table 1). Most known CDK sites reside within the N terminus domain of SF3B1 outside the HEAT motif–containing region, whereas relatively few reside in the C-terminal portion. SF3B1 associates with cyclin E, and both CDK1 and CDK2 are known to phosphorylate SF3B1 (19Seghezzi W. Chua K. Shanahan F. Gozani O. Reed R. Lees E.

The presence of phosphorylated SF3B1 in spliceosomes during active splicing is particularly interesting, given evidence suggesting that splicing is coordinated with cell cycle progression and follows a cell cycle stage–specific program (25Dominguez D.

Open table in a new tab In this paper, we report that SF3B1 phosphorylation is dynamic during cell cycle progression and dependent on CDK activity. The cell cycle–dependent phosphorylation of SF3B1 differentially regulates its interaction with nucleosomes during G1/S and G2/M, with CDK2 and CDK1 playing opposing roles in regulating the interaction. Data from in vitro binding studies demonstrated that the interaction between SF3B1 and mononucleosomes depends on the presence and phosphorylation status of linker histone H1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq of synchronized cells, we mapped regions of the genome of cell cycle stage–specific occupancy of SF3B1 within genes and determined the extent to which these correlated with changes in splicing. Our findings in toto provide new insights into the role of phosphorylation of SF3B1 by CDKs and suggest that splicing-independent functions may be regulated by cell cycle–dependent SF3B1–chromatin binding. SF3B1 contains numerous serine or threonine residues juxtaposed to a proline at the +1 position, representing potential sites for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases, including cyclin-CDKs, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Although several MS studies have demonstrated SF3B1 phosphorylation sites clustering within the N-terminal domain of the protein (Table 1), the functional significance of SF3B1 phosphorylation is largely undefined. SF3B1 phosphorylation is coupled with splicing catalysis (23Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Phosphorylation of spliceosomal protein SAP 155 coupled with splicing catalysis.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9585501): 1409-141410.1101/gad.12.10.1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); specifically, phosphorylation of threonine 313, a cyclin E-CDK2 substrate, is associated with active splicing (24Girard C. Will C.L. Peng J. Makarov E.M. Kastner B. Lemm I. Urlaub H. Hartmuth K. Lührmann R. Post-transcriptional spliceosomes are retained in nuclear speckles until splicing completion.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3 (22871813): 99410.1038/ncomms1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cyclin E-CDK2–mediated phosphorylation of SF3B1 at threonines 244, 248, and 313 has been shown to mediate interaction with NIPP1, a protein phosphatase that localizes within the nucleus (20Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the splicing factors SAP155 and NIPP1.J. Biol.

To understand first whether SF3B1 phosphorylation changes during cell cycle progression, we used mitotic arrest to synchronize two human cell lines, HeLa and K562, and measured SF3B1 expression and serine/threonine phosphorylation (using anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-proline (pSer/Thr-Pro) and anti-phosphothreonine 313 (pSF3B1) (24Girard C. Will C.L. Peng J. Makarov E.M. Kastner B. Lemm I. Urlaub H. Hartmuth K. Lührmann R. Post-transcriptional spliceosomes are retained in nuclear speckles until splicing completion.Nat.

We found a highly dynamic pattern of SF3B1 phosphorylation through cell cycle progression, wherein SF3B1 is phosphorylated at low levels in G1, declining further at G1/S, but is highly phosphorylated at G2/M (Fig. 1, A and B). Based on previous MS data that demonstrated CDK-mediated phosphorylation of SF3B1, we hypothesized that the increased phosphorylation of SF3B1 in G2/M depended on CDK1 activity. We further hypothesized that the subsequent decrease in SF3B1 phosphorylation following mitotic exit was mediated by phosphatases active during reentry into G1. To test these hypotheses, we first treated HeLa and K562 cells arrested in G2/M with purvalanol A, a specific CDK1 (CDC2) inhibitor (28Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.M. Norman T.C. Kwon S.

Brief pharmacologic inhibition of CDK1 (at 0.5 and 4 h) completely blocked detectable SF3B1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, C and D). Inhibition of phosphatase activity in G1/S cells using okadaic acid (OA) treatment that inhibits both PP2A and PP1 phosphatases (30Bialojan C. Takai A. Inhibitory effect of a marine-sponge toxin, okadaic acid, on protein phosphatases: specificity and kinetics.Biochem.

Together, these results demonstrate that SF3B1 phosphorylation is dynamic during cell cycle progression, peaking at G2/M in a CDK-dependent manner and then decreasing due to phosphatase activity as cells progress through G1/S. Work by several groups has demonstrated that SF3B1 interacts with chromatin or chromatin-associated proteins (13Isono K. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Komori T. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Koseki H. Mammalian polycomb-mediated repression of Hox genes requires the essential spliceosomal protein Sf3b1.Genes Dev. 2005; 19 (15741318): 536-54110.1101/gad.1284605Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Cavellán E.

Datta A. Sze S.K. Meshorer E. Ast G. SF3B1 association with chromatin determines splicing outcomes.Cell Rep. 2015; 11 (25892229): 618-62910.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed that SF3B1 associates with mononucleosomes near exons and positively influences splicing of these occupied exons. Moreover, splicing is known to be coordinated with cell cycle progression, such that the expression and splicing of specific transcripts are regulated in a stage-specific manner (25Dominguez D. Tsai Y.H. Weatheritt R. Wang Y. Blencowe B.J. Wang Z. An extensive program of periodic alternative splicing linked to cell cycle progression.eLife. 2016; 5 (27015110)e1028810.7554/eLife.10288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In light of these data and our finding of dynamic phosphorylation of SF3B1, we hypothesized that changes to phosphorylation of SF3B1 during cell cycle progression influence its association with nucleosomes. To test this, we first prepared whole-cell lysates and mononucleosome-enriched fractions from mitotically arrested and synchronized HeLa and K562 cells. Mononucleosome fractions containing nuclear proteins and chromatin were prepared by isolating nuclei and digesting them with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), such that the resulting DNA fragments were ∼150 bp in size (length of DNA wrapped around a single nucleosome is 147 bp) (Fig. 2A, inset). We compared SF3B1 protein abundance in nucleosome-enriched versus whole cell lysates of synchronized cells. In nucleosome-enriched lysates, SF3B1 levels are significantly reduced in G2/M, when SF3B1 phosphorylation peaks (Fig. 1), and increased in G1 and G1/S. However, SF3B1 protein abundance remained unchanged between G1, G1/S, and G2/M in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2, A and B), supporting our hypothesis that cell cycle–dependent phosphorylation influences SF3B1 association with nucleosomes. Next, we asked whether the change in chromatin association was specific to SF3B1 or if other spliceosome proteins also exhibit cell cycle–dependent chromatin association. We hence determined the total abundance and nucleosome association of SF3B2, a component of the U2 snRNP (similar to SF3B1), and also of U1–70K (or snRNP70), a subunit of a distinct snRNP (U1). Both SF3B2 and U1–70K followed the same cell cycle–dependent chromatin association as SF3B1 (Fig. 2C). Next, to confirm that this cell cycle–related change in splicing factor abundance within chromatin-enriched lysates was directly linked to a change in interaction with nucleosomes, we examined the association of SF3B1, SF3B2, and U1–70K with the core nucleosome protein, histone H3, in synchronized cells. As expected, SF3B1, SF3B2, and U1–70K did not associate with histone H3 in G2/M cells but showed increased histone association in G1/S (Fig. 2, D and E). Treatment of G1/S HeLa cells with OA resulted in decreased SF3B1–nucleosome interaction (Fig. 2F). Because OA treatment did not alter cell cycle distribution (not shown), this result suggests that the dynamics of SF3B1 phosphorylation and not merely the progression of cells through G1/S regulate SF3B1–nucleosome interactions. Splicing is a co-transcriptional process; hence, it is possible that the observed cell cycle–dependent interaction between spliceosome proteins and chromatin are dependent on nascent, transcribed RNA or snRNA within the spliceosome. To address this, we tested the effect of RNase on the interaction of the spliceosome proteins with histone H3 and chromatin. Whereas RNase-A treatment significantly diminished the interaction between histone H3 and SF3B2 and U1–70K in G1/S phase, the SF3B1 interaction with nucleosomes remained intact, consistent with an RNA-independent mode of association during G1/S (Fig. 2G), consistent with previous reports (18Kfir N. Lev-Maor G. Glaich O. Alajem A. Datta A. Sze S.K. Meshorer E. Ast G. SF3B1 association with chromatin determines splicing outcomes.Cell Rep. 2015; 11 (25892229): 618-62910.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data demonstrate that SF3B1 interactions with nucleosomes are dynamic during cell cycle progression. SF3B1 interacts with nucleosomes during G1 and G1/S stages, where it demonstrates lower level phosphorylation, whereas its interaction with nucleosomes is greatly diminished during G2/M when CDK1 activity peaks, suggesting that SF3B1 phosphorylation during G2/M directly contributes to its dissociation from nucleosomes. Importantly, unlike other spliceosomal proteins we tested (both U2 snRNP components and non-U2 components), this cell cycle-dependent interaction of SF3B1 with histone is RNA-independent and hence probably not solely due to transcription. We next hypothesized that dynamic SF3B1–nucleosome interactions are dependent on CDK-dependent phosphorylation. We tested this hypothesis by pharmacologic inhibition of CDK1 activity in G2/M and of CDK2 activity in G1/S. Treatment of G2/M cells with purval"

Features of directional antennas and the visual data make WVSNs more complex than the conventional Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The virtual backbone is a technique, which is capable of constructing clusters. The version associating with the aggregation operation is also referred to as the virtual backbone tree. In most of the existing literature, the main focus is on the efficiency brought by the construction of clusters that the existing methods neglect local-balance problems in general. To fill up this gap, Directional Virtual Backbone based Data Aggregation Scheme (DVBDAS) for the WVSNs is proposed in this paper. In addition, a measurement called the energy consumption density is proposed for evaluating the adequacy of results in the cluster-based construction problems. Moreover, the directional virtual backbone construction scheme is proposed by considering the local-balanced factor. Furthermore, the associated network coding mechanism is utilized to construct DVBDAS. Finally, both the theoretical analysis of the proposed DVBDAS and the simulations are given for evaluating the performance. The experimental results prove that the proposed DVBDAS achieves higher performance in terms of both the energy preservation and the network lifetime extension than the existing methods."

The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher HFnu values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (AUC = 0.92 ± 0.01; Se = 0.91 ± 0.06; Sp = 0.90 ± 0.05). Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome."

To discover additional PPARα activators as potential compounds for use in hypolipidemic drugs, here we established human hepatoblastoma cell lines with luciferase reporter expression from the promoters containing peroxisome proliferator–responsive elements (PPREs) and tetracycline-regulated expression of full-length human PPARα to quantify the effects of chemical ligands on PPARα activity. Using the established cell-based PPARα-activator screening system to screen a library of >12,000 chemical compounds, we identified several hit compounds with basic chemical skeletons different from those of known PPARα agonists. One of the hit compounds, a 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid derivative we termed compound 3, selectively up-regulated PPARα transcriptional activity, leading to PPARα target gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. Of note, the half-maximal effective concentrations of the hit compounds were lower than that of the known PPARα ligand fenofibrate. Finally, fenofibrate or compound 3 treatment of high fructose–fed rats having elevated plasma triglyceride levels for 14 days indicated that compound 3 reduces plasma triglyceride levels with similar efficiency as fenofibrate. These observations raise the possibility that 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid derivatives might be effective drug candidates for selective targeting of PPARα to manage dyslipidemia.

https://openalex.org/W2804219790,"Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0-150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent."

The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2803435392,"Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is a highly adaptive species and has been used as a research model for comparative immunology, physiology, and toxicology among ectothermic vertebrates. It is also economically important for aquaculture. As such, its reference genome was generated and annotated with protein coding genes. However, the repetitive elements in the catfish genome are less well understood. In this study, over 417.8 Megabase (MB) of repetitive elements were identified and characterized in the channel catfish genome. Among them, the DNA/TcMar-Tc1 transposons are the most abundant type, making up ~20% of the total repetitive elements, followed by the microsatellites (14%). The prevalence of repetitive elements, especially the mobile elements, may have provided a driving force for the evolution of the catfish genome. A number of catfish-specific repetitive elements were identified including the previously reported Xba elements whose divergence rate was relatively low, slower than that in untranslated regions of genes but faster than the protein coding sequences, suggesting its evolutionary restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W2804901240,"Two-pore domain K+ channels (K2P) are responsible for background K+ currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K+ channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K2P channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel (TRESK) is different from the other K2P channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2nd and 3rd transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region. Ba2+ was applied to the intracellular side of excised membrane patches and the characteristics of the channel block were determined. We compared the kinetics of the development of Ba2+ block when the channels were phosphorylated (inhibited) or dephosphorylated (activated) and also in different mutants mimicking the two functional states. Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba2+ block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK."
https://openalex.org/W2803122722,"Background Both amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and schizophrenia, in particular deficit schizophrenia, are accompanied by cognitive impairments. The aim of the present study was to examine the cognitive differences between aMCI and (non)deficit schizophrenia. Methods Towards this end we recruited 60 participants with aMCI, 40 with deficit and 40 with nondeficit schizophrenia and 103 normal volunteers. Cognitive measures were assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) using the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word list memory (WLM), Word list recall (WLRecall) and Word list recognition (WLRecognition). Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses and machine learning techniques. Results BNT scores were significantly lower in aMCI as compared with nondeficit schizophrenia. Patients with deficit schizophrenia had significantly lower MMSE, WLM, WL True Recall and WL Recognition than aMCI patients, while WL False Recall was significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia than in aMCI. Neural network importance charts show that deficit and nondeficit schizophrenia are best separated from aMCI using total BNT score, while WLM and WL false Recall follow at a distance. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia and aMCI have a significantly different neurocognitive profile. Memory impairments, especially in episodic memory, are significantly worse in younger patients with deficit schizophrenia as compared with elderly patients with aMCI, while the latter show more dysnomia than patients with schizophrenia."

The significance of its additional ability to dehalogenate bromo- and chlorotyrosine is less apparent, and none of these functions could have been anticipated in invertebrates until recently. Drosophila, as most arthropods, contains a deiodinase homolog encoded by CG6279, now named condet (cdt), with a similar catalytic specificity. However, its physiological role cannot be equivalent because Drosophila lacks a thyroid and its associated hormones, and no requirement for iodide or halotyrosines has been reported for this species. We have now applied CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate Drosophila strains in which the cdt gene has been either deleted or mutated to identify its biological function. As previously shown in larvae, expression of cdt is primarily limited to the fat body, and we now report that loss of cdt function does not enhance sensitivity of the larvae to the toxic effects of iodotyrosine. In adult flies by contrast, expression is known to occur in testes and is detected at very high levels in this tissue. The importance of cdt is most evident in the decrease in fertility observed when either males or females carry a deletion or mutation of cdt. Therefore, dehalogenation of a halotyrosine appears essential for efficient reproduction in Drosophila and likely contributes to a new pathway for controlling viability in arthropods.

https://openalex.org/W2803896559,"Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the dy2J/dy2J mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and dy2J/dy2J mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of dy2J/dy2J mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in dy2J/dy2J mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in dy2J/dy2J mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in dy2J/dy2J mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly. Our study presents a complete natural history dataset which can be used in setting up standardized studies in dy2J/dy2J mice."

The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in Cldn5 and Pecam1 as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. Plvap proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples. This study may contribute to the building blocks toward overarching research needs on the blood-brain barrier."

https://openalex.org/W2803668263,"Background 
There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (MTR) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.


Procedure 
We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in MTR. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.


Results 
Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and initial white blood cell count < 50 x 109/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.


Discussion 
Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the in utero origins of ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2803925793,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely used non-invasive brain stimulation technique by applying low-frequency weak direct current via electrodes attached on the head. The tDCS using a fixed current between 1 and 2 mA has relied on computational modelings to achieve optimal stimulation effects. Recently, by measuring the tDCS current induced magnetic field using an MRI scanner, the internal current pathway has been successfully recovered. However, up to now, there is no technique to visualize electrical properties including the electrical anisotropic conductivity, effective extracellular ion-concentration, and electric field using only the tDCS current in-vivo. By measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the magnetic flux density induced by the tDCS, we propose a method to visualize the electrical properties. We reconstruct the scale parameter, which connects the anisotropic conductivity tensor to the diffusion tensor of water molecules, by introducing a repetitive scheme called the diffusion tensor J-substitution algorithm using the recovered current density and the measured ADCs. We investigate the proposed method to explain why the iterative scheme converges to the internal conductivity. We verified the proposed method with an anesthetized canine brain to visualize electrical properties including the electrical properties by tDCS current."
https://openalex.org/W2804401370,"Ellipse fitting is a highly researched and mature topic. Surprisingly, however, no existing method has thus far considered the data point eccentricity in its ellipse fitting procedure. Here, we introduce the concept of eccentricity of a data point, in analogy with the idea of ellipse eccentricity. We then show empirically that, irrespective of ellipse fitting method used, the root mean square error (RMSE) of a fit increases with the eccentricity of the data point set. The main contribution of the paper is based on the hypothesis that if the data point set were pre-processed to strategically add additional data points in regions of high eccentricity, then the quality of a fit could be improved. Conditional validity of this hypothesis is demonstrated mathematically using a model scenario. Based on this confirmation we propose an algorithm that pre-processes the data so that data points with high eccentricity are replicated. The improvement of ellipse fitting is then demonstrated empirically in real-world application of 3D reconstruction of a plant root system for phenotypic analysis. The degree of improvement for different underlying ellipse fitting methods as a function of data noise level is also analysed. We show that almost every method tested, irrespective of whether it minimizes algebraic error or geometric error, shows improvement in the fit following data augmentation using the proposed pre-processing algorithm."

This study investigated the function of Shh at the late-gestational stage; during which, the esophagus continues to differentiate.

Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining, with antibodies against keratin 14, Shh, patched 1 (Ptch1), Gli1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), high-molecular-weight caldesmon (hCD), myogenin, paired box 7 (Pax7), β3-tubulin, and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), was performed to detect specific tissue dysplasia. Organ culture was conducted in vitro, and total mRNA was extracted to determine the transcriptional dysregulation. The esophagus of CK14-Cre;Shhfl/fl mice developed into an independent tube with an obvious dilatation at postnatal d 0.5. The number of cell layers and the expression of PCNA were decreased in mutant mice, compared with those in wild-type mice. The expression of hCD declined progressively in the middle, distal, and lower esophageal sphincter levels of the mutant esophagus from embryonic d 17.5, compared with the expression in wild-type littermates. Pax7 accumulation and myogenin reduction in mutant mice indicated that esophageal skeletal-myoblast progression was blocked. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant down-regulation of genes involved in proliferation and muscular motivation in CK14-Cre;Shhfl/fl mice. Thus, loss of Shh at the late-gestational stage leads to megaesophagus with reduced proliferation and a muscle development disorder in mice.-Jia, X., Min, L., Zhu, S., Zhang, S., Huang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2803451494,"The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein Gi in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G13 activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G13 and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G13 might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G13 and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα13 (Gα13QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα13QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα13QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα13QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care."
https://openalex.org/W2804183897,"Silicon-diode-based detectors are commonly used for the dosimetry of small radiotherapy beams due to their relatively small volumes and high sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, silicon-diode-based detectors tend to over-respond in small fields because of their high density relative to water. For that reason, detector-specific beam correction factors ([Formula: see text]) have been recommended not only to correct the total scatter factors but also to correct the tissue maximum and off-axis ratios. However, the application of [Formula: see text] to in-depth and off-axis locations has not been studied. The goal of this work is to address the impact of the correction factors on the calculated dose distribution in static non-conventional photon beams (specifically, in stereotactic radiosurgery with circular collimators). To achieve this goal, the total scatter factors, tissue maximum, and off-axis ratios were measured with a stereotactic field diode for 4.0-, 10.0-, and 20.0-mm circular collimators. The irradiation was performed with a Novalis® linear accelerator using a 6-MV photon beam. The detector-specific correction factors were calculated and applied to the experimental dosimetry data for in-depth and off-axis locations. The corrected and uncorrected dosimetry data were used to commission a treatment planning system for radiosurgery planning. Various plans were calculated with simulated lesions using the uncorrected and corrected dosimetry. The resulting dose calculations were compared using the gamma index test with several criteria. The results of this work presented important conclusions for the use of detector-specific beam correction factors ([Formula: see text] in a treatment planning system. The use of [Formula: see text] for total scatter factors has an important impact on monitor unit calculation. On the contrary, the use of [Formula: see text] for tissue-maximum and off-axis ratios has not an important impact on the dose distribution calculation by the treatment planning system. This conclusion is only valid for the combination of treatment planning system, detector, and correction factors used in this work; however, this technique can be applied to other treatment planning systems, detectors, and correction factors."
https://openalex.org/W2803248406,"In 2015, several provinces in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children."
https://openalex.org/W2804761204,"REEs in the environment can be absorbed by plants and sequestered by plant phytoliths. Acid rain can directly or indirectly affect plant physiological functions. Currently, the effects of REEs and acid rain on phytolith-REEs complex in plants are not yet fully understood. In this study, a high-silicon accumulation crop, rice (Oryza sativa L.), was selected as a representative of plants, and orthogonal experiments were conducted under various levels of lanthanum [La(III)] and pH. The results showed that various La(III) concentrations could significantly improve the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III) in germinated rice seeds. A pH of 4.5 promoted phytolith La(III) sequestration, while a pH of 3.5 inhibited sequestration. Compared with the single treatment with La(III), the combination of La(III) and acid rain inhibited the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III). Correlation analysis showed that the efficiency of phytolith La(III) sequestration had no correlation with the production of phytolith but was closely correlated with the sequestration of phytolith La(III) and the physiological changes of germinated rice seeds. Phytolith morphology was an important factor affecting phytolith La(III) sequestration in germinated rice seeds, and the effect of tubes on sequestration was more significant than that of dumbbells. This study demonstrated that the formation of the phytolith and La(III) complex could be affected by exogenous La(III) and acid rain in germinated rice seeds."
