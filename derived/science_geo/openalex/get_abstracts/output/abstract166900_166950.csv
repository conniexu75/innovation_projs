We have previously shown that a mutation in mev-1 causes shortened life span and rapid accumulation of aging markers such as fluorescent materials and protein carbonyls in an oxygen-dependent fashion. However, it remains unclear as to whether this hypersensitivity is caused by direct toxicity of the exogenous oxygen or by the damage of endogenous reactive oxygen species derived from mitochondria. Here we report important biochemical changes in mev-1 animals that serve to explain their abnormalities under normoxic conditions: (i) an overproduction of superoxide anion from mitochondria; and (ii) a reciprocal reduction in glutathione content even under atmospheric oxygen. In addition, unlike wild type, the levels of superoxide anion production from mev-1 mitochondria were significantly elevated under hyperoxia. Under normal circumstances, it is well known that superoxide anion is produced at complexes I and III in the electron transport system. Our data suggest that the mev-1(kn1) mutation increases superoxide anion production at complex II itself rather than at complexes I and III. The mev-1 mutant also had a lactate level 2-fold higher than wild type, indicative of lactic acidosis, a hallmark of human mitochondrial diseases. These data indicate that Cyt-1/ceSDHC plays an important role not only in energy metabolism but also in superoxide anion production that is critically involved in sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen.

Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). During this process, electrons are transferred ultimately to oxygen after their passage through four membrane-bound complexes. Electrons enter the electron transport system through either complex I (NADH-CoQ1 oxidoreductase) or complex II (succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase). Via two, single-electron reductions, they are transferred to CoQ (coenzyme Q or ubiquinone), thereby reducing CoQ first to ubisemiquinone and then to ubiquinol (dihydroubiquinone). At complex III (CoQH2-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) molecules of ubiquinol undergo two sequential and spatially separate one-electron oxidations, a process called Q cycle. These reducing equivalents are then transferred to the remainder of the electron transport chain: cytochrome c, complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and finally to oxygen. Mitochondrial deficiencies cause a variety of diseases, including human congenital neurodegenerative diseases like MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), KSS (Kearns-Sayre syndrome), CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa), MILS (maternally inherited Leigh syndrome), and LHON (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) (2Wallace D.C.

Many of the ultimate manifestations of these diseases are triggered by a metabolic imbalance known as lactic acidosis, which is characterized by a high lactate/pyruvate ratio and is a characteristic feature of a variety of other metabolic disorders in addition to mitochondrial diseases. In contrast to the well defined pathologies resulting from complex I, III, and IV deficiencies, the effects of complex II defects in humans are not as completely understood (5Bourgeois M.

A complex II deficiency has been described that is associated with a mitochondrial disease called Leigh syndrome and resulted in metabolic changes leading to lactic acidosis (5Bourgeois M. Goutieres F. Chretien D. Rustin P. Munnich A. Aicardi J. Brain Dev. 1992; 14: 404-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Bourgeron T. Rustin P. Chretien D. Birch-Machin M. Bourgeois M. Viegas-Pequignot E. Munnich A. Rotig A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Another mutation in the flavoprotein subunit of complex II has recently been shown to cause late onset optic atrophy, ataxia, and myopathy (10Taylor R.W. Birch-Machin M.A. Schaefer J. Taylor L. Shakir R. Ackrell B.A. Cochran B. Bindoff L.A. Jackson M.J. Griffiths P. Turnbull D.M. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Birch-Machin M.A. Taylor R.W. Cochran B. Ackrell B.A. Turnbull D.M. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, individuals with an inherited propensity for vascularized head and neck tumors (i.e. paragangliomas) have been recently demonstrated to contain one of several mutations in the small and large subunits of cytochrome b in succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (14Baysal B.E. Ferrell R.E. Willett-Brozick J.E. Lawrence E.C. Myssiorek D. Bosch A. van der Mey A. Taschner P.E.M. Rubinstein W.S. Myers E.N. Richard C.W. Devilee P. Devlin B.

In addition to its role in electron transport, the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) moiety of complex II plays an essential role in the trichloroacetic acid cycle, catalyzing the conversion of succinate to fumarate. Complex II is composed of four subunits, named SDHA through SDHD in Escherichia coli or human and SDH1 through SDH4 in yeast. SDHA/SDH1 is a flavoprotein subunit, and SDHB/SDH2 is an iron-sulfur protein subunit. Two other hydrophobic membrane-anchored subunits (consisting of large and small subunits of cytochrome b) are named SDHC/SDH3/CybL and SDHD/SDH4/CybS. We will refer to the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs as Cyt-1/ceSDHC through ceSDHD. The electron transport system is also the major endogenous source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH). The ROS produced during aerobic respiration cause cumulative oxidative damage that results in aging and age-related degenerative diseases (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). It is known that oxygen is initially converted to superoxide anion by complexes I and III (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Conversely, there is no evidence that complex II is a site of superoxide anion production. We have previously described a mev-1(kn1) mutant of the nematode C. elegans that has a missense mutation in Cyt-1/ceSDHC in mitochondrial complex II (19Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The mutant, isolated by screening for hypersensitivity to oxygen, ages precociously (19Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 20Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tomita S. Keino T. Honda S. Koshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We have also reported that the mev-1 mutant accumulates markers of aging (e.g. fluorescent materials and protein carbonyls) more rapidly than wild type (21Honda S. Ishii N. Suzuki K. Matsuo M. J. Gerontol. 1993; 48: B57-B61Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Hosokawa H. Ishii N. Ishida H. Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Suzuki K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 74: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Adachi H. Fujiwara Y. Ishii N. J. Gerontol. 1998; 53A: B240-B244Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) at high oxygen concentrations. In addition, the mev-1 mutant has much lower succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity than wild type (19Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, the reason the mev-1 mutant is hypersensitive to hyperoxia as well as the role of Cyt-1/ceSDHC was completely unclear. We now demonstrate that mev-1 animals manifest a series of biochemical defects that serve to explain their oxygen-hypersensitive cellular and organismal mutant phenotypes. In addition, the data also suggest that, contrary to the current sentiment in the scientific literature, significant amounts of superoxide anion may be produced at complex II. To prepare stage-synchronized animals of either wild type (N2: Bristol strain) or mev-1(kn1), isolated embryos were cultured on nematode growth medium (NGM) at 20 °C under atmospheric (21%) or hyperoxic (40%) conditions. Young adult animals were harvested 72 h later by centrifugation and were homogenized (10% w/v) in isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mmsucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with a Teflon homogenizer. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation (24Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Submitochondrial particles (SMP) were obtained by sonicating freeze-thawed mitochondria twice for 20 s with 1-min intervals in a model U200S sonicator (IKA Labortechnik). SMP were washed twice and suspended in isolation buffer. The activities of complex I plus III (NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) and complex II plus III (succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) in mitochondria isolated from wild-type and mev-1 young adult animals were measured as described (24Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide anion generation was measured using the chemiluminescent probe MCLA (cypridina luciferin analog, 2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-α]pyrazin-3-one). Forty micrograms of either intact mitochondria or SMP were added to 1 ml of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA) containing 0.5 mm MCLA. For the measurement of superoxide anion generation from mitochondria with substrate and inhibitor, 1.5 mm succinate as a complex II substrate was added in the mitochondrial solution, and 100 μm antimycin A as a complex III inhibitor was added after addition of the mitochondria and succinate. The solution was placed into the photon counter with a H-R550 photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photogenic Co. Ltd.) and measured at 37 °C. The rates of superoxide anion production were expressed as counts per second. The amount of superoxide anion production was calculated by subtracting the optical density of samples in the presence of 10 μg/ml bovine Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from that in the absence of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase. The levels of total thiol groups (total SH) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in whole lysates from wild-type and mev-1 young adult animals were measured by the rate of formation of 5,5′-dithio-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described (25Anderson A.E. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 317-323Google Scholar). Young adult animals were cultured under atmospheric (21%) or hyperoxic (50%) conditions for 16 h, and whole lysates were prepared as described below. Animal lysates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were suspended in an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid and homogenized with ultra-Turrax T8 (IKA Labortechnik) on ice and then sonicated with a Sonifier 450 (Branson). The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatants then were neutralized with 4n KOH and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Lactate and pyruvate were measured using Sigma diagnostic kits. Citrate, succinate, and glutamate were measured with an enzymatic bioanalysis/food analysis kit (Roche Diagnostics). ATP was measured using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II (Roche Diagnostics). We first measured the activities of complex I and complex II in wild-type and mev-1 genetic backgrounds to directly confirm the genetic evidence that the mev-1 mutant is normal for NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex I plus III) activity but has a severely reduced succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II plus III) activity (Table I). The activity of succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase (complex II) in mev-1 mutant mitochondria was also markedly lower than that in wild type (data not shown). By extension, these data suggest that the various biochemical manifestations of the mev-1 mutation derive from a defect in the electron transfer between complex II and complex III. Because Northern and Western blots revealed roughly equal mRNA and protein levels of Cyt-1/ceSDHC in wild-type and mutant animals (data not shown), the mev-1 mutation most likely compromises enzyme activity per se as opposed to affecting complex assembly.Table IActivities of NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase in wild-type and mev-1 animals under atmospheric oxygenStrainNADH-cytochrome coxidoreductaseSuccinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductasenmol min−1 mg−1Wild type312.8 ± 84.140.2 ± 24.6mev-1306.6 ± 86.65.0 ± 1.8ap < 0.05 for wild type as compared with mev-1 mutants by paired Student’s t test.Each value reported is the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments.a p < 0.05 for wild type as compared with mev-1 mutants by paired Student’s t test. Open table in a new tab Each value reported is the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. The specific mechanism by which a complex II deficiency causes hypersensitivity to exogenous oxygen in mev-1 mutants has not been directly addressed. There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that complex II contributes directly to ROS production. Indeed, it is currently thought that the majority of ROS are produced in mitochondria at complex III (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of the mev-1 mutation on mitochondrial ROS production, we examined mitochondria from mev-1 and wild-type animals cultured under atmospheric and hyperoxic conditions. The levels of superoxide anion production were found to be approximately 2-fold higher in intact mitochondria and SMP from mev-1 animals as compared with wild type under atmospheric oxygen (Fig. 1). SMP were employed because they are known to be depleted in the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) that transforms superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide. As a next step, we examined the effect of hyperoxia on superoxide anion production from intact mitochondria (Fig.2). The level of superoxide anion production from intact mev-1 mitochondria (without stimulation by exogenous succinate and antimycin A) was higher than in wild type and was significantly increased under hyperoxia (40% O2). Specifically, it was ∼3.4-fold higher than the wild type under 40% O2 and ∼1.6-fold higher than mev-1 under 21% O2. On the other hand, superoxide anion production from the wild-type mitochondria was relatively independent of oxygen concentration. These results suggest that the mutation in this complex II-encoding gene causes cell damage and precocious aging by the endogenous generation of ROS in mitochondria rather than by the direct toxicity of exogenous oxygen. We further examined superoxide anion production as it is influenced by succinate, a complex II substrate, and antimycin A, a Q cycle (complex III) inhibitor (Fig. 2). Both succinate and antimycin A stimulated superoxide anion production. The proportional increase of the succinate stimulation was approximately the same for wild-type and mev-1 mutants, although the absolute levels were significantly higher in mev-1 mutants. In addition, inclusion of antimycin A to succinate-stimulated mitochondria increased superoxide anion production much more in wild-type than in mev-1 mutants, particularly under hyperoxia. We also measured total cellular levels of GSH. GSH can either act directly as an antioxidant or as a substrate for the ROS detoxifying enzyme glutathione peroxidase making it an important defense against ROS (26Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Schultz J.B. Lindenau J. Seyfreid J. Dichgans J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4904-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Only 10–15% of the total cellular GSH is normally found inside the mitochondrial matrix (26Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An age-associated increase in superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide generation by mitochondria and an age-related decline in GSH content are observed in senescent organisms including both mammals and insects (27Schultz J.B. Lindenau J. Seyfreid J. Dichgans J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4904-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 28Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar). Elevated mitochondrial ROS could act as a sink to eventually reduce or deplete total cellular GSH levels, ultimately rendering the entire cell more susceptible to the effects of mitochondrially generated ROS. This in turn could lead to the dual phenotypes of oxygen-hypersensitive precocious aging that are the hallmark phenotypes of mev-1 mutants. Indeed, total cellular GSH levels were decreased ∼30% in mev-1 mutants when compared with wild type (Fig. 3). Because a thiol group constitutes the reactive moiety of GSH, we also confirmed that total thiol content in mev-1 mutants was experimentally identical to wild-type levels (Fig. 3). Thus, it is likely that the Cyt-1/ceSDHC deficiency leads to an overproduction of mitochondrial ROS, which in turn reduces GSH levels in both cytosol and mitochondria. In concert these biochemical abnormalities render mev-1 animals hypersensitive to hyperoxia. Alternatively, the reduced GSH levels in mev-1 extracts may have resulted from some unknown metabolic changes in mev-1 mutants versus wild type. A stoichiometric comparison of superoxide anion and GSH concentrations would distinguish these alternatives. Such an analysis was not attempted because GSH and the superoxide anion were assayed using different protocols that employed whole lysates in one case and isolated mitochondria in another. However, a variety of data suggest that GSH levels vary in direct response to superoxide anion scavenging rather than to metabolic suppression (26Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the complex II deficiency by the Cyt-1/ceSDHC mutation in mev-1 mutants might impede flow through the trichloroacetic acid cycle and alter the lactate/pyruvate ratio, resulting in lactic acidosis. Indeed, although pyruvate concentrations were not significantly different in wild type and mev-1 mutants, there was over twice as much lactate in mev-1 animals, i.e. the lactate/pyruvate ratio in mev-1 mutants was ∼1.6-fold higher than that in wild type (Fig. 4 A and TableII). Both citrate and succinate levels were normal in mev-1 animals; however, glutamate was present in reduced amounts in mev-1 animals at statistically significant levels (Fig. 4 B). The decrease in glutamate suggests that the trichloroacetic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, a precursor of glutamate, is reduced in its content. On the other hand, in the patient with complex II and SDH defects, urine levels of both succinate and α-ketoglutarate were significantly increased (5Bourgeois M. Goutieres F. Chretien D. Rustin P. Munnich A. Aicardi J. Brain Dev. 1992; 14: 404-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An SDH defect may result in a block in the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with accumulation of succinate. Given the elevated lactate levels in mev-1 mutants, this finding suggests that the flow of pyruvate into the trichloroacetic acid cycle may be reduced. It is possible that these metabolic defects contribute to the mev-1 phenotypes.Table IIThe lactate to pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) in wild-type and mev-1 mutants under either atmospheric oxygen (21%) or hyperoxia (50%)StrainOxygen concentrationsLactatePyruvateL/P ratio%mmol liter−1Wild type211.28 ± 0.440.040 ± 0.02235.7 ± 16.8501.37 ± 0.370.046 ± 0.02131.7 ± 5.9mev-1212.97 ± 0.16ap < 0.005 for mev-1 mutants under 21% O2 as compared with wild type under 21% O2.0.056 ± 0.02258.0 ± 20.9503.17 ± 0.06bp < 0.005 for mev-1 mutants under 50% O2 as compared with wild type under 21% O2.cp < 0.005 for mev-1 mutants under 50% O2 as compared with wild type under 50% O2.0.049 ± 0.02575.7 ± 32.6Data are derived from Fig. 3.

Given the complex II deficiency in mev-1 animals and its various biochemical consequences, it was surprising that ATP levels were experimentally identical in wild type and mev-1 mutants under atmospheric oxygen (Fig. 4 C). Even under 50% oxygen the slight reduction in ATP was not statistically significant (Fig.4 C). It seems likely that mev-1 animals rely more heavily on glycolysis for energy acquisition, thus explaining the elevated lactate levels (Fig. 4 A). However, it is also possible that ATP consumption is decreased in mev-1 because of some sort of global decrease in the metabolic rate that acts to counterbalance the compromised ATP generation in mev-1animals. Mitochondria are widely accepted as the major intracellular site of ROS production because of the inappropriate single-electron reduction of diatomic oxygen to superoxide anion (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Because once generated ROS react indiscriminately with a wide variety of cellular constituents, they figure prominently in theories seeking to explain the etiology of aging and neurodegenerative diseases (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 18Raha S.

Work with the mev-1(kn1) mutation of the nematode C. elegansmay prove useful in this regard. As articulated in the Introduction,mev-1 mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and age precociously (19Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S.

Gerontol. 1998; 53A: B240-B244Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to a missense mutation in the gene encoding Cyt-1/ceSDH3, a large subunit of cytochrome b, that compromises complex II activity (19Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that superoxide anion production is significantly higher in mev-1 animals, particularly under hyperoxia (Figs.1 and 2). Along with the reduced GSH levels we have observed in mev-1 animals (Fig. 3), these data provide the biochemical connection that links the molecular defect in complex II to the organismal phenotypes of ROS hypersensitivity and precocious aging. Perhaps more importantly, the data bear on the question of precisely where in the mitochondria and how superoxide anion is generated. It is generally believed that most superoxide anions are produced at complex III (16Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Specifically, the free radical ubisemiquinone is generated during the Q cycle, a series of events that includes a two-step oxidation from ubiquinol to ubisemiquinone to ubiquinone. Ubisemiquinone is alternatively capable of transferring electrons to diatomic oxygen, forming superoxide anion. Given this, how can the increased superoxide production in mev-1 animals be explained? First, the increase may be an indirect effect of the mev-1 mutation that uncouples some aspect of electron transport and results in increased superoxide anion at complex III itself. Second, the increase may be a direct effect of the mev-1 mutation such that superoxide anion is produced at complex II. Two variations on this second scenario could be envisioned. The first is that the complex II defect could affect electron flow such that there is a probable increase of electrons leaking directly from complex II to molecular oxygen. The second is that the mutation results in increased superoxide anion generation because of semiquinone involvement; specifically, the mutation could result in a premature release of the free radical semiquinone before its reduction to ubiquinol. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mev-1 mutation results in superoxide anion production at complex II itself rather than exerting an indirect effect on complex III. Interpretation of inhibitor data is fraught with danger; however, the antimycin A results (Fig. 2) lend support to the notion that superoxide anion can be produced at complex II, particularly in mev-1 animals. Specifically, disruption of the complex III-associated Q cycle by antimycin A had comparatively little effect on superoxide anion production in mitochondria derived from mev-1 animals, suggesting that production occurred at some location other than at complex III. Conversely, the large antimycin A-mediated increase in wild type is in keeping with other evidence implicating complex III as the source of most superoxide anions under normal conditions. That succinate stimulated superoxide anion production more in mev-1 mutants than wild type is also consistent with our contention that the mev-1 mutation results in high levels of superoxide anion production at complex II. Similarly, the relative inability of antimycin A to exacerbate the increases mediated by succinate in mev-1 (but not wild type) also suggests that complex II is the source of most superoxide anion in mev-1 mutants. In addition to the inhibitor data, the specific nature of the mev-1 mutation is consistent with a direct, complex II-mediated production of superoxide anion. Specifically, site-directed mutagenesis has been employed in E. coli to demonstrate that amino acid residues 17–33 are likely the ubiquinone-binding sites in the E. coli SDHC to which Cyt-1/ceSDHC is the probable ortholog (30Yang X., Yu, L. He D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31916-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This corresponds to amino acids 59–76 in Cyt-1/ceSDHC. We have shown previously that the mev-1 mutant has a missense mutation that substitutes glutamic acid for glycine at residue 71 (19). Therefore, it seems reasonable to speculate that this mutation may result in premature release in semiquinone, thereby enabling superoxide anion formation via its subsequent interaction with molecular oxygen. Whatever the case, it seems likely that the mev-1 mutation exerts an allele-specific effect, that is the missense mutation at position 71 may affect the quinone-binding site whereas other, more severe mutations would not elevate superoxide anion production. It also seems reasonable to posit that some superoxide anion production might occur at complex II even in wild-type mitochondria. In particular, the observation that succinate, the substrate for complex II, increased superoxide anion production in wild-type mitochondria suggests that complex II might even be a secondary source of superoxide anion production in wild type. Many reports have implicated that mitochondrial function is reduced in the aging process (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 16Lenaz G. Biochim.

Several studies have demonstrated age-linked declines in the activities of mitochondrial electron transport enzymes NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex I plus III), succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II plus III), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and ATP synthase (complex V) in human skeletal muscle (31Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are the major source of ROS and are also the first compartment in the cell that is damaged by these ROS. Indeed, aging is accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial function. That has led to the hypothesis that a deficit in energy metabolism and an increase in ROS production could be a cause of aging. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the model of short-lived mev-1 mutants. In summary, we have shown that mev-1 animals manifest two distinct biochemical pathophysiologies, namely superoxide anion overproduction from mitochondrial complex II itself (with an attendant decrease in glutathione levels) and metabolic changes with lactic acidosis by the mutation in Cyt-1/ceSDHC subunit (Fig.5). The metabolic changes in mev-1 mutants are biochemical and metabolic features associated with human mitochondrial diseases. The superoxide anion overproduction ultimately results in (or strongly contributes to) the exogenous oxygen-dependent mev-1 phenomena: shortened life span and damage to lipids and proteins (rapid accumulation of fluorescent materials and protein carbonyls) that might be correlated with the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and precocious aging. Elevated ROS by mitochondrial dysfunction is also thought to lead to neurodegeneration, cell death, and damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The mechanisms are currently poorly understood. Therefore, studies of those cellular and organismal sequelae in mev-1 mutants might elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of mitochondrial disease and aging. We thank K.

https://openalex.org/W2326949580,"We recently demonstrated the existence of specific patterns of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in several cancers. Here we sought to identify the presence of mtDNA mutations in prostate cancer and their paired PIN lesions. The D-loop region, 16S rRNA, and the NADH subunits of complex I were sequenced to identify mtDNA mutations in 16 matched PIN lesions and primary prostate cancers. Twenty mtDNA mutations were detected in the tumor tissue of three patients. Identical mutations were also identified in the PIN lesion from one patient. This patient with multiple point mutations also harbored a high frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in nuclear mononucleotide repeat markers. Remarkably, identical mutations were also detected in all (3/3) matched urine and plasma samples obtained from these patients. Although mitochondrial mutations are less common in prostate adenocarcinoma, they occur early in cancer progression and they can be detected in bodily fluids of early stage disease patients. The identification of MtDNA mutations may complement other early detection approaches for prostate cancer."

This selectivity endows MBL with the ability to discriminate self from infectious non-self, and confers this “ante-antibody” a major role in innate immunity, as underlined by numerous clinical reports indicating that MBL deficiency is linked with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases (3Turner M.W.

MASP-1 and MASP-2 show a domain organization identical to that of C1r and C1s, the enzymatic components of the C1 complex of complement (14Arlaud G.J. Volanakis J.E. Thielens N.M. Narayana S.V.L.

By analogy with human C1s, it may be anticipated that the proteolytic activity and specificity of the MASPs is defined by the two CCP modules together with the serine protease domain (17Rossi V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and that the latter forms a rigid association with the preceding, second CCP module (18Gaboriaud C.

Comparative analysis of the cDNAs of C1r, C1s, and the MASPs in different animal species reveal that these fall into two groups (19Ji X. Azumi K. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar). In the smaller and probably more ancient group comprising MASP-1 and the ascidian MASPs, the active site serine is encoded by a “TCN” codon (where N is A, T, G, or C), and the histidine-loop disulfide bridge is present. In the larger group encompassing C1r, C1s, MASP-2, and most of the known animal MASPs, the active site serine is encoded by an “AGY” codon (where Y is T or C), and the histidine-loop is missing. The only available information dealing with the substrate specificity of MASP-1 and MASP-2 has been obtained on proteases isolated from human serum, and is somewhat controversial. Thus, whereas it is now widely accepted that MASP-2 cleaves both C4 and C2 (6Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U.

In addition, the relative efficiency of MASP-2 with respect to C4 and C2 cleavage has not been assessed. The objective of the present work was to produce recombinant human MASP-1 and MASP-2 and catalytic fragments thereof, to precisely determine their substrate specificity on both protein substrates and synthetic esters, and to measure the kinetic parameters of their activity. Our data reveal that MASP-2 cleaves C4 much more efficiently than does C1s, emphasizing the physiological relevance of MASP-2 with respect to complement activation. In contrast, recombinant MASP-1 shows only marginal C3 cleaving activity, raising questions about its involvement in complement activation.

The sequence of the sense primer (5′-GAAGATCTCAATGAGTGCCCAGAGCT-3′) introduced aBglII restriction site (underlined) and allowed in-frame cloning with the melittin signal peptide of the pNT-Bac expression vector (17Rossi V.

The antisense primer (5′-GGAATTCTCAGTTCCTCACTCC-3′) introduced a stop codon (bold face) followed by an EcoRI site (underlined) at the 3′ end of the fragment. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BglII and EcoRI, purified, and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pNT-Bac vector. The DNA fragment encoding the MASP-2 signal peptide plus the mature protein (amino acids 1–671) was excised from the pBS-MASP-2 vector (6Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B.

DNA fragments encoding residues 298–686 (CCP1/2-SP construct) and residues 365–686 (CCP2-SP construct) of human MASP-2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the VentR polymerase and the pFastBac MASP-2 vector as a template. The sequences of the sense primers (5′-CGGGATCCCCAGCCTTGCCCTTATCC-3′ for the CCP1/2-SP construct and 5′-CGGGATCCCGACTGTGGCCCTCCTG-3′ for the CCP2-SP construct) introduced a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and allowed in-frame cloning with melittin signal peptide of the pNT-Bac expression vector. The antisense primer (5′-GGAATTCTTAAAAATCACTAATTATGTTCTC-3′) was identical for both constructs and introduced a stop codon (bold face) followed by an EcoRI site (underlined). Both polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, purified, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pNT-Bac vector. All DNA constructs used in this study were checked for the absence of mutations by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble). The insect cells Spodoptera frugiperda (Ready-Plaque Sf9 cells from Novagen) andTrichoplusia ni (High FiveTM) were routinely grown and maintained as described previously (27Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-BacTM system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The bacmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen midiprep purification system (Qiagen S.A., Courtaboeuf, France) and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells utilizing cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant virus particles were collected 4 days later, titrated by virus plaque assay, and amplified as described by King and Possee (35King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). High Five cells (1.75 × 107 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2–3 in Sf900 II SFM medium at 28 °C for 48 h (MASP-2 fragments) or 72 h (full-length MASP-2 and CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-1). Culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant containing MASP-2 was dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.8 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a 800-ml linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were identified by Western blot analysis, and dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.0. Further purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out with a linear NaCl gradient from 50 to 500 mm in 90 min. The supernatants containing the CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments of MASP-2 were dialyzed against 5 mm EDTA, 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.6, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.8 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a 700-ml linear gradient from 0 to 350 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were identified by Western blot analysis, dialyzed against 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, and further purified by high-pressure hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a TSK-Phenyl 5PW column (Beckman) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by decreasing the (NH4)2SO4 concentration from 1.5m to 0 in 30 min. Both purified recombinant fragments were dialyzed against 145 mm NaCl, 50 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, concentrated up to 0.2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, and stored at −20 °C. The supernatant containing the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-1 was dialyzed against 50 mm Na acetate, pH 5.1, and loaded on a SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.8 × 8 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was performed with a 800-ml linear gradient from 0 to 600 mm NaCl. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, concentrated by ultrafiltration to 0.05–0.5 mg/ml, and stored at 0 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously (36Thielens N.M. Aude C.A. Lacroix M.B. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14469-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and immunodetection of the recombinant proteins were carried out as described by Rossi et al. (17Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), or using the ECL detection procedure of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The antibodies used were the mouse monoclonal anti-MASP-2 antibody 1.3B7, a rabbit polyclonal anti-MASP-2 antibody (37Petersen S.V. Poulsen K. Stover C.M. Koch C. Vorup-Jensen T. Thiel S. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35 (abstr.): 409Crossref Google Scholar), and a rabbit anti-peptide antibody directed against the serine protease domain of MASP-1 (6Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analyses were performed after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer, using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer as described previously (38Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of MASP-1, MASP-2, and C1s toward C2, C3, C4, C5, and factor B was measured by incubation at different enzyme:protein ratios for varying periods at 37 °C, as indicated in the text. The extent of reaction was determined after SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions by gel scanning of the cleavage fragments, as described previously (17Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For determination of the kinetic parameters, the concentrations of C2 ranged from 1.0 to 4 µm, and those of C4 ranged from 50 to 500 nm (MASP-2 cleavage) or from 0.5 to 4 µm (C1s cleavage). Fixed enzyme concentrations of 2 nm were used in all cases, and enzyme dilutions were performed in 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, 145 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. The kinetic constants were determined by the Lineweaver-Burk method using linear regression analysis and are based on duplicate or triplicate measurements of initial rates at 6 separate substrate concentrations. All kinetic analyses were conducted in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Complex formation between C1 inhibitor and MASP-1 or MASP-2 was assessed by incubation of the proteases with excess molar ratios of C1 inhibitor for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 145 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. C1 inhibitor-protease complexes were revealed by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against full-length MASP-2, and a rabbit anti-peptide antibody directed against the serine protease domain of MASP-1. Titration of the enzymatic activity of C1s, MASP-1, and MASP-2 by C1 inhibitor was performed by preincubating these proteases (at concentrations of 0.25 µm, 20 nm, and 0.25 µm, respectively) with increasing concentrations of C1 inhibitor (10–500 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. The residual C2 cleaving activity of MASP-2 and C1s was then measured by incubating the enzymes (3.75 and 7.5 nm, respectively) for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2.25 µm C2, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, as described above. In the case of MASP-1, the residual esterolytic activity was measured on Bz-Arg-OEt, as described above. The reactivity of C1s and MASP-2 toward α2M was measured by preincubating the enzymes (0.25 µm each) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations (3.7–300 µm) of α2M. Residual C4 cleaving activity was then measured by incubating the enzymes (1.25 nm each) for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2.25 µm C4, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Esterolytic activities were measured on the synthetic esters Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe and Tos-Arg-OMe using a spectrophotometric assay based on the measurement of methanol released upon hydrolysis (39Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Assays on the thioester Z-Gly-Arg-S-Bzl and on Bz-Arg-OEt were carried out as described by McRae et al.(40McRae B.J. Lin T.-Y,. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12362-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Arlaud and Thielens (39Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 30 °C, at substrate concentrations of 0.1–3 mm(Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe and Tos-Arg-OMe), 0.5–3 mm (Bz-Arg-OEt), or 0.075–0.2 mm (Z-Gly-Arg-S-Bzl). The modular structures of MASP-1, MASP-2, and of the truncated fragments used in the present study are depicted in Fig. 1. The recombinant baculoviruses used for expression of each construct were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used to infect High Five insect cells for various periods at 28 °C. The amount of recombinant material recovered in the culture medium, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, ranged from 0.15 (MASP-2) to 2 µg/ml (CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-1). Protein purification was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using an initial ion-exchange fractionation step in all cases. Because of the low amounts of material recovered, protein detection and analysis was performed routinely using Western blot analysis rather than Coomassie Blue staining. Due to its very low recovery, recombinant MASP-2 could not be purified to homogeneity since attempts to completely remove contaminant proteins resulted in a nearly complete loss of material. SDS-PAGE analysis of the partially purified MASP-2 fraction under nonreducing conditions revealed two bands reactive with specific antibodies: (i) a major, 80-kDa species corresponding to the full-length protease, yielding two sequences, Thr-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Lys-Trp-Pro-Glu-Pro … and Ile-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys-Pro-Gly … , corresponding to the N-terminal ends of the mature protein and of the serine protease domain, respectively; (ii) a 45-kDa species yielding only the first sequence above, and corresponding to a truncated fragment derived from the N-terminal end of the protein. Analysis under reducing conditions indicated that full-length MASP-2 was recovered in a partially activated form, since only 20–30% of the protein migrated as a single chain, proenzyme species, whereas the remainder yielded two bands at 45 and 28 kDa, corresponding to the N-terminal A chain and the serine protease domain, respectively. Based on Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE analysis, the relative amount of full-length MASP-2 in the partially purified fraction averaged 10% of the total protein contents. Both the CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments of MASP-2 could be purified to homogeneity. On SDS-PAGE analysis, the CCP1/2-SP fragment migrated under nonreducing conditions as a 44-kDa band, which upon reduction split into two bands corresponding to the serine protease domain (27 kDa) and the CCP1/2 segment (17 kDa) (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 2), indicating complete activation of the protease. In contrast, the shorter CCP2-SP fragment migrated as a single band of about 35 kDa both under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2, lanes 3and 4), indicating that this species had retained a single chain, proenzyme structure. N-terminal sequence analysis of the latter fragment yielded a single sequenceAsp-Pro-Asp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Pro … corresponding to the expected N-terminal end of the fragment, whereas the activated CCP1/2 SP fragment yielded equivalent amounts of two sequences:Asp-Pro-Gln-Pro-Cys-Pro-Tyr … (N-terminal end) and Ile-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Ala … (serine protease domain). Protein staining with Coomassie Blue (not shown) yielded the same pictures as observed by Western blot analysis, indicating that no major fragment or contaminant was present in the purified preparations. As in the case of full-length MASP-2, the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-1 could not be purified to homogeneity, mainly because of the low amounts of recombinant material available. SDS-PAGE"
https://openalex.org/W2078172132,"The Wnt signal transduction pathway has been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis in the mouse. beta-catenin, a key downstream effector of this pathway interacts with and thus activates the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors. Elevated levels of beta-catenin have been found in many human tumors, notably colon carcinomas. Recently, elevated levels of beta-catenin have been associated with poor prognosis in human adenocarcinoma of the breast. In order to assess the possible role of beta-catenin in mammary carcinoma, we have created transgenic mice bearing the MMTV-LTR driving an activated form of beta-catenin. These mice develop mammary gland hyperplasia and mammary adenocarcinoma, a phenotype very similar to that of transgenic mice expressing an MMTV-driven Wnt gene. Indeed, the histopathology of the mammary tumors in Wnt-mediated adenocarcinoma is identical to that observed in our beta-catenin-mediated disease model. Furthermore, putative beta-catenin transcriptional targets, cyclin D1 and c-myc, are elevated in beta-catenin-mediated mammary tumors and cell lines. These observations support the notion that the oncogenic Wnt pathway operates via beta-catenin and its targets in the context of mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma."

Many mitogens increase the cellular levels of GTP-bound Ras, leading to activation of the downstream target, Raf-1. The Raf-1 kinase can phosphorylate and activate the dual specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn activate MAPK (also known as p42ERK2and p44ERK1). Once activated, MAPK can phosphorylate several nuclear transcription factors including Myc, Elk, and Rsk (for review, see Ref. 18Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). p27 itself has several MAPK consensus sites, and MAPK can phosphorylate p27 in vitro (16Naumann U. Weit S. Rieger L. Meyermann R.

Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). While constitutive activation of Ras-MAPK can reduce p27 inhibitory function in immortal and cancer-derived lines, it is not clear whether MAPK directly regulates p27 during cell cycle progression in normal cell types. Studies of p27 regulation by the Ras-MAPK pathway were initially carried out in fibroblasts (15Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y.

In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, Ras signaling is required for the down-regulation of p27 as cells approach the G1-to-S phase transition (13Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Biol.

Introduction of a dominant negative ras mutant prevented the loss of p27 in response to serum and inhibited S phase entry. Others have reported that Ras-MAPK activation reduces the ability of p27 to inhibit cdk2 through sequestration of p27 into cyclin D1-cdk4 complexes, rather than by promoting p27 protein loss (14Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).

Oncology. 1999; 57 Suppl. 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the causes of MAPK activation differ among tumors, in many cancers constitutive signaling from cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors contributes to activation of the Ras-Raf-1-MEK-MAPK pathway. For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2/c-ErbB-2, both of which activate the Ras-MAPK pathway, are overexpressed in up to 20 and 30% of breast cancers, respectively. Overexpression of these receptors has been associated with antiestrogen resistance and poor prognosis in primary breast cancers (22Nicholson S. Wright C. Sainsbury J.R. Halcrow P. Kelly P. Angus B.

However, only two-thirds of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers respond initially to antiestrogen therapy, and even sensitive tumors invariably acquire antiestrogen resistance (34Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In most cases, acquired resistance is not due to a loss or mutation of the ER (35Robertson J.F.R. Br. J.

Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of tamoxifen-resistant ER-positive breast cancer, including altered drug metabolism (37Osborne C.K. Coronado E. Allred D.C. Wiebe V.

The cell cycle inhibitor, p27Kip1, is an essential mediator of cell cycle arrest by tamoxifen and other antiestrogenic drugs. We recently demonstrated that antisense-mediated down-regulation of p27kip1 abrogated antiestrogen-induced cell cycle arrest in the ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer line (3Cariou S. Donovan J.

These observations stimulated the present study to investigate the relationships between Ras-MAPK pathway activation, antiestrogen resistance, and p27 function. Our data indicate that constitutive MEK activation alters p27 phosphorylation, reduces p27 inhibitory activity, and contributes to antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. MCF-7 cells (42Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brenan S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar) and LY-2 cells (43Bronzert D.A. Greene G. Lippman M.E.

MCF-7 cells, stably transfected with full-lengthHER2 cDNA (MCF-7/HER2–18), were kindly provided by C. Arteaga. All lines were grown in improved-modified essential medium (option Zn2+) supplemented with insulin and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were pulse-labeled with 10 µm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 2 h and then fixed, stained with anti-BrdUrd-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (Becton Dickinson) and counterstained with propidium iodide as described (45Sandhu C.

Cell cycle analysis was carried out on a Becton Dickinson FACScan and Cell Quest Software. Values given for flow cytometric analysis represent the mean of repeat assays. For comparison of the effects of antiestrogens in MCF-7, MCF-7 transfectants, or LY-2 cell lines, cultures were treated by addition of 1 µm 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) (Sigma) or 10 nm ICI 182780 (7α-(9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulfinyl) nonyl)estra-1,3,5, (10Pietenpol J.A.

The effects of MEK inhibition on the cell cycle were assayed following addition of 0.1 µm U0126 (Promega) for 2 or 24 h prior to recovery for immunoblotting or flow cytometric analysis. The effects of MEK inhibition on antiestrogen sensitivity in the antiestrogen-resistant lines, LY-2 or MCF-7/HER2–18, were assayed by treating cells with 0.1 µm U0126 for 2 h followed by an additional 48 h with either 1 µm 4-OH-TAM or 10 nm ICI 182780 prior to recovery of cells for protein or flow cytometric analysis. Antisense experiments were carried out as described (3Cariou S. Donovan J. Flanagan W. Milic A. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorothioate oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: GS5422 antisense p27 (ASp27) 5′-TGGCTCTCXTGCGCC-3′; GS5585 mismatch p27 (MSMp27) 5′-TGGCTCXCTTGCGCC-3′; X indicates the G-clamp modification of these oligonucleotides.

LY-2 cells were rendered quiescent by the addition of 0.1 µm U0126 (Promega) for 2 h followed by antiestrogen treatment (10 nm ICI 182780, or 1 µm 4-OH TAM) for a further 48 h. Quiescent cells were then transfected with 120 nm oligonucleotides using 2.5 µg/ml cytofectin G3815 (Gilead Scientific, Foster City, California) for 6 h, followed by replacement with complete medium supplemented by U0126 and antiestrogen. Flow cytometry and proteins were analyzed prior to transfection and at 21 h thereafter. Cells lysis and immunoblotting were as described (45Sandhu C. Garbe J. Daksis J. Pan C.-H. Bhattacharya N. Yaswen P. Koh J. Slingerland J. Stampfer M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2458-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal protein loading was verified by blotting for β-actin. To assay cyclin E1 complexes, cyclin E1 was immunoprecipitated from 200 µg of protein lysate. Immunoprecipitates were resolved, transferred, and blotted with cyclin E1, cdk2, and p27 antibodies. Antibody alone controls were run along side immunoprecipitates. Monoclonal antibodies to p27 were obtained from Neomarkers (DCS-72) or Transduction Laboratories. p27 rabbit polyclonal serum (pAb5588) was provided by H. Toyoshima and T. Hunter (Salk Institute). Antibodies to p21 were from Santa Cruz, to cdk2 (PSTAIRE) from S. Reed (The Scripps Research Institute), to MEK, MAPK, and phospho-MAPK from New England Biolabs, to β-actin from Sigma, and to cyclin E1 (mAbs E12 and E172) from E. Harlow (Massachusetts General). These cyclin E1 antibodies are specific for cyclin E1(46). The ER antibody H222 was provided by Dr. G. Greene. Cyclin E1 or p27 complexes were immunoprecipitated from 100 µg of protein lysate and reacted with [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1 as described(45). Radioactivity incorporated in histone substrate was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. To determine background IgG-associated activity, nonspecific mouse IgG (for cyclin E1-cdk2 assays) or polyclonal rabbit IgG (for p27-associated kinase) immunoprecipitates from test lysates were collected on protein A, washed, and reacted with the kinase mixture as for cyclin E1 and p27 immunoprecipitates. Radioactivity incorporated in control nonspecific IgG immunoprecipitates was subtracted from test kinase values prior to graphing as in Refs. 45Sandhu C. Garbe J. Daksis J. Pan C.-H. Bhattacharya N.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3683-3694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Sf-9 cells and TNM-FH media were obtained from Invitrogen. Adherent Sf-9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding humancyclin E1 or human cdk2 genes, and cyclin E1 and cdk2 were prepared as described (46Lauper N. Beck A.R. Cariou S. Richman L. Hofmann K. Reith W. Slingerland M.M. Amati B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sf-9 cell lysates containing cyclin E1 and cdk2 were used directly in p27 inhibitor assays. Cell lysates (250 µg) from asynchronously proliferating MCF-7, MCF-7/MEKEE (line M2), or LY-2 cells were immunoprecipitated with pAb5588 anti-p27 serum or control polyclonal rabbit IgG, and precipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. For testing heat-stable p27 inhibitor activity, p27 immunoprecipitates were washed, then boiled for 5 min in 200 µl of reaction buffer, placed on ice, and then cleared by centrifugation. The p27 in the supernatant was recovered, and recombinant cyclin E1-cdk2 and dithiothreitol (1 mm final) were added and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-cyclin E1 (mAbE172) or control polyclonal mouse IgG (Sigma). The un-inhibited control recombinant cyclin E1-cdk2 was treated with reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min without any added p27. Complexes were subsequently assayed for H1 kinase activity, and resulting activities were graphed as a % maximum un-inhibited cyclin E1-cdk2 activity. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 0.1% Tween 20 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na2VO4, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.02 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). For 2D-IEF, p27 immunoprecipitates were denatured in 8m urea, loaded onto immobilized non-linear pH gradient (pH 3–10) IEF strips and focused at 50,000 volt-hour using the IPGphor IEF system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These assays yield highly reproducible electrophoretic resolution of isoforms because of the covalent linkage of the electrophoresis medium to a matrix. The IEF strip was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 6m urea, 30% glycerol, and 2% SDS for 30 min before loading for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, p27 isoforms were detected by immunoblotting using p27 antibody from Transduction Labs, and proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). For 2D-IEF of cyclin E1-bound p27, 3 mg of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal mAb E172 antibody. Densitometric analysis of multiple ECL film exposures from repeat assays was used to determine the ratios of the various p27 isoforms. For phosphatase treatment, p27 immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) and then incubated at 37 °C overnight with 66 units per 10 µl of reaction of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To confirm that the most positively charged p27 isoforms represented unphosphorylated p27, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/100-dish) for 3 h, and p27 immunoprecipitates were isolated and subjected to 2D-IEF. p27 immunoprecipitated from unlabeled cells was resolved by 2D-IEF in parallel with the labeled p27, and the resolution pattern of the cold p27 was compared with the phosphate-labeled p27. We compared p27 levels in antiestrogen-sensitive MCF-7 (42Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brenan S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar) and the resistant MCF-7 derivative, LY-2 (43Bronzert D.A. Greene G. Lippman M.E. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1409-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The loss of antiestrogen responsiveness in LY-2 was not due to a loss of p27 protein (Fig.1A). The association of p27 with cyclin E1-cdk2 was assayed in asynchronously growing and antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 and LY-2 cells (Fig. 1B). Asynchronously proliferating LY-2 and MCF-7 cells had similar cell cycle profiles (Fig. 1B). When equal amounts of cyclin E1 were immunoprecipitated, the amount of p27 bound to cyclin E1-cdk2 in asynchronously growing LY-2 was nearly 4-fold higher than that in asynchronous MCF-7. There was no compensatory decrease in p21 binding to cyclin E1 in proliferating LY-2. Levels of cyclin E1-bound p21 were similar in proliferating MCF-7 and LY-2. Cyclin E1-bound cdk2 levels were similar in the two lines and were not affected by antiestrogens. Despite the increased p27 bound to cyclin E1-cdk2 in proliferating LY-2 cells, the histone H1 activity of these complexes was not reduced compared with cyclin E1-cdk2 from asynchronous MCF-7 (Fig. 1B). Antiestrogen treatment of MCF-7 with either ICI 182780 (ICI) or 4-OH-TAM (data shown here for ICI) caused a 3- to 5-fold increase in p27 binding to cyclin E1-cdk2, a 3-fold increase in cyclin E1-bound p21, inhibition of this kinase, and G1 cell cycle arrest. Antiestrogen treatment of LY-2 caused a minimal increase in p21 binding, no change in the amount of p27 bound to cyclin E1-cdk2, no significant inhibition of cyclin E1-cdk2 activity, and no change in the cell cycle profile (Fig. 1B). These data suggested a functional alteration of p27 in LY-2 cells. Since MAPK had been shown to alter p27 function in fibroblasts (15Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,20Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we assayed MAPK activity by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies that detect activated MAPK. Although total MAPK protein levels were similar in LY-2 and MCF-7 cells, the levels of phosphorylated MAPK (both p42 ERK2 and p44 ERK1) were elevated nearly 8-fold in LY-2 (Fig. 1C). We also observed elevated MAPK activity in two other MCF-7 derived antiestrogen-resistant cell lines, LCC2 and MCF-7/HER2–18 (data not shown). To determine whether the increased MAPK activity observed in the antiestrogen-resistant lines was causally linked to the antiestrogen-resistant phenotype, we transfected MCF-7 cells with activated MEK1(MEKEE) or an active ERK2 allele (ERK2-MEK) and assayed stable transfected cell lines for antiestrogen sensitivity. Transfectants showed MAPK activation compared with parental cells and empty vector controls (representative data shown for MEKEEtransfectants, labeled M1 and M2 in Fig. 2A). Of note, both p21 and p27 levels were reduced in MEKEEtransfectants (Fig. 2A). The level of the ER protein was not affected by the degree of MAPK activation achieved in these cells (data not shown). Asynchronously growing MAPK-activated lines and empty vector controls showed similar cell cycle profiles (Fig.2B). Lines with constitutive MAPK activation showed partial resistance to 4-OH-TAM or ICI compared with the parental or vector alone controls (Fig. 2B). Levels of cyclin E1-associated p21 and p27 were assayed in asynchronousMEKEEtransfected lines and in the empty vector controls (Fig. 2C). Although densitometric analysis showed that total p27 levels in asynchronously growing MEKEEtransfectants were reduced by up to 3-fold compared with controls, the amount of p27 detected in cyclin E1-cdk2 complexes was not reduced (Fig. 2, C and D). Despite the similar amounts of both p27 and p21 bound to cyclin E1 in proliferatingMEKEE and control lines, equal amounts of cyclin E1-cdk2 showed approximately 2-fold higher kinase activity inMEKEEtransfectants compared with empty vector controls (Fig. 2, C and D). There was no change in cdk2 binding to cyclin E1, and the subtle increase in the proportion of the faster mobility, CAK-activated cdk2 bound to cyclin E1 would not suffice to mediate the 2-fold increase in cyclin E1-cdk2 activity in the MEKEE lines (Fig. 2C). MCF-7 lines with constitutive MEK1 activation showed no increase in p27 binding to cyclin E1 following antiestrogens compared with that in parental MCF-7 or in the empty vector controls (representative data in Fig. 2D). The modest increase of p21 binding to cyclin E1-cdk2 may mediate the partial cell cycle inhibition after antiestrogen treatment of the M2 clone. Earlier work has established that increased KIP binding to cyclin E1-cdk2 in MCF-7 is essential for G1 arrest by antiestrogens (3Cariou S. Donovan J. Flanagan W. Milic A. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 48Carroll J.S. Prall O.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

Thus, MAPK activation via MEKEEor ERK2-MEK transfection may contribute to antiestrogen resistance, at least in part, by impairing the antiestrogen-mediated increase in p27 binding to cyclin E1-cdk2. The MAPK-activated transfectants and LY-2 cells show a number of similarities. Both showed more abundant p27 binding to cyclin E1-cdk2 in asynchronously proliferating cells than would have been predicted from the respective total cellular abundance of p27, and antiestrogens failed to cause an accumulation of p27 in cyclin E1-cdk2 complexes. We postulated that differences in p27 phosphorylation may be associated with these differences in p27 function. Under most one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions, p27 does not show reproducible differences i"
https://openalex.org/W1545189970,"Both the β-catenin and the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) proteins are important regulators of gene expression and cellular proliferation. Two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are critical activators of the NF-κB pathway. Here we present evidence that these kinases are also important in the regulation of β-catenin function. IKKα- and IKKβ-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts exhibited different patterns of β-catenin cellular localization. IKKβ decreases β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation, while IKKα increases β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. IKKα and IKKβ interact with and phosphorylate β-catenin using both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays. Our results suggest that differential interactions of β-catenin with IKKα and IKKβ may in part be responsible for regulating β-catenin protein levels and cellular localization and integrating signaling events between the NF-κB and Wingless pathways."

Although it is generally assumed that there is no tissue-specific regulation of the PTP, this issue has not been examined clearly. Beside Ca2+, which is the single most important inducer, the PTP is modulated by a variety of physiological factors, especially matrix pH, transmembrane electrical potential, Mg2+, Pi, cyclophilin D, the redox potential, and adenine nucleotides (26Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 27Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 124: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we have shown that the PTP is modulated by electron flux through the respiratory chain complex I, although the degree of control exerted by this process on the overall probability of pore opening is more relevant in skeletal muscle than in liver (28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To explore further the functional links between the PTP and the respiratory chain complex I, in the present work we have investigated the effects of the complex I inhibitor rotenone on the regulation of the PTP in U937 and KB cells, as well as ontert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell death. We show that rotenone dramatically inhibits PTP opening both in permeabilized and intact cells and that like CsA it prevents PTP opening-related cell death in these two cell lines. U937 and KB cells were maintained in exponential growth phase using RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were permeabilized immediately before use by incubation under stirring for 2 min at 25 °C in a medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 µm EDTA, 50 µg/ml digitonin, 1 mm Pi-Tris, 10 mmTris-MOPS (pH 7.4). Measurements of Ca2+ and pyridine nucleotide oxidation-reduction status were carried out fluorimetrically at 25 °C with a PTI Quantamaster C61 spectrofluorometer. Free Ca2+ was measured in the presence of 1 µmCalcium Green-5N with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 506 and 532 nm, respectively, whereas pyridine nucleotide oxidation-reduction status was estimated based on endogenous fluorescence of NAD(P)H (excitation/emission, 340–460 nm). For electron microscopy, permeabilized cells were centrifuged and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed and post-fixed with 1% osmic tetroxide for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated, and embedded in epon. Thin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were observed with a JEOL1200EX11 electron microscope. For calcein staining, KB cells were grown for 48 h on 22-mm-diameter round glass coverslips and exposed for 20 min at 37 °C to PBS medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 0.35 mm pyruvate, 1 mm CoCl2, and 1 µm calcein-acetomethoxyl ester as described by Petronilliet al. (24Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). After loading, cells were washed free of calcein and CoCl2 and incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C in PBS/glucose/pyruvate medium supplemented with 1 µm CsA, 1 µm rotenone, or vehicle. Coverslips were then mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope, and PTP opening was achieved by adding 50 µm tBH. For induction of cell death, cells were exposed to tBH for 45 min and then washed with PBS and incubated in Petri dishes at 37 °C for 6 h in a complete RPMI medium. Cytotoxicity was evaluated either by staining necrotic cells with 20 µg/ml propidium iodide or by using a trypan blue (5%) exclusion assay. Cellular images were acquired at 25 °C with a Nikon TE200 microscope, which was equipped for epifluorescent illumination and included a xenon light source (75-W) and a 12-bit digital-cooled charged-couple device camera (SPOT-RT; Diagnostic Instruments). For calcein fluorescence 488 ± 5/525 ± 10 nm excitation/emission filter settings were used, and images were collected every minute with a constant exposure time using a 60×/1.40 Plan Apo oil immersion objective (Nikon). For detection of propidium iodide five randomly selected fields were acquired from each Petri dish using an excitation/emission cube of 550 ± 10/580 longpass and an ELWD 20×/0.45 Plan Fluor objective (Nikon). The corresponding bright field images were also acquired, and the two channels were overlaid using the appropriate function of the SPOTTM 3.0.6 software. To evaluate cytochrome c release into cytosol, mitochondrial and cytosolic spaces were separated using the digitonin fractionation method (29Zuurendonk P.F. Tischler M.E. Akerboom T.P. Van Der Meer R. Williamson J.R. Tager J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 30 µg of cytosolic proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels in MES buffer, followed by Western blotting. The membranes were probed with a monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (1 µg/ml) clone 7H8.2C12 and developed with a secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody followed by chemiluminescent detection. Quantification was carried out using the NIH Image software. U937 and KB cells were purchased from ATCC. Calcein-acetomethoxyl ester and Calcium Green-5N were from Molecular Probes whereas monoclonal antibodies were from Pharmingen. Piericidine was a generous gift from Dr. Alain Dupuis (Grenoble, France). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 1, panel A, the Ca2+ uptake and release of digitonin-permeabilized U937 cells were measured by loading cells with a train of Ca2+pulses at 2-min intervals. As reported with isolated mitochondria (e.g. see Ref. 28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), permeabilized cells took up and retained Ca2+ (trace a) until the Ca2+ load reached a threshold value that induced a fast Ca2+ release, which was accompanied by mitochondrial swelling as assessed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1, panel B). Confirming that these events were because of PTP opening, in the presence of CsA, the same Ca2+ load failed to induce Ca2+ release (panel A, trace b) or mitochondrial swelling (panel B), and the fast Ca2+ release occurred only after a much larger Ca2+ load (panel A,trace b). As can be appreciated in Fig. 1, rotenone also inhibited Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling (panel B) whereas the Ca2+ load required for Ca2+release (panel A, trace c) was higher than when the PTP was inhibited by CsA (panel A, trace b). To explore the statistical significance of this finding, we measured the Ca2+ retention capacity (i.e. the Ca2+ load that induced Ca2+ release) in two cell types using the protocol depicted in Fig. 1, panel A. These results are presented in Fig. 2and show that rotenone was dramatically more potent than CsA at PTP inhibition in U937 and KB cells. Similar results have been obtained with the complex I inhibitor piericidine (data not shown), confirming that PTP regulation by rotenone is related to complex I inhibition.Figure 2Comparison of the effect ofCsAand rotenone on the Ca2+ retention capacity of permeabilized U937 and KB cells. The Ca2+ retention capacities of two different cell lines were measured as in Fig. 1A, in the presence of vehicle (control), 1 µm CsA, or 1 µmrotenone.

Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To characterize further the mechanism by which complex I regulates the PTP, we first measured the NAD(P)H oxidation reduction level of permeabilized cells (Fig. 3, panel A). As can be appreciated in traces b or c, rotenone addition sped up NAD(P)H reduction induced by succinate but did not affect the final NAD(P)H reduction level reached after energization (comparetraces a, b, and c). In the absence of rotenone (trace a), subsequent Ca2+ additions led to transient NAD(P)H oxidations concomitant with Ca2+uptake. As expected, Ca2+ uptake did not induce transient NAD(P)H oxidation when complex I was inhibited by rotenone (trace b), whereas addition of appropriate concentration of duroquinone, a quinone able to oxidize NAD(P)H (31Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), produced a transient NAD(P)H oxidation (trace c) similar to that one induced by Ca2+ uptake in the absence of rotenone. We next measured the Ca2+ retention capacity of permeabilized cells (Fig.3, panel B) in the absence (traces a and c) or in the presence of rotenone (traces b and d), adding either trains of Ca2+ pulses (traces a and b) or trains of duroquinone plus Ca2+ pulses (traces cand d). Although duroquinone-induced oxidation of NAD(P)H favored pore opening (compare traces a and c ortraces b and d), the effect of rotenone persisted despite NAD(P)H oxidation (compare traces a andd). Similar results have been obtained with both cell lines under study indicating that, as initially found in skeletal muscle mitochondria (28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), electron flux through complex I is a main PTP regulator in U937 and KB cells. To examine whether complex I activity is a physiological PTP regulator in vivo, we next induced PTP opening in intact cells using the glutathione oxidant tBH. PTP opening was assessed directly by measuring mitochondrial permeability to calcein and cobalt as described by Petronilli et al. (24Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Fig. 4shows that calcein fluorescence, initially confined to mitochondria, progressively decreased after tBH addition, because its fluorescence was quenched by cobalt (Fig. 4, upper panel). The fluorescence changes were inhibited by CsA (middle panel), indicating that they were because of PTP opening, as well as by rotenone (lower panel). These data confirm that tBH induces PTP opening in vivo and indicate that rotenone is as effective as CsA at PTP inhibition in intact cells. Finally, we addressed the issue of whether rotenone could prevent PTP opening-induced cell death. U937 or KB cells were transiently exposed to tBH and then washed and incubated in an RPMI medium for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 5, this protocol induced cell death in 10 to 15% of KB cells as assessed by propidium iodide staining (panel A) or trypan blue exclusion (panel B). Similar percentages of staining were obtained with annexin V (not shown) suggesting that dead cells were essentially necrotic. Consistent with a mitochondrial pathway to cell death, tBH induced cytochrome c release in the same proportion (panel C). Like CsA, rotenone inhibited tBH-induced cytochromec release (panel C) and cell death (panels A and B), suggesting that rotenone prevented cell death through inhibition of PTP opening. Similar results were obtained with U937 cells (data not shown). In this study we have shown that rotenone is an effective PTP inhibitor both in permeabilized and intact cells. This effect can be dissociated from the oxidation-reduction state of the pyridine nucleotides, and at variance from results obtained with liver or skeletal muscle mitochondria rotenone appears to be a more potent PTP inhibitor than CsA in U937 and KB cells. Moreover, both PTP inhibitors inhibit tBH-induced cell death. The proposal that the PTP could play a key role in the commitment to cell death initially resulted from findings of a protective effect of CsA in several models of cell death (12Crompton M. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13Ichas F. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 14Kroemer G.

This proposal was supported further (i) by works showing that mitochondrial depolarization is an early event (32Petit P.X. Lecoeur H. Zorn E. Dauguet C. Mignotte B. Gougeon M.L. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and (iii) by the demonstration that PTP opening occurs in intact cells (22Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1747-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nieminen A.L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem.

We think that the current work, which shows that rotenone inhibits cell death, because it inhibits the PTP, further supports the PTP as a major actor in the commitment to cell death. Rotenone has been shown previously to inhibit tBH-induced cell death in U937 cells (34Guidarelli A. Brambilla L. Clementi E. Sciorati C. Cantoni O. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Sestili P. Brambilla L. Cantoni O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor-α in L929 cells (36Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and H2O2-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells (21Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ueffing M. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). At present, the effect of rotenone on the PTP can easily account for these observations, which were initially ascribed to a change of cellular redox potential or to a decrease of radical oxygen species production at the level of the respiratory chain. Indeed, consistent with an involvement of the PTP in these models of cell death, it has been shown that CsA prevents killing of L929 cells by tumor necrosis factor-α (38Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) whereas BA prevents the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 in Jurkat T-cells (21Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ueffing M. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is surprising that despite the fact that rotenone inhibits the respiratory chain complex I, it is not toxic in several tissues. This is most probably because of the fact that oxidation of complex II substrates and glycolysis are able to sustain the cellular energy supply in these cells. We note that BA has been shown to inhibit cell death (16Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Marchetti P. Castedo M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) despite the fact that it inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocator and profoundly affects cellular energy metabolism. We suspect that rotenone inhibits PTP opening-related cell death solely in tissues where it inhibits the PTP (see below) and in conditions where complex I activity is not indispensable. In the present work tBH opened the PTP in a large majority of cells (Fig. 4), whereas it induced cell death in only 10 to 15% of cells (Fig. 5). This discrepancy is most probably related to extra stresses such as calcein or photodynamic toxicity afferent to the procedure used to visualize PTP opening in vivo (39Beghetto C. Renken C. Eriksson O. Jori G. Bernardi P. Ricchelli F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It should be however kept in mind that PTP opening can occur without necessarily inducing cytochrome c release (10Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although it is commonly believed that the PTP is a multiprotein complex whose core is constituted by the adenine nucleotide translocator (2Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crompton M. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 40Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the molecular nature of the PTP remains unsolved. In a series of recent studies, we have shown that the PTP is modulated by electron flux through respiratory chain complex I (28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and by different ubiquinone analogs, which could be acting at a unique binding site (41Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 42Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These observations, as well as other consideration (30Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), led us to propose that the respiratory chain complex I may be part of the PTP (28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 30Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we find it remarkable that rotenone is a stronger PTP inhibitor than CsA in the two cell lines studied in the present work. We note, however, that rotenone does not directly affect PTP regulation in permeabilized hepatocytes incubated under identical conditions (data not shown) and that CsA and rotenone inhibit the PTP in similar proportions in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria (28Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). At present, the reasons why the relative potencies of CsA and rotenone at PTP inhibition change in different tissues are not clear, but these observations indicate that it might be misleading to generalize observations coming exclusively from studies with liver mitochondria. The finding that rotenone inhibits the PTP only in some cells indicates that the regulation of the permeability transition is partly tissue-specific. This opens the perspective of developing new drugs that may regulate the PTP specifically in some tissues while sparing the others. Such a targeting would be of great interest especially, because any malfunction of the PTP is expected to affect the life span of the cells. We thank Paolo Bernardi for helpful discussions, Isabelle Pignot-Paintrand for expert assistance with electron microscopy, and Dan Veal for help in correcting the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2096966552,"Familial prion diseases are linked to point and insertional mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene that are presumed to favor conversion of the cellular isoform of PrP to the infectious isoform. In this report, we have investigated the subcellular localization of PrP molecules carrying pathogenic mutations using immunofluorescence staining, immunogold labeling, and PrP-green fluorescent protein chimeras. To facilitate visualization of the mutant proteins, we have utilized a novel Sindbis viral replicon engineered to produce high protein levels without cytopathology. We demonstrate that several different pathogenic mutations have a common effect on the trafficking of PrP, impairing delivery of the molecules to the cell surface and causing a portion of them to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations suggest that protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum may play an important role in prion diseases, as it does in some other inherited human disorders. Our experiments also show that chimeric PrP molecules with the sequence of green fluorescent protein inserted adjacent to the glycolipidation site are post-translationally modified and localized normally, thus documenting the utility of these constructs in cell biological studies of PrP. Familial prion diseases are linked to point and insertional mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene that are presumed to favor conversion of the cellular isoform of PrP to the infectious isoform. In this report, we have investigated the subcellular localization of PrP molecules carrying pathogenic mutations using immunofluorescence staining, immunogold labeling, and PrP-green fluorescent protein chimeras. To facilitate visualization of the mutant proteins, we have utilized a novel Sindbis viral replicon engineered to produce high protein levels without cytopathology. We demonstrate that several different pathogenic mutations have a common effect on the trafficking of PrP, impairing delivery of the molecules to the cell surface and causing a portion of them to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations suggest that protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum may play an important role in prion diseases, as it does in some other inherited human disorders.

They are thought to be caused by a change in the conformation of PrPC,1 a neuronal membrane glycoprotein of unknown function, that results in its conversion to PrPSc, a protease-resistant isoform of high β-sheet content that is infectious in the absence of nucleic acid. PrPSc is postulated to physically interact with PrPC, acting as a nucleus or template in the formation of more PrPSc. Self-propagating changes in protein conformation have also been described in lower eukaryotes such as bakers’ yeast and filamentous fungi, underlining the generality of the prion phenomenon in nature (3Wickner R.B.

Familial prion diseases are due to dominantly inherited mutations in the PrP gene on chromosome 20 that are presumed to favor spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (4Young K. Piccardo P. Dlouhy S.

Point or insertional mutations have been linked to Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and ∼10% of the cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The mechanism by which these mutations promote generation of the PrPSc conformation is still unclear. One possibility is that they structurally destabilize the PrPC molecule, lowering the kinetic barrier to PrPSc formation. However, this is not likely to be the mechanism in all cases of familial prion diseases since some pathogenic mutations have little effect on the thermodynamic stability of PrP (6Liemann S.

Instead, these mutations may alter the interaction between PrP and other cellular components that influence the PrPC → PrPSc conversion reaction. Cultured cells that express mutant PrP molecules offer an attractive system for analyzing the biochemical mechanisms underlying familial prion diseases. Much of our own work has utilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that have been stably transfected to synthesize mouse PrP molecules carrying mutations whose human homologs are associated with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, or fatal familial insomnia (10Lehmann S.

We have found that the mutant proteins in these cells display several biochemical properties that are characteristic of PrPSc, including protease resistance, insolubility in nondenaturing detergents, and resistance of the C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to cleavage by phospholipase. These properties are not manifested by wild-type (WT) PrP or by PrP carrying a mutation that is homologous to a nonpathogenic amino acid polymorphism in human PrP (M129V), thus demonstrating the specificity of the effect. Although there are some differences between the mutant PrP molecules and authentic PrPSc, such as their degree of protease resistance, it is nevertheless likely that CHO cells are reproducing several key features of PrPSc formation. We have observed the same three PrPSc-like properties when mutant PrPs are expressed in both undifferentiated and nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (15Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and other investigators have reported similar results in neuroblastoma cells and fibroblasts (16Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Biol.

Although the biochemical properties can vary with the cell type and the mutation being expressed, the conclusion from all of these studies is that mutant PrPs can be converted to a PrPSc-like state in cultured cells. The fact that this occurs in non-neuronal as well as neuronal cell types suggests that whatever cellular cofactors play a role in the conversion process are likely to be ubiquitous. Despite extensive work on the biochemical properties of mutant PrPs in cultured cells, less attention has been paid to the precise localization of these proteins at a subcellular level. Several studies have suggested that mutant PrP molecules are inefficiently transported to the cell surface and are trapped in intracellular compartments (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H.

To further investigate these abnormalities, we undertook a detailed investigation of the localization of mutant PrPs in cultured cells using light and electron microscopic techniques. Our results demonstrate that several different pathogenic mutations share the property of impairing delivery of PrP molecules to the cell surface and causing their accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These observations raise the possibility that ER quality control mechanisms play an important role in prion diseases, as they do in some other inherited human disorders. From a technical standpoint, our experiments also document the utility of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras in cell biological studies of PrP. DNA fragments encoding 3F4 epitope-tagged WT or PG14 PrP were isolated from previously described plasmids (10Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by digestion with HindIII and BamHI and, after blunting with Klenow, were subcloned into the PmlI site of pSinRep21, which contains the Sindbis replicon (23Agapov E.V. Frolov I. Lindenbach B.D. Prágai B.M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Frolov I. Agapov E. Hoffman T.A. Pragai B.M. Lippa M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3854-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PG14 mutation was previously designated PG11 (25Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (Correction): 1520Google Scholar). To construct PrP-EGFP plasmids, a vector designated pEGFP-NC was first constructed in which the EGFP coding sequence was flanked on both the 5′- and 3′-sides by polylinkers. To create this vector, a 549-base pair fragment from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was isolated by digestion with SspBI and DraIII and ligated to a 4248-base pair fragment isolated from pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) by digestion with the same enzymes. A 767-base pair fragment encompassing EGFP was then released from pEGFP-NC by digestion with SmaI and EcoRI; and after blunting with Klenow, it was cloned into the single StuI site that lies within codon 223 (alanine) of mouse PrP. The WT and PG14 mouse PrP sequences, which carried an epitope tag for monoclonal antibody 3F4, had been previously inserted between the HindIII and BamHI sites of the vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which does not contain a StuI site. A ClaI/XbaI fragment encompassing PrP-EGFP was then isolated from the Bluescript vector, blunted with Klenow, and subcloned either into the PmlI site of pSinRep21 or into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A plasmid encoding D177N/M128 PrP-EGFP was created by replacing an MluI/BstEII fragment from pcDNA3 containing WT PrP-EGFP with the corresponding fragment from pcDNA3 containing D177N/M128 PrP. The cloning strategy utilized here, which maintains the reading frame across both PrP-EGFP junctions, introduces 7 extra amino acids (GDPPVAT) upstream and 12 extra amino acids (SGLRSRAQASNS) downstream of the EGFP sequence as a result of the polylinker segments in the pEGFP-NC vector. For the creation of stable populations of PrP-expressing cells, BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with pSinRep21 plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 24–48 h later were transferred to medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. After ∼1 week (at which time all cells in mock-transfected cultures had been killed), antibiotic-resistant cells were expanded, and frozen stocks were prepared. Cells were maintained as a population without cloning in 5 μg/ml puromycin. All experiments were performed on cells that had been passaged <10 times. BHK cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, minimal essential medium vitamins, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the experiments shown in Fig. 10, PrP-EGFP constructs in pcDNA3 were introduced into BHK cells using LipofectAMINE, and cells were analyzed 24–48 h later. The experiment shown in Fig. 7 utilized stably transfected lines of CHO cells, described previously (11Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

To visualize surface PrP, stably transfected CHO cells expressing the indicated PrP molecules were stained with antibody P45-66 prior to fixation and application of Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (unpermeabilized; left-hand panels). To visualize internal PrP, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with antibody 3F4 followed by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (permeabilized; right-hand panels). The scale bar, applicable to all panels, is 50 μm. The human homologs of the PrP mutations are associated with the following diseases: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (PG14), Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (P101L and F197S/M128V), and fatal familial insomnia (D177N/M128).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Monoclonal antibody 3F4 was used at dilutions of 1:5000 for Western blotting and 1:500 for immunofluorescence staining. Polyclonal antibody P45-66 was raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 45–66 of mouse PrP (10Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The serum was used at a dilution of 1:250 for immunofluorescence staining, and the affinity-purified antibodies were used at a concentration of 4–8 μg/ml for EM immunogold labeling. We utilized, as an ER marker, antibodies against protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), either a rabbit polyclonal antiserum from Peter Arvan (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) or a mouse monoclonal antibody from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), both at a dilution of 1:200. We utilized, as a Golgi marker, the plasmid pEYFP (CLONTECH), which was introduced into cells by transient transfection, or a polyclonal antibody against giantin (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ), which was used at a dilution of 1:1000. To visualize lysosomes, we incubated cells with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) at a concentration of 62 nm for 2 h at 37 °C prior to fixation. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes and grown for 24 h to 50% confluence. For surface staining of PrP, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with antibody 3F4 diluted in 2% goat serum and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by washing with PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose, and PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, blocked for 1 h with 2% goat serum and PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted 1:300 in blocking solution. Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on microscope slides in 50% glycerol and PBS or Cytoseal-60 (Stephens Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). For staining of internal PrP and organelle markers, cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose, and PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized for 1 min at room temperature with 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS, and washed again with PBS. Blocking, incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, and mounting were carried out as described above, except that the primary antibody was diluted in blocking solution, and Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody was used for some double-labeling experiments. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser confocal scanning system. Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Figures show single optical slices through the cells. For live-cell imaging of PrP-EGFP, cells were grown on 22 × 22-mm No. 1 glass coverslips, which were then mounted with vacuum grease on glass slides to produce a flow chamber and viewed with a 63 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective in a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright microscope. Continuous confocal imaging was achieved with a Yokagawa tandem spinning disc device (Solamere Technologies, Salt Lake City, UT). Live images were captured at magnification × 10 from the Yokagawa device using a highly intensified CCD camera (Solamere Technologies). The analog video signal from the CCD was further intensified, amplified, and smoothed by eight-frame averaging with a Dage-MTI DSP 2000 video image processor. Images were recorded in time-lapse mode at one/s on a Panasonic TQ3038 optical memory disc recorder. For Z-series reconstruction and compression, images were obtained at video rates while manually focusing through the cell, and the resultant analog video sequences were compressed to single images with an analog video peak storage device (Model 493, Colorado Video Inc., Boulder, CO). The resultant single-frame C-series projections were transferred to Mac computers as 640 × 480 pixel images with a Targa A-D converter and were then manipulated and pseudo-colored in green with Adobe Photoshop. Cells were grown to confluence in plastic tissue culture dishes, washed with PBS, detached with 5 mm EDTA and PBS, and fixed for 2 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Cells were then rinsed in PBS, embedded in 10% gelatin, and processed for ultramicrotomy as described (27Haney P.M. Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ultrathin frozen sections were incubated with blocking buffer containing 10% goat serum in PBS, then with affinity-purified antibody P45-66 for 2 h, and finally with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 12-nm gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h. After washing, sections were stained with uranyl acetate and embedded in methyl cellulose. Sections were viewed on a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. To assay the detergent insolubility of PrP, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm EDTA). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min, followed by ultracentrifugation at 186,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet from the second centrifugation, containing detergent-insoluble PrP, was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Detergent-soluble PrP was precipitated from the supernatant by addition of 0.05 volumes of 10% SDS and 4 volumes of methanol at −20 °C. PrP was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibody 3F4 and ECL detection. To assay the proteinase K resistance of PrP, cells were lysed with PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% Sarkosyl, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protein concentration of the lysate was assayed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 300 μg of total protein from each sample were incubated with proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, after which proteins were precipitated with methanol as described above, and PrP was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibody 3F4. To assay release of PrP by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), confluent cultures of cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with PIPLC (Glyko, Novato, CA) at a concentration 1 unit/ml in Opti-MEM for 2 h at 4 °C. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to remove loose cells, and proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with methanol. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cells were lysed directly in sample buffer. PrP was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibody 3F4. To maximize our ability to visualize the subcellular localization of PrP in cultured cells, we utilized a high level expression system driven by a replicon derived from Sindbis, a cytoplasmic RNA virus belonging to the Alphavirus group (23Agapov E.V. Frolov I. Lindenbach B.D. Prágai B.M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Frolov I. Agapov E. Hoffman T.A. Pragai B.M. Lippa M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3854-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replicon contains a promoter that controls replication of full-length viral RNA and two subgenomic promoters, one of which drives expression of the protein of interest, and the other expression of the enzyme puromycin N-acetyltransferase, which confers resistance to the antibiotic puromycin. This system does not result in the production of infectious viral particles, an important biohazard consideration, since genes for viral structural proteins are absent. Since replication of Sindbis virus in most cell types results in substantial cellular damage within 24–48 h, we employed a replicon that carries a mutation in the nsP2 gene encoding one of the nonstructural proteins. This mutation renders the replicon nontoxic in BHK cells and allows the cells to be propagated indefinitely without apparent cytopathology (23Agapov E.V. Frolov I. Lindenbach B.D. Prágai B.M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,24Frolov I. Agapov E. Hoffman T.A. Pragai B.M. Lippa M. Schlesinger S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3854-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BHK cells were transfected with a DNA version of the replicon and, after selection with puromycin, were maintained as an uncloned population to avoid clonal artifacts. To avoid the appearance of mutations that can occur during RNA replication, all analyses were performed on cells that had been carried for <10 passages. We initially focused on cells expressing either WT PrP or PG14 PrP, a mutant containing a nine-octapeptide insertion associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that we have previously characterized in CHO cells, PC12 cells, and transgenic mice (12Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that both PrP molecules were correctly processed despite high levels of expression. As shown in Fig. 1 A, WT and PG14 PrPs were expressed at similar levels in BHK cells using the Sindbis replicon. These levels were ∼10-fold higher than those in the lines of stably transfected CHO cells that we have used in previous studies in which PrP synthesis was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Both proteins were efficiently processed in BHK cells to yield monoglycosylated (33 kDa) and diglycosylated (35–40 kDa) species, with a relatively small proportion of unglycosylated polypeptide (28 kDa). The glycosylated species were quantitatively converted to the 28-kDa form by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (data not shown), confirming the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. We next tested whether PG14 PrP synthesized in BHK cells acquired the distinctive biochemical characteristics we have previously documented for mutant PrPs expressed at lower levels in other cell types. These properties, which are reminiscent of PrPSc, include detergent insolubility; proteinase K resistance; and resistance to the bacterial enzyme PIPLC, which cleaves the C-terminal GPI anchor (11Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,14Narwa R. Harris D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8770-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to WT PrP, which remained entirely in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of detergent lysates, PG14 PrP was partially insoluble, with about half found in the pellet (Fig. 1 B). PG14 PrP was also resistant to digestion with low concentrations of proteinase K, yielding a protease-resistant fragment (PrP27–30) after treatment with 0.5–1 μg/ml proteinase K, a concentration range in which WT PrP was completely digested (Fig. 1 C). Finally, treatment of intact cells with PIPLC released about half of the WT protein, but none of the mutant protein (Fig. 1 D). Thus, WT and PG14 PrPs expressed at high levels in BHK cells using the Sindbis replicon are correctly processed, and the mutant protein displays typical PrPSc-like properties. To visualize PrP on the cell surface, living cells were stained with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 and then fixed and reacted with Alexa 488 (green) secondary antibody without permeabilization. Despite equivalent expression levels by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A), virtually all cells synthesizing PG14 PrP showed much weaker surface staining than those expressing WT PrP (Fig. 2). As a negative control, untransfected BHK cells showed no detectable staining. The difference in surface staining between WT and mutant PrPs is likely to be caused by a decreased amount of the mutant protein on the plasma membrane, rather than by inaccessibility of the 3F4 epitope, for the following reasons. First, permeabilization of fixed cells with Triton X-100 prior to immunostaining revealed intracellular deposits of PG14 PrP (see below), implying that the mutant protein is not intrinsically unreactive with the primary antibody. Second, treatment of fixed cells with guanidine HCl to enhance immunoreactivity of PrP (29Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) did not increase surface or internal staining of the mutant protein (data not shown). Third, PG14 PrP-EGFP fusion proteins displayed the same lack of surface fluorescence (see below), even though these molecules do not require antibody staining for visualization.

Here we describe the structure-based design of a selective inhibitor of SKCa2. Leiurotoxin I (Lei) and PO5, peptide toxins that share the RXCQ motif, potently blocked human SKCa2 and SKCa3 but not SKCa1, whereas maurotoxin, Pi1, Tsκ, and PO1 were ineffective. Lei blocked these channels more potently than PO5 because of the presence of Ala1, Phe2, and Met7. By replacing Met7 in the RXCQ motif of Lei with the shorter, unnatural, positively charged diaminobutanoic acid (Dab), we generated Lei-Dab7, a selective SKCa2 inhibitor (K d = 3.8 nm) that interacts with residues in the external vestibule of the channel. SKCa3 was rendered sensitive to Lei-Dab7 by replacing His521 with the corresponding SKCa2 residue (Asn367). Intracerebroventricular injection of Lei-Dab7 into mice resulted in no gross central nervous system toxicity at concentrations that specifically blocked SKCa2 homotetramers. Lei-Dab7 will be a useful tool to investigate the functional role of SKCa2 in mammalian tissues.

Apamin, a peptide from bee venom, exhibits only 10-fold selectivity for human SKCa2 over human SKCa1 or SKCa3 (3Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P.

The peptide toxin Lei (also known as scyllatoxin) from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, currently the most specific inhibitor of SKCa2, exhibits ∼200-fold selectivity for human SKCa2 (15Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 627-637Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) over SKCa1 (25Stroebaek D. Joergensen T.D. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), although its affinity for SKCa3 had not been determined. This study describes the guided design and electrophysiological characterization of a novel Lei analog that selectively blocks SKCa2 homotetramers with low nanomolar affinity. Our strategy to design a specific inhibitor of the SKCa2 channel exploited an approach used previously to develop selective blockers of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 channels (27Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

In this approach, a potent yet non-selective inhibitor of the target channel is the starting template. Specificity for the desired channel is engineered into the peptide on the basis of experimentally determined differences in its interaction with the target channel and other channels. Using Lei and a closely related peptide PO5 as templates, and by comparing the potencies of the native and mutant toxins for SKCa1, SKCa2, and SKCa3, we delineated the channel-binding surfaces of these toxins. Lei-Dab7 was designed to target a structural feature unique to the Lei-SKCa2 interaction surface. N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acid derivatives, Fmoc-amide resin, and chemical reagents used for peptide synthesis were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Shelton, CO), Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland), and Neosystem Laboratoire (Strasbourg, France). Solvents were analytical grade products from SDS (Peypin, France). The various peptides were synthesized by the stepwise solid-phase method (29Merrifield B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) using a peptide synthesizer (Model 433A, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The side-chain protecting groups used for trifunctional residues were: 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchromane-6-sulfonyl for Arg and homoarginine; tert-butyloxycarbonyl for Orn, Lys, and homolysine, and 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-yliden)-3-methylbutyl for Dab and diaminopropionic acid (Dapa). The reduced peptides were dissolved at 1 mm in 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, and stirred under air to allow folding/oxidation (48 h, 25 °C). The folded/oxidized toxins and their structural analogs were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), C18 Aquapore ODS 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm). The homogeneity (>99%) and identity of the peptides were verified by: (i) analytical C18reversed-phase HPLC, (ii) amino acid content determination after acidolysis, and (iii) mass analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Jurkat E6–1, COS-7, and PC12 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Jurkat E6–1 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 10 mm HEPES at densities of 1–9 × 105 in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. COS-7 and PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine and split twice weekly. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. The cloning of human SKCa3containing 19 polyglutamines in the N terminus (GenBankTMAF031815, AJ251016) and IKCa1(GenBankTMAF033021) has been reported previously (30Chandy K.G. Fantino E.

The full coding region of SKCa1 was amplified from human brain total RNA using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with an engineered 5′ HindIII site near the start codon and a 3′ BamHI site near the termination codon and was cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to createGFP-SKCa1. PCR was used to generate mutant SKCa3 channels (28Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with KpnI andBamHI and cloned into KpnI andBamHI-cut GFP-SKCa3. All clones were verified by sequencing. DNA for transfection was prepared with the QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) Miniprep kit. Human SKCa2 in pcDNA3 was a generous gift from Dr. Bernard Attali (Tel Aviv University, Sackler School of Medicine, Israel). COS-7 cells were plated in culture chambers (5 × 105cells/chamber), and 12–24 h later, cells were transiently transfected using FuGeneTM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the respective DNA in serum-free OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. GFP-positive cells were used for electrophysiological studies at 48 h following transfection. Typical transfection efficiencies using this protocol were 40–70%. PC12 cells were plated overnight on glass coverslips prior to use. Cell lines stably expressing mKv1.1, mKv1.3, and hKv1.5, hSlo, and RBL cells expressing endogenous rKir 2.1 were used for the selectivity screen as described previously (28Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were studied in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. The holding potential in all experiments was −80 mV. For measurement of IKCa, SKCa, and BKCa currents, we used an internal pipette solution containing (in mm) 145 potassium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 K2EGTA, and 8.5 CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7.2, 290–310 mOsm. KV currents were recorded with a fluoride-based internal solution. To reduce currents from native chloride channels in COS-7, sodium aspartate Ringer was used as an external solution (in mm) 160 sodium aspartate, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, 290–310 mOsm. For Jurkat T cells, potassium aspartate Ringer was used as an external solution with K+ instead of Na+(164.5 mm K+). SKCa currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from −120 to 40 mV applied every 10 s, and the reduction of slope conductance at −80 mV by the toxin was taken as a measure of channel block. BKCacurrents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from −80 to 80 mV applied every 30 s, and channel block measured at 35 mV. The inward rectifier (rKir 2.1) in RBL cells was studied in sodium aspartate Ringer with a potassium aspartate-based pipette solution containing 50 nm free Ca2+. Lei-Dab7 was administered to 25-g C57/BL6 mice via the intracerebroventricular route, and the LD50 was determined (33Behrens B. Karber C. Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmakol. 1935; 177: 379-388Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Groups of four mice per dose were injected with 5 μl of the peptide solution containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Six peptide toxins from scorpion venom have been identified as SKCa channel blockers based on125I-apamin displacement studies on rat brain synaptosomes (34Fajloun Z. Carlier E. Lecomte C. Geib S.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As the first step in our strategy to design a specific SKCa2 inhibitor, we compared the potency of Lei with that of PO5, a toxin that differs from Lei only at positions 1, 2, 7, and 24 (Fig. 1), in blocking Jurkat SKCa2. Symmetric internal and external K+ solutions were used to induce the inward component of the SKCa2 current. Following break-in with 1 μm Ca2+ in the pipette solution, SKCa2 currents were seen at negative potentials. At potentials more positive than −40 mV, K+ currents were mainly due to Kv1.3 with minimal contribution from SKCa2 (Fig.3 A, left). The SKCa2 component was blocked by Lei and PO5, whereas the Kv1.3 current was unaffected (Fig. 3 A, left). Dose-response curves showed that Lei blocked Jurkat SKCa2 with K d values consistent with published data on the cloned and native channel (15Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol.

Lei and PO5 were next evaluated on cloned SKCa1 and SKCa3 expressed in COS-7 cells. SKCa1 (Fig. 3 A, middle) and SKCa3 (Fig. 3 A, right) K+ currents elicited with 1 μm Ca2+ in the pipette solution reversed at −80 mV in the presence of external sodium Ringer. Lei and PO5 blocked SKCa3 but were ineffective on SKCa1 (Fig. 3 A and Table I). Comparison of the dose-response curves of SKCa3 showed Lei to be 25-fold more effective than PO5 (Fig. 3 B and Table I).

PO5-V24D blocked SKCa2 and SKCa3 with a potency comparable with native PO5 (Fig.4 A). PO5-T1A, PO5-V2F, and PO5-R7M blocked SKCa2 with potencies approaching that of Lei. The improved potency of all three PO5 mutants to nearly that of Lei suggests that any of the indicated alterations in the side chains at these positions may allow PO5 to fit more tightly within the channel-binding pocket due to either shorter side-chain size or local change in backbone conformation (37Rajamohan F.

The reverse mutation in Lei (Lei-M7R) reduced potency on both SKCa2 and SKCa3 (data not shown). These results indicate that Ala1, Phe2, and Met7 underlie the increased affinity of Lei over PO5 for SKCa2 and SKCa3. These three residues form a localized binding pocket that may represent an important contact point with SKCa channels (Fig.5, A and B).Figure 5Space-filling models of Lei (left) and PO5 (right) showing residues at positions 1, 2, 7, and 24 (A) and the conserved RXCQ motif (B). X = methionine in Lei and arginine in PO5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Positions 6 and 7 of Lei are part of the conserved RXCQ motif (Fig. 1). To define the role of the residues in this motif, a series of Lei mutants was made at positions 6 and 7 to probe the toxin-channel interaction. Charge-neutralization mutations at position 6 that retained size (Arg6 → leucine or citrulline) reduced toxin potency 70–180-fold for both channels (Fig.6), indicating the need for a charged residue at this position. Substitution of the unbranched lysine at position 6, a mutation that retained charge but decreased size, also reduced toxin affinity for both channels (20–35-fold), whereas the introduction of the positively charged, bulky branched unnatural amino acid, homoarginine, caused a 1000-fold decrease in toxin potency (Fig.6). Thus, substitutions at position 6 are not tolerated, and the arginine has the optimum size, charge, and branching required for interaction with SKCa channels. Furthermore, when residues at positions 6 and 7 were exchanged, the Lei-R6M+M7R double mutant was considerably less potent than the native toxin on SKCa2 and SKCa3 (K d = 9.5 and 65 nm, respectively), establishing the importance of the relative locations of Arg6 and Met7 in the RXCQ motif. We next turned our attention to position 7 in the RXCQ motif and found our first promising lead. Introduction of positively charged lysine at position 7 (Lei-M7K) yielded a mutant that blocked SKCa2 35-fold more potently than SKCa3 (Fig.7). In an attempt to further enhance this difference, we generated two additional Lei mutants in which Met7 was replaced by smaller positively charged unnatural amino acids diaminopropionate (Lei-Dapa7) and diaminobutanoate (Lei-Dab7). Lei-Dapa7 blocked Jurkat SKCa2 ∼350-fold more potently than SKCa3, whereas Lei-Dab7 was ∼650-fold more effective. Similar results were obtained with the cloned SKCa2 channel expressed in COS-7 cells (Table II). Lei-Dab7 was also ineffective against hSKCa1, hIKCa1, hSlo, KV, and Kir channels, establishing its specificity for SKCa2 (Table II).Table IISelectivity of Lei-Dab7 on a panel of channels K d indicated on the rightChannelLei-Dab7 K dKCa channels hSKCa16000 ± 800 nm hSKCa2 (Jurkat)3.8 ± 0.5 nm hSKCa2 (cloned)5.5 ± 0.7 nm hSKCa32500 ± 500 nm hIKCa1No effect at 1 μm hSloNo effect at 1 μmKV channels mKv1.1No effect at 1 μm mKv1.3 (cloned)No effect at 1 μm hKv1.3 (Jurkat)No effect at 1 μm hKv1.5No effect at 1 μm rKv1.2 and Kv2.1 (PC12)No effect at 1 μmInward rectifier rKir2.1 (RBL cells)No effect at 1 μm Open table in a new tab Because Lei-Dab7 and apamin share the critical RXCQ channel-binding motif (Figs.1 and 2), it is likely that Lei-Dab7, like apamin (39Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), binds to residues in the external S5-Pore-S6 region of the channel. Human SKCa2 and SKCa3 differ at only two positions in the pore region (Fig. 8 A). To determine whether one or both these residues contribute to Lei-Dab7selectivity (Fig. 8, B and C), we replaced these two residues in SKCa3 (Val485 and His521) with the corresponding residues of SKCa2 (Ala331 and Asn367), individually or together. Lei-Dab7blocked SKCa3-H521N (K d = 20 ± 4.7 nm) and SKCa3-V485A + H521N (K d = 7.5 ± 1.2 nm) with nearly the same potency as SKCa2 (Fig. 8, D and E, and Table II), whereas SKCa3-V485A did not produce functional channels. In mutant cycle studies with the SKCa3-H521N and SKCa3-V485A+H521N mutants, residue 7 of Lei-Dab7 was found to couple tightly with His521 (ΔΔG = 2.4), suggesting that these two residues lie in close proximity to each other. We conclude that Lei-Dab7 binds to the external vestibule of SKCa channels and that Asn367 (the residue corresponding to His521 of hSKCa3) in SKCa2 contributes to Lei-Dab7 selectivity. To evaluate the central nervous system effects of specific in vivo blockade of SKCa2 homotetramers, Lei-Dab7 was administered via the intracerebroventricular route to mice. At a concentration (10 ng (or 300 nm assuming a brain liquid volume of 10 μl)) that would selectively block >99% of SKCa2 homotetramers, no gross central nervous system toxicity was observed. At a higher concentration (50 ng (or 1500 nm)), all six animals became hyperexcitable, developed convulsions followed by paralysis lasting 15 h, and then fully recovered. At much higher concentrations (80 ng (or 2400 nm)), 50% of the animals died within 2 h, and 100% lethality was observed in 1 h at 100 ng (3 μm). The neurotoxicity observed at Lei-Dab7 concentrations higher than 1500 nm may be due to the blockade of SKCa1 and/or SKCa3 homotetrameric channels (Table II), although we cannot exclude the contribution of heteromultimeric SKCa channels containing SKCa2 subunits. Functional SKCa channels are tetramers of SKCa1–3 subunits that can assemble as homo- or heterooligomers (39Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Heterooligomers are likely to exist natively given the overlapping patterns of distribution of SKCa1–3 in the central nervous system. SKCa1 and SKCa2 are abundant in the hippocampus, whereas the medial habenula has both SKCa2 and SKCa3 (10Rimini R. Rimland J.M. Terstappen G.C. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 218-220Google Scholar,16Stocker M.

In this study, we used a structure-guided approach to develop Lei-Dab7, a novel peptide that blocks SKCa2 homotetramers with nanomolar potency and exhibits 650-fold or greater selectivity over related homooligomeric channels. Heterooligomeric SKCa channels may exhibit intermediate sensitivity for Lei-Dab7 compared with their homotetrameric counterparts as has been shown with apamin on recombinant heterotetramers of SKCa1 and SKCa2 (39Ishii T.M.

Lei-Dab7 may also help define the role of SKCa2 in the retina, liver, melanocytes, immune system, and fetal heart. The subunit composition of SKCa heterooligomers in diverse mammalian tissues may also be determined by using Lei-Dab7 in much the same way as radiolabeled peptide toxins selective for a particular KV subunit have proven useful in assessing the subunit composition of brain heteromeric KV channels (40Scott V.E.

https://openalex.org/W2098444271,"The ATM protein kinase regulates the cell's response to DNA damage by regulating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. ATM phosphorylates several proteins involved in the DNA-damage response, including p53. We have examined the mechanism by which ATM regulates p53's transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that reintroduction of ATM into AT cells restores the activation of p53 by the radio-mimetic agent bleomycin. Further, p53 activation is lost when a kinase inactive ATM is used, or if the N-terminal of ATM is deleted. In addition, AT cells stably expressing ATM showed decreased sensitivity to Ionizing Radiation-induced cell killing, whereas cells expressing kinase inactive ATM or N-terminally deleted ATM were indistinguishable from AT cells. Finally, single point-mutations of serines 15, 20, 33 or 37 did not individually block the ATM-dependent activation of p53 transcriptional activity by bleomycin. However, double mutations of either serines 15 and 20 or serines 33 and 37 blocked the ability of ATM to activate p53. Our results indicate that the N-terminal of ATM and ATM's kinase activity are required for activation of p53's transcriptional activity and restoration of normal sensitivity to DNA damage. In addition, activation of p53 by ATM requires multiple serine residues in p53's transactivation domain."

BTK has an N-terminal region consisting of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a proline-rich TEC homology domain.

The SH2 domain mediates binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide motifs on other molecules, and the SH3 domain mediates binding to proline-rich motifs. Mutations in the SH1 domain, SH2 domain, as well as the PH domain of human BTK have been found to cause maturational blocks at early stages of B cell ontogeny leading to XLA (9Vihinen M.

The molecular mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Tyr-551 within the kinase domain leads to the initial activation of BTK has not been deciphered. Similarly, there is no structural understanding of how XLA is caused by various mutations within the BTK kinase domain. In this paper, we report the x-ray crystal structure of the kinase domain of murine BTK to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and shows the architecture of a typical kinase and reveals a unique mechanism of activation. The N-terminal lobe (residues 397–475) contains five strands of antiparallel β sheets and one α helix. The C-terminal lobe (residues 479–659) contains a 4-helix bundle flanked by a short antiparallel β sheet and four additional helices. The N-terminal and C-terminal lobes are connected by a linker region (residues 475–479) and form a cleft at the ATP binding site. In contrast to previous predictions, the catalytic cleft of the BTK-KD is not occluded by the A loop or by any other portion of the KD. The A loop in the unphosphorylated BTK-KD structure adopts a unique noninhibitory conformation very similar to the active state conformation of phosphorylated LCK-KD, and hence does not limit substrate access to the active site. Because of the inactive conformation of helix C, however, the enzyme is not in the active state. Based on the BTK structure, we propose that the trans-phosphorylation of Tyr-551 can lead to BTK activation by triggering an exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs from Glu-445/Arg-544 to Glu-445/Lys-430 and subsequent relocation of helix αC of the N-terminal lobe. We have also evaluated the functional consequences of kinase domain mutations encountered in XLA patients and gained novel structural insights into the molecular mechanism of XLA. The murine BTK-KD (residues 397–659) gene was amplified from wild type BTK by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (BTK-KD/pCR2.1) using the Invitrogen TA cloning procedure. Subsequently, the BTK-KD/pCR2.1 was digested completely with NcoI and HindIII. The fragment was purified and ligated to the pFastBac HTb donor plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by digestion to generate pFastBac HTb:BTK-KD. The produced vector was then used to generate a baculoviral stock using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression was checked by anti-BTK-c20 (San Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-His6. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM containing 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. The cell with a density of 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml was infected with the recombinant BTK-KD-containing virus with a 5-fold multiplicity of infection. 54 h postinfection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then flash frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and finally stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were thawed in a 37 °C water bath, resuspended in 5 volumes of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then sonicated for 1 min and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded on the nickel column, which was equilibrated with a solution containing 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The column was washed with a 20-bed volume of buffer A (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm KCl, 15–20 mmimidazole, and 2 mm DTT), then washed with a 10-bed volume of buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1 m KCl, and 2 mm DTT). Afterward, it was washed again with a 2-bed volume of buffer A. The protein was eluted with buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 150 mmimidazole, and 2 mm DTT). The fractions that contain BTK-KD were pooled together, dialyzed against a solution that contained 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Then the protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml, digested with 6 µg/mg rTEV protease at 4 °C overnight, and then concentrated to 3 ml, which was then loaded on a Superdex 200 column (26/60), equilibrated with a solution of 20 mm Trs/HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. The pure BTK-KD fraction was concentrated to 12 mg/ml for crystallization. The pure protein at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was used for dynamic light scattering studies. The data indicated that the BTK-KD sample was monodisperse as measured immediately after purification and became polydisperse in 30 min at room temperature. Therefore, all of the crystallization trays were set up at 4 °C. The purified BTK-KD was crystallized using the hanging drop method, with 2 µl of protein and 1 µl of reservoir solution in the drop and equilibrated with 600 µl of reservoir solution, which contains 20% polyethylene glycol 1000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT using VDP trays (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA). The crystals began to appear in a week. It took 2–3 weeks to reach the full size of 200 × 200 × 200 µm. Two native data sets and two heavy atom derivative data sets were collected using a CCD detector and high intensity synchrotron radiation source at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). Data statistics are summarized in TableI. One crystal was soaked for 24 h in 5 mm K2Au(CN)2, and another crystal was soaked in 0.1 mm ethylene mercury phosphate. All crystals were flash cooled and kept in liquid nitrogen with 30% polyethylene glycol 1000 solution as a natural cryoprotectant. All data sets were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (20Otwinnowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) and then analyzed and scaled using the CCP4 program suite (21Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar).

Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The self-rotation function calculation failed to indicate any noncrystallographic symmetry, suggesting that there is either no noncrystallographic symmetry or that the noncrystallographic symmetry axis is too close to the crystallographic axis (in fact, the 2-fold axis was later found to be close to the x axis). The search models of polyglycine and polyalanine from crystal structures of kinase domains including LCK, insulin receptor kinase (IRK), fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase, haematopoietic cell kinase, and SRC kinase, as well as the homology BTK-KD model revealed a clear solution in rotation function searches with a top peak 10–25% higher than the second solution, depending on the search model used in the calculation. Interestingly, the search model of LCK with the A loop yielded better results, but the apo-IRK model with the A loop produced noisy results. This agrees with the final refined BTK structure in which the A loop in BTK is similar to phospho-LCK but not to IRK. The following translational searches using both the polyglycine/polyalanine models and the models that maintain conserved residues failed to produce a convincing solution with confidence, probably because of the existence of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the significant difference between the search models and the target structure. Meanwhile, a heavy atom derivative search using a Patterson function calculation (using the RSPS program) followed by difference Fourier calculation (FFT) in the CCP4 suite (21Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) based on the data sets from the ethylene mercury phosphate-soaked crystal and the K2Au(CN)2-soaked crystal led to the identification of four mercury sites and six gold sites which were then used to phase all reflections at 4.0 Å and above by MLPHARE. The correct hand of the protein was determined by a sign of anomalous occupancies during the heavy atom site refinement. The map calculated based on the combination of phase information from the mercury and gold derivatives including anomalous diffraction data of mercury atoms in the ethylene mercury phosphate derivative was subjected to several rounds of phase improvement using the DM program with a solvent flattening and histogram matching method. The improved maps demonstrated clear boundaries between the target protein and solvent region. The map indicated two BTK molecules in one asymmetric unit. Therefore, two polyglycine/polyalanine kinase search models were fit manually into the electron density, which revealed how the two molecules are related by noncrystallographic symmetry. The matrix that relates the orientation of the two molecules was generated and then refined to two different matrices that corresponded to the N-terminal lobe domain and the C-terminal lobe domain, respectively, using MAMA and 6D_IMP (23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar, 24Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The refined matrices were then used in multidomain averaging of the electron density map using 6D_AVE. The final map was improved considerably from the previous map, and the α helix and β strand structures and many large amino acids were clearly visible. The 500 residues and ∼4000 atoms for two BTK molecules based on the BTK amino acid sequence were fit readily into the electron density. The entire amino acid sequences of BTK fragments from residue 397 to residue 659 were mostly traceable in the electron density except for a few disordered residues on the surface. The kinase domain structures of the two BTK molecules were refined using simulated annealing in X-PLOR (27Brünger A.T. XPLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), and numerous structural adjustments were performed with the help of CHAIN (28Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 244-245Crossref Google Scholar) and O programs (29Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C. Ealick S. Crystallographic Computing and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer, New York1989: 120-129Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. We compared the BTK crystal structure with those of other kinase domains including cAPK (pdb access code: 1atp), LCK (3lck), cSRC(2src), haematopoietic cell kinase (1qcf), fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase (1agw), and IRK (1irk for the apo structure and 1ir3 for the ternary complex) using CHAIN and O. His-tagged BTK-KD was purified using a nickel column, digested with rTEV protease to cleave off the His tag, and concentrated, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the protein was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis using an anti-BTK antibody. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis andin vitro kinase assays of the purified BTK-KD showed that it is not phosphorylated but is capable of undergoing autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylating a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Igα in a 5-min kinase reaction. Purified BTK-KD was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and crystallized using the hanging drop method. The obtained crystals were analyzed using a CCD detector and high intensity synchrotron radiation source. The x-ray crystal structure of BTK-KD was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement. Data statistics are summarized in Table I. The final structure has been refined at 2.1 Å resolution to an R value of 22% with all amino acid residues falling into favored or generously allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (except for glycine residues), as indicated by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The average B factor for all non-hydrogen atoms is 21 Å2 and is below 20 Å2 for more than half of the protein atoms. Two short regions that are disordered in the electron density map include part of the β1 strand (residues 409–412) and part of the A loop (residues 550 and 555). Other regions that display a visible electron density in the original map and have high B factors include the loop from residues 546 to 549, the loops around residue 467, and the N-terminal end of helix C which has B factors mostly in the 20–30 Å2 range. The crystal structure of the BTK-KD in its unphosphorylated state is shown in Fig.1. BTK-KD is packed in a dimeric form in the crystal lattice but is present mainly in monomeric form in solution (data not shown). BTK-KD has a two-lobe fold reminiscent of the topology of other PTK kinase domain structures (31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3805) Google Scholar, 32Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 33Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the BTK-KD is labeled in Fig. 1 using the established nomenclature (34Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 35Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). The N-terminal lobe (residues 397–475) contains five strands of antiparallel β sheets (β1–β5) and one α helix (C helix) (shown in yellow, Fig. 1). The C-terminal lobe (residues 479–659) contains a four-helix bundle (αD, αE, αF, and αH) flanked by a short antiparallel β sheet (β6, β8, and β9) and four additional helices (αI, αDE, αEF, and αHI). The N- and C-terminal lobes are connected by a linker region (residues 475–479) and form a cleft at the ATP binding site. The rotation of the N-terminal lobe relative to the C-terminal lobe varies among the different KD structures, and the ATP binding cleft between the two lobes is closed when substrates (or analogs) are bound (22Narayana N. Cox S. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Therefore, both lobes of a KD need to adopt a mandatory closed conformation for the KD to achieve a catalytically active state. Notably, the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated BTK-KD revealed that its N- and C-terminal lobes adopt a closed conformation very similar to the reported conformation of the lobes of the phosphorylated LCK-KD (rms deviation between the backbones of the central portion of β3 and β5 < 1 Å) (34Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and the central regions of the β3 and β5 strands are almost superimposable when the C-terminal lobes are overlaid. However, the β1 and β2 strands, very much like the corresponding β strands of the cAPK-KD, adopt a more “closed” conformation than their counterparts in LCK-KD. The rotation needed to superimpose the N-terminal lobe of the BTK-KD onto the N-terminal lobe the cAPK-KD is only 5.2°, whereas an 11° rotation is required to overlay the N-terminal lobe of the LCK-KD with the N-terminal lobe of the cAPK-KD (22Narayana N. Cox S. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By comparison, the magnitudes of the rotation needed to open the BTK-KD and LCK-KD N-terminal lobes to match the conformation observed in the apo-IRK structure are 22° and 17° (22Narayana N. Cox S. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), respectively. In contrast to the similarity of the closed conformation of their N- and C-terminal lobes, the C-terminal ends of the helix αC in unphosphorylated BTK-KD versus phosphorylated LCK-KD are markedly different. The distance between the Cα position of residue 440 in BTK-KD and its counterpart in LCK is 6.7 Å. From the pivot point at residue 452, helix αC of BTK-KD needs to be rotated toward the ATP binding cleft by 20° to be superimposed onto the helix αC of the LCK-KD. The helix αC in phosphorylated LCK-KD adopts a closed conformation consistent with a catalytically active state (34Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). By comparison, the helix αC of the BTK-KD adopts a more open conformation than that of the LCK-KD. The conformation of helix αC of the BTK-KD is different from the open conformation of helix C in c-SRC as well (see Fig. 2a), in accordance with a unique conformation of the A loop in BTK-KD. Significant structural differences between BTK-KD and LCK-KD were also found in helices αDE, αEF, αG, and αI (which differed in location by ∼2 Å), and in the glycine loop (β1–β2). The β1 strand of the glycine loop is highly flexible and was observed in two distinct alternative conformations in the BTK-KD crystal structure. One conformation of the β1 strand is similar to the conformation of the corresponding β1 strand in cAPK-KD, whereas the other conformation places residues 410–412 in a position that allows the triphosphate of ATP to bind BTK molecule A. A portion of the glycine loop is disordered in BTK molecule B, which is related to molecule A by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The adopted conformation of the invariant PTK residues 439DFG441 in BTK-KD is consistent with the conformation of the same residues in the apo-IRK structure (37Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Although it is highly mobile (B factors of 30–40 Å2), the A loop of BTK-KD, except for residues 553–556, is visible within the electron density map. The A loop of the BTK-KD is structurally very similar to the A loop in the phosphorylated LCK-KD and the ligated IRK-KD structures, which contain a phosphorylated tyrosine residue (see Fig. 2a; IRK is not shown). Arg-544, Glu-445, and Tyr-551 are well defined in electron densities of the 2Fo-Fc map (Fig. 1B). Based on the distance and geometry in the refined structure, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-551 interacts with Arg-544, Ser-553, and a water molecule via hydrogen bonds, and it possibly interacts electrostatically with the nearby Arg-520 residue. The aromatic ring of Tyr-551 has van der Waals contacts with Val-546 and Phe-574. Tyr-551 of the A loop of the BTK-KD is not phosphorylated, but it interacts with Arg-544 as is the case for the phospho-IRK and phospho-LCK structures. The structural difference is that the unphosphorylated Tyr-551 in the A loop of the BTK-KD interacts with Arg-544 via a hydroxyl group rather than through a phosphate (see Fig.2a). The crystal structure of the BTK-KD indicates that the A loop is essentially in a closed noninhibitory conformation (Fig. 2,a and b). Hence, only minor structural adjustments would be expected for Tyr-551 and the surrounding residues upon Tyr-551 phosphorylation. Similarly, only minor structural cha"

The active ArcA-P binds to the promoter regions of target genes, thereby regulating their transcriptional activities. The phosphoryl group of ArcA-P is unstable with a half-life of 30 min. However, we were able to inhibit the dephosphorylation for more than 12 h by the addition of EDTA; this allowed us to characterize ArcA-P.

ArcA phosphorylated by either ArcB or carbamyl phosphate multimerizes to form a tetramer of dimers; this multimer binds to the ArcA DNA binding site. Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis and nitrocellulose-filter binding analyses indicated that the ArcA multimer is composed of both ArcA-P and ArcA in a ratio, 1:1. The ArcA(D54E) mutant protein was unable to be phosphorylated by ArcB. This defect resulted in the inability of ArcA(D54E) to form a multimer or to bind to the ArcA DNA binding site. These results indicate that phosphorylation of ArcA induces multimerization prior to DNA binding, and the multimerization is a prerequisite for binding.

Recently, it was reported that ArcA-P binds to oriC, the origin of chromosomal replication, thereby specifically inhibiting in vitro E. coli chromosomal replication (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been reported that, in DNase I protection assays, ArcA-P protects a wide region of DNA, more than 60 bp (up to 150 bp in theoriCregion), from the DNase I cleavage (10Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the interaction of ArcA protein with the wide regions of DNA as defined by the DNase I protection assays, and we show that phosphorylation of an ArcA dimer induces formation of an ArcA multimer, consisting of a tetramer of dimers that contains both ArcA and ArcA-P in a 1:1 ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that this multimerization occurs prior to DNA binding.

Other reagents, unless otherwise indicated, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ArcA and ArcB proteins were purified as previously described (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To generate mutant ArcA(D54E) protein, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based site-directed mutagenesis was conducted as recommended by Stratagene. Mutagenic primers (5′-GGTGATCATGGAAATCAATCTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGATTGATTTCCATGATCACC-3′) were designed to incorporate a Glu substitution at Asp-54; PCR was performed using pBADarcA (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as template DNA. Parental DNA templates were removed from the PCR products using DpnI restriction enzyme digestion, then the mixture containing nicked plasmids harboring the desired mutation was transformed into DH5α (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated, and the proper amino acid substitution was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resultant mutated DNA, pBADarcAD54E, was transformed into MC4100ΔarcA (gift from Edmund C. C. Lin) for purification to avoid contamination of wild type protein during purification procedures. ArcA(D54E) protein was purified in the same way as wild type ArcA purification as previously described (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the FastS column step was omitted. Approximately 6.5 mg of ArcA(D54E) protein was purified from 18 liters of MC4100ΔarcA(pBADarcAD54E) culture. Transphosphorylation reactions (TP) containing ArcB and ArcA or ArcA(D54E) were performed as previously described (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 10 µl of TP mixture contained 6 µg of ArcA, 0.6 µg of ArcB, 0.1 mmATP, 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 33 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, 0.5 m EDTA was immediately added to the reaction mixture for a final concentration of 50 mm(except for DNase I protection assays). To visualize the phosphorylated proteins, [γ-32P]ATP was included in the TP mixture. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of gel-loading buffer (20% glycerol, 8% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m EDTA, and 0.003% bromphenol blue). After incubation at 55 °C for 3 min, the mixture was subjected to 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. The phosphorylation reaction of ArcA with carbamyl phosphate (CP) was performed as previously described (11Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA to 50 mm. To construct pBSpfl used for DNA binding assays, the pfl promoter regulatory region of −458 to +23 (10Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the primers, 5′-CGGGGATCCACGCGTTTGCTGCACATCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGAATTCAGCTTTCACACTAACTCTCTC-3′ (BamHI and EcoRI sites are in boldface), usingE. coli genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was digested with both BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of a pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). Gel-shift assays using the 324-bp BamHI/DraI fragment isolated from pBSpfl were performed essentially as previously described (11Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 21.5 fmol of 5′-end-labeled DNA was mixed with 20 µl of TP mixtures containing 50 mm potassium chloride, 2.5 µg of bovine serum albumin, 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), and 10% glycerol. After incubation at 32 °C for 10 min, each sample was loaded onto a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. For the DNase I protection assay, the 532-bpXbaI/XhoI fragment from pBSpfl was 5′-end-labeled at the XbaI restriction site, and the assay was conducted as previously described (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), unless 10 ng of DNase I (in 1.5 µl of H2O) was used. The IEF gel contained 5% polyacrylamide, 9 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% ampholine (pH 4.0–6.0), and 0.4% ampholine (pH 3.0–10.0). 10 mmphosphoric acid and 20 mm sodium hydroxide were used as anolyte and catholyte, respectively. Each of the protein samples was mixed with an equal volume of IEF gel loading buffer (9 murea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% ampholine (pH 4.0–6.0), 0.4% ampholine (pH 3.0–10.0), 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). After removing insoluble materials through centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, samples were loaded to the anode. The gel was run at 150 V for 30 min, followed by 200 V for 2.5 h. TP reaction mixtures containing [γ-32P]ATP were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, HA), equilibrated with buffer A (25 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 2.8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol), followed by an additional washing with 5 ml of this buffer. The filters were then dried, and radioactivities were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Gel filtration analysis was carried out using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, LKB). A Superose 12 column (PC 3.2/30) or Superose 6 column (PC 3.2/30) was equilibrated with buffer A. 30 µl of each indicated reaction mixture was applied to the column and eluted at a flow rate of 40 µl/min. Concentration of proteins in the eluent was monitored by measuring optical density at 280 nm, and 30 µl of each fraction was collected after an initial 0.93 ml was eluted. Each of these fractions was analyzed using IEF gel electrophoresis and gel-shift assays. For glycerol gradient sedimentation, 100 µl of TP or CP mixture was loaded onto 4.5 ml of a 25–45% glycerol gradient in buffer A, followed by a centrifugation for 25 h at 48,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. 110 µl each of fraction was collected from the bottom. ArcA and ArcB proteins were purified as previously described (13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); both purified proteins were active in transphosphorylation reactions (Fig.1). In addition, ArcB-P, which was formed by the autophosphorylation of ArcB in the presence of ATP, was able to phosphorylate ArcA as previously shown (6Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the ArcB protein can function as both a kinase and a phosphatase, it was necessary to optimize the ArcA to ArcB ratio to maximize ArcA-P formation. Using transphosphorylation reactions, we determined that a 10:1 ratio of ArcA to ArcB produced the largest concentration of ArcA-P. Although the ability of ArcB-P protein to phosphorylate ArcA has clearly been established, it is unknown which ArcA amino acid(s) is phosphorylated by ArcB-P. Previously, the ArcA amino acid sequence was compared with other two-component response regulators, revealing a putative phosphorylation site at amino acid 54, an aspartic acid residue (15Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine the importance of Asp-54 in ArcA phosphorylation by ArcB-P. To do this, we constructed the ArcA mutant protein ArcA(D54E), in which Asp-54 of ArcA was substituted with glutamate using site-directed mutagenesis. The ArcA(D54E) mutant protein was purified to near homogeneity using column chromatography. ArcB-P which was able to phosphorylate wild type ArcA was unable to phosphorylate the purified ArcA(D54E) (Fig. 1). Next, we wanted to determine the ability of wild type ArcA and mutant ArcA(D45E) protein to bind the pfl promoter. Under anaerobic conditions, binding of ArcA-P to the pfl promoter induces the expression of pyruvate-formate lyase. Because small phosphoryl donors such as carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate can phosphorylate two-component response regulators in the absence of cognate sensor kinases and ATP (1Parkinson J.S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 9-23Google Scholar), ArcA was incubated with either carbamyl phosphate or ArcB. ArcA-P, phosphorylated by either carbamyl phosphate or ArcB, exhibited efficient binding to the pflpromoter as determined by gel-shift assays (Fig.2A). The ability of ArcA (unphosphorylated) to bind the pfl promoter was also examined; although ArcA was also able to bind the pflpromoter, its binding pattern was different from that of ArcA-P. In addition, ArcA(D54E), incubated with either carbamyl phosphate or ArcB, showed a similar binding pattern to the pfl promoter as ArcA (unphosphorylated). Given the unexpected binding of unphosphorylated ArcA and ArcA(D54E) to the pfl promoter in gel-shift assays, their bindings were examined using DNase I footprinting analysis (Fig. 2B). The ArcA-P formed by incubation with either carbamyl phosphate or ArcB bound to its binding locus, −285 to −208 relative to the start site of transcript P6, in the pfl promoter as shown previously (10Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although a 3-fold excess (600 ng) of unphosphorylated ArcA as compared with the unphosphorylated ArcA (200 ng) in gel-shift assay (Fig. 2A) was used in footprint analysis, the protein did not yield a significant protection from DNase I cleavage. In addition, ArcA(D54E), incubated with either carbamyl phosphate or ArcB, was unable to exhibit the protection. Therefore, the binding of unphosphorylated ArcA or ArcA(D54E) in the gel-shift assays can be attributed to nonspecific binding to DNA. This nonspecific binding persisted in the presence of poly(dI·dC). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of ArcA is required for specific DNA binding, and Asp-54 of ArcA is necessary for proper DNA binding. It has been reported that the phosphoryl group of response regulators such as NtrC (16Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and CheY (17Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21770-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are unstable. We found that ArcA-P rapidly lost its phosphoryl group with a half-life of about 30 min (Fig.3). In addition, the phosphoryl group of ArcB-P also rapidly dissociated. Addition of EDTA immediately following the transphosphorylation reaction prevented the dephosphorylation of both ArcA-P and ArcB-P. In the presence of EDTA, the phosphoryl groups of both phosphorylated proteins did not significantly dissociate for more than 12 h. The effect of EDTA is presumably due to chelation of the Mg2+ ion, which might be a required cofactor in the dephosphorylation process. Therefore, EDTA was added to a concentration of 50 mm for further experiments to stabilize the phosphoryl group. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel electrophoresis separates proteins based on differences in isoelectric points. Because phosphorylation increases the acidity of a protein, a phosphorylated form of a protein can be separated from its non-phosphorylated form using IEF gel electrophoresis. ArcA, possessing a pI value of 5.4, and ArcA(D54E) migrated as a single protein band (Fig. 4A, lanes 1and 4). ArcA-P, phosphorylated by ArcB, yielded an additional band, the migration of which was shifted. Western blot analysis using anti-ArcA serum indicated that the protein bands shown in the IEF gel corresponded to ArcA or its modified forms (Fig.4B). Interestingly, the shifted band was not exhibited in the lane of ArcA(D54E) treated with ArcB. To determine if this was due to an ability of ArcB to phosphorylate ArcA, ArcA and ArcA(D54E) were incubated with ArcB and [γ-32P]ATP, then subjected to IEF gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining or autoradiography (Fig. 4C). The 32P label was incorporated in the shifted ArcA band and was not incorporated into ArcA(D54E). These results indicate that the shift of ArcA incubated with ArcB and [γ-32P]ATP was due to the phosphorylation of ArcA and the shifted band corresponded to ArcA-P. To determine the effect of carbamyl phosphate phosphorylation on ArcA and ArcA(D54E), both proteins were incubated with carbamyl phosphate (Fig. 4A). IEF analysis generated other shifted protein bands, which were not seen following the ArcB treatment. Thearrow in Fig. 4A indicates two close bands; the migration of the lower band was identical to that of the ArcA-P generated by ArcB but not seen in the ArcA(D54E) lane treated with carbamyl phosphate. However, the upper band was also observable in the ArcA(D54E) treated with carbamyl phosphate. These results indicate that carbamyl phosphate modifies amino acids of ArcA other than Asp-54, probably through nonspecific phosphorylation or carbamylation. Because of the lack of resolution in the previous IEF gel electrophoresis, the other bands modified by carbamyl phosphate could not be separated from the ArcA-P band (18Colloms S.D. Alén C. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the arcA gene encodes a 27-kDa polypeptide (6Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ArcA-P footprints have shown that ArcA-P protects wide regions (at least 60 bp) of DNA from DNase I cleavage (10Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated how those wide regions could be bound by the 27-kDa polypeptide of ArcA. ArcA-P (transphosphorylation mixture) and ArcA were subjected to Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography (Fig.5). ArcA eluted as a single peak of ∼50-kDa protein, whereas the transphosphorylation mixture yielded an additional, earlier-eluted peak that contained larger molecular size forms of the protein (Fig. 5A). IEF gel electrophoresis of the peaks revealed that the earlier peak contained both ArcA-P and ArcA, and that the later-eluted peak contained only ArcA (Fig.5B). In gel-shift assays, most (>95%) of thepfl promoter binding activity was recovered in the earlier peak (Fig. 5C). Because the earlier peak contained higher molecular weight forms of the protein, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of ArcA induces multimerization of ArcA prior to DNA binding. Both ArcB (Fig. 5A) and ArcB-P co-eluted at the earlier peak (data not shown). The ArcA treated with carbamyl phosphate also generated two peaks (Fig.6A). In the IEF gel, the band corresponding to ArcA-P (Fig. 4) was seen in the earlier but not the later peak (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the other bands generated by carbamyl phosphate were present in both peaks. Most of thepfl promoter binding activity was recovered from the earlier peak (Fig. 6C). The observation that the earlier peak formed by carbamyl phosphate has an identical retention volume with the earlier peak formed by ArcB (Fig. 5A) excluded the possibility of a complex formation between ArcA-P and ArcB. In addition, the elution profile of untreated ArcA(D54E) was obtained; a single peak with the same retention volume of the later peak of ArcA was generated, but its elution pattern was broader than that of ArcA (Fig. 7). This elution profile of ArcA(D54E) was not influenced by the treatment of ArcB or the carbamyl phosphate. The earlier peaks of ArcA, which were produced by incubation with either ArcB or carbamyl phosphate, contained ArcA-P (Figs. 5 and 6); those peaks were not observed in the elution of similarly treated ArcA(D54E) (Fig. 7, B and C), presumably because the protein could not be phosphorylated by ArcB (Figs. 1 and 4). The identical elution pattern of the earlier peak with that of untreated ArcB (Fig. 7A), and the absence of the earlier peak in the ArcA(D54E) incubated with carbamyl phosphate (Fig.7C) indicated that the earlier peak shown in ArcA(D54E) incubated with ArcB was as due to elution of ArcB (Fig.7B). Multimerization of ArcA-P was confirmed using glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments (Fig.8A). The glycerol gradient sedimentation of ArcA yielded a single peak, whereas ArcA-P, produced by ArcB phosphorylation, yielded two peaks; the slowly sedimenting peak coincided with the ArcA (untreated) peak. These results confirmed that ArcA-P forms multimers as observed in gel-filtration experiments (Figs.5 and 6). The sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radii of the slowly sedimenting and later, respectively, peak were estimated as 3.9 S (Fig.8B) and 3.04 nm (Fig. 8C), respectively. These values predict a molecular mass of the ArcA protein (unphosphorylated) to be 50 kDa, indicating that ArcA is a homodimer of two 27-kDa polypeptides. The sedimentation coefficient as 11.0 S and Stokes radii as 4.92 nm of the fast-sedimenting (Fig. 8B) and earlier, respectively, peak (Fig. 8D) containing ArcA-P predicts a molecular mass of a multimer of 230 kDa. These results suggest that the multimer is a tetramer of ArcA-P dimers or an octamer composed of 27-kDa ArcA-P polypeptides. The earlier peaks comprised multimers containing both ArcA and ArcA-P proteins (Figs. 5B and 6B). Because all the experiments were performed in the presence of EDTA, which inhibited dephosphorylation of ArcA-P (Fig. 3), the presence of ArcA due to dephosphorylation of ArcA-P in these multimers is negligible. Thus, we wanted to determine the ratio of ArcA and ArcA-P in these multimers. To do this, the amount of ArcA-32P in TP mixtures containing [γ-32P]ATP was quantified using nitrocellulose filter binding assays (TableI). The filter binding assay indicated that 19.2% of the input ArcA was converted to the ArcA-P. Although the filter binding assay detected both ArcA-32P and ArcB-32P in the TP mixture, the ArcB-32P radioactivities were negligible compared with the ArcA-32P radioactivities (Fig. 1B). Densitometric scanning of the ArcA-P band in the IEF gel (Fig. 4A) showed that 24% of the input ArcA was converted to ArcA-P. When the ArcB amount was taken out from the earlier peak (the earlier peak of TP mixture contained ArcB in addition to ArcA-P and ArcA) in Fig. 5A, the ratio of the protein amount in the earlier peak to that in the later peak was near 1. These results indicate that 38–48% of the multimer is composed of ArcA-P. This value appeared to be in agreement with the ArcA-P fraction shown in Fig. 5B. Therefore, we concluded that the multimer is composed of both ArcA and ArcA-P with a ratio of 1:1.Table IDetermination of ArcA-P amount in TP mixtureIncorporated ATP = ArcA-PTotal ArcAArcA-Ppmolpmol%1st4.4422.220.02nd4.2822.219.33rd4.0822.218.4Average19.2 (± 0.82)Nitrocellulose filter binding experiments with TP mixtures containing [γ-32P]ATP were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Three independent assays were analyzed and averaged.

Among the response regulators of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, the structure of CheY, which is the response regulator upon chemotaxis, has been well studied by x-ray crystallography and other methods (17Sanders D.A.

The Asp-12, Asp-13, and Asp-57 of this protein form an acid pocket, and the Asp-57 is phosphorylated (15Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Due to amino acid sequence homology with CheY and other response regulators of bacterial two-component systems, it was predicted that Glu-10, Asp-11, and Asp-54 of ArcA protein also form an acid pocket and the Asp-54 is the site for ArcB phosphorylation (8Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relevancies of these amino acids remain unstudied. Here we demonstrate that an ArcA mutation at Asp-11 2Y. Jeon, Y. S. Lee, J. S. Han, J. B. Kim, and D. S. Hwang, unpublished results. as well as a mutation at Asp-54 (Fig. 1) resulted in the inability of these mutant proteins to be phosphorylated by ArcB. In addition, the broad elution pattern of ArcA(D54E) (Fig. 7A) as compared with that of wild type ArcA (Fig. 5A) in gel filtration studies suggests that ArcA(D54E) possesses a different conformation from ArcA. Although the phosphorylation site was not determined specifically, these results indicate that the Asp-11 and Asp-54 are crucial to constitute a proper conformation for functional ArcA. Carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate commonly phosphorylate the response regulators of two-component systems (1Parkinson J.S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 9-23Google Scholar). However, specificity for the phosphorylation has not been reported. In addition to ArcA-P produced by ArcB phosphorylation, incubation of ArcA-P with carbamyl phosphate produced at least two additional ArcA proteins whose migrations were retarded in IEF gel electrophoresis (Figs.4A and 6). The two modified ArcA proteins were also formed upon incubation of the ArcA(D54E) mutant protein with carbamyl phosphate. Therefore, these modified ArcA proteins could be produced by nonspecific modifications irrelevant to ArcA-P function. The presence of these modified proteins in both the earlier- and later-peak in gel-filtration studies (Fig. 6) indicates that the nonspecific modification did not affect the multimerization of ArcA-P with ArcA. Phosphorylation of proteins generally induces a conformational change, thus modifying protein activity. In bacterial two-component systems, a sensor kinase phosphorylates an aspartic acid residue of its cognate response regulator, resulting in activation of the regulator (21Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the monomeric PhoB protein induces dimerization, and the resultant dimer binds to its DNA binding sites (22Fiedler U. Weiss V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23McCleary W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylated OmpR forms dimers and trimers as evidenced by chemical cross-linking experiments (24Nakashima K. Kanamaru K. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10775-10780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, phosphorylation of dimeric NtrC induces interaction between dimers that results in the formation of tetramers. The resulting tetrameric NtrC proteins cooperatively and sequentially bind to target DNA (25Porter S.C. North A.K. Wedel A.B. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2258-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). If a protein binds sequentially or cooperatively to DNA, the bound region seen in footprint experiments becomes broadened by the increasing amount of the protein. Interestingly, increasing the amount of ArcA-P did not broaden the bound region but enhanced the intensity of the bound region (Fig. 2B) and region of oriC(13Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Jeon Y. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9917-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations support our conclusion that multimerization of ArcA occurs prior to DNA binding, and the ArcA multimer binds to DNA. Our results indicate that the phosphorylation of the ArcA dimer induces the formation of a tetramer of dimers (or an octamer) that is composed of both ArcA-P and ArcA. The ratio of ArcA-P to ArcA in the multimer appears to be ∼1. These findings suggest two possibilities: 1) ArcA multimer is composed of four identical dimers, of which one subunit is phosphorylated, or 2) two dimers of ArcA-P, all of which subunits are phosphorylated, form a tetramer with two unphosphorylated ArcA dimers. The formation of an ArcA multimer with ArcA-P and ArcA would be advantageous in the aspect that all ArcA proteins do not need to undergo phosphorylation in response to an anaerobic situation. This will facilitate the activation process of ArcA, thereby contributing to a rapid adaptation of E. coli to anaerobic environments. We thank Gillian Newman for careful editing of this manuscript."

Crystal structures of the native enzyme and the enzyme-product complex were determined at 2.1- and 2.2-Å resolutions, respectively. An elongated cleft transversing the middle of the molecule has been identified as the substrate-binding place. Two product molecules of hyaluronan degradation were observed bound to the cleft. The enzyme catalytic site was identified to comprise three residues: His479, Tyr488, and Asn429. The highly positively charged cleft facilitates the binding of the negatively charged polymeric substrate chain. The matching between the aromatic patch of the enzyme and the hydrophobic patch of the substrate chain anchors the substrate chain into degradation position. A pair of proton exchanges between the enzyme and the substrate results in the cleavage of the β-1,4 glycosidic linkage of the substrate chain and the unsaturation of the product.

Edwards M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 549: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Dillon Jr., H.C. Khare S. Gray B.M. J. Pediatr. 1987; 110: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The knowledge about the molecular basis that leads to the development of these invasive diseases is still limited. Several putative pathogenic factors were identified, including the polysaccharide capsule, hemolysin, C5a peptidase, C-proteins, and hyaluronate lyase (3Spellerberg B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). High levels of hyaluronate lyase (SagHL) were found in the extracellular cultures of the disease-causing strains of serotype III GBS (4Milligan T.W. Baker C.J. Straus D.C. Mattingly S.J. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 738-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Musser J.M. Mattingly S.J. Quentin R. Goudeau A. Selander R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clinical studies indicated that strains of type III GBS that produce more extracellular hyaluronate lyase (division I S. agalactiae) are apparently more virulent than those strains producing less (division II S. agalactiae) (5Musser J.M. Mattingly S.J. Quentin R. Goudeau A. Selander R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,6Rollend K. Marois C. Siquier V. Cattier B. Quentin R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Division I S. agalactiae usually causes invasive infections, whereas division II bacteria cause diseases much less frequently and are usually found in asymptotically colonized infants. The molecular function of SagHL is to degrade hyaluronan (HA) and certain chondroitin sulfates (CS). The enzymatic degradation of these polysaccharides breaks down the biophysical barrier of the host connective tissues, therefore facilitating the invasion and spreading of this pathogen. Structurally, HA is a high molecular weight polysaccharide built by linear repeats of disaccharide units, (β-1,4-d-glucuronic acid-β-1,3-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine)n. It is produced by almost all members of the animal kingdom, as well as by certain members of Streptococci (7Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and Its Derivatives. Portland Press, London1998Google Scholar), and is widely distributed in various connective tissues and the nervous system. The human tissues known to contain HA include synovial fluid, the vitreous humor of the eye, umbilical tissue, amniotic fluid, aorta, leukocytes, plasma, blood platelets, brain, articular cartilage, liver, prostate, skin, teeth, and urine (8Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Through inter- and intramolecular interactions, HA forms strikingly viscous solution, which provides not only a soft and elastic “bed” for tissue cells to grow on, but also a medium for the intercellular communication. Various kinds of cell surface receptors are secreted into the extracellular matrix for the purpose of communication between cells. Many of them, such as CD44 and RHAMM, are known to bind to HA (9Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 288-298Google Scholar) and be involved in signal transduction processes. Bacteria usually secretes hyaluronate lyases for the purpose of HA degradation, and the enzyme produces unsaturated products, whereas animals employ hyaluronidases, a group of hydrolases, for the HA degradation without unsaturation of the products (10Linker A. Meyer K. Hoffman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 219: 13-25Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Various Gram-positive microorganisms including species ofStreptococcus, Clostridium,Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, andStreptomyces produce hyaluronate lyase (11Hynes W.L. Walton S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All known bacterial hyaluronate lyases were found to share substantial sequence identity and thus likely to use the similar mechanism for the catalytic action (12Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The degradation of HA by bacterial hyaluronate lyases occurs at the β-1,4 glycosidic linkage between disaccharide units and produces C4–C5 double bond on the glucuronic residue of its products. The mechanism of the unsaturation in the HA degradation was recently revealed (12Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This depolymerization of HA in vivo causes the destruction of the intracellular matrix and exposes the host cells to various bacterial toxins (13Berry A.M. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Significant additive attenuation in virulence was observed for streptococci with hyaluronate lyase and pneumolysin double mutations (13Berry A.M. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HA degradation is an important step in bacterial invasion and spreading. Because sequences and the mechanisms of HA degradation are different for bacteria and animals, it suggests that these two group of enzymes are significantly different. Therefore, hyaluronate lyase may be targeted to inhibit bacterial invasion (14Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As part of our effort to elucidate the molecular basis of action of this enzyme, S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase (SagHL) was overexpressed, purified, and crystallized as reported previously (15Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we present the SagHL native crystal structure at 2.1-Å resolution and a complex structure with the 4,5-unsaturated disaccharide, the degradation product of this enzyme, at 2.2-Å resolution. The complete active site residues were identified. The mechanisms of HA and CS degradation were proposed based on the x-ray crystallography studies of SagHL native and disaccharide complex structures, the substrate binding modeling studies, and the known mutations of the active site residues (18Lin B. Hollingshead S.K. Coligan J.E. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Prichard D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30113-30116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure basis of substrate binding, cleavage site selection, substrate degradation, product unsaturation and release, product size determination, and the direction of HA chain processive degradation are discussed. SagHL expression (genehylB3502), purification, crystallization, and data collection have been reported previously (16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SagHL crystal structure was determined at 2.1-Å resolution by the molecular replacement (MR) method using a poly(A)LA model derived from theS. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) crystal structure (12Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The sequence homology of SagHL to SpnHL is 53%. MR calculation was performed using the program AMoRe (19Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The two domains of the SpnHL structure (α-domain and the β-domains) were treated as two separate molecules. The MR calculation provided one solution that was about 10 times higher than the other peaks. No implausible structural conflicts were observed among symmetry-related molecules on graphics. The initial R factor was 0.502 andRfree 0.497. The SagHL enzyme has additional 82 residues at the N terminus and six places of insertions as compared with the SpnHL enzyme. The insertions were treated as chain breaks in the next step of the model building on graphics using program O (20Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The structural refinement was performed using program X-PLOR (21Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) against 53,312 reflections at 50.0–2.1-Å resolution range. TheRfree flag was assigned to 2% (1,074) reflections for the validation of the refinement progress. The inserted residues, side chains, and the N terminus were built gradually on graphics using O (20Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) between each round of refinement until theR factor dropped to 0.282 and Rfreeto 0.340. Then, the B-factor refinement was introduced and waters were added following standard criteria.

Open table in a new tab The unsaturated HA disaccharide degradation product, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔDi-HA), was obtained as described previously (17Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Native SagHL crystals were soaked with 50 mm ΔDi-HA for elongated period of time. The crystals were cryoprotected using the same condition as for the native crystals (16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the diffraction data set at 2.2-Å resolution was collected. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL2000 package (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar) withRsys of 0.101 and the completeness of 98.1%. The native SagHL structure without water molecules was used as the initial model for the complex structure determination and refinement using program X-PLOR protocols (21Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The structure was manually fitted on graphics using program O (20Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and was refined against 45,510 reflections at 50–2.2-Å resolution range. Only 2% (860) reflections were randomly selected and assigned Rfree flags for monitoring and validation of the progress of the structural refinement. Two ΔDi-HA molecules and 256 waters were incorporated into the final structure model. The model of tetrasaccharide bound in the active site of SagHL was obtained to investigate binding of longer HA substrates in the active site cleft of the enzyme. The tetrasaccharide coordinates were taken from the crystal structure of SagHL disaccharide HA complex consisting of two disaccharide units, HA1 and HA2 (see below). The HA1 disaccharide molecule was kept unmoved, whereas the HA2 disaccharide was rotated and moved to form a linear tetrasaccharide with HA1. Then, the coordinates of the derived tetrasaccharide were optimized against the protein part using energy dynamic minimization in X-PLOR (21Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) with the protein coordinates fixed initially and released in the second round of the refinements. The native SagHL undergoes extensive proteolysis after its synthesis, resulting in a mixture of at least three molecular mass products: 118, 111, and 92 kDa (18Lin B. Hollingshead S.K. Coligan J.E. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Prichard D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30113-30116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gase K. Ozegowski J. Malke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 118-kDa form is enzymatically inactive and the 111- and 92-kDa forms are active (18Lin B. Hollingshead S.K. Coligan J.E. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Prichard D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30113-30116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It suggests that SagHL is synthesized as an inactive 118-kDa form inside the bacteria (23Gase K. Ozegowski J. Malke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When the enzyme is secreted into the extracellular matrix, it is activated by the cutting off of the signal segment at the N terminus, leaving an active 111-kDa form (23Gase K. Ozegowski J. Malke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enzyme is then further degraded into a more stable 92-kDa form (16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This last process is likely to be caused by autodegradation in the presence of calcium ions (16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The SagHL structure determination work was performed on the autodegradation product ofhylB3502, which is the 92-kDa form of SagHL, and its sequence was determined to be from Ser171 to Ile984 (16Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All 814 residues were modeled in the 2.1-Å resolution SagHL crystal structure. A total of 538 waters were incorporated into the final SagHL model. The finalRcryst is 0.191 and Rfree0.253. In the final structure, 99.6% of the residues fall in the energetically favored regions in the Ramachandran plot (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Two residues, Thr480 and Asn769, are in disallowed regions. Both residues are located on the surface loop regions, and their electron densities are plausible. The side chains of Glu468 and Tyr635 form several hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of these two residues, respectively. These interactions likely displace Thr480 and Asn769to the energetically unfavorable regions. The SagHL crystal structure is constructed from three structural domains (Fig. 1A), the N-terminal β-sheet domain (βI-domain, containing residues from Ala171 to Val244), the middle α-helical domain (α-domain, residues from Phe252 to Asn611), and the C-terminal β-sheet domain (βII-domain, residues from Lys621 to Ile984). Two peptide linkers connect these three domains. Linker I (residues from Thr245 to Asn251) connects the βI-domain and the α-domain, and linker II (residues from Asp612 to Leu620) connects the α-domain and the βII-domain. The α-domain is primarily composed of 13 α-helices that are named sequentially from helix 1 to helix 13 from the N terminus to the C terminus (Fig. 1B). Ten of them (helix 3 to helix 12) are arranged into an incomplete α5/α5 barrel structure, and helix 2 and helix 13 are in the position of blocking the incomplete barrel opening. The two ends of this barrel structure are not of the same size. The larger end encompasses the predominant cleft, which is located between the α- and the βII-domains. The smaller end is blocked by helix 1. The N-terminal βI-domain is primarily composed of seven β-strands arranged into two anti-parallel β-sheets. The C-terminal βII-domain is mainly composed of 25 β-strands arranged into five anti-parallel β-sheets. The orientation of the N-terminal segment from Ser171 to Glu182 extends out of the βI-domain along the surface of the α-domain toward the cleft region (Fig. 1A). Such orientation of this segment of the enzyme suggests that this part might be a linker to yet another structural domain at the N terminus. It is possible that the unknown part of the structure, the first 212 residues in the sequence of SagHL at the N terminus, might form at least one structural domain near the cleft region. The function of the βI-domain is still unclear, but it might possibly serve as a connection of the catalytic α-domain (see below) to this unknown structural domain. The cleft in the α-domain of SagHL is located in the middle of the SagHL structure, close to the interface between the α-domain and the βII-domain (Fig. 1). The dimensions of this cleft are about 30 Å in length, 10 Å in width, and 10 Å in depth. A total of 28 charged residues, 22 from the α-domain and 6 from the βII-domain, are accumulated along the edges of the cleft. These residues are Lys278, Lys282, Lys289, Lys305, Asp306, Arg321, Arg380, Arg416, Asp432, Arg435, Lys466, Glu468, Asp478, His479, Asp494, Arg540, Arg542, Arg546, Glu557, Arg560, Arg564, and Lys598 from the α-domain; and Glu657, Glu662, Lys712, Lys720, Lys732, and Lys868 from the βII-domain. Most of these residues are positively charged, including 10 lysines and 9 arginines. These charged residues are distributed along both sides and the bottom of the cleft and likely contribute to the attraction and binding of the negatively charged, tape-shaped substrates, HA or CS. This charged region of the enzyme is by far its most positively charged segment overall. To confirm that the cleft is the place where the substrate/product bind to pursue the enzymatic action catalyzed by SagHL, the product of this enzyme, 4,5-unsaturated disaccharide, ΔDi-HA, was soaked into the SagHL crystal. The refined structure of native SagHL without water molecules was used as primary model for the SagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure solution and refinements against 45,510 reflections. The final Rcryst was 0.182, and theRfree was 0.254; 332 water molecules were incorporated into the electron density as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein part of the complex structure is similar to the native SagHL structure with the root mean square deviation of 0.89 Å. Similarly to the native enzyme, it consists of three structural domains: βI, α, and βII. The orientation of the residues in the cleft is virtually the same as in the native enzyme structure. The structure of HA substrate has two distinct features that facilitate its binding to the enzyme cleft. One is the negative charges due to the carboxylate groups along the HA chain, and the hydrophobic patches generated by the sugar rings of the tape-shaped HA chain. The arrangement of these hydrophobic patches is ambidextrous (25Scott J.E. Heatley F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4850-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Two ΔDi-HA molecules were observed binding to the cleft region in the SagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure and were named as the HA1 and HA2 position ΔDi-HA, respectively (Fig. 2). HA1 is in contact with six protein residues from the α-domain only (Fig. 3A), and HA2 is in contact with another group of six residues from both the α- and the βII-domains (Fig. 3B). Enzyme residues interacting with these two ΔDi-HA molecules and the hydrogen bonds at their interfaces were listed in Table II. As expected, the sugar rings of the N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamines of HA1 and HA2 are in a chair conformation, whereas the sugar rings of the unsaturated β-d-glucoronate are in a half-chair conformation. The SagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure confirmed that the cleft is the region where the substrates are bound and degraded.Figure 3Protein-product interfaces in theSagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure.

Open table in a new tab The two ΔDi-HA molecules, HA1 and HA2, observed in the SagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure were not connected together as it would be in the case of a tetrasaccharide, although their positions are close to such arrangement. To analyze more precisely the substrate binding pattern, a tetrasaccharide hyaluronan was modeled into the HA binding cleft of the enzyme based on the two ΔDi-HA positions in the SagHL-ΔDi-HA complex structure (HA1 and HA2; as described under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 4). The two-disaccharide building blocks of the tetrasaccharide were also named HA1 and HA2 because the displacement from their corresponding positions in the complex structure is small. HA1 is located at the reducing end of the HA substrate chain, and HA2 is at the nonreducing end. HA1 disaccharide was almost unmoved, and the HA2 disaccharide needed to be slightly rotated to obtain the tetrasaccharide arrangement. HA2 was rotated so that theN-acetamino-2-deoxy-d-glucose residue of HA2 is facing the d-glucuronic acid residue of HA1 and to allow for the β-1,4 glycosidic with HA1. In the complex structure, 4 arginine residues (Table II) modify the orientation of the electronegative HA2 ΔDi-HA away from the position of alignment along the cleft to a new rotated orientation (Fig. 3B). There are four possible ways to fit the tetrasaccharide into the cleft. The tetrasaccharide position in the cleft can be end-flipped (the reducingversus the nonreducing end) or side-flipped (the innerversus the outer side of the cleft). Tetrasaccharide in Fig.4 has no bad interactions with the enzyme residues in the cleft, and the positions of two ΔDi-HA molecules in the complex need the least movement to obtain this arrangement, whereas in any other three positions, tetrasaccharide has significant number of bad interactions with the residues of the cleft. The interactions were considered too close (or bad) when any two-atom pairs between the modeled substrate and the enzyme were in a distance of 2.2 Å or closer. In addition in this orientation, there is enough space left in the cleft to accommodate one more disaccharide unit at the nonreducing end of the HA chain, which was named the HA3 position. At this modeled and refined position, the tetrasaccharide substrate makes 16 interactions with 10 enzyme residues, which include Arg321, Asn370, Trp371, Trp372, Arg380, Arg416, Asn421, Phe423, Asn429, and Asp432. No bad contacts (distance between atom pairs within 2.4 Å) were present at the enzyme-substrate interface. Although"
https://openalex.org/W1975616008,"Matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase-7) is expressed by mucosal epithelia throughout the body and functions in host defense by activating murine intestinal α-defensins. In normal adult human lung, matrilysin is expressed at low levels in the airway epithelium, but is markedly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis (CF). Because CF lungs support a heavy bacterial load, we assessed if relevant CF pathogens regulate matrilysin expression in human lung epithelial cells. Indeed, acute infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (but not Staphylococcus aureus,Haemophilus influenzae, or Klebsiella pneumoniae) induced the expression of matrilysin in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells. Increased matrilysin mRNA levels were detectable at 3 h post-infection and peaked at a 25-fold induction between 6 and 8 h. Both P. aeruginosa CF isolates and laboratory strains induced matrilysin expression to similar levels. Flagellin, the monomeric precursor of bacterial flagella, was identified as the inductive factor released by P. aeruginosa that regulated matrilysin expression. In addition, flagellin-null mutants failed to stimulate matrilysin expression in cultured cells or in lungs infectedin vivo. These data show that P. aeruginosa(and specifically flagellin) potently stimulates matrilysin expression in lung epithelial cells and may mediate the overexpression of this proteinase in CF lungs.

Following injury, epithelial cells initiate a programmed series of coordinated responses, such as proliferation, migration, and matrix assembly, to restore the integrity of the damaged tissue. In addition, by forming a barrier at mucosal surfaces and by the release of a variety of antimicrobial products, epithelia provide the first line of innate defense against invading pathogens. Although seemingly divergent events, the epithelial programs in response to infection and injury may have co-evolved, particularly with respect to the genes selectively induced and repressed. After all, injury provides an opportunity for infection, and infection can lead to injury. Hence, many of the epithelial products associated with either of these events may actually be common to both. Matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1-7), a member of the MMP gene family produced primarily by mucosal epithelia, is an example of a protein that is regulated by both infection and injury and serves essential functions in both innate defense and re-epithelialization. As we demonstrated in an aseptic ex vivo model of airway damage, matrilysin is prominently expressed by migrating epithelial cells in wounded trachea, and re-epithelialization of the injured airway is markedly delayed in matrilysin-null mice (1Dunsmore S.E. Saarialho-Kere U.K. Roby J.D. Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as discussed below and the subject of this report, the presence of bacteria, either commensal or pathogenic, is also a potent effector of matrilysin expression, and we hypothesize that the activity of this enzyme may be a common and essential component of mucosal defense mechanisms. For example, intestinal pro-α-defensins, demonstrated substrates of this MMP, are not activated in matrilysin-null mice, leading to an impaired ability to battle enteric pathogens (2Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Collectively, our functional data indicate that the catalytic activity of matrilysin is an essential component of both mucosal defense and repair. Unlike many MMPs, which are typically expressed or released in response to injury, disease, or inflammation, matrilysin is expressed by non-injured, non-inflamed exocrine and mucosal epithelia in most adult human tissues. For example, matrilysin is produced by the ductal or glandular epithelia of the skin, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, breast, intestine, urogenital tract, and other tissues (3Wilson M.J. Garcia B. Woodson M. Sinha A.A. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Cannon P. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J.

Cell. 1995; 6: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We proposed that exposure to commensal bacteria (and possibly low-level infection) regulates the widespread expression of matrilysin in healthy mucosa (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, in mice with conventional microflora, matrilysin is prominently expressed in the Paneth cells of the small intestine, but it is nearly undetectable in germ-free mice. Expression of this MMP, however, is fully restored in ex-germ-free mice colonized with just one species of commensal bacteria (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, matrilysin expression in cultured cells and tissues is, depending on its basal levels, induced or markedly increased by exposure to several strains of pathogenic Escherichia coli (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, bacterial exposure seems to be the physiologic signal that regulates matrilysin expression in intact epithelia. However, the bacterially derived signal that regulates matrilysin expression is not known. Lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are normal in utero, but become infected shortly after birth with a number of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Infection leads to the development of chronic inflammation, which, in turn, contributes to further tissue destruction and airway obstruction. Among these bacteria, P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic microorganism recovered from the airways of most patients with CF and many with impaired host defense. Eventually, >85% of CF patients become colonized with P. aeruginosa (8Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T.S. Goldberg J.B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: S175-S182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bals R. Weiner D.J. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), an infection that is extremely resistant to eradication (10Govan J.R. Deretic V. Microbiol.

Nature. 2000; 407: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The initial step of bacterial infection, crucial for the development of permanent colonization at later stages, is the adherence of the bacteria to epithelial cells. In lungs from patients with CF, matrilysin is prominently expressed by airway and alveolar epithelial cells (1Dunsmore S.E. Saarialho-Kere U.K. Roby J.D. Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and here we assessed if any of the bacterial species frequently isolated from CF patients mediates the marked up-regulation of this MMP. Our data demonstrate that exposure to P. aeruginosa, but not other respiratory pathogens, is a potent stimulus of matrilysin expression in lung epithelial cells. A number of bacterial gene products stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in epithelial cells, and we identifiedP. aeruginosa flagellin, the monomeric component of flagella, as the factor controlling matrilysin expression. Our data demonstrate that the production of this defense-related metalloproteinase is specifically regulated in airway epithelial cells by a bacterial product. Specimens of recipient lungs from patients with CF were biopsied at the time of transplant surgery, and Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (n = 16) were obtained from the Department of Pathology of Washington University (St. Louis, MO) and from Dr. James R. Yankaskas (University of North Carolina). For normal lung, we examined the tumor-free margins of lung adenocarcinoma tissue (n= 5), recipient lungs of transplant patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 6), and segments of the proximal end of normal human trachea obtained from donor lungs (n = 7). The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 and the human lung carcinoma cell line Calu-3 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Anti-human matrilysin antiserum was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 93–108 (13Busiek D.F. Ross F.P. McDonnell S. Murphy G. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. J.

In vitro transcribed antisense and sense RNA probes for matrilysin, collagenase-1, stromelysin-1, and 92-kDa gelatinase were labeled with [α-35S]UTP as described (14Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sections were hybridized and washed as described (15Prosser I.W. Stenmark K.R. Suthar M. Crouch E.C. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 1073-1088PubMed Google Scholar). After autoradiography for 10–21 days, the photographic emulsion was developed, and the slides were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. In situ hybridization experiments were done at least twice. Human epithelial cells were seeded onto six-well plates and grown to ∼80% confluency. Inoculi of bacteria, ranging from 109 to 106colony-forming units/well, were added to eukaryotic cells in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for up to 90 min. Epithelial monolayers were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline to remove non-adherent bacteria, and the cultures were further incubated in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 50 µg/ml gentamycin to kill the remaining extracellular bacteria. At different times post-infection, total RNA from the cells was prepared with RNAzol (Tel-Text, Inc., Friendswood, TX). In experiments performed in the presence of 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 6 or 24 h, and conditioned media were collected and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with specific anti-matrilysin antiserum (13Busiek D.F. Ross F.P. McDonnell S. Murphy G. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9087-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern hybridization for matrilysin, collagenase-1, MT1-MMP, and GAPDH mRNAs and gelatin zymography of conditioned media were done as described (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. A 400-ml sample of a 24-h culture of P. aeruginosa ATCC 51673 or 10145 was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Over a period of 2 h at room temperature, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to reach 40% saturation. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min, the pellets were resuspended in 8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. Flagellin was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 40 min; resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. Media samples from the 90-min period of infection of the epithelial cells were concentrated 28-fold by lyophilization. Aliquots of concentrated media were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred by semidry electrophoretic transfer at 15 V for 20 min to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) in 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.0375% SDS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by soaking membranes in 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Blots were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-flagellin polyclonal antiserum (17Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in blocking buffer for 1 h and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min. Membranes were subsequently incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxide-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed twice, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old) were anesthetized and inoculated nasally with 50 µl of sterile saline or a suspension containing 108 colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa PAK or PAK-fliC. Mice (four/group) were killed 6 h later, and total lung RNA was isolated. Matrilysin mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as described (6Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Rudolph L.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using primers MMat405 (5′-ACTTACCTCGGATCGTAGTG-3′) and MMat645 (5′-GTCCAGTACTCATCTTTGTC-3′) and an annealing temperature of 55 °C for 25 cycles. Mouse GAPDH was amplified in a separate reaction using primers MGapdh205 (5′-ATTCAACGGCACAGTCAAGG-3′) and MGapdh859 (5′-GGTCCTCAAGTGTAGCCCAAG-3′). Amplification products were resolved on 8% acrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. We previously reported that matrilysin is induced in airway epithelial cells migrating over denuded tissue in an aseptic ex vivo model of tracheal injury (1Dunsmore S.E. Saarialho-Kere U.K. Roby J.D. Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and in airway cells of intact trachea infected with pathogenic strains of E. coli (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the expression of matrilysin is regulated by both infection and injury. We also reported that matrilysin is expressed at high levels by airway epithelial cells at sites of overt mucosal damage in CF (1Dunsmore S.E. Saarialho-Kere U.K. Roby J.D. Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In a further examination of several CF samples (n = 16), we observed that matrilysin protein was uniformly detected in the intact epithelia of trachea (Fig. 1,A and B), bronchioles (Fig. 1, E andG), and alveoli (Fig. 1K). No staining was seen in samples processed with preimmune IgG (Fig. 1C). In addition, a moderate to intense signal for matrilysin mRNA colocalized with cells that had strong staining for the protein (Fig.1, E and F, G and H), indicating that this MMP was actively expressed in the airway epithelia of CF lungs. In contrast, matrilysin was typically not seen in the intact airway epithelia of non-CF lung samples (Fig. 1D), except in epithelial cells at the edge of wounded mucosa, if such lesions were present. In several of the non-CF samples (8 out of 18), matrilysin protein was seen in intact epithelium (Fig.1I); however, signal for the mRNA was not detected, even after extended autoradiographic exposure (Fig. 1J). Intense staining for matrilysin protein was also seen in intact and wound-edge alveolar type II cells in CF lungs (Fig. 1K), but only a weak immunostaining signal was detected in alveolar cells bordering sites of denudation in non-CF specimens (Fig. 1L,arrowheads). A strong signal for matrilysin protein and mRNA was also seen in the ductal cells of peritracheal and peribronchial glands in CF samples, but not in non-CF specimens (data not shown). Signal for collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), or gelatinase-B (MMP-9) mRNA or protein was not detected in the epithelial layer of CF or non-CF samples (data not shown). Together, these in vivo observations demonstrate that expression of matrilysin is potently and invariantly up-regulated in the intact airway epithelia of CF lungs. To determine whether infection directly mediates the up-regulation of matrilysin seen in CF lung tissues, we infected epithelial cells with various CF pathogens. Inoculi containing 1 × 108colony-forming units of bacteria, representing a 50:1 bacterial/epithelial cell ratio, were exposed to cells for 90 min. To eliminate bacteria, monolayers were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with gentamycin. Total RNA was isolated from the cells at 6 h post-infection and analyzed by Northern blotting. As a positive control for the bacterially mediated induction of matrilysin expression, we infected cells with a recombinant E. coli strain engineered to produce type 1 pili (12Langermann S. Palaszynski S. Barnhart M. Auguste G. Pinkner J.S. Burlein J. Barren P. Koenig S. Leath S. Jones C.H. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1997; 276: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which potently induces matrilysin expression in human mucosal epithelial cells (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Infection with a P. aeruginosa strain isolated from a CF patient (ATCC 51673) markedly stimulated matrilysin expression in Calu-3 lung carcinoma (30-fold) and HT29 colon carcinoma (6-fold) epithelial cells (Fig.2A). P. aeruginosawas a more potent stimulator of matrilysin expression than E. coli in lung-derived cells (30-fold versus 10-fold, respectively). In contrast, infection at a comparable multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) with S. aureus, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae had no effect on matrilysin mRNA levels (data not shown). The up-regulation of matrilysin mRNA levels correlated with increased amounts of matrilysin protein, as detected by immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from the 24-h conditioned media of infected cells (Fig. 2B). We infected Calu-3 lung cells for 90 min with increasing m.o.i. values of P. aeruginosa and assessed the response at different times post-infection. Even with an initial inoculum of 1 × 107 bacteria (representing a 5:1 bacteria/epithelial cell ratio), matrilysin mRNA levels were elevated 5-fold at 6 h post-infection (Fig. 2C). Up-regulation of matrilysin expression was observed as early as 3 h post-infection and peaked at 6 h; the levels of matrilysin mRNA remained elevated at 72 h post-infection (Fig. 2D). A similar time course of bacterially mediated induction of matrilysin mRNA levels was seen in HT29 colon epithelial cells (data not shown). We assessed the response of lung epithelial cells to infection with a variety of P. aeruginosa strains to determine whether the regulation of matrilysin is affected by the pathogenicity of the bacteria. Infection with either P. aeruginosa CF isolates (ATCC 51673 and 39324) or with laboratory strains (ATCC 10145 and 25619) markedly stimulated matrilysin mRNA levels (Fig.2E). Similarly, matrilysin expression was also induced in HT29 colon epithelial cells infected with these strains (data not shown). Of the other MMPs we examined, we did not detect expression of collagenase-1 or any change in the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA (see Fig.4E). In addition, as assessed by substrate zymography, infection with P. aeruginosa did not affect the levels of gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) (data not shown). To assess the role of bacterial adherence, we examined the effect of type IV pili, which mediate the adherence of P. aeruginosato eukaryotic cells (18Comolli J.C. Waite L.L. Mostov K.E. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells were infected with a wild-type strain (PAK) or with an isogenic mutant lacking the PilA subunit (PAK-NP). This mutant does not produce pili and hence adheres poorly to eukaryotic cells compared with the parental strain (17Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, matrilysin expression was stimulated to similar levels in cells infected with either strain (Fig.3A). Because adherence ofP. aeruginosa was not critical for matrilysin expression, we searched for preformed soluble bacterial factors that mediate induction of this MMP. Preparations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. aeruginosa failed to induce matrilysin in Calu-3 lung cells (Fig.3B). In addition, the presence of gentamycin during the 90-min infection period did not prevent induction (Fig. 3B), and matrilysin expression was also induced by infection with heat-killed bacteria (data not shown). Thus, bacteria do not need to be metabolically active to influence matrilysin expression. We next investigated the effect of proteins released by P. aeruginosa on matrilysin expression in lung epithelial cells. Proteins in the supernatants of 1- and 2-day cultures were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pattern of proteins secreted by the bacterial cells was overtly different from the pattern seen in cell lysates (Fig.4A). Treatment of Calu-3 cells with concentrated supernatants from either 1- or 2-day cultures resulted in similar induction of matrilysin (data not shown). Boiling the supernatants for 20 min did not prevent matrilysin induction, but proteinase K treatment obliterated the inductive effect (data not shown). Sequencing of the most prominent band (migrating at 55 kDa) identified this protein as flagellin, the monomeric component of bacterial flagella (19Totten P.A. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flagellin was easily purified to homogeneity from 1-day culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa 51673 (CF isolate) and 10145 (laboratory strain) by 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation (Fig. 4, A and B). As demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 4C) and by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown), flagellin was secreted by the bacteria in a time- and dose-dependent manner during the infection period. Treatment of Calu-3 cells with 0.2 µg/ml purified flagellin for 6 h resulted in a 12-fold induction of matrilysin mRNA levels (Fig. 4D). Based on the purification yield and the comparison of band staining intensities by Western blotting and protein staining, 0.2 µg/ml flagellin was roughly equivalent to direct infection at an m.o.i. of 200. Furthermore, the induction of matrilysin obtained with purified flagellin was comparable to that seen with intact bacteria (Fig. 3; see Fig. 5below), suggesting that flagellin is the major bacterial factor regulating expression of MMP. As we found for infection with P. aeruginosa, flagellin did not affect expression of MT1-MMP, collagenase-1 (Fig. 4E), and gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) (data not shown). To corroborate further that flagellin is the bacterial factor responsible for P. aeruginosa-mediated induction of matrilysin, we infected Calu-3 cells with mutants of fliC, the gene that encodes flagellin (16Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure for 90 min to the mutant strains PAK-fliC and PAK-NP-fliC, in which an interrupted copy of the gene has replaced the wild-type fliCsequence (17Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect matrilysin mRNA levels, whereas infection with the wild-type strain PAK and the pilin mutant PAK-NP resulted in a 10-fold induction (Fig.5A). In addition, we prepared crude supernatants (i.e. 40% ammonium sulfate-precipitated proteins from the 2-day culture supernatants) from the wild-type PAK strain and the isogenic flagellin PAK-fliC mutant. The protein patterns from these supernatants differed only in the presence or absence of flagellin (Fig. 5B). Treatment of Calu-3 cells with PAK (but not PAK-fliC) supernatants up-regulated matrilysin expression by 8-fold (Fig. 5C), further identifying flagellin as the major factor that promotes matrilysin expression. Finally, to determine whether flagellin is relevant to the induction of matrilysin expression in vivo, we infected mice intranasally with wild-type P. aeruginosa (PAK) or with the PAK-fliC mutant. Mice were killed 6 h post-infection, and matrilysin mRNA expression was examined in lung tissues. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that matrilysin mRNA levels increased in PAK-infected animals compared with the levels seen in control mice (Fig. 6). In contrast, infection with the mutant PAK-fliC strain had no detectable effect on matrilysin mRNA levels. We have demonstrated that matrilysin is prominently and invariantly expressed in the airway and respiratory epithelia of lungs from patients with CF and that exposure of lung epithelial cells toP. aeruginosa, a relevant CF pathogen, markedly stimulates the expression of this MMP. In contrast, S. aureus, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae, other pathogens found in CF lungs, did not influence matrilysin expression. The increase in matrilysin mRNA levels was rapid and detectable at low m.o.i., suggesting that epithelial cells readily respond to bacterial exposure by up-regulating this MMP. Furthermore, the specificity of the response to P. aeruginosa suggests that this bacterium selectively triggers signaling pathways that control matrilysin expression in epithelial cells. Because most adult CF patients are permanently colonized with one or more P. aeruginosa strains, these findings may explain the pattern of increased expression of matrilysin we observed in CF lung tissues (Fig. 1). The pathogenesis of the airway infection in CF follows a pattern in which initial colonization by non-mucoid variants of P. aeruginosa, often combined with more transient infections withH. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, almost invariably results in chronic colonization by mucoid variants of P. aeruginosa (10Govan J.R. Deretic V. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 539-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that both CF isolates and non-CF strains of P. aeruginosa induce the expression of matrilysin to comparable levels, suggesting that the up-regulation of matrilysin could occur early in the establishment of the disease. Indeed, we found that a short infection led to rapid and sustained expression. In addition, the marked sensitivity of lung epithelial cells to P. aeruginosa exposure indicates that even low levels of initial colonization by the bacterium could turn on the expression of the enzyme. However, it is currently unclear whether matrilysin is initially engaged in tissue repair and innate defense mechanisms or whether the enzyme contributes to tissue damage from the onset of the infection, further facilitating the adherence of P. aeruginosa to injured tissue (20de Bentzmann S. Plotkowski C. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: S155-S162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adherence of P. aeruginosa to lung epithelial cells depends on the expression of type IV pili (21Strom M.S. Lory S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 565-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and mutants of the pilin subunit gene pilA induce a diminished inflammatory response (22Tang H. Kays M. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1278-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the lack of PilA did not affect matrilysin induction by P. aeruginosa. Therefore, we hypothesized that a preformed soluble bacterial factor was responsible for the induction of matrilysin expression. Indeed, we found that a factor was present in the supernatant of overnight bacterial cultures and that it was heat-stable and sensitive to proteinase degradation. We identified flagellin, the monomeric component of bacterial flagella (16Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Spangenberg C. Heuer T. Burger C. Tummler B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), as the secreted protein that induced matrilysin expression. Similarly, flagellin from Salmonella, enteroaggregativeE. coli, and Pseudomonas species induces a program of epithelial cell activation and is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator in intestinal and lung epithelial cells (17Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24DiMango E. Zar H.J. Bryan R. Prince A. J. Clin.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although adherence may not be directly critical for induction of matrilysin, binding of bacteria to tissue could potentiate the host response signal by increasing the pericellular bacterial density and hence the concentration of flagellin at the epithelial cell surface. Previous reports suggested that bacterial soluble virulence factors can induce MMP activation or expression (28de Bentzmann S. Polette M. Zahm J.M. Hinnrasky J. Kileztky C. Bajolet O. Klossek J.M. Filloux A. Lazdunski A. Puchelle E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Firth J.D. Putnins E.E. Larjava H. Uitto V.J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, to our knowledge, this is the first example of flagellin up-regulating the expression of an MMP. In this regard, P. aeruginosa LPS had no significant effect on matrilysin expression, corroborating our previous finding that the factor responsible for the E. coli-mediated up-regulation of matrilysin in colon epithelial cells is not LPS-related (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). LPS can induce the expression of genes encoding innate defense molecules in airway epithelial cells, such as the mucin muc2(30Li J.D. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Miyata S. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Nadel J.A. Prince A. Basbaum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, human BD-2, an inducible β-defensin, does not respond strongly to LPS in a variety of epithelial cells, but is up-regulated by bacteria, interleukin-1β, and other pro-inflammatory mediators (31Becker M.N.

Eckmann L. Ganz T. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6718-6724PubMed Google Scholar). As we reported (7López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), matrilysin is induced in epithelial cells treated with interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6, albeit to a much lesser extent than in infected cells. Thus, matrilysin and human BD-2 may share common regulatory mechanisms and respond to similar stimuli. Indeed, expression of human BD-2 in human colon epithelial cells is induced by Salmonella enteritidisflagellin (34Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Mori N. Oishi K. Nagatake T. Takahashi A. Asakura H. Makino S. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ohsaki M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30521-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Insight into the response of respiratory epithelial cells to airway pathogens has recently been provided by microarray analysis of genes differentially expressed after infection withP. aeruginosa and Bordetella pertussis, illustrating the potent pro-inflammatory response mounted by epithelial cells upon interaction with bacteria (35Ichikawa J.K. Norris A. Bangera M.G. Geiss G.K. van't Wout A.B. Bumgarner R.E. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9659-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 36Belcher C.E. Drenkow J.

Therefore, our data include matrilysin in the panoply of genes induced early and strongly by bacterial exposure. (Incidentally, matrilysin cDNA is not included in the arrays used in these studies). Finally, it is tempting to speculate that matrilysin and other innate defense molecules, such as mucins and defensins, are part of a general response of epithelial cells to bacterial exposure and that these molecules play pivotal roles in host defense. However, high levels of production or activity of these molecules can be detrimental and could be major contributors to the processes of tissue destruction and airway obstruction that eventually kill CF patients. For example, a high level of activity of matrilysin, an MMP capable of acting on a variety of extracellular matrix molecules, could result in the exaggerated degradation of any of these substrates and alterations in tissue architecture. Similarly, an excessive production of mucins causes clogging of the CF airways due to the accumulation of material that cannot be efficiently removed by the mucociliary clearance mechanism. Finally, the concentration of defensins in CF sputum/fluid could be so high as to be cytotoxic to airway epithelial cells (37Zhang H. Porro G. Orzech N. Mullen B. Liu M. Slutsky A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L947-L954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lichtenstein A. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1986; 68: 1407-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Soong L.B.

In sum, we provide evidence that flagellin, a potent virulence factor, strongly up-regulates the expression of matrilysin in lung epithelial cells and that this host enzyme is an early marker of bacterially induced inflammation.

To assess the role of this reaction in the adaptation of the bacterium to growth ond-cysteine, the gene of the desulfhydrase was cloned. It corresponds to the open reading frame yedO at 43.03 min on the genetic map of E. coli. The amino acid sequence deduced from this gene is homologous to those of several 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylate deaminases. However, theE. coli desulfhydrase does not use 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate as substrate. Various mutants in which the yedO gene was inactivated or overexpressed were constructed. They exhibited hypersensitivity or resistance, respectively, to the presence of d-cysteine in the culture medium. Growth protection against d-cysteine in minimal medium was conferred by the simultaneous addition of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. In agreement with this behavior,d-cysteine inhibited the activity of threonine deaminase, a key enzyme of the isoleucine, leucine, and valine pathway.

A similar activity could be detected in Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Chlorella fusca, Spinacia oleracea, and various Fusobacterium species (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T.

However, recent studies indicated thatE. coli growth is impaired in the presence of micromolar amounts of d-cysteine (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting thatd-cysteine desulfhydrase has a detoxification function.In the present work, we report the cloning of the E. coligene (yedO) encoding d-cysteine desulfhydrase activity. Involvement of the product of this gene in the adaptation of the cell to d-cysteine is established. Overexpression of the desulfhydrase gene protects E. coli againstd-cysteine, whereas its inactivation renders the bacterium hypersensitive to the d-amino acid. Moreover, our data suggest that, similarly to l-cysteine (7Harris C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),d-cysteine exerts its toxicity through an inhibition of threonine deaminase. Decomposition of d-cysteine by the desulfhydrase produces H2S, which the bacterium can utilize as a sulfur source. Accordingly, we establish that the presence of theyedO gene stimulates cell growth in the presence ofd-cysteine as sole sulfur source. In agreement with an involvement of the desulfhydrase in sulfur metabolism, sulfate starvation induces expression of yedO.MATERIALS AND METHODSl- and d-Amino acids, β-chloro-d-alanine,N′,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine were from Sigma.

All buffers used for the purification ofd-cysteine desulfhydrase contained 10 µmpyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at an optical density of 140 at 650 nm. Crude extract preparation, nucleic acid precipitation with streptomycin sulfate, and ammonium sulfate fractionation of proteins were performed as described previously (8Soutourina J. Plateau P.

The cloned DNA was verified by DNA sequencing.Disruption of the yedO GeneDisruption of theyedO gene was performed according to the method of Hamiltonet al. (9Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by using the plasmid pMAK705 carrying a thermosensitive replicon and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. TheXbaI and KpnI sites of this plasmid were used to insert a DNA fragment carrying, in successive order as follows: (i) the ribosome-binding site of plasmid pKK223-3 (GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGAATTC) plus the first 270 bp of theyedO ORF (N-terminal part) taken from plasmid pKKyedO; (ii) the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (10Vieira J.

The resulting plasmid (pMAKNkanCyedO) was used to transform E. coli strain K37. Recombination of pMAKNkanCyedO with the chromosome at theyedO locus was obtained by growing the transformants at 42 °C on LB agar medium containing chloramphenicol. In a second growth cycle, cells were maintained at 30 °C in liquid medium for ∼30 generations. Then cells no longer carrying the plasmid in their chromosome were identified through their chloramphenicol sensitivity at 42 °C on solid medium. At this stage, ∼50% of the chloramphenicol-sensitive clones were kanamycin-resistant at 42 °C. Therefore, we could deduce the following: (i) in the latter clones, the second recombination had resulted in the creation of a ΔyedO::kan mutation on the chromosome, and (ii) the presence of the yedO gene was not essential to E. coli growth. In addition, the selected clones now carried the wild-type yedO gene copy on the pMAK705 derivative. The resulting plasmid, named pMAKyedO, was used, as described below, to overproduce the desulfhydrase. Finally, to eliminate plasmid pMAKyedO, a few selected clones were maintained at 42 °C during several generations. Loss of the thermosensitive plasmid was assayed by following chloramphenicol sensitivity of the cells at 30 °C. In one clone named K37ΔyedO, disruption of theyedO gene was eventually confirmed by PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA using the above oligonucleotides yedODEB and yedOFIN.Purification of d-Cysteine Desulfhydrase from the Overproducing E. coli Strain XL1-Blue Containing pKKyedOE. coli strain XL1-Blue transformed by plasmid pKKyedO (Table I) was grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of 2× TY medium containing 100 µg of ampicillin per ml. When the optical density of the culture reached 0.15 at 650 nm, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added, and growth was continued overnight. Under these conditions,d-cysteine desulfhydrase-specific activity in a crude extract reached 3.0 units per mg of total protein (TableII). Conditions for crude extract preparation, nucleic acid precipitation with streptomycin sulfate, and ammonium sulfate fractionation of proteins were identical to those used for enzyme purification from strain K37. Chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Superdex 75 columns (Hi-Load) was also performed as above. The only modification was the utilization of a 30-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (1.6 × 15 cm) eluted with a 540-ml gradient at a flow rate of 0.45 ml/min. Purified d-cysteine desulfhydrase was dialyzed against a 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 60% glycerol, 10 µmpyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA and stored at −20 °C. It was homogeneous, according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.Table IId-Cysteine desulfhydrase activity in various E. coli strainsStrainCulture conditions2-aCells were grown overnight under the indicated culture conditions.

Total protein concentration in the extracts was 5–10 mg/ml.d-Cysteine desulfhydrase activity was assayed at 37 °C for 30 min in 1-ml assays containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm freshly prepared d-cysteine (assay I). One unit corresponds to enzyme activity capable of producing 1 µmol of H2S per min. Open table in a new tab Concentration of homogeneous d-cysteine desulfhydrase was determined using a light-absorption coefficient of 0.599A280 units·mg−1·ml (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By taking into consideration the homodimerization of the desulfhydrase (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the removal of the initiator methionine in the mature protein (this work), a Mr of 70,044 was calculated. The total amount of protein in crude extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Assays of d-Cysteine Desulfhydrase Activityd-Cysteine desulfhydrase activity could be followed by use of three different assays. In each case, the enzyme dilution buffer contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 µmpyridoxal phosphate.Measurement of H2S Formation (Assay I)In this assay, H2S formation from d-cysteine was measured (3Schmidt A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 449-453Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in 1-ml assays containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm freshly preparedd-cysteine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of enzyme and quenched by the successive addition of 0.1 ml of solution I (20 mmN′,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 7.2 m HCl) and 0.1 ml of solution II (30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl). After 30 min at room temperature, methylene blue formation was measured at 670 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 28.5 × 103m−1 cm−1. One unit ofd-cysteine desulfhydrase activity corresponds to the activity capable of producing 1 µmol of methylene blue per min,i.e. 1 µmol of H2S per min. This method was used to assay d-cysteine desulfhydrase activity either in crude extracts or during its purification. It was also used to determine kinetic parameters of the reaction of the homogeneous desulfhydrase with d-cysteine as substrate.Measurement of Pyruvate Formation (Assay II)The activity of the purified enzyme was also monitored through measurement of the amount of pyruvate formed from d-cysteine by using a spectrophotometric method with lactate dehydrogenase and NADH (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at 37 °C in cuvettes (250 µl) containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.13 mm NADH, 5 units of rabbit muscle l-lactate dehydrogenase, various concentrations (0.02–5 mm) of the substrate under study (d-cysteine, β-chloro-d-alanine, orl-cysteine), and catalytic amounts of enzyme in 10 µl. The reaction was started by adding 10 µl of the substrate solution in H2O. Consumption of NADH and the resulting decrease in absorption at 340 nm were followed. A molar absorption coefficient of 6220 m−1 cm−1 was used for NADH.Assay II was also used to study the conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate into 2-oxobutyrate (11Phillips A.T. Wood W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 15: 530-535Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this case, the final concentration of lactate dehydrogenase in the reaction mixture was 25 units per 250 µl. We verified that, under these conditions, the transformation of 2-oxobutyrate into the final product was not rate-limiting.Measurement of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate Deamination (Assay III)Colorimetric quantitation of 2-oxobutyrate, based on the reaction of this compound with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (12Datta P. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17: 566-571Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), was used to obtain evidence for the possible conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate into 2-oxobutyrate. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5-ml assays containing 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 µmpyridoxal phosphate, and 20 mm1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. The reaction was started by addition of 20 µl of the enzyme solution and stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of a freshly prepared solution containing 15% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% (w/w) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. After 10 min at 37 °C, 0.5 ml of 2.5 m NaOH was added, and absorption at 540 nm of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative of 2-oxobutyrate was immediately measured. A molar absorption coefficient of 4000m−1 cm−1 was used for this derivative.Assay of Threonine Deaminase ActivityThreonine deaminase activity was measured in crude extracts through the production of 2-oxobutyrate, according to the procedure of Harris (7Harris C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The colorimetric determination of 2-oxobutyrate was the same as that used in assay III. One unit of threonine deaminase activity produces 1 µmol of 2-oxobutyrate per min.Genomic and Phylogenetic AnalysesAmino acid sequences were obtained from the SwissProt data base (www.expasy.ch/sprot) or the GenBankTM data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank). In the cases of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato,Caulobacter crescentus, Bacillus anthracis,Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Burkholderia mallei, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Aspergillus fumigatus, preliminary sequence data were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website at www.tigr.org; for Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis, Bordetella bronchiseptica andparapertussis and Burkholderia pseudomallei, the Sanger Center website at www.sanger.ac.uk was used; Salmonella typhimurium data were from the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center website at genome.wustl.edu. The ClustalX program (13Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35185) Google Scholar) was used to align the sequences and to construct the phylogenetic tree. Escherichia coli contains an enzyme activity capable of catalyzing the transformation of d-cysteine into pyruvate, H2S, and NH3 (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This enzyme was namedd-cysteine desulfhydrase. A similar activity could be detected in Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Chlorella fusca, Spinacia oleracea, and various Fusobacterium species (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt A. Erdle I. Z.

Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no activity was found in the bacteria of genera Arthrobacter, Alcaligenes, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Erwinia, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Sarcina, Serratia, and Xanthomonas (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). d-Cysteine desulfhydrase from E. coli is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme. It catalyzes the α,β-elimination reaction of d-cysteine and of severald-cysteine derivatives, such as S-alkyl-,S-aryl-, and S-aralkyl-d-cysteine,d-cystine, dl-selenocysteine,dl-selenocystine, β-chloro-d-alanine,O-methyl-d-serine, orO-acetyl-d-serine (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Yamada H. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 149: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). d-Cysteine desulfhydrase also catalyzes the formation of d-cysteine ord-cysteine-related amino acids from β-chloro-d-alanine in the presence of various thiols or from O-acetyl-d-serine plus sulfide (1Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,5Nagasawa T. Ishii T. Yamada H. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 149: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The physiological role of bacterial d-cysteine desulfhydrase is unknown. However, recent studies indicated thatE. coli growth is impaired in the presence of micromolar amounts of d-cysteine (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting thatd-cysteine desulfhydrase has a detoxification function. In the present work, we report the cloning of the E. coligene (yedO) encoding d-cysteine desulfhydrase activity. Involvement of the product of this gene in the adaptation of the cell to d-cysteine is established. Overexpression of the desulfhydrase gene protects E. coli againstd-cysteine, whereas its inactivation renders the bacterium hypersensitive to the d-amino acid. Moreover, our data suggest that, similarly to l-cysteine (7Harris C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),d-cysteine exerts its toxicity through an inhibition of threonine deaminase. Decomposition of d-cysteine by the desulfhydrase produces H2S, which the bacterium can utilize as a sulfur source. Accordingly, we establish that the presence of theyedO gene stimulates cell growth in the presence ofd-cysteine as sole sulfur source. In agreement with an involvement of the desulfhydrase in sulfur metabolism, sulfate starvation induces expression of yedO. MATERIALS AND METHODSl- and d-Amino acids, β-chloro-d-alanine,N′,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine were from Sigma.

DEAE-Sephacel and Superdex 75 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Purification of d-Cysteine DesulfhydraseCells from E. coli strain K37 (TableI) were grown at 37 °C in 8 liters of 2× TY medium and harvested by centrifugation for 35 min at 3,000 × g. All buffers used for the purification ofd-cysteine desulfhydrase contained 10 µmpyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at an optical density of 140 at 650 nm. Crude extract preparation, nucleic acid precipitation with streptomycin sulfate, and ammonium sulfate fractionation of proteins were performed as described previously (8Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that ammonium sulfate precipitations were at 35 and 55% saturation, instead of 50 and 80%, respectively. Then the protein pellet was dissolved in 50 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of the same buffer. The resulting solution was applied to a 250-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (4.4 × 16.5 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 2.4 ml/min with a 6-liter linear gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl. d-Cysteine desulfhydrase activity was recovered at 0.31 m KCl. After concentration by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation) and dialysis against 2 liters of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm KCl, the sample was applied to a Superdex 75 column (120 ml, 1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrainsGenotypeRef.K37galK rpsL46Miller H.I.

In large and small intestine a channel complex consisting of KCNQ1 and the β-subunit KCNE3 (MiRP2) is known to mediate the cAMP-activated basolateral K+ current, which is essential for luminal Cl− secretion. Northern blot experiments revealed an expression of both subunits in lung tissue. However, previous reports suggested a role of KCNE1 (minK, Isk) but not KCNE3 in airway epithelial cells. Here we give evidence that KCNE1 is not detected in murine tracheal epithelial cells and that Cl− secretion by these cells is not reduced by the knock-out of the KCNE1gene. In contrast we show that a complex consisting of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 probably forms a basolateral K+ channel in murine tracheal epithelial cells. As described for colonic epithelium, the current through KCNQ1 complexes in murine trachea is specifically inhibited by the chromanol 293B. A 293B-sensitive current was present after stimulation with forskolin and agonists that increase Ca2+as well as after administration of the pharmacological K+ channel activator, 1-EBIO. A 293B-inhibitable current was already present under control conditions and reduced after administration of amiloride indicating a role of this K+channel not only for Cl− secretion but also for Na+ reabsorption.

Disturbances in the underlying secretion and absorption mechanisms lead to malfunction of the ciliary clearance, which is needed to transport mucous and foreign particles from the bronchial system toward the pharynx (1Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1143-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 631-638Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One of the diseases in which these transport properties are disturbed is the autosomal recessively inherited condition, cystic fibrosis (CF)1 (3Kunzelmann K. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to viscous mucous due to Na+ hyperabsorption as well as reduced Cl−secretion and predispose individuals to bacterial infections (5Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol.

To enhance Cl− secretion in CF patients, interest has focused over the last years on activating basolateral K+ channels (6Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J.

This approach is based on the finding that Cl−secretion requires the concomitant activation of basolateral K+ channels (8Greger R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

There are two differently regulated subsets of K+ channels in airway epithelia, one group regulated by Ca2+ and the other group via cAMP. IK1 (KCNN4) is thought to be one of the Ca2+-activated channels (10Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The benzimidazolone 1-EBIO became known as the first substance that pharmacologically enhances the Ca2+-activated K+ current and has been suggested as an approach to ameliorate electrolyte imbalances in CF (6Devor D.C.

Pharmacological evidence with the KCNQ1-specific inhibitor, the chromanol 293B, supports a role of KCNQ1 in human nasal epithelium (18Bleich M. Briel M. Busch A.E. Lang H.J. Gerlach U. Gögelein H.

Here we provide evidence that as in the gut KCNQ1 co-assembles with KCNE3 in murine tracheal epithelial cells to form a basolateral K+ channel complex, which functions as the main driving force for epithelial anion secretion and base-line Na+ absorption. KCNE1 knock-out and wild-type mice were generated as described previously and were back-crossed with C57Bl6 mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) (15Vetter D.E. Mann J.R. Wangemann P. Liu J. McLaughlin K.J. Lesage F. Marcus D.C. Lazdunski M. Heinemann S.F. Barhanin J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1251-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). 6–12-week-old animals derived from heterozygous mating were used and genotyped by PCR prior to experiments. Other than for breeding, C57Bl6 mice were used directly for all other functional experiments not concerning the KCNE1 gene knock-out. All animals had free access to standard chow and tap water and were kept according to the German law for the care and use of laboratory animals. The experimental protocols were approved by the local council on animal care. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (ketamine: 100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal, Sigma; xylazine: 4 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and killed by dissection of the abdominal aorta. With a parasternal incision the thoracic cavity and the neck were opened, and the trachea was exposed from adjacent structures. After the main bronchi were cut off with a pair of scissors, a scalpel blade was used to separate the trachea from the esophagus. The trachea was then cut from the larynx and freed from surrounding connective tissue under a dissection microscope. mRNA expression of KCNQ1, KCNE1, and KCNE3 was assessed by RT-PCR. Mouse tracheae were removed as described and placed for 15 min at 37 °C in a Ca2+-free solution containing (in mm): 127 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5d-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 5 Na+-pyruvate, 10 HEPES, 5 EDTA, pH 7.4. Under a dissection microscope (Stemi 2000, Zeiss) the epithelial layer was carefully removed, and the epithelial cells were placed immediately thereafter in lysis buffer (QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). mRNA purification and cDNA preparation were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SensiScript RT Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 0.1–0.2 μg of mRNA were used to create a cDNA library. For the respective PCR reactions (1 unit of Taq polymerase, 30 nm MgCl2, 4 nm dNTPs, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, ddH2O to a reaction volume of 20 μl (all from Life Technologies, Inc.); KCNQ1, 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 45 s at 72 °C; KCNE1, 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; KCNE3, 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; for 35 cycles each), the following mouse-specific primers (10 pm) were used: KCNQ1 (product length, 421 bp), sense 5′-CCC TCT TCT GGA TGG AGA T-3′, antisense 5′-ATC TGC GTA GCT GCC AAA C-3′, generated according to GenBankTM accession number NM008434; KCNE1 (297 bp), sense 5′-GCT CGT AAG TCT CAG CTC CG-3′, antisense 5′-CGA CAA TGG CTT CAG TTC AGG-3′, generated according to GenBankTM accession number NM008424; KCNE3 (302 bp), sense 5′-AAC GGG ACT GAG ACC TGG TA-3′, antisense 5′-CAT CAG ATC ATA GAC ACA CGG-3′, generated according to GenBankTM accession number NM020574. cDNA was synthesized using mouse total RNA from tracheal epithelial cells, colon, and kidney. A second set of mouse-specific primers was used for these experiments: mKCNQ1 (sense, bp 756–775; antisense, bp 1387–1406; from GenBankTMaccession number MMU70068, Tm 62 °C); mKCNE1 (sense, bp 98–117; antisense, bp 528–547; from GenBankTM accession number NM008424, Tm 62 °C); mKCNE3 (sense, bp 211–230; antisense, 664–683; from GenBankTM accession number NM020574, Tm 58 °C). They were amplified using the following PCR conditions: 3 min at 94 °C; 15 s at 94 °C, 25 s at Tm, 20 s at 72 °C for 32 cycles. After product quantification with the intensity of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal, specific PCR products were detected by Southern probing using internal oligonucleotides. Radioactivity was measured after 10 min with a phosphorimaging device (Fuji bio-imaging analyzer). 2.5 μm, thin, paraffin-embedded tracheal sections of KCNE1 −/− and +/+ mice were used. After removal of paraffin and re-hydration, the sections were boiled for 3 min in citrate buffer (10 mm, pH 6.0). The affinity-purified polyclonal KCNQ1 antibody (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany) was directed against the peptide CPADLGPRPRVSLDPRVSIY of the cytosolic N terminus (22Grahammer F. Herling A.W. Lang H.J. Schmitt-Gräff A. Wittekindt O. Nitschke R. Bleich M. Barhanin J. Warth R. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The polyclonal KCNE1 antibody was directed against the whole polypeptide (23Lesage F. Attali B. Honore E. Romey G. Faurobert E. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were dissolved in antibody dilution solution (1:500 and 1:1000, respectively; Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was used as secondary antibody and HOE 333342 (2 μm, Molecular Probes) for staining of the nuclei. Control experiments were performed by omitting either primary of secondary antibody respectively. The sections were examined with a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany; Alexa488, excitation at 488 nm, emission at 505–550 nm). The trachea was split along the anterior side, and the pars membranacea of the trachea was then mounted into an Ussing chamber (area 0.64 mm2) with the aid of a dissection microscope. The chamber (2 ml) was maintained at 37 °C and continuously perfused on both sides at a rate of 10–15 ml/min with a solution containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 0.4 KH2PO4, 1.6 K2HPO4, 5d-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 1.3 calcium gluconate, and 1 μm Indomethacin (Sigma) to inhibit endogenous cAMP formation; pH was adjusted to 7.4. To prevent muscular contraction, 10 nm tetrodotoxin (Molecular Probes) was added to the basolateral solution. The tissue was given at least 40 min of equilibration time prior to experiments. Trans-epithelial resistance (Rte) was determined from the voltage deflection, ΔVte, caused by the injection of short current pulses (0.2 Hz, 0.9 s duration, 0.5 μA); the resistance of the empty chamber was subtracted. Equivalent short circuit current (Isc) was calculated from trans-epithelial voltage (Vte), and Rte was calculated according to Ohm’s law. The sign of the Isc and Vterefer to the lumen. Amiloride (50 μm, Sigma), azosemide (500 μm, Sanofi Winthrop, München, Germany), cyclopiazonic acid (50 μm, Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany), 1-EBIO (1 mm, Sigma), and 293B (10 nm-10 μm, Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) were dissolved in Me2SO; forskolin (5 μm, Aventis) was dissolved in methanol. Data are shown as the mean values ± S.E. from n observations. Paired as well as unpaired Student’s t tests were used as appropriate. A p value of ≤0.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance, which is marked in the figures with the ★ symbol. RT-PCR showed an mRNA expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 in harvested tracheal epithelial cells of wild-type and KCNE1 knock-out mice. mRNA expression of KCNE1 in the cells of wild-type mice could not be detected with this sensitive method, albeit parallel experiments with the same amount of kidney mRNA gave a clearly visible band at the expected length (Fig. 1 A). To verify our results we performed a second RT-PCR with a different set of primers, quantified the amount of cDNA according to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal of the different tissues, and used a Southern blot specifically to probe and quantify the reaction products (Fig. 1 B). In these experiments in addition to cDNA from tracheal epithelial cells we used colon and kidney cDNA as a reference for KCNQ1/KCNE3 and KCNE1, respectively. KCNQ1 and KCNE3 were both expressed in colon and trachea, whereas KCNE1 could not be detected in these tissues, which was in striking contrast to kidney. We therefore conclude that there is no relevant mRNA expression of the KCNE1 gene in murine tracheal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence with KCNQ1- and KCNE1-specific antibodies showed a cytoplasmatic as well as cell membrane expression pattern of KCNQ1 in tracheal sections of both genotypes, whereas a KCNE1-specific signal could not have been established in KCNE1 wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Controls, omitting either primary or secondary antibody, were both negative (data not shown). In paraffin-embedded KCNE1 wild-type kidney sections, the KCNE1 protein could easily be detected in the brush-border membrane of proximal tubules, which was already shown for the rat (24Sugimoto T. Tanabe Y. Shigemoto R. Iwai M. Takumi T. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As expected, this signal was absent in kidney sections of KCNE1 knock-out mice (data not shown). Thus, these findings suggest the presence of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 in murine tracheal epithelial cells and a lack of KCNE1 expression in this tissue.Figure 2In contrast to the KCNE1 antibody (left panel), a KCNQ1-specific antibody (right panel) gives a green signal in the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of tracheal epithelial cells when examined with a laser scanning microscope, corresponding well with the earlier findings in RT-PCR experiments. Nuclei are stained with Hoe 333342 (blue color); the gray colorrepresents the underlying differential interference contrast image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish whether the expression of these two genes’ products correlates with a detectable functional role, we performed in vitro Ussing chamber experiments with freshly excised murine tracheas. After the Isc had reached a stable plateau (∼40 min), the KCNQ1-specific inhibitor 293B (0.1–10 μm) was added to the basolateral side under three different conditions: 1) luminal control solution, 2) luminal amiloride (50 μm), and 3) both luminal amiloride and basolateral forskolin (5 μm) (Fig. 3, Table I). In the presence of luminal control solution, basolateral 293B (10 μm) reduced the Isc by 39.1 ± 5.5 μA/cm2 (n = 7). When amiloride was added to the luminal solution, the effect of 293B was reduced to 19.8 ± 2.2 μA/cm2 (n = 6). Stimulation by forskolin in the presence of luminal amiloride induced a rise in Isc of −49.1 ± 6 μA/cm2(n = 7). The current under this condition was inhibited by 293B by 45.7 ± 4.6 μA/cm2 (n = 7; Figs. 3 and 4 A, Table I). Compared with the current in the presence of luminal amiloride the 293B-sensitive current was doubled by the administration of forskolin, which underscores the importance of KCNQ1 complexes for cAMP activated secretion (Fig. 5). When added after the administration of amiloride and 293B, forskolin still induced a rise in Isc of 26.4 ± 1.6 μA/cm2(n = 6, Table I). This current was completely inhibited by the selective inhibitor of the basolateral Na+2Cl−K+ cotransporter, azosemide (500 μm), indicating a 293B-insensitive component of cAMP-stimulated Cl− secretion.Table IConditionControl before 293BAfter 293B (10 μm)VteRteIscVteRteIscmVohm cm2μA/cm2mVohm cm2μA/cm21 Bilateral control (n = 7)−11.5 ± 1.170.8 ± 6.8−165.5 ± 12.2−8.9 ± 0.873.2 ± 7.5−126.4 ± 13.22 Lum. amiloride, bl. control (n = 6)−6.0 ± 0.3131 ± 8.0−46.7 ± 4.1−3.6 ± 0.1136.3 ± 7.4−27.0 ± 2.23 Lum. amiloride, bl. forskolin (n = 7)−5.8 ± 0.572 ± 6.4−82.8 ± 6.9−2.7 ± 0.373.8 ± 6.1−37.1 ± 3.54 Lum. amiloride + ATP, bl. forskolin (n = 16)−31.6 ± 1.756.8 ± 2.5−574.3 ± 44.1−13.8 ± 0.989.2 ± 4.0−155.3 ± 9.55 Lum. amiloride + CPA, bl. forskolin (n = 6)−24.8 ± 2.973.5 ± 4.1−340.1 ± 42−10.8 ± 2.1107.8 ± 11.2−106.6 ± 24.36 Lum. amiloride + EBIO, bl. control (n = 8)−6.75 ± 0.5102.3 ± 5.1−66 ± 4.2−3.6 ± 0.2101.3 ± 5.2−36.4 ± 2.7The experimental series in conditions 1 and 3 were the same, whereas all other results were obtained from different sets of experiments.

Agonists and inhibitors were added to the luminal (lum.) or the basolateral (bl.) side, respectively. Values are given as the mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments indicated under the respective experimental condition. The IC50 of 293B given basolaterally after stimulation of Cl− secretion by forskolin was 1.6 μm, which is in good agreement with previously published results in other tissues (25Suessbrich H. Busch A.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 137: 191-226PubMed Google Scholar). The basolateral connective and muscular tissue in our experimental set-up, which could not be removed completely, constitutes a pharmacokinetic hindrance. Therefore we also established the IC50 of 293B after luminal administration of the compound. Under these conditions the IC50 was 0.4 μm, which is very close to the recently published value of 0.3 μm in human nasal epithelium (Fig. 4 B) (19Mall M. Wissner A. Schreiber R. Kuehr J. Seydewitz H.H. Brandis M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to the molecular approach, we compared functional parameters in tracheal tissue from wild-type (KCNE1 +/+) and knock-out mice (KCNE1 −/−). Basal Isc was increased in KCNE1 −/− to −228.4 ± 19.4 μA/cm2(n = 8) as compared with −165.5 ± 12.2 μA/cm2 (n = 7) in KCNE1 +/+. KCNE1 −/− also showed an enhanced effect of forskolin (5 μm) and 293B (10 μm) compared with KCNE1 +/+. The forskolin-induced increase in Isc was −83.7 ± 7.8 μA/cm2 (n = 8) in KCNE1 −/− and −49.1 ± 6 μA/cm2(n = 7) in KCNE1 +/+, respectively. 293B decreased Isc by 70.9 ± 10 μA/cm2(n = 8) in KCNE1 −/− compared with 45.7 ± 4.6 μA/cm2 (n = 7) in wild-type mice (Fig. 6). The effect of 293B under control conditions was 30.2 ± 3.5 μA/cm2 (n= 8) in KCNE1 −/−, which was not different from its effect in KCNE1 +/+ mice (39.1 ± 5.5 μA/cm2, n = 7). To establish the contribution of KCNQ1 complexes to Ca2+-activated secretion, we used either luminal ATP (100 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 50 μm). Both agents are known to increase intracellular Ca2+ in the presence and absence of 293B. To rule out receptor desensitization or incomplete washout of 293B, these experiments were performed in a permutated manner. In the presence of luminal amiloride (50 μm) and basolateral forskolin (5 μm), 293B (10 μm) reduced the ATP- and CPA-induced peak rise in Isc by about 80% (Table I). The effect of ATP without 293B was −461.9 ± 36.2 μA/cm2(n = 16), and the effect of CPA was −277.8 ± 40.3 μA/cm2 (n = 6), respectively. After administration of 293B the short circuit current was reduced: −104.6 ± 8.1 μA/cm2 (n = 16) for ATP and −49.8 ± 17 μA/cm2 (n = 6) for CPA (Figs. 7 and 8), respectively. The rise in Isc during the plateau phase after administration of ATP was not affected by 293B; it was −31.2 ± 5.4 μA/cm2 (n = 16) without 293B and −32.1 ± 4.1 μA/cm2 (n = 16) with 293B (10 μm). This result indicates the activation of channels other than KCNQ1 complexes to ensure the necessary basolateral K+conductance during the plateau phase of ATP induced secretion.Figure 8Summary of the effects of 293B (10 μm) on ATP (100 μm, n = 16)- and CPA (50 μm, n = 6)-induced Isc peak increase. Peak Isc was reduced by about 80% in the presence of 293B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish the role of KCNQ1 complexes during pharmacological stimulation of secretion independent of changes in cytosolic cAMP or Ca2+, we compared the effect of 293B (10 μm) before and after the administration of 1-ethylbenzimidazolone (1-EBIO, 1 mm). In this series 293B reduced the basal Isc by 13.3 ± 2.3 μA/cm2(n = 8). As expected, 1-EBIO after washout of 293B increased the Isc from −29.4 ± 3.2 μA/cm2 (n = 8) to a stable plateau of −66.1 ± 4.2 μA/cm2 (n = 8). Surprisingly, the effect of 293B during administration of 1-EBIO was more than doubled as compared with control conditions (Fig. 9, Table I). 293B reduced the Isc by 29.7 ± 5.2 μA/cm2(n = 8). Hence, 50% of the 1-EBIO effect was sensitive to inhibition by the chromanol 293B. The role of KCNQ1 channel complexes in airway epithelial cells has not been studied thoroughly, which is in contrast to studies in small and large intestine (11Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S.

Mufti D.A.H. Durrington H.J. Cuthbert A.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 237-247Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to the α-subunit KCNQ1, the β-subunit KCNE1 had been associated in several studies with a functional role in airway epithelial cells (20Hwang T. Suh D. Bae H. Lee S. Jung J. J Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Lock H. Valverde M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34849-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We confirmed the expression of the α-subunit KCNQ1 by RT-PCR alone, RT-PCR and subsequent Southern probing, immunofluorescence, and by demonstrating a 293B-sensitive current. KCNQ1 is expressed in the cytoplasmatic and the basolateral membranes of murine tracheal epithelial cells. In contrast to other groups, we could neither establish a relevant mRNA expression of KCNE1 with sensitive RT-PCR methods nor could we detect a protein expression with the help of a specific antibody in murine tracheal epithelial cells. As the molecular evidence for an expression of KCNE1 in trachea previously relied on RT-PCR in primary cultured rat tracheal epithelial cells, the apparent discrepancy of these results to our study might be explained by: (a) a species difference between rat and mouse, (b) an altered gene expression due to the 10-day exposure to culture medium (29Grubb B.R. Pace A.J. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C615-C623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or (c) fundamental differences in the experimental protocols used (20Hwang T. Suh D. Bae H. Lee S. Jung J. J Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Instead of KCNE1 we found the related β-subunit KCNE3 to be expressed in murine tracheal epithelial cells. In KCNE1 knock-out mice, we did not observe a loss or reduction of function as one would expect if KCNE1 participates in Cl−secretion. However, the Isc was increased under control conditions and after stimulation with forskolin in KCNE1 knock-out mice. The latter finding is probably because of changes in systemic hormone levels of these animals that in turn might influence expression of genes important for fluid transport (30Arrighi I. Bloch-Faure M. Grahammer F. Bleich M. Warth R. Mengual R. Barhanin J. Meneton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2130512685,"p53 and p73 proteins activate similar target genes and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, p53, but not p73 is considered a tumour-suppressor gene. Unlike p53, p73 deficiency in mice does not lead to a cancer-prone phenotype, and p73 gene is not mutated in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report that normal liver cells express only DeltaN-p73 transcript forms giving rise to the synthesis of N-terminally truncated, transcriptionally inactive and dominant negative p73 proteins. In contrast, most hepatocellular carcinoma cells express TA-p73 transcript forms encoding full-length and transcriptionally active p73 proteins, in addition to DeltaN-p73. We also show that together with the acquired expression of TA-p73, the 'retinoblastoma pathway' is inactivated, and E2F1-target genes including cyclin E and p14(ARF) are activated in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there was no full correlation between 'retinoblastoma pathway' inactivation and TA-p73 expression. Most TA-p73-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma cells have also lost p53 function either by lack of expression or missense mutations. The p73 gene, encoding only DeltaN-p73 protein, may function as a tumour promoter rather than a tumour suppressor in liver tissue. This may be one reason why p73 is not a mutation target in hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2077211615,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) represents the most frequent genetic alteration observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chromosome 16q is of particular interest as it exhibits LOH in 29% of HCC tumors and is frequently lost in breast, prostate, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. We genotyped 157 HCC tumors for 17 microsatellite markers distributed on chromosome 16q and determined a common region of LOH localized between the markers D16S518 and D16S504. By refining the boundaries of two interstitial LOH and two homozygous deletions, the critical region was delimited to 180 kb between D16S3096 and D16S3029. This region is located in intron 8 of the WWOX/FOR gene, but a search for mutations in all coding exons of this gene in 27 HCC tumors and cell lines did not reveal any tumor somatic alterations. Furthermore, by RT-PCR, no abnormal transcripts of this WWOX/FOR gene was detected in nine HCC cell lines. Finally, analysis of the p53 gene mutations with the clinical parameters of all tumors revealed that the two homozygous deletions have occurred in tumors presenting a R249S mutation. Our data revealed a relationship between chromosome 16q homozygous deletions and R249S p53 mutations in tumors where the patient had been exposed to aflatoxin B1 (P=0.002). These results are consistent with a role of aflatoxin B1 in the instability of chromosome 16q at the fragile site FRA16D. However, the nature of the specific gene that is altered during hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be elucidated."

Prompted by earlier findings of ligands for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases in extracellular matrix we investigated if Matrigel, a preparation of extracellular matrix proteins, contained modulators of the specific activity of the receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1. Matrigel stimulation of cells increased the specific activity of immunoprecipitated DEP-1. Also, incubation of immunoprecipitated DEP-1 with Matrigel led to an increase in DEP-1 activity, which was blocked by soluble DEP-1 extracellular domain. Finally, immunoprecipitated DeltaECD-DEP-1, a mutant form of DEP-1 lacking most of the extracellular domain, failed to respond to Matrigel stimulation. These experiments identify Matrigel as a source of DEP-1 agonist(s) and provide the first evidence for upregulation of the specific activity of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by extracellular ligands."

In trypanosomes, glutathione is conjugated to spermidine to form a unique cofactor termed trypanothione, an essential cofactor for the maintenance of redox balance in the cell. Using extensive similarity searches and sequence motif analysis we detected homology between γ-GCS and glutamine synthetase (GS), allowing these proteins to be unified into a superfamily of carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligases. The structure of γ-GCS, which was previously poorly understood, was modeled using the known structure of GS. Two metal-binding sites, each ligated by three conserved active site residues (n1: Glu-55, Glu-93, Glu-100; and n2: Glu-53, Gln-321, and Glu-489), are predicted to form the catalytic center of the active site, where the n1 site is expected to bind free metal and the n2 site to interact with MgATP. To elucidate the roles of the metals and their ligands in catalysis, these six residues were mutated to alanine in the Trypanosoma brucei enzyme. All mutations caused a substantial loss of activity. Most notably, E93A was able to catalyze thel-Glu-dependent ATP hydrolysis but not the peptide bond ligation, suggesting that the n1 metal plays an important role in positioning l-Glu for the reaction chemistry. The apparent Km values for ATP were increased for both the E489A and Q321A mutant enzymes, consistent with a role for the n2 metal in ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. Furthermore, the apparent Kd values for activation of E489A and Q321A by free Mg2+ increased. Finally, substitution of Mn2+for Mg2+ in the reaction rescued the catalytic deficits caused by both mutations, demonstrating that the nature of the metal ligands plays an important role in metal specificity. γ-Glultamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) catalyzes the first step in the de novo biosynthesis of glutathione.

E55A, Glu-55 to Ala mutant T. brucei γ-GCS Glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) is a tripeptide thiol that acts as a sulfhydryl buffer. It is present in mammalian cells at high concentrations and plays an important role in many cellular processes, such as detoxification of oxidative species, protein and DNA synthesis, and cellular import of amino acids (1Meister A.

The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness, a disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in Africa. The identification of metabolic differences between parasite and host is an important step in the development of new anti-trypanosomal agents (3Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 93-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammals and trypanosomes differ in their metabolism of glutathione. Trypanosomes utilize a unique molecule that is a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine, called trypanothione, to maintain reduced thiol pools in the cell (4Fairlamb A.H. Le Quesne S.A,. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis. CAB International, Wallingford, Oxen, UK1997: 149-161Google Scholar). The first committed step in the biosynthesis of glutathione, and thereby trypanothione, is the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine, catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS)1 (5Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). γ-GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione in mammalian cells (6Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and of trypanothione in the trypanosomatid,Leishmania tarentolae (7Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).γ-GCS catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the γ-carboxyl of l-Glu and the α-amino group ofl-Cys. A number of acceptor amino acids have been tested in place of l-Cys and the enzyme was found to catalyze the reaction utilizing l-Aba with similar efficiency asl-Cys (8Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme utilizes ATP to promote this reaction by first phosphorylating the γ-carboxyl of l-Glu (Fig. 1). The phosphate group of this intermediate is a good leaving group for the subsequent attack by the α-amino group of l-Cys (5Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). Purified rat kidney γ-GCS is activated by both Mg2+ and Mn2+ (9Orlowski M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mn2+ activates the enzyme at 10-fold lower concentrations than Mg2+, but the rate in the presence of Mn2+is 4-fold slower than with Mg2+. Moreover, Mn2+lowers the specificity of the enzyme for the acceptor amino acid (8Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).γ-GCS has been identified in animals, bacteria, plants, fungi, and protozoa. However, the relationship between animal, bacterial, and plant enzymes was unclear due to the absence of pronounced sequence similarity between them (10May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite extensive functional studies of γ-GCS in many organisms, our understanding of its structure and catalytic mechanism had been limited. A three-dimensional structure of γ-GCS is not available and the enzyme is structurally unrelated to mechanistically similar enzymes such as d-Alad-Ala ligase and glutathione synthetase (11Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, with the rapid expansion of protein sequence data and the development of sensitive similarity search tools such as PSI-BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) and HMMer (13Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), the limits of sequence-based homology detection are being extended (14Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments contain information about the positional variation of amino acid usage that is the basis for profile generation (15Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl.

Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar), we were able to detect homology between animal, fungal, plant, and bacterial γ-GCS proteins. A multiple alignment was constructed from these γ-GCS sequences. Using the profile generated from this multiple sequence alignment, statistically significant sequence similarity between γ-GCS and glutamine synthetase (GS) was found. Homology between γ-GCS and GS was further supported by secondary structure predictions and conservation pattern analysis.GS is a crucial enzyme in nitrogen metabolism that ligates ammonia to the γ-carboxyl of l-Glu, also in an ATP-dependent reaction (18Ginsburg A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1972; 26: 1-79Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The structure of GS with and without bound substrates has been reported (20Liaw S.H. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and thus provides a fold prediction for γ-GCS that yields insight into the molecular basis of its catalytic function. A partial model of the γ-GCS active site was constructed based on the GS structure allowing the Mg2+, MgATP, and l-Glu-binding sites to be modeled.This model of the γ-GCS active site residues was used as a guide for experimental studies of the T. brucei γ-GCS, which has previously been kinetically characterized (21Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26317-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on the homology to GS, six conserved residues in γ-GCS are predicted to form two metal-binding sites (n1: Glu-55, Glu-93, Glu-100; and n2: Glu-53, Glu-489, Gln-321). The roles of these six amino acid residues were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. All six residues are crucial for enzyme activity. The activity of only three of the mutant enzymes (E93A, E489A, and Q321A) was sufficient for detailed study. E93A was able to catalyze l-Glu-dependent ATP hydrolysis but not peptide bond ligation, suggesting that the n1 metal plays an important role stabilizing the transition state for this latter step. Mutations of Glu-489 and Gln-321 to Ala greatly affected both metal activation and MgATP binding, supporting a role for the n2 metal in binding of MgATP. Surprisingly, we found that Mn2+ can rescue activity in these mutants. These data validate an important structural prediction and provide novel insight regarding the residues in the active site of γ-GCS that are crucial for divalent metal binding and catalysis.RESULTSIdentification of Homology among γ-GCS ProteinsTo clarify the relationships among γ-GCS proteins from different organisms, we conducted PSI-BLAST searches starting from individual sequences from fungi, plants, and bacteria. Similarity searches initiated with plant sequences retrieved a hypothetical protein from Synechosytis sp. (gi‖7469602, iteration 2, E-value 0.05). Using this protein as the query we detected many bacterial sequences as well as sequences from plants (e.g. gi‖7489004, L. esculentum, iteration 3, E-value 4e-05), animals (e.g.gi‖7494173, Plasmodium falciparum, iteration 3, E-value 0.044), and fungi (e.g. gi‖885591,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, iteration 4, E-value 0.007), implying that these γ-GCSs are homologous. Searches with the E. coli γ-GCS sequence (gi‖121661) converged within a separate bacterial group that could not be linked with other γ-GCSs using PSI-BLAST. However, analysis of conserved motifs and secondary structure predictions in this group, and their comparison with other γ-GCSs, suggested homology among all known γ-GCS proteins (Fig. 2). Based on sequence similarities and phylogeny of organisms, we divided γ-GCS homologues into two eukaryotic groups (E-I and E-II) and three prokaryotic groups (P-I, P-II, and P-III) (Fig. 2).Identification of GS as a Structural Homolog of γ-GCSPSI-BLAST searches starting from γ-GCS sequences could not detect any proteins outside the γ-GCS family with significant E-values (<0.02). Because the sensitivity of profile-based similarity searches relies on the quality of the multiple sequence alignment, alignments produced automatically by PSI-BLAST might be of insufficient quality to detect remote homologues. Thus after automated PSI-BLAST iterations failed to detect γ-GCS homologues with statistically significant scores, we used the manually adjusted multiple alignment of all identified γ-GCS sequences to start profile-based searches. For some query sequences (for example, gi‖11282603 from Xylella fastidiosa, Fig. 2), seeding PSI-BLAST with the γ-GCS alignment produced significant hits (E-value less than 0.02, bit score >40) to a protein outside the γ-GCS family. This Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein (gi‖7478087) is annotated as “probable glnA3 protein” and belongs to the type I GS family (Fig. 2). No other proteins were detected with E-values less than 0.02. The key residues for metal and substrate binding or catalysis in GS form highly conserved motifs that are mainly located in the central β-sheet (Fig. 3). An inspection of the multiple sequence alignments of γ-GCS and GS reveals consistent conservation of these key residues (Fig. 2). Additionally, hydrophilic and hydrophobic positions alternate along the predicted β-strands, and secondary structure prediction (27Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) of the aligned regions are similar (data not shown). Thus we conclude that γ-GCSs and GSs are homologous and unify them into a superfamily of carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligases.Figure 3Structure of the C-terminal domain of type I GS. The structure of the C-terminal domain of S. typhimurium GS is displayed (Protein Data Bank entry 1F52, chain A, residues 102–462).

Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Liaw S.H. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Only the C-terminal domain of GS is homologous to γ-GCS and it consists of a central anti-parallel β-sheet of 6 strands with several α-helices packed on one side of it (Fig. 3). The other side of the β-sheet accommodates the active site with the binding sites for metal ions and substrates. All of the core β-strands and α-helices of GS can be mapped to the γ-GCS sequences, among which are two hydrophobic α-helices buried between the β-sheet and outside helices (Fig. 2). Two divalent metal ions (termed n1 and n2, which may be Mg2+ or Mn2+) participate in substrate binding and catalysis by GS. The n1 metal interacts with the α-carboxyl group of l-Glu and the n2 metal interacts with ATP and is involved in phosphoryl transfer. Each metal is chelated by three highly conserved residues: the n1 metal is liganded by Glu-131, Glu-212, and Glu-220 and the n2 metal is bound by Glu-129, His-269, and Glu-357 (Fig. 3). Five of the metal ligands are conserved throughout the γ-GCS and GS families, while His-269 is conservatively replaced with Gln in many γ-GCS proteins (Fig. 2). The conservation of metal-binding residues across the superfamily suggests that γ-GCS also binds two metal ions that are chelated similarly. The binding sites for l-Glu and ATP are also predicted to be similar between GS and γ-GCS, while the third substrate differs between the two (ammonia in GS versus l-Cys in γ-GCS) and the binding pockets are not expected to be conserved. The negative charges of the ATP phosphoryl groups in GS are mainly stabilized by the n2 metal and by Arg-344, which is conserved in both families (Fig. 2). His-271 also interacts with the phosphates of ATP in GS and is replaced by Asn or Thr in many of the γ-GCS sequences, while Ser-273, which forms a hydrogen bond to N-6 of the ATP purine ring in GS is replaced by Ser, Asp, or Gln in γ-GCS (Fig. 2). In GS two arginine residues confer the substrate specificity for l-Glu, Arg-321 interacts with the α-carboxyl and Arg-359 with the γ-carboxylate ofl-Glu (Figs. 2 and 3). The corresponding positions in γ-GCS also contain a positively charged residue (typically Arg), suggesting that l-Glu binds to γ-GCS in a similar manner.Diversity of γ-GCS and GS SuperfamilyThe difficulty in identifying the relationship between the γ-GCS and GS families results from the fact that this superfamily of carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligases is very diverse, e.g. with sequence identity ranging from 7 to 92% for the full-length sequences in Fig. 2. Thus, it is not straightforward to build a phylogenetic tree for the superfamily, the branching order in such a tree would be highly unreliable. To illustrate the relationships between the superfamily members, we have chosen to represent the sequences as points in Euclidian space with distances between the points approximating evolutionary distances. The two-dimensional projection of the space onto the plane of the largest scatter of points is shown (Fig. 4). The points were grouped according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” resulting in 7 clusters that are colored differently on the distance projection plot (Fig. 4). Sequences that are more closely related group together on the plot. Eukaryotic group I (E-I) contains animal and fungal sequences; they share high sequence similarities. E-II/P-I consists of plant and prokaryotic sequences, which are similar to each other and relatively distant from animal or fungal sequences. The high similarity between plant and prokaryotic sequences from this group might suggest horizontal transfer events between plants and bacteria/archaea. The distance plot shows that sequences of groups E-II/P-I and P-II are closer to each other than to any other group. In contrast, the P-III group is well separated from the rest and it includes the first experimentally characterized prokaryotic γ-GCS from E. coli (30Watanabe K. Yamano Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4393-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, the GS sequences, which have been classified into three groups, are distant from all of the γ-GCS sequences and group together on the plot.Figure 4Distance diagram of representative sequences of γ-GCS and GS. Coordinates 1 and 2 are the two dimensions of maximal scatter of points in a multidimensional space. The points represent the sequences in Fig. 2, numbered correspondingly. The representations are: filled black circles (E-I, 1–5), red rectangles (E-II/P-I, 6–13),green triangles (P-II, 14–18), dark yellow-green triangles (P-III, 19–28), purple plus signs (GS-I, 29–32), brown diamonds (GS-II, 33–36), and cyan lines (GS-III, 37–39).

Their detected homology to γ-GCS facilitates functional annotation and classification of these sequences. Two archaeal proteins (gi‖11499888 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and gi‖10580902 from Halobacterium sp.) are among these hypothetical proteins. There have been no previous reports about the presence of γ-GCS in archaea. Our detection of γ-GCS in Halobacterium sp. is consistent with previous findings that γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptide is one of the major thiols in halobacteria in the absence of significant glutathione (31Newton G.L. Javor B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; : 438-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Characterization of Metal Dependence by Wild-type T. brucei γ-GCSThe finding that γ-GCS is a structural homolog of GS supports the conclusion that γ-GCS has two metal-binding sites. To evaluate this hypothesis experimentally, the dependence of the reaction rate of wild-type γ-GCS on free Mg2+ was monitored. The concentrations of free metal and MgATP were calculated from total metal and ATP concentrations by using the computer program “Bound and Determined” (28Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Saturating concentrations of MgATP,l-Glu, and l-Aba were used for the analysis. A hyperbolic dependence of the reaction rate on free Mg2+ was observed (Fig. 5). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the Kdapp (apparent dissociation constant) for free Mg2+ at 2 mm ATP was determined to be 0.50 ± 0.04 mm (TableI). Small variations in the concentration of MgATP (less than a 2-fold change occurs over the 35-fold range of free Mg2+) did occur over the range of the titration but were not substantial enough to account for the rate activation by free Mg2+. Thus, the data are consistent with the model derived from the GS structure in which the active enzyme species binds both Mg2+ and MgATP at separate sites.Figure 5Divalent metal activation of wild-type and mutant γ-GCS. The dependence of enzyme rate on free Mn2+(●) or Mg2+ (▾). Free metal concentration was calculated from total metal concentration using the program “Bound and Determined.” Lines represent the fit of the displayed data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The concentrations for l-Glu and l-Aba in all experiments were 10 and 100 mm, respectively. The concentrations of ATP in the assays were: A, wild-type, 2 mm; B, E93A, 5 mm; C, E489A, 5 mm; and D, Q321A, 15 mm. Wild-type data with Mn2+ was fit to the Hill equation (n = 2.5) as a hyperbola did not fit the data (see “Results”). The square of the correlation coefficient (r 2) for the global fit of all displayed data are greater than 0.98.

Open table in a new tab Effects of Substituting Mn2+ for Mg2+Wild-type T. brucei γ-GCS is also activated by Mn2+ (Fig. 5). The activity is stimulated at significantly lower concentrations of Mn2+ (EC50 = 6 μm) than Mg2+, however, the maximum catalytic rate is slightly lower. Total Mn2+ concentrations above 0.75 mm are inhibitory. Unlike for Mg2+, the dependence of rate on free Mn2+ concentrations is sigmoidal and suggests multiple Mn2+ ions may be binding cooperatively. Indeed the concentration of MnATP could not be held constant over the range of free Mn2+ concentrations used in the titration, thus the data reflect contributions from the binding of both free Mn2+ and MnATP to separate sites on the enzyme.The kinetic constants for all three substrates were also measured in the presence of constant concentration of free Mn2+. The Km values for l-Glu and Aba were similar to those measured in the presence of Mg2+ and the Km for MnATP was 3-fold lower than for MgATP (TablesII andIII).Table IIKinetic analysis of T. brucei γ-GCS mutants in the presence of Mg2+Enzymekcat(MgATP)Kmapp l-GluKmapp l-AbaKmapp MgATPkcat/KmMnATPs−1mmm−1s−1Wild-typeakcat is the fitted parameter from varying Mg2+ over its dynamic concentration range.

P1-type ATPases have a distinctive amino-terminal domain containing the conserved metal-binding motif GXXCXXC. ZntA has one copy of this motif while ATP7B has six copies. The effect of interchanging the amino-terminal domains of ATP7B and ZntA was investigated. Chimeric proteins were constructed in which either the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or only its sixth metal-binding motif replaced the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Both chimeras conferred resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts but not to copper salts. The purified chimeras displayed activity with lead, cadmium, zinc, and mercury, which are substrates of ZntA. There was no activity with copper or silver, which are substrates of ATP7B. The chimeras were 2–3-fold less active than ZntA. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases cannot alter the metal specificity determined by the transmembrane segment. Also, these results suggest that this domain interacts with the rest of the transporter in a metal ion-specific manner; the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity.

The functions carried out by these pumps include maintenance of homeostasis of essential soft metals like copper, cobalt, iron, and zinc; conferment of resistance to toxic concentrations of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, and silver; and delivery of specific metal ions to target enzymes. In humans, Menkes and Wilson diseases are caused by mutations in two Cu(I)-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively (5Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat.

Wilson disease is characterized by the accumulation of toxic concentrations of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain. ATP7B, the Wilson disease-associated protein, is a 1411 amino acid protein that is localized primarily in the trans-Golgi network where it pumps copper from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen (10Hung I.H.

ZntA is one of two P1-type ATPases from Escherichia coli; it is specific for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) and confers resistance to these metal ions in vivo (11Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Beard S.J. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Mol.

This domain contains 1–6 repeats of a conserved metal-binding motif; this motif is 70–100 residues long and usually contains the sequence GXXCXXC. This motif also occurs in metallothioneins, copper chaperone proteins, and the periplasmic mercury-binding protein MerP, among others (14Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J.

Both ATP7A and ATP7B have six repeats of the GXXCXXC sequence, whereas the smaller bacterial P1-type ATPases generally have one or two repeats. In some P1-type ATPases, the cysteine-rich amino terminus is replaced by a highly histidine-rich sequence. The isolated amino-terminal domain of ZntA is able to bind different soft metal ions. 1B. Mitra, unpublished observation. 1B. Mitra, unpublished observation. The amino-terminal domain of ATP7B (WND-Cu(1–6)),2 comprising residues 1–649, has been shown to bind six atoms of copper (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Detailed structural analysis of copper binding to this domain showed that each binding site ligates copper in a +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry (19DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain revealed that both secondary and tertiary structural changes take place upon copper binding. The conformational changes correlate very well with the cooperativity of copper binding to this domain reported earlier (18DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These observations together with other functional data led us to postulate that copper-induced conformational changes in WND-Cu(1–6) stimulate the phosphorylation of the ATPase, thereby initiating the copper transport cycle (19DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). P1-type ATPases display a high degree of specificity for the metal ions that are transported. For example, ATP7A and ATP7B transport the monovalent cation Cu(I) and possibly Ag(I). On the other hand, ZntA has been shown to be specific for Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The determinants of metal ion recognition and specificity for P1-type ATPases are not known. Because there is a high level of sequence similarity among all P1-type ATPases, the basis of metal ion specificity remains an intriguing question. We recently characterized a mutant of ZntA lacking its amino-terminal domain, ΔN-ZntA (21Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ΔN-ZntA is fully capable of ATP-dependent soft metal transport and has the same metal specificity as the intact protein, although its activity is slightly lower than that of ZntA. Thus, the core transport domain of ZntA is necessary and sufficient for the recognition and transport of specific metal ions. In the present work, our goal was to investigate whether the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases also determines specificity toward particular metal ions. Toward this end, we constructed chimeric proteins in which the amino-terminal domain of ZntA was replaced by the amino-terminal domain of the Wilson Cu(I)-transporter ATP7B (Fig.1). In one chimeric protein designated WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B, containing all six metal-binding motifs, was attached to ZntA lacking its amino-terminal domain (ΔN-ZntA). In the second chimeric protein, WND-Cu(6)-ZntA, only the sixth metal-binding motif of ATP7B was attached to ΔN-ZntA. It has been reported that the sixth metal-binding domain is necessary and sufficient for the transport activity of ATP7B (22Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both chimeric proteins were able to confer resistance toward Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) in azntA-disrupted E. coli strain but not to copper in an E. coli strain disrupted in copA, which encodes a Cu(I)-transporting ATPase (23Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, in vivo the chimeras appear to behave in a manner similar to ZntA and ΔN-ZntA but not to CopA. The purified chimeric proteins were active; the ATPase activity was stimulated by Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Hg(II), cations that are substrates for ZntA. No activity was obtained with Cu(I) or Ag(I), cations that are substrates for ATP7B. TheVmax values obtained for both chimeras are lower than the values obtained for ZntA, especially in the presence of thiolates in the assay buffer. These results confirm our previous conclusion that metal ion specificity is determined by the transmembrane part of the ATPase; the amino-terminal domain cannot override this intrinsic specificity. Additionally, these results demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain interacts with the rest of the transporter in a metal ion-specific manner; the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity. Monoclonal antibodies against the hexahistidyl tag were from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA.l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (asolectin) was purified prior to use (24Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest commercial grade. The chimeric proteins WND-Cu(6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA were constructed as follows. For WND-Cu(6)-ZntA, a fragment of DNA encoding amino acids 543–666 of ATP7B that contains the sixth copper-binding domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction. An NcoI site was generated at the 5′-end to provide an initiation codon, and aKpnI site was generated at the 3′-end of the fragment using the oligonucleotides 5′-GACCATGGCTCAGTTCATCCAGGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGGTACCCTGCTTTATTTCCATTTTG-3′ together with the plasmid WCBD-pGEX-6P-2 as template. Plasmid WCBD-pGEX-6P-2 was generated by cloning the cDNA encoding the six Cu(I)-binding domains of ATP7B in pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A fragment of DNA encoding amino acids 106–732 of ZntA containing a KpnI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end was generated using the oligonucleotides 5′-GAGGTACCAAAGCAGGCTATTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCGAATTCTCTCCTGCGCAACAATC-3′ and the plasmid pZntA as a template (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The two individual polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The WND-Cu(6) fragment was excised by restriction digestion using NcoI and KpnI, while the ZntA fragment was excised using KpnI andEcoRI. The two fragments were purified and ligated together with pBAD/MycHis-C (Invitrogen), which was previously digested with NcoI and EcoRI to generate plasmid pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA in which the WND-Cu(6)-ZntA chimera is in-frame with a hexahistidyl tag at the carboxyl terminus. As a first step toward construction of the DNA fragment encoding the chimera WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, the existing EcoRI andNcoI sites, located between nucleotides 1325 and 1336 of the coding sequence of WCBD(1–6)-pGEX-6P-2, were disabled by site-directed mutagenesis by using the U.S.E. Mutagenesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotide used was 5′-GTTTGCACCATACTATTCCCAGCACTGTGG-3′ in which the altered bases, indicated in bold and italics, replaced GGA in the wild-type DNA. This mutation does not change the amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B. The resulting altered plasmid was then used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a fragment of DNA encoding amino acids 1–666 of ATP7B withNcoI and KpnI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends respectively, by using the oligonucleotide 5′-TGACCATGGGACCTGAGCAGGAGAGACAG-3′ and the same reverse primer that was used to generate WND-Cu(6). The subsequent steps in creating the plasmid pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA were essentially the same as described above for the WND-Cu(6)-ZntA chimera. To ensure that the polyhistidyl group at the carboxyl terminus can be removed when required, the plasmids carrying the chimeras were further modified. A synthetic oligonucleotide with coding sequence for the cleavage site of PreScission protease (human rhinovirus 3C protease) was introduced by an in-frame insertion between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of both plasmids pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA and pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA. This insert also contained an XbaI site to facilitate its identification in the plasmid. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-AATTCCTGGAAGTTCTGTTCCAGGGGCCCTCTACTAGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCTAGAGGGCCCCTGGAACAGAACTTCCAGG-3′. The two oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′-end using the T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, then ligated with the plasmids that were precut withEcoRI and HindIII. The presence of the insert in the ligated plasmids was confirmed by XbaI digestion. The fidelity of the sequences of the chimeras was verified by automated DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Center for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). The sensitivity of E. coli strains LMG194, LMG194(zntA::kan), as well as LMG194(zntA::kan) transformed with either pZntA, pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, or pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA to Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II) salts was measured using a basal salts medium from which zinc salts were omitted (20Sharma R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight and then diluted 50-fold in the same medium containing different concentrations of lead acetate, zinc acetate, or cadmium chloride. Cell growth at 37 °C was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm either after 24 h or at fixed time intervals. The sensitivity of LMG194, LMG194(copA::kan), as well as LMG194(copA::kan) transformed with either pCopA2, pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, or pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA to cupric chloride was measured in Luria-Bertani medium (23Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cell growth at 37 °C was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm either at fixed time intervals or after 5–8 h. The chimeric proteins were expressed by growth of LMG194(zntA::kan) transformed with the plasmids pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA and pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium followed by induction with 0.02%l-arabinose as described earlier for ZntA (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The chimeric proteins were purified using established protocols for ZntA (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Protein expression and purity were assessed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting, antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidyl tag were used to locate the recombinant proteins. The metal ion-dependent ATPase activity of purified ZntA and the chimeric proteins was assayed at 37 °C either by the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay or by a colorimetric method that measures phosphate release at fixed time intervals (26Chan K.M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 27Cogan E.B. Birrell G.B. Griffith O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were incubated with 1–2 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h prior to assays. The typical assay buffer used was 0.1 m acetic acid, 0.05 mBisTris, and 0.05 m triethanolamine (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% purified asolectin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 5.0 mm each ATP and MgCl2. When assays were performed in the presence of silver ions, care was taken to ensure that nitrate was the only anion present in the assay buffer. Lead acetate, zinc acetate, cadmium chloride, and other soft metal salts as well as cysteine were added as required. For the coupled assay, 0.25 mm NADH, 1.25 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 6–9 units of pyruvate kinase, and 13 units of lactate dehydrogenase were also included. For the phosphate release assay, 50-µl aliquots of the assay mixture were removed at fixed time intervals and quenched with 10 µl of 0.5 m EDTA. The volume was made up to 500 µl with water followed by the addition of 172 µl of reagent A (28 mm ammonium molybdate in 2.1 m sulfuric acid) and 128 µl of reagent B (0.35% polyvinyl alcohol and 0.76 mm malachite green in water). The color was allowed to develop by incubation at room temperature for 20 min followed by reading the absorbance at 610 nm. A standard curve was constructed using sodium phosphate. The Km for MgATP was measured by taking into account the dissociation constants of MgATP, MgHATP, and the pKa values of ATP (28Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 257-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In assays where thiols were added, the concentration of cysteine required to generate a constant metal ion:thiolate ion ratio was calculated using a pKa of 8.33 for cysteine. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. Data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph for the Macintosh (Synergy Software). We showed earlier that the hypersensitivity of the zntA-disrupted strain LMG194(zntA::kan) to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts can be complemented by transforming it with a plasmid containing the genes for ZntA or ΔN-ZntA, which is a mutant of ZntA lacking the amino-terminal domain (11Rensing C.

The ability of the chimeric proteins to confer resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts was tested. Fig. 2shows growth of LMG194, LMG194(zntA::kan), and LMG194(zntA::kan) transformed with plasmid pZntA, pΔN-ZntA, pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, or pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA in minimal media containing different concentrations of lead, zinc, and cadmium salts. The chimeric proteins were able to complement the sensitivity of the zntA-disrupted strain to the same extent as ZntA or ΔN-ZntA. Time courses of growth for the same strains in the absence and presence of 5 µm lead acetate, 50 µm zinc acetate, and 5 µm cadmium chloride were also measured (data not shown). Growth rates for LMG194 as well as for LMG194(zntA::kan) containing pZntA, pΔN-ZntA, pWND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, or pWND-Cu(6)-ZntA were similar, although all four plasmid-bearing strains exhibited an initial lag in growth compared with the wild-type strain LMG194. ZntA does not confer resistance to copper salts in thecopA-disrupted strain, LMG194(copA::kan) (23Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the chimeric proteins to confer resistance to copper salts. Fig. 3shows growth of LMG194, LMG194(copA::kan), and LMG194(copA::kan) transformed with plasmids containing CopA, WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, or WND-Cu(6)-ZntA in the presence of different concentrations of cupric chloride. Unlike CopA, the chimeric proteins were unable to complement the sensitive phenotype of the copA-disrupted strain. The two chimeric proteins were expressed using the same expression vector used for ZntA. WND-Cu(6)-ZntA was expressed at levels similar to ZntA; the level of expression of WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA was lower than that of ZntA under similar growth and induction conditions. The WND-Cu(6)-ZntA chimera could be purified to near homogeneity; however, the WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA chimera appeared to be partially degraded into smaller fragments in vivo. The proteins were purified using Ni(II) affinity chromatography; SDS-PAGE analysis of the chimeras is shown in Fig. 4. The molecular masses of WND-Cu(6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, including the histidyl and Myc tags, are 82 and 139.6 kDa, respectively. It is clear from Fig.4 that WND-Cu(6)-ZntA could be purified to near homogeneity, but the purified WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA had smaller degradation products. The size of the smallest fragment corresponded to the size of ΔN-ZntA. Both chimeric proteins were active and displayed ATPase activities that were stimulated by soft metal ions. As previously observed for ZntA and for ΔN-ZntA, pretreatment of the chimeras with dithiothreitol as well as with phospholipids in the assay buffer was required for the ATPase activity. Additionally, the thiolate form of cysteine in the assay buffer increased the activity of both chimeric proteins, as has also been observed with ZntA and ΔN-ZntA (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The soft metal ion-stimulated ATPase activity was measured as a function of the MgATP concentration in the presence of 100 µm Pb(II) (data not shown). The Kmvalues for MgATP at pH 7.0 and 37 °C for WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(6)-ZntA were 89 ± 9 and 160 ± 25 µm, respectively; the Km for MgATP for ZntA was 106 ± 13 µm. Table Isummarizes the kinetic parameters of both chimeric proteins together with those of ZntA and ΔN-ZntA for the soft metal-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of excess MgATP (5 mm each Mg(II) and ATP) at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. For all four proteins, Pb(II) was the best metal ion substrate. In the absence of thiolates, the Vmaxof the Pb(II)-stimulated activity for both chimeric proteins was ∼2-fold lower compared with the value for ZntA. The Zn(II)- and Cd(II)-stimulated activities of WND-Cu(6)-ZntA were similar to those of ZntA, whereas those of WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA were 2-fold lower. TheKm values for all three metals were similar; theseKm values in the absence of thiolates refer to the ATP complexes of soft metal ions given the magnitude of the association constants of PbATP, ZnATP, CdATP, and MgATP (29Sigel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). When thiolates were present in the assay buffer at a soft metal ion:thiolate ratio of 1:1, both the Vmax and the apparentKm values were higher for all four proteins. TheVmax values for both chimeras were ∼2–3-fold lower than that of ZntA; the apparent Kmvalues were also lower than that of ZntA. TheseVmax and Km values for the chimeras are very similar to those obtained for ΔN-ZntA (TableI).Table ISummary of kinetic parametersMetal ionZntAΔN-ZntA1-aValues are from Ref. 21.WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntAWND-Cu(6)-ZntAVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxKmnmol min−1mg−1µmnmol min−1mg−1µmnmol min−1mg−1µmnmol min−1mg−1µmPb(II)502 ± 105.9 ± 0.4319 ± 611.6 ± 0.8287 ± 99.3 ± 0.9285 ± 55.6 ± 0.4Zn(II)186 ± 75.2 ± 0.781 ± 79.3 ± 1.273 ± 54.2 ± 1.0152 ± 49.2 ± 0.6Cd(II)83 ± 53.8 ± 0.866 ± 34.1 ± 0.641 ± 32.0 ± 0.7105 ± 23.2 ± 0.3Pb(II) + [thiolate]2390 ± 140201 ± 241095 ± 6755 ± 11902 ± 62196 ± 281040 ± 4287 ± 10Zn(II) + [thiolate]730 ± 39115 ± 15372 ± 642 ± 3324 ± 1155 ± 6390 ± 5273 ± 9Cd(II) + [thiolate]981 ± 43216 ± 19388 ± 1052 ± 5356 ± 1397 ± 10389 ± 1457 ± 7Kinetic parameters were obtained for ZntA, ΔN-ZntA, and the chimeric proteins, WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(6)-ZntA at pH 7.0 and 37 °C for the metal ions Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) in the absence and presence of the thiolate form of cysteine at a concentration equal to the soft metal ion concentration, [M(II)].

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were obtained for ZntA, ΔN-ZntA, and the chimeric proteins, WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(6)-ZntA at pH 7.0 and 37 °C for the metal ions Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) in the absence and presence of the thiolate form of cysteine at a concentration equal to the soft metal ion concentration, [M(II)]. The Mg(II) and ATP concentrations were 5 mM each. Metal cations other than Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) were tested for their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of both WND-Cu(6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA. Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Cr(III), and Bi(III) were unable to stimulate the ATPase activity above background levels. As previously observed for ZntA, Hg(II) was able to stimulate the ATPase activity of the chimeric proteins in the presence of added thiolates (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); however, it was less effective than Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). In the absence of thiolates in the assay medium, Hg(II) displayed no activity with ZntA, ΔN-ZntA, or either chimeric protein. Of the divalent metals Co(II), Ni(II), Fe(II), and Cu(II), only Cu(II) inhibited the ATPase activity of the chimeras, as was also true for ZntA and ΔN-ZntA. 5 µm Cu(II) completely inhibited the Pb(II)-stimulated ATPase activity of all four proteins. Because Cu(I) and Ag(I) are substrates of ATP7B, we tested the effect of these monovalent metals on the ATPase activity of the chimeras. Cu(I) (generated from Cu(II) in the presence of excess dithiothreitol) and Ag(I) did not increase the activity of the chimeras above background levels. When testing Ag(I), care was taken to ensure that the lack of Ag(I) activity was not due to its insolubility in the assay buffer. Members of the P1-type ATPase subfamily have a high degree of homology with each other that extends to the hydrophilic metal ion-binding amino-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the ATPase domain. Despite this high level of sequence similarity, P1-type ATPases display stringent specificity in the transport of specific metal ions. For example, ZntA is specific for the ions Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), while ATP7A, ATP7B, and CopA from E. coli and homologues transport Cu(I) and possibly Ag(I) (5Vulpe C. Levinson B.

Other P1-type ATPases with different metal ion specificities include SilP, specific for Ag(I), and CoaT, specific for Co(II) (30Gupta A. Matsui K. Lo J.F. Silver S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is also likely that plants have multiple P1-type ATPases that transport different metal ions including Zn(II), Cu(I), Ni(II), and Mn(II) (32Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants of metal ion recognition and specificity in P1-type ATPases are not known. We have previously shown that ΔN-ZntA, a truncated mutant of ZntA that lacks the amino-terminal domain, is an active ATPase with the same metal ion specificity as ZntA, demonstrating that the amino-terminal domain is not essential for function and that the transmembrane domain determines specificity (21Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, ΔN-ZntA was less active than the full-length ZntA, suggesting that the amino-terminal domain may have a function in enhancing the overall catalytic activity, possibly by increasing the rate of metal ion binding to the pump. Studies on the isolated amino-terminal domains of a few P1-type ATPases, notably ATP7A and ATP7B, have shown that these domains can bind a variety of soft metals, including those that are not substrates of the full-length pump (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For example, the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B is able to bind Cu(I), a substrate, as well as Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), which are ions that are not substrates. Zinc binds to this domain with a stoichiometry of 6:1 and upon binding induces conformational changes that are completely different from those previously observed for copper. Spectra from x-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that zinc is ligated primarily to nitrogen atoms, which is different from the behavior of copper-binding ligands of this domain. 3M. DiDonato, J. Zhang, L. Que, and B. Sarkar, manuscript in preparation. We therefore wanted to investigate the impact of interchanging the amino-terminal domains of P1-type ATPases with mutually exclusive metal ion substrates. In particular, we wanted to determine whether such chimeric proteins are active ATPases and if so, whether the amino-terminal domain is able to alter the specificity of the transmembrane domain. In this study, we have characterized the properties of chimeric proteins constructed by splicing the amino-terminal domains of the mammalian transporter ATP7B with the bacterial transporter ZntA lacking its amino-terminal domain. In one chimera the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B, including all six metal-binding motifs, was used; in the second, only the sixth metal-binding domain of ATP7B was used. The sixth metal-binding domain of ATP7B approximately corresponds in size to the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Also, this domain has been shown to be sufficient for thein vivo transport function of ATP7B in yeast (22Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both chimeric proteins were able to mediate resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts in a zntA-disrupted strain but not to copper salts in a copA-disrupted strain. Thus, physiologically the chimeras behave like ZntA and not like ATP7B and CopA. Therefore, the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot override the metal ion specificity of ZntA. Additionally, these in vivoresults suggested that the chimeric proteins are active transporters. This was confirmed by measuring the ATPase activities of the purified chimeras. Both WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(6)-ZntA could be expressed in functional forms in E. coli, although WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA appeared to be degraded to some extent in vivo. The purified hybrid proteins were able to catalyze the soft metal ion-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. The Kmvalues of MgATP for WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA and WND-Cu(6)-ZntA for the Pb(II)-stimulated activity at pH 7.0 were similar to that of ZntA (90–160 µm). ZntA is specific for the divalent soft metal cations Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), with Pb(II) displaying the highest activity (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The chimeric proteins showed the same substrate specificity, with Pb(II) again displaying the highest activity. In particular, no activity was observed with either chimera for Cu(I) or Ag(I). A comparison of the Vmax andKm parameters for the ATPase activities of the purified chimeras with those for the ATPase activities of ΔN-ZntA and ZntA in the absence of thiolates shows that the Pb(II)- and Zn(II)-stimulated activities of the chimeras and of ΔN-ZntA are ∼2–3-fold lower than those of ZntA. Interestingly, the Cd(II)-stimulated activity of WND-Cu(6)-ZntA is consistently higher than that of ZntA, ΔN-ZntA, or WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA. We have previously reported that thiolates increase the ATPase activity of ZntA and ΔN-ZntA, possibly by increasing the rate of metal ion release from the transporter (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effect is most pronounced for the Cd(II)-ATPase activity. Thiolates were able to increase the activities of both chimeras for all three metal ions. The thiolate-stimulated activities of WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA, WND-Cu(6)-ZntA, and ΔN-ZntA were highly similar to each other and 2–3-fold lower than those for ZntA (Table I). The thiolate-stimulated activity is likely to be a more accurate reflection of the in vivo activity of ZntA, given that glutathione is abundant inside the cell and that metal ion chaperones present in the periplasm may assume the role of thiolates. Thus, the data in Table I strongly suggest that the chimeric proteins resemble ΔN-ZntA in terms of their catalytic abilities. Therefore, the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity. It has been suggested that the full-length amino-terminal domain of ATP7B may play a regulatory role; metal ion binding releases an inhibitory interaction of this domain with the hydrophilic ATPase domain (33Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this case, it would be expected that the WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA chimera would be inactive until copper ions were added to the assay medium. In other words, we would observe copper-stimulated Pb(II)-ATPase activity for WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA. Contrary to this expectation, Cu(II) in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol did not increase the Pb(II)-stimulated ATPase activity; it completely inhibited the Pb(II)-ATPase activity. This observation suggests that at least in the case of the WND-Cu(1–6)-ZntA chimera the amino-terminal domain does not play a regulatory role. We constructed two chimeric proteins in which either the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or only the sixth metal-binding domain of ATP7B was attached to ZntA lacking its amino-terminal domain. The chimeras were able to mediate resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts but not to copper salts in vivo. Thus, physiologically, they resemble ZntA. The purified chimeras were active ATPases. The soft metal cation-dependent ATPase activity was specific for Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Hg(II), metal ion substrates of purified ZntA; the highest activity was obtained with Pb(II). There was no activity with Cu(I) or Ag(I), which are substrates of ATP7B. TheVmax values for the chimeras are ∼3-fold lower than the values for ZntA. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B does not override the specificity of the transmembrane segment of ZntA. Also, it cannot replace the amino-terminal domain of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity to ZntA."

Further studies identified a 46-kDa cytosolic protein in human cervical carcinoma cells, which specifically interacted with a CU-rich 18-basecis-element in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of human FR-α mRNA, and that this interaction was critical for the translation of FR in vitro (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because this FR mRNA-binding trans-factor was widely distributed in cells expressing little to no FR-α, we predicted that this RNA-binding protein probably has additional functions that are unrelated to FR translation (10Sun X.L.

In this report, we present evidence that favors identity of the FR mRNA-binding trans-factor with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1). In addition, functional analysis of this protein using antibodies against hnRNP E1 confirms its critical role in the biosynthesis of FR at the translational level. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, RNase A, RNase T1, proteinase K, RNase inhibitor, mRNA isolation kit, and the in vitro transcription kit (containing pSPT-18/19 plasmids) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Unless noted otherwise, all other chemicals of the highest analytical grade were from Sigma. Full-length FR-α cDNA inserted in a pUC8 plasmid (17Elwood P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. P. C. Elwood. Sense and antisense 18-base DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the FR-α mRNAcis-element (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the 19-base cis-element in the 3′-UTR of 15-lipoxygenase RNA (25Funke B. Zuleger B. Benavente R. Schuster T. Goller M. Stevenin J. Horak I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA sequencing kit (Sequenase version 2.0), [α-32P]UTP, [α-32P]CTP (specific activity >3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ATP, Redivue Pro-Mix [35S]methionine, all FPLC HiTrap chromatography columns, fast flow liquid chromatography (FPLC) equipment, and GST fusion protein expression vector PGEX4T-1 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech(Uppsala, Sweden). Mini-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis cell, mini-trans-blot transfer cell, and SDS-PAGE ready gels were from Bio-Rad. Access RT-PCR introductory system and the 5′ end labeling kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmid preparation kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The 1.1-kilobase pair full-length human FR-α cDNA, which was subcloned into the pSPT18 vector downstream of the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter, was designated pSPT18-FR-α (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a plasmid containing the 18-base FR-α cis-element, sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing two 18-base oligonucleotide repeats with PstI andBamHI restriction sites at the ends were synthesized. After annealing the sense and antisense oligonucleotides and restriction enzyme digestion, the DNA fragment was subcloned into the pSPT18 vector between restriction sites PstI and BamHI. The new plasmid was designated as pXL37A. The 18-base sequence (see Fig.4A) was determined by DNA sequencing. To prepare the 18-base cis-element RNA fragment, pXL37A was linearized byPstI. To prepare radiolabeled RNA probe, [α-32P]UTP was included in the transcription reaction, and RNA transcripts were purified using NucTrap push-through Sephadex G-50 columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 5′ end labeling was used to prepare γ-32P-labeled 18-base DNA oligonucleotide probes. Double-stranded 18-base pair DNA was generated by annealing equimolar amounts of single-stranded sense and antisense 18-base oligonucleotides by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to 22 °C. RNA-protein binding reactions and electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assay (18Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) were performed as described (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, reducing or oxidizing reagents were added to the reactions to detect effects on the RNA-protein interaction. Briefly,32P-labeled cis-element (10,000 cpm) was reacted for 30 min at 22 °C with 20 µg of partially purified placental cytosolic extract (that had been dialyzed to remove dithiothreitol (DTT)) with various concentrations of dithiothreitol,dl-homocysteine, l-cysteine,N-ethylmaleimide, or oxidized dithiothreitol. After addition of RNase T1 and heparin and incubation for 20 min, RNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed (native PAGE) followed by autoradiography (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To semiquantitatively estimate the relative recovery of FR mRNA-binding trans-factor during each purification step, aliquots from each step were analyzed using a single preparation of 32P-labeled 18-base cis-element probe of known specific activity. The binding of a fixed amount of excess RNA probe with trans-factor present in each purification step was determined by a gel-shift assay. After drying the gel on Whatman paper, the areas of RNA-protein complexes (verified by autoradiography) were excised and immersed in 10 ml of Biosafe II counting mixture (Research Products International), and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Functionally active trans-factor was monitored during each purification step by Northwestern blots. Briefly, various aliquots oftrans-factor protein were first separated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE mini-gels by electrophoresis before Northwestern blot analysis using 32P-labeled 18-base cis-element RNA probes (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Southwestern blot analysis, following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, the separated proteins were probed with32P-labeled 18-base single-stranded or double-stranded DNA probes. Cytosolic protein extracts (S-100 fraction) from 5 × 107Hela-IU1 cells were prepared as described (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Placental cytosolic extracts were prepared as follows. Full-term placentas were collected in an ice bath shortly after normal vaginal delivery and processed within 4 h of delivery. After removal of the umbilical cord, membranes, blood clots, and necrotic tissue, each placenta was diced into 2 × 2-cm pieces and then washed twice with 1000 ml of 75 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) prior to homogenization in two volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) (Buffer A). After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and filtered through a Minitan ultrafiltration system (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) using a 300,000 Mr cut-off. The sample was then concentrated over a 30,000 Mr cut-off membrane to a final volume of 50 ml/placenta. After the addition of 10% glycerol (v/v), the sample was frozen at −80 °C until further use. The protein concentration of the cytosolic extracts from human placenta (hereafter referred to as “crude sample”) was determined using the BCA method. Nuclear extracts from human placenta were also prepared as described (19Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all purification steps (Table I) were carried out at 4 °C and RNA binding activity was detected by Northwestern blot analysis. The crude sample was thawed to 4 °C and trans-factor was precipitated by 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. The pellet was rinsed with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, following which thetrans-factor was dissolved in 10 ml of Buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.6m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The sample was then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column that was equilibrated with Buffer B using a Pharmacia FPLC system. After loading the sample and washing with 10 column volumes of 50% Buffer B plus 50% Buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol), the trans-factor was eluted with Buffer C and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected.Table IPurification of the FR mRNA-binding trans-factorFractionsVolumeConcentrationProteinUnits1-aOne unit of activity corresponds to 1 pmol of bound RNA/mg of protein in the standard gel-shift assay.Specific activityYieldPurificationmlmg/mlmgpmol/mg%-foldLysate1-bThe lysate was derived from six placentas.762510.479,300NDUltrafiltration65018.712,20053,6624.41001Ammonium sulfate708.66047,63212.614.22.8Phenyl-Sepharose501.1553,15557.45.910.8Heparin-Sepharose7.52151,37591.72.620.8Poly(U)-Sepharose100.080.8638.5792.81.2181.5ND, not determined.1-a One unit of activity corresponds to 1 pmol of bound RNA/mg of protein in the standard gel-shift assay.1-b The lysate was derived from six placentas. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. The eluted fractions containing RNA binding activity (fractions 5–9) were pooled and directly loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (consisting of five 1-ml columns connected in series; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated and washed with Buffer C until the absorbance at an optical density of 280 was at base line. The proteins that remained bound to the column were eluted with 50 ml of Buffer B with KCl in a linear gradient from 0 to 1000 mm, and trans-factor-positive fractions (eluting between 0.3 and 0.4 m KCl) were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of Buffer C. After adding rRNA (35 µg/ml), tRNA (20 µg/ml), and RNase inhibitor (40 units/ml), the mixture was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap poly(U)-Sepharose 4B column, which was equilibrated with Buffer C. After washing the column with Buffer C until base-line optical density of 280 readings were obtained, the sample was eluted with 50 ml of Buffer C with KCl in a linear gradient of 0–1000 mm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, andtrans-factor-positive fractions (eluting between 0.38 and 0.6 m KCl) were dialyzed against Buffer C using Slide-a-lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce). Finally, the sample was filtered (0.2 µm) and stored at −80 °C. Purified proteins (following the poly(U)-Sepharose step) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Pre-stained protein markers (Bio-Rad) were loaded on either sides of the gel. Following electrophoresis, the band corresponding to the trans-factor was excised and the proteins were electro-eluted in 2-ml dialysis bags containing 25 mm Tris-glycine and 0.1% SDS. After filtration through 0.2-µm filters, PMSF and DTT were added to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 and 1 mm, respectively. Renaturation of the eluted protein from SDS-PAGE gel was carried out with minor modification (20Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Briefly, four volumes of acetone (−20 °C) were added and proteins were allowed to precipitate for 30 min in a dry ice-ethanol bath. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was rinsed with 80% acetone. After drying at 22 °C, the pellet was first dissolved in 20-µl of 6 m guanidine HCl in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 22 °C, followed by 50-fold dilution in Northwestern binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× Denhardt's solution in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water). The protein was allowed to renature over the ensuing 12 h at 22 °C, following which the protein was concentrated using Centricon concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and analyzed for trans-factor activity. In pilot experiments (see legend to Fig. 1D), several other renaturing buffers were employed in place of Northwestern binding buffer. After SDS-PAGE separation and trans-blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore) and staining, the band corresponding to the purified FR mRNA-binding trans-factor was excised. After cyanogen bromide digestion and separation of peptide fragments, or furtherO-phthalaldehyde treatment, two peptide fragments of the 43-kDa and one fragment of the 38-kDa species were microsequenced (ProSeq, Boston, MA). The results of microsequencing were analyzed within the GenBank™ data base using the BLAST program. The mRNA from HeLa-IU1 cells was isolated, and the coding region of hnRNP E1 cDNA was cloned by Access RT-PCR and EcoRI and XhoI sites were introduced into each end of the amplified cDNA fragments. After restriction enzyme digestion, the RT-PCR fragment was inserted intoEcoRI and XhoI linearized GST fusion protein expression vector PGEX4T-1. The recombinant plasmid was transformed to BL21 Escherichia coli, and a positive clone was verified by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing (Merlin Core Service, Carlsbad, CA), which confirmed that the insert was hnRNP E1. Following induction by 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the GST-hnRNP E1 fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B affinity chromatography. Recombinant hnRNP E1 protein was released by cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin (0.5 units/ml), and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Northwestern blotting using32P-labeled 18-base mRNA, and Western blotting using anti-peptide hnRNP E1 antibodies. An oligopeptide containing a 19-amino acid stretch of sequences (SLAQYLINARLSSEKGMGC) of hnRNP E1 was synthesized, acetylated at its N-terminal end, and after conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, rabbit antiserum was generated against this antigen by Animal Pharm Services, Inc. (Healdsburg, CA). Rabbit anti-hnRNP E1 (oligopeptide) antibodies were isolated by affinity chromatography using oligopeptide-Sepharose, and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 1.0% sodium azide at −20 °C. Various proteins were analyzed by Western blots (21Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using 1:10,000 diluted rabbit anti-hnRNP E1 (oligopeptide) antibodies that were detected with 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection and autoradiography. Female mice (C57 B6, 2 months old) were from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Placentas were obtained from CD-1 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) on gestation day 17 and transported from Jefferson, AR, to Indianapolis, IN on dry ice. Murine tissues (bone marrow, liver, heart, kidney, brain, lung) were dissected and processed immediately after sacrifice. After S-100 fractions were prepared (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), gel-shift assays and Northwestern blots were carried out using human 18-base cis-element. In vitro transcription and translation were carried out using the protocol (Single Tube Protein System 3, SP6) from Novagen (Madison, WI). Briefly, after addition (0.5 µg/reaction) of DNA template (BglI linearized plasmid pSPT18 FR) to the transcription mix, the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, following which aliquots of the transcription reaction were applied to the translation reaction. In vitrotranslation was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in a 50-µl reaction mixture containing 30 µCi of [35S]methionine. Various amounts of purified human placental FR mRNA-binding trans-factor (or purified recombinant hnRNP E1) and/or purified rabbit anti-hnRNP E1 (oligopeptide) antibodies (or nonimmune serum) were included in the reticulocyte lysate 15 min before in vitro translation was begun. The translation reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, followed by addition of 1 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation at 22 °C for 5 min, the reaction mixture was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The 19-base sequence in the 3′-UTR of 15-lipoxygenase mRNA (25Funke B. Zuleger B. Benavente R. Schuster T. Goller M. Stevenin J. Horak I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) corresponding to its cDNA (2116CCCCACCCTCTTCCCCAAG2135) was synthesized as follows. The sequence pAATTCG was introduced to the 5′ end of the above sense oligodeoxynucleotide, and pAGCTT introduced to the 5′ end of the antisense sequence. The resulting double-stranded DNA was subcloned into the vector pSPT18 linearized with EcoRI andHindIII to construct a plasmid pYST03. This plasmid was introduced into DH5α bacteria. To prepare the sense 19-base RNA fragments, pYST03 was linearized with HindIII, and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. γ-32P-Labeled, single-stranded 19-base 15-lipoxygensase DNA oligonucleotides were generated with the DNA 5′ end labeling kit (Roche). These radiolabeled 19-base 15-lipoxygenase sense RNA and DNA were reacted with placentaltrans-factor and hnRNP E1 and analyzed by gel-shift assays, Northwestern, and Southwestern blots. Using gel-shift assays to monitor the interaction of cytosolic extracts from human placenta with 18-base α-32P-labeledcis-element from the 5′-UTR of human FR-α mRNA, we identified an RNA-protein interaction (Fig.1A). With increasing cytosolic extracts, there were progressively stronger signals confirming a dose-dependent relationship (Fig. 1A,lanes 1–5). The abrogation of signals in the presence of proteinase K (Fig. 1A, lane 6) suggested that proteins were among the components that interacted with the probe. Northwestern blot analysis using crude cytosolic extracts from human placenta revealed a 43-kDa mRNA-binding trans-factor protein (results not shown). When equivalent quantities of S-100 cytosolic and nuclear fractions were analyzed on Northwestern blots, the 43-kDa trans-factor protein was predominantly found in cytosolic rather than nuclear fraction (Fig. 1B). Progressive purification of the trans-factor was assessed by Northwestern blots and SDS-PAGE. Various properties of thetrans-factor were exploited in its purification from human placental cytosolic extracts (Table I; Fig. 1C). Although the predicted molecular mass of thetrans-factor was 43 kDa, trans-factor proteins were retained by a 100-kDa cut-off membrane; this suggested its association in a complex with other proteins. Accordingly, following ultrafiltration using a 300-kDa cut-off membrane, the sample was concentrated over a 30-kDa cut-off membrane. Fig. 1C shows the progressive purification of thetrans-factor using the purification scheme summarized in Table I. Following ammonium sulfate precipitation, thetrans-factor, which bound to a hydrophobic interaction column (phenyl-Sepharose), was further purified based on its resistance to elution by up to 80% of Buffer C. Therefore, after eluting other proteins, the trans-factor was eluted by Buffer C, which was supplemented with 0.5% CHAPS. (CHAPS was selected because several other ionic, nonionic, or zwitterionic detergents (Nonidet P-40, SDS, Triton X-100) affected the RNA-protein interaction). Thetrans-factor interacted with the heparin column at pH 7.0, following which it was eluted by a linear gradient of KCl. The 18-base cis-element is a C/U-rich sequence (containing 11 cytosine and 6 uridine residues). Although thetrans-factor interaction with the cis-element could be competed by poly(C) (but not by poly(U)) (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the very strong interaction of the trans-factor with poly(C)-Sepharose precluded elution from this column with conventional buffers. Surprisingly, in the presence of CHAPS, we found that thetrans-factor could bind poly(U)-Sepharose and was eluted by a linear gradient of KCl. This was a key step in the purification scheme (Fig. 1C, lane 5). To eliminate minor protein staining bands (that were noted only on silver-stained SDS-PAGE) that co-eluted with the trans-factor following the poly(U)-Sepharose step, that portion of the gel containing the 43-kDatrans-factor was electro-eluted. An aliquot of this electro-eluted protein exhibited a single 43-kDa protein on repeat SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. To prove that this protein was the trans-factor, another aliquot was denatured with guanidine and renatured and then assessed for the capacity to interact with the cis-element with gel-shift assays. As shown in Fig.1D, although there were no RNA-protein complexes when electro-eluted (denatured) 43-kDa trans-factor protein was assessed for RNA interaction, such RNA-protein complexes were best observed after the electro-eluted and denatured trans-factor was renatured with Northwestern binding buffer containing 1× Denhardt's solution (lane 9). Thus, the purified protein doublet that bound the 18-base RNA cis-element on Northwestern blots was the same protein that gave rise to the RNA-protein complexes on gel-shift assays. Accordingly, the electro-eluted, apparently homogeneous trans-factor was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. After confirmation of apparent homogeneity based on SDS-PAGE, the trans-factor was characterized as follows. Earlier, we identified that the cervical carcinoma (HeLa-IU1) celltrans-factor had a Mr of 46,000; this was based on the use of prestained standards used in Northwestern blots (10Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, using unstained Mr standards, the same 46-"

Introduction of a histidine (T349H) at the extracellular end of transmembrane segment (TM) 7 together with a histidine (E370H) or a cysteine (Q374C) at the extracellular end of TM 8 resulted in potent inhibition of [3H]GABA uptake by Zn2+ (IC50 = 35 and 44 µm, respectively). Upon expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes it was similarly observed that Zn2+ was a potent inhibitor of the GABA-induced current (IC50 = 21 µm for T349H/E370H and 51 µm for T349H/Q374C), albeit maximum inhibition was only ∼40% in T349H/E370H versus ∼90% in T349H/Q374C. In the wild type, Zn2+ did not affect the Na+-dependent transient currents elicited by voltage jumps and thought to reflect capacitive charge movements associated with Na+ binding. However, in both mutants Zn2+ caused a reduction of the inward transient currents upon jumping to hyperpolarized potentials as reflected in rightward-shifted Q/V relationships. This suggests that Zn2+ is inhibiting transporter function by stabilizing the outward-facing Na+-bound state. Translocation of lithium by the transporter does not require GABA binding and analysis of this uncoupled Li+ conductance revealed a potent inhibition by Zn2+ in T349H/E370H, whereas surprisingly the T349H/Q374C leak was unaffected. This differential effect supports that the leak conductance represents a unique operational mode of the transporter involving conformational changes different from those of the substrate translocation process.

Following release into the synaptic cleft the effect of GABA is rapidly terminated by reuptake into the presynaptic nerve terminal via specific transporter proteins present in the plasma membrane (1Miller J.W. Kleven D.T. Domin B.A. Fremau Jr., R.T. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 101-150Crossref Google Scholar). These transporters play a critical role in regulating GABA-mediated neurotransmission by controlling the availability of GABA in the extracellular space. Currently four distinct GABA transporters have been identified (GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1), GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1) (1Miller J.W. Kleven D.T. Domin B.A. Fremau Jr., R.T. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 101-150Crossref Google Scholar). They belong to the large family of Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters, which also include the transporters for several other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glycine (1Miller J.W.

The Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters are all believed to share a common topology with 12 predicted transmembrane segments and cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini (1Miller J.W.

The transport of GABA across the plasma membrane is driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Na+ is co-transported with GABA, and the estimated stoichiometry of the translocation process in the GAT-1 is two sodium ions and one chloride ion per GABA molecule (5Keynan S. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Kavanaugh M.P. Arriza J.L. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol.

However, it is of interest to note that the co-transport of the Cl− ion recently has been disputed by Loo et al. (8Loo D.D. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) who proposed that the Cl−dependence does not involve a co-transport of Cl− but rather a Cl−/Cl− exchange mechanism during the transport cycle (8Loo D.D.

Since the uptake of GABA is electrogenic (5Keynan S. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,6Kavanaugh M.P. Arriza J.L. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) the transporters have been subjected to electrophysiological measurements. The electrophysiological measurements have not only been able to define a voltage-dependent current stoichiometrically coupled to the translocation of GABA but also indicated additional operational modes of the transporter (9Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). First, in the absence of GABA and in the presence of Li+, an inwardly directed leak current has been shown to arise at hyperpolarized potentials (10Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, Na+-dependent transient currents were found to arise in the absence of GABA during voltage jumps of the membrane potential (9Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These transient currents are believed to represent charge movements resulting from conformational changes associated with the binding and unbinding of Na+ ions as the conformational equilibrium is shifted following abrupt changes in the potential across the membrane (9Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Finally, the presence of a relatively large uncoupled transport-associated current has been proposed based on apparent disparities between the net fluxes of substrate and charge translocation (13Cammack J.N. Schwartz E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This putative uncoupled channel activity arising in the presence of substrate suggests similarity between neurotransmitter transporters and ligand-gated ion channels. Nonetheless, a tight coupling between charge movements and [3H]GABA transport has recently been demonstrated (8Loo D.D. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This observation together with the study by Lu and Hilgemann (15Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) may argue against the existence of such a channel mode at least in GAT-1. Many studies have been carried out in the attempt to identify functionally important regions in the GABA transporters as well as in other Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters (11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

These studies have resulted in the identification of several residues important for the interaction of substrate and blockers with the transporters and/or residues important for the translocation process (11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, in the absence of tertiary structure information, it has not been possible to define, for example, the substrate and ion permeation pathways. Thus the molecular mechanism underlying translocation of the substrate across the membrane remains still essentially unknown. Recently we have been able to define the first distance constraints in the tertiary structure of a Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter based on the discovery of an endogenous high affinity Zn2+binding site in the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) (20Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We were able to identify three Zn2+ coordinating residues in this binding site: His193 in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane segments 3 and 4, His375 at the external end of TM 7, and Glu396 at the external end of TM 8 (20Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The three residues are distanced in the primary structure, but their common participation in binding of the small Zn2+ion defined their spatial proximity in the tertiary structure of the transporter. Based on the information provided from the endogenous Zn2+ binding site, a series of artificial Zn2+binding sites in the hDAT were subsequently engineered by taking advantage of the strict geometrical requirements for binding of the Zn2+ ion (22Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The information acquired enabled us to build a structural model of the “TM 7/8 microdomain” in the hDAT that improved the analysis and prediction of structural features in a functionally important region of this transporter (22Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this present study we have genetically transferred Zn2+binding sites from the hDAT to GAT-1 to probe the structural and functional similarity between two distinct Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters and thereby use engineered Zn2+ binding sites as evolutionary fingerprints of structural and functional features conserved through evolution in this class of transporters. The engineering of two inhibitory Zn2+ switches in GAT-1 between TM 7 and 8 provided direct support for a similar structural organization of the TM 7/8 domain in GAT-1 as in DAT and indicated a common key role of this domain in the substrate translocation mechanism. Moreover, two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on GAT-1 and the mutated transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes provided both new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ at the engineered Zn2+ binding sites as well as new information about the relationships between GABA uptake and the different transporter-mediated currents. The cDNA for rGAT-1 in pBluescript SK (23Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated by polymerase chain reaction-derived mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into either the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or a vector optimized for oocyte expression (pNB1) containing rGAT-1 as HindIII and XbaI fragments. The vector pNB1 was generated by enlarging the multiple cloning site of pGH19, which is a modified version of pGEMHE (24Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 automated sequencer. The rGAT-1 constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (25Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells were grown as described in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc. catalog no. 0413 1855) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin (25Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For expression in HeLa cells, the cells were plated on 24-well plates and infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus (27Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar) and transfected with cDNA (pBluescript SK with the wild type or mutant transporter inserted downstream of the T7 promoter) using the transfection reagentN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts (DOTAP) as described previously (28Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The rGAT-1 constructs in the oocyte vector pNB1 were linearized downstream of the poly(A) segment with NotI and in vitro transcribed with the T7 RNA polymerase using the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). The mRNAs were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer to a concentration of ∼1 µg/µl. The integrity of the transcripts was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the mRNA was stored at −80 °C until injection. Female X. laevis frogs were anesthetized for 15–20 min in 2 g/liter Tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma catalog no. A-5040) before an ovarian lobe was removed from the abdominal cavity through a small (1-cm) incision. Oocytes were defolliculated enzymatically by incubation in 1% collagenase (Sigma catalog no. C-0130) and 0.1% trypsin inhibitor (Sigma catalog no. T-2011) in Kulori medium (90 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h followed by five washes in Kulori medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma catalog no. A-6003) and incubation for 1 h in a hypertonic phosphate buffer (100 mmK2HPO4, pH 6.5). Subsequently stage V and VI oocytes were selected, washed five times in Kulori medium, and kept overnight at 19 °C in Kulori medium before injection with 50 nl of mRNA (∼50 ng) using a Nanoject microinjector (Drummond). Injected and noninjected oocytes were kept in Kulori medium at 19 °C for 3–7 days before electrophysiological measurements. The oocytes were incubated in Kulori medium at 19 °C for 3–7 days before experiments were performed. Uptake assays were carried out using 4-amino-n-[2,3-3H]butyric acid ([3H]GABA) (88 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected COS-7 cells were plated in 12-well dishes (1–3 × 105 cells/well) to achieve an uptake level of 5–10% of total added [3H]GABA. The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection. Prior to the experiment, the cells were washed once with 500 µl of uptake buffer (25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4). Uptake buffer and Zn2+ or unlabeled GABA were added to the cells, and uptake was initiated by the addition of 5 nm[3H]GABA in a final volume of 500 µl. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 500 µl of uptake buffer, lysed in 500 µl of 1% SDS, and left for 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland), and 500 µl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (Wallac) were added followed by counting of the plates in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm nonlabeled GABA (RBI, Natick, MA). All determinations were performed in triplicate. The uptake experiments were performed in 24-well plates with 30 µm GABA and 15 nm [3H]GABA added to a total of 400 µl of oocyte uptake buffer (90 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4). Oocytes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times in 1 ml of oocyte uptake buffer with choline chloride (90 mm ChCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4), and dissolved in 200 µl of 10% SDS. Before counting, 2.0 ml of scintillation fluid was added to the samples. The [3H]GABA uptake experiments on the HeLa cells were carried out 18–20 h post-transfection as described previously (16Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For oxidative cross-linking with Cu2+-phenanthroline, a fresh stock solution of 150 mm Cu2+-phenanthroline was made up for each experiment as follows. 600 µl of a 250 mmCuSO4 solution were mixed with 400 µl of a 1.25m solution of 1,10-phenanthroline in 50% ethanol. This stock solution was further diluted into the NaCl-containing transport solution to the desired concentration. Just prior to the transport assay the cells from triplicate or quadruplicate wells were washed twice with 1 ml of choline medium (transport solution with ChCl replacing the NaCl) and incubated with 1 ml of transport solution with or without Cu2+-phenanthroline at the indicated final concentrations for 5 min. Subsequently the cells were washed once in choline medium and assayed for sodium-dependent [3H]GABA uptake, subtracting values obtained with cells transfected with the control plasmid alone. The oocytes were impaled by two microelectrodes, one providing the clamp current and the other measuring the membrane potential. The experimental chamber had a volume of 30 µl, and solution changes were 90% complete in 5 s given a flow rate of 12 µl s−1. The solutions were fed into the chamber via a mechanical valve with a dead space of 5 µl. The recording solution contained 90 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. In substitution experiments, sodium ions were replaced by equimolar lithium or choline ions. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature with a Dagan clampator interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC using a DigiData 1200 A/D converter and pCLAMP 6.0 (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries to a resistance of 0.5–2 megaohms and were filled with 1 m KCl. SKF89976A hydrochloride was obtained from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, United Kingdom). The [3H]GABA uptake data and the GABA-induced currents were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). For analysis of the transporter-mediated transient current, the capacitative charge movements (Q) were calculated by integration of the transporter transient currents at each membrane potential with the background (ChCl substitution ± Zn2+) subtracted (9Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The time integral of the transient currents was calculated in SigmaPlot (version 5.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) after deduction of the steady-state contribution. The Q was then plotted against the membrane potential (Vm), and the resultingQ/Vm relationship was fitted to the Boltzmann equation (Q − Qhyp =Qmax/(1 + exp(zδ(Vm −V0.5)F/RT)).Qmax corresponds to the maximum charge movement defined as Qdep − Qhyp, where Qdep and Qhyp areQ at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits, respectively;z is the charge of the particle moving; δ is the fraction of the membrane field through which the charge moves, F is the Faraday constant; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; and V0.5 is the voltage at which the charge movements are half-completed. TheQ/V relationships were normalized by setting the charge movements observed upon the voltage jump to +50 mV to one and the charge movements observed upon the voltage jump to −150 mV to zero. All means are given as the means ± S.E. or mean ± S.E. interval throughout the manuscript. S.E. intervals were calculated from the S.E. of the means of pKm and pIC50 determined by nonlinear regression analysis. Previously we have demonstrated that the hDAT transiently expressed in COS-7 cells is inhibited by Zn2+ in low micromolar concentrations with an IC50 value of around 1 µm for inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake (20Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This inhibition is due to the presence of an endogenous Zn2+ binding site comprised of three Zn2+coordinating residues: His193, His375, and Glu396 (20Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to hDAT, the rGAT-1 is insensitive to Zn2+ in low micromolar concentrations. At higher concentrations (millimolar), [3H]GABA uptake was inhibited, but this inhibition can most likely be attributed to nonspecific toxic effects of Zn2+ (Fig. 2) (29Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To probe the structural similarity between the hDAT and rGAT-1 we attempted first to transfer the endogenous site of the hDAT to the rGAT-1 by introducing histidines in positions 177 (Y177H) and 349 (T349H) corresponding to His193 and His375 in hDAT, respectively (Fig. 1). The third coordinating residue Glu396 in the endogenous hDAT binding site is conserved in rGAT-1 (Glu370). Unfortunately mutation of Tyr177 caused the mutant transporter to be nonfunctional (data not shown) making us unable to establish a Zn2+ binding site in rGAT-1 equivalent to the endogenous hDAT site. Instead we investigated the possibility of transferring artificial bidentate Zn2+ sites engineered between TM 7 and 8 from hDAT to GAT-1. Recently we have shown that introduction of a histidine in position 396 in hDAT generates an inhibitory Zn2+ binding site involving this histidine and His375 (21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, introduction of histidines in the corresponding positions in GAT-1 (T349H/E370H) resulted in potent inhibition of [3H]GABA uptake by Zn2+(IC50 = 35 (range 32–39) µm, TableI). Mutation of Glu370 to histidine (E370H) alone did not increase the apparent Zn2+affinity, and mutation of Thr349 to histidine (T349H) alone caused only a 3–4-fold increase in apparent Zn2+ affinity (Fig. 1 and Table I). This is consistent with Zn2+ being coordinated in a bidentate fashion between both residues. Of interest, the slight 3–4-fold increase in apparent Zn2+ affinity in T349H may reflect low affinity coordination of Zn2+ between the histidine in position 349 and Glu370.Figure 1Two-dimensional representation of therGAT-1. The residues in the top of TM 7 and 8 that have been mutated to either histidine (T349H and E370H) or cysteine (Q374C) areenlarged and marked in black.

https://openalex.org/W2150574447,"BALB/c is a susceptible strain for the development of gamma-ray induced mouse thymic lymphoma whereas MSM shows resistance. Association analysis of 220 backcross mice between the two strains using 67 markers was carried out to identify loci involved in the control of susceptibility. The genotype of mice with lymphoma showed excess heterozygosity relative to MSM homozygosity at D2Mit15 and D4Mit12 and was skewed toward MSM-derived alleles at D5Mit5. The P values in Mantel-Cox test were 0.0048 (D2Mit15), 0.0034 (D4Mit12) and 0.0048 (D5Mit5), suggesting association at the three loci in the susceptibility. Cooperative effect on lymphomagenesis was also observed among the three loci. To obtain independent evidence for linkage at D4Mit12, we made partially congenic mice in which a D4Mit12 region in BALB/c was replaced by MSM-derived homolog. Examination for the lymphoma susceptibility in 78 progeny of the congenic mice confirmed the effect of the locus near D4Mit12 (P=0.0037). The result, together with the linkage analysis, shows that the locus near D4Mit12 is regarded as a confirmed linkage but the other two loci as marginally suggestive."
https://openalex.org/W2334377293,"There is evidence that protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) is a tumor suppressor, although its physiological role has not been elucidated so far. Since important anti-proliferative signals are mediated by cell-cell contacts we studied whether PKCdelta is involved in contact-dependent inhibition of growth in human (FH109) and murine (NIH3T3) fibroblasts. Cell-cell contacts were imitated by the addition of glutardialdehyde-fixed cells to sparsely seeded fibroblasts. Downregulation of the PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon, and mu after prolonged treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 0.1 microM) resulted in a significant release from contact-inhibition in FH109 cells. Bryostatin 1 selectively prevented TPA-induced PKCdelta-downregulation and reversed TPA-induced release from contact-inhibition arguing for a role of PKCdelta in contact-inhibition. In accordance, the PKCdelta specific inhibitor Rottlerin (1 microM) totally abolished contact-inhibition. Interestingly, immunofluorescence revealed a rapid translocation of PKCdelta to the nucleus when cultures reached confluence with a peak in early-mid G1 phase. Nuclear translocation of PKCdelta in response to cell-cell contacts could also be demonstrated after subcellular fractionation by Western blotting and by measuring PKCdelta-activity after immunoprecipitation. Transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells with a dominant negative mutant of PKCdelta induced a transformed phenotype. We conclude that PKCdelta is involved in contact-dependent inhibition of growth."
https://openalex.org/W2051140798,Tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms involved in the intracellular propagation of external signals. Strategies aimed at interfering with this process might allow the control of several cellular phenotypes. SH2 domains mediate protein-protein interactions by recognizing phosphotyrosine (pY) residues in the context of specific phosphopeptides. We created an SH2-scaffolded repertoire library by randomly mutagenizing five critical amino acid positions in the specificity-determining region of the PLCgamma C-terminal SH2 domain. Synthetic SH2 domains were selected from the library using biotinylated phosphopeptides derived from a natural PLCgamma-SH2 ligand as well as unrelated SH2 ligands. The isolated SH2s displayed high binding affinity constants for the selecting peptides and were capable of interacting with the corresponding proteins.

In several kindreds with recessive, ankyrin-deficient HS, mutations have been identified in the ankyrin promoter that have been proposed to decrease ankyrin synthesis. We analyzed the effects of two mutations, −108T to C and −108T to C in cis with −153G to A, on ankyrin expression. No difference between wild type and mutant promoters was demonstrated in transfection or gel shift assays in vitro. Transgenic mice with a wild type ankyrin promoter linked to a humanAγ-globin gene expressed γ-globin in 100% of erythrocytes in a copy number-dependent, position-independent manner. Transgenic mice with the mutant −108 promoter demonstrated variegated γ-globin expression, but showed copy number-dependent and position-independent expression similar to wild type. Severe effects in ankyrin expression were seen in mice with the linked −108/−153 mutations. Three transgenic lines had undetectable levels of Aγ-globin mRNA, indicating position-dependent expression, and four lines expressed significantly lower levels of Aγ-globin mRNA than wild type. Two of four expressing lines showed variegated γ-globin expression, and there was no correlation between transgene copy number and RNA level, indicating copy number-independent expression. These data are the first demonstration of functional defects caused by HS-related, ankyrin gene promoter mutations. Ankyrin defects are the most common cause of hereditary spherocytosis (HS).

These data are the first demonstration of functional defects caused by HS-related, ankyrin gene promoter mutations. hereditary spherocytosis polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) ankyrin Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)1 is a common hemolytic anemia characterized by the presence of spherically shaped erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear. The principal cellular defect in HS is loss of erythrocyte membrane surface area relative to intracellular volume, accounting for the spherical shape as well as decreased deformability of the erythrocyte (1Gallagher P.G. Jarolim P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1999: 576-610Google Scholar). The primary biochemical defects in HS reside in the proteins of the erythrocyte membrane, particularly those proteins involved in the interactions between the membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer: ankyrin, α and β spectrin, band 3, and protein 4.2 (2Iolascon A. Miraglia del Giudice E. Perrotta S. Alloisio N. Morle L. Delaunay J. Haematologica. 1998; 83: 240-257PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In two thirds to three quarters of cases, HS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (1Gallagher P.G. Jarolim P.

In the remaining patients, HS is inherited in a recessive fashion or is the result of a de novo mutation. Ankyrin-1 (ANK1, Mendelian Inheritance in Man 182900) deficiency is one of the most common abnormalities found in the erythrocyte membranes of HS patients (5Savvides P. Shalev O. John K.M. Lux S.E.

First identified in preparations of erythrocyte membranes, ankyrin provides the primary linkage between the spectrin-actin-based erythrocyte membrane skeleton and the plasma membrane by attaching tetramers of spectrin to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (7Bennett V.

Studies have revealed that abnormalities of the ankyrin gene, primarily frameshift or nonsense mutations, are the most common cause of typical, dominant HS (3Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Br. J.

Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One molecular mechanism that could lead to ankyrin deficiency is a mutation in the ankyrin erythroid promoter leading to decreased ankyrin synthesis. Several reports have identified sequence variations in the ankyrin gene promoter in individuals with recessively inherited, ankyrin-deficient HS (4Miraglia del Giudice E. Nobili B. Francese M. D'Urso L. Iolascon A. Eber S. Perrotta S. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J.

Alberto F.L. Costa F.F. Saad S.T. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whether these are disease causing mutations or are merely polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with as yet unidentified mutations is unknown, as it is difficult to assess the effect of promoter mutations on ankyrin gene expression in affected HS patients. To address this question, we have analyzed the effect of two HS-associated, ankyrin gene promoter mutations in vitro and in vivo. The first mutation, a T to C substitution at position −108, was discovered in the heterozygous state in four of seven German families with ankyrin-deficient, recessive HS (9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A. Gallagher P.G. Schroter W. Forget B.G. Lux S.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In two of the four kindreds, mutations in the coding region of the ankyrin gene were discovered in trans, and the mutation was silent in the heterozygous state. In this mostly German HS population, the allele frequency was estimated to be 29% in HS patients and 2.0% in normal individuals. This mutation has also been associated with ankyrin-deficient, nondominantly inherited HS in Italy (4Miraglia del Giudice E. Nobili B. Francese M. D'Urso L. Iolascon A. Eber S. Perrotta S. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The second mutation, a G to A substitution at position −153, was discovered in the heterozygous state in a Brazilian kindred with ankyrin-deficient, recessive HS (11Leite R.C. Basseres D.S. Ferreira J.S. Alberto F.L. Costa F.F. Saad S.T. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The −153 substitution was always found in cis to the previously reported −108T to C ankyrin promoter mutation. These linked substitutions were silent in the heterozygous state. No individuals with the −153 mutation alone were detected. In a control Brazilian population, the allelic frequency of the −108/−153 allele was 2.4% and the −108 allele was 1.4%. Previously, we have shown the wild type ankyrin promoter directed expression of a linked Aγ-globin reporter gene in an erythroid-specific, position-independent, copy number-dependent fashion in transgenic mice (13Sabatino D.E.

Levels ofAγ-globin mRNA correlated directly with levels of functional γ-globin protein in erythrocytes of these transgenic mice (14Persons D.A. Allay E.R. Sabatino D.E. Kelly P. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Blood. 2001; 97: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used this ankyrin promoter/human Aγ-globin reporter transgenic mouse model as a system to study the effect of the spherocytosis-associated promoter mutations in vivo.Significant abnormalities in reporter gene mRNA and protein expression were seen, the first demonstration of functional defects caused by HS-related ankyrin gene promoter mutations. These promoter mutations may represent a common pathogenetic mechanism of recessive HS in ankyrin-deficient patients. The mutations described in this report have been reported previously and are schematically shown in Fig.1 (4Miraglia del Giudice E. Nobili B. Francese M. D'Urso L. Iolascon A. Eber S. Perrotta S. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A. Gallagher P.G.

Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The tissue culture cell lines K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis with erythroid characteristics, ATCC CCl243) and HEL (human erythroleukemia, ATCC TIB 180) were used to study expression of the mutant ankyrin promoters. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. We have shown previously that a 286-bp minimal ankyrin gene promoter fragment directs high level expression of a luciferase reporter gene in erythroid cells (plasmid p296 in Ref. 12Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant ankyrin promoter fragments corresponding to this 286-bp promoter fragment were generated by PCR amplification and subcloning into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2B (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Test plasmids were sequenced to exclude cloning or PCR-generated artifacts. All plasmids tested were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) or cesium chloride plasmid purification, and at least two preparations of each plasmid were tested in triplicate. 107 K562 or HEL cells were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse of 300 V at 960 microfarads with 20 μg of test plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ, a mammalian reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and the activity of both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity determined in cell extracts. All assays were performed in triplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described by Andrews and Faller (15Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used in gel mobility shift assays are shown in Table I. Gel mobility shift binding reactions were carried out as described (16Mason P. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach.

Resulting complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 21 °C at 200 watts for 2 h. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays−108T to C Wild typeSense5′-CCCTCGGGGGCCTGGCCCGCACGT-3′Antisense5′-ACGTGCGGGCCAGGCCCCCGAGGG-3′ MutantSense5′-CCCTCGGGGGCCCGGCCCGCACGT-3′Antisense5′-ACGTGCGGGCCGGGCCCCCGAGGG-3′ AP-2 controlSense5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′Antisense5′-ACGGGCCGCGGGCGGTCAGTTCGATC-3′−153G to A Wild typeSense5′-GGAGCGCCCGGCCCGACAGCA-3′Antisense5′-TGCTGTCGGGCCGGGCGCTCC-3′ MutantSense5′-GGAGCGCCCGACCCGACAGCA-3′Antisense5′-TGCTGTCGGGTCGGGCGCTCC-3′ Open table in a new tab To generate mutant Ank/Aγ-globin transgenes, 276-bp SmaI/BglII fragments containing mutant ankyrin promoters (−291 to −20 plus polylinker sequence) were excised from the pGL2B luciferase reporter vector (see above). A 1938-bp BglII/HindIII Aγ-globin fragment was excised from plasmid 72βsp+Aγ (described in Sabatino et al. in Ref 18Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triple ligations consisting of the ankyrin promoter, the Aγ-globin gene, and SmaI/HindIII-digested pSP72 were used to generate the mutant Ank/Aγ-globin plasmids. The ankyrin/Aγ-globin gene fragments (2244 bp) were excised from the plasmids with EcoRV and HindIII for microinjection (Fig. 2 A). All plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutant ankyrin promoter was correctly fused to the Aγ-globin gene. Transgenic mice were generated as described by Hogan et al. (19Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) and Sabatino et al. (18Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were collected from superovulated FVB/N female mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) ∼9 h after mating to CBy6F1 male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Fragments for microinjection were separated on an agarose gel, electroeluted, and purified with an Elutip-d minicolumn (Schleicher & Schuell). The fragments were diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μl in 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and ∼ 2 pl was injected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs. The injected eggs were transferred to psuedopregnant CByB6/F1 foster mothers. Founder animals were identified by Southern analysis of DNA extracted from tail biopsies by probing with an Ank/Aγ-globin probe. Founder animals were crossed to FVB/N mice for propagation. Copy number was determined by comparing the γ-globin signals from Southern blot analysis of transgenic mouse and K562 DNA using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Statistical analysis of copy number and expression data was analyzed by linear regression using GraphPad Prism® version 2.0 software. Total cellular RNA was extracted from adult reticulocytes, obtained by collecting 200 μl of blood from phlebotomized animals, using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Life Technologies, Inc.). Linear DNA templates for RNase protection assays were prepared by restriction enzyme digestion of cesium chloride purified plasmid preparations. Riboprobe one, which contains sequences for both exon 2 of the humanAγ-globin gene and exon 2 of the murine α-globin gene, was linearized with BglII (Fig. 2 B). This riboprobe ensures that both the human Aγ-globin and murine α-globin sequences are labeled to equal specific activity, allowing direct comparison of human Aγ-globin and murine α-globin mRNA levels. Riboprobe two, which includes part ofAγ-globin exon 2, all of exon 1, and the ankyrin transcription initiation site, was linearized with EcoRI (Fig. 2 C) (18Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This riboprobe allows detection of the transcription initiation site directed by the mutant ankyrin promoters. Templates were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a Geneclean® II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). Linear DNA template for the mouse β-actin gene was obtained from the MAXIscript™ in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Inc.). 32P-Labeled RNA probes were transcribed using the MAXIscript™ in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Inc.). Hybridization of the probe and RNA (0.1–0.25 μg) was carried out overnight according to standard procedures (RPA II, Ambion, Inc.). RNase digestion was performed using an RNase A/RNase T1 mixture in RNase digestion buffer and the protected fragments separated on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. To quantitate the levels of mRNA, the gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative amounts of the bands humanAγ-globin exon 2 (223 bp) and mouse α-globin exon 2 (186 bp) were estimated by the following formula: (Aγ-globin RNA/transgene copy number) × (1/mouse α-globin RNA). Detection and measurement of γ-globin protein in red blood cells was performed as described by Thorpe et al. (20Thorpe S.J. Thein S.L. Sampietro M. Craig J.E. Mahon B. Huehns E.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 87: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Blood cells collected by phlebotomy from the retro-orbital sinus of transgenic mice were washed in cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in ice-cold (4 °C) 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The cells were washed with 1:1 acetone/water (−20 °C), acetone (−20 °C), and 1:1 acetone/water (−20 °C) before resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% fetal bovine serum (4 °C). Hemoglobin tetramers containing human γ-globin were identified with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated human hemoglobin F antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis was performed on a FACStar instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). To prevent leaching of hemoglobin, cells were maintained at 4 °C or lower throughout the procedure. Computer-assisted analyses of mutant ankyrin promoter nucleotide sequences were performed utilizing the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) (21Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar) and the BLAST algorithm (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro studies showed that expression of a minimal human ankyrin-1 promoter in erythroid cells was mediated by GATA-1-, CACCC-, and CGCCC-binding proteins (12Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the ankyrin promoter sequence reveals that neither the −108 nor −153 mutations are located in these binding sites, nor are they located in regions protected during in vitro DNase I footprinting experiments using erythroid nuclear extracts (12Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The −108 mutation disrupts a potential AP-2 binding site; it does not create a novel site for any known DNA-binding proteins. The −153 mutation is not contained in a known DNA binding protein site, nor does it create a site for any known DNA-binding proteins. Plasmids containing wild type and mutant −108 and −108/−153 ankyrin promoter fragments linked to a firefly luciferase reporter gene transiently transfected into K562 and HEL cells and luciferase expression assayed. There was no significant difference in luciferase activity directed by wild type or mutant plasmids in either K562 or HEL cells (Fig.3). Oligonucleotides containing the wild type and mutant ankyrin promoter sequences were synthesized, and protein binding activity was analyzed in mobility shift assays using K562 cell nuclear extracts. Wild type and mutant −108 oligonucleotides formed complexes that migrated at the same mobility as a control AP-2 oligonucleotide. In competition assays, the −108 mutant oligonucleotide competed away both the corresponding wild type ankyrin and control AP-2 complexes (data not shown). Neither wild type nor mutant −153 oligonucleotides formed complexes with K562 extracts (data not shown). Previously, we have shown the wild type ankyrin promoter-directed expression of a linked Aγ-globin reporter gene in an erythroid-specific, position-independent, copy number-dependent (p = 0.004) fashion in transgenic mice (18Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this ankyrin promoter/humanAγ-globin reporter transgenic mouse model as a system to study the effect of the spherocytosis-associated promoter mutations in vivo. To dissect the effect of the −108 mutation from the linked −153 mutation, we created mutant ankyrin promoter transgenes with the −108 mutation, the linked −108 and −153 mutations, and an experimental control with the −153 mutation (Fig.1), even though the −153 mutation has not been reported solely without the −108 mutation. Wild type or mutant minimal ankyrin-1 promoter fragments were fused to the human Aγ-globin sequence immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon (Ank WT, −108, −108/−153, or −153, respectively/Aγ-globin; Figs. 1 and 2). Sixteen wild type, eight −108, seven −108/−153, and eight −153 transgenic mouse lines were generated. Southern blot analysis determined that the transgene copy number in these mice ranged between 1 and 15 (TableII).Table IIExpression of ankyrin/Aγ-globin mRNA in transgenic miceLinesTransgene copy no.Aγ-globin mRNA/α-globin mRNAAγ-globin mRNA/transgene copy no.Wild type A10.020.02 B10.0230.023 C20.1120.056 D10.0390.039 E20.0550.0275 F150.40.0267 H10.0470.047 I20.1230.0615 J30.1690.0563 K60.2810.0468 L20.1280.064 M30.1290.043 N50.1980.0396 O40.2440.061 P30.1110.037 Q120.140.017 Mean0.041 ± 0.004−108T to C A10.1120.112 B20.040.02 C10.0120.012 D110.3050.0277 E20.0450.0225 F40.1010.0253 G20.0510.0265 H40.1980.0495 Mean0.03681 ± 0.011p = 0.653, NSaNS, not significant.−108T to C/−153G to A A10.0150.015 B30.0160.0053 C20.0110.0055 D10.005bValues ∼0.005 and lower are indistinguishable from background.0.005 E30.008bValues ∼0.005 and lower are indistinguishable from background.0.003 F40.007bValues ∼0.005 and lower are indistinguishable from background.0.0018 G40.0180.0036 Mean0.006 ± 0.002p < 0.0001−153G to A A110.2730.0248 B110.3380.0307 C30.170.0567 D30.120.04 E60.1770.0295 F10.0380.038 G40.1910.0478 H10.0350.035 Mean0.03781 ± 0.004p = 0.5907, NSa NS, not significant.b Values ∼0.005 and lower are indistinguishable from background. Open table in a new tab The levels of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA and endogenous murine α-globin mRNA in reticulocytes were analyzed by ribonuclease protection. Riboprobe one (Fig. 2), which ensures that both the human Aγ-globin and murine α-globin sequences are labeled to equal specific activity, allowing comparison of humanAγ-globin and murine α-globin mRNA levels, was used. Wild type mice demonstrated position-independentAγ-globin gene expression in all 16 lines (Fig.4 and Table II). Transgenic mice with the −108 mutation demonstrated position-independent expression (eight of eight transgenic lines expressed γ-globin with Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA levels similar to wild type,p = 0.6533). Severe effects on Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA levels were seen in seven lines of mice with the linked −108/−153 mutations (Fig.5 and Table II). Three lines had undetectable levels of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA, indicating position-dependent expression, and in four lines the level of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA was significantly lower than wild type (−108/−153 mean 0.006 ± 0.002% versuswild type 0.041 ± 0.004% Aγ-globin RNA/copy number, p < 0.0001).

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that transcription was properly initiated in transgenic mice with mutant ankyrin promoters, we analyzedAγ-globin mRNA expression in reticulocyte RNA using riboprobe two (Fig. 2). All three mutant promoter transgenes initiated transcription at the same location as wild type (data not shown). Transgenic mice with the wild type ankyrin promoter expressed theAγ-globin transgene in a copy number-dependent fashion (copy number correlation with mRNA level r 2 = 0.5890, p = 0.0005 for all 16 strains, linear relationship, Table II and Fig. 5). Reporter gene expression relative to copy number in the −108 mice was similar to wild type, i.e. copy number-dependent (copy number correlation with mRNA level r 2= 0.7991, p = 0.0028, linear relationship). In the four −108/−153 mutant-expressing mice, there was no correlation between transgene copy number and mRNA level, indicating copy number-independent expression (copy number correlation with mRNA level r 2 = 0.1505, p = not significant; Table II and Fig. 5). The −153 experimental control mice expressed the Aγ-globin reporter gene relative to copy number in a copy number-dependent fashion (copy number correlation with mRNA level r 2 = 0.8755,p = 0.0006, linear relationship). To determine whether humanAγ-globin protein was present in the red cells of transgenic animals, we used an anti-human γ-globin monoclonal antibody for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. Transgenic mice with the wild type promoter expressed human γ-globin in a uniform pattern, i.e. in 100% of erythrocytes (TableIII, Fig.6). Similar analyses demonstrated different results in the mutant promoter transgenic lines (Table III, Fig. 6). γ-Globin expression was variegated in all eight lines of −108 mice, with between 10 and 80% of erythrocytes expressing γ-globin. In two of the four expressing transgenic lines with the −108/−153 mutation and in five of eight −153 mutant control lines, γ-globin gene expression was variegated (Table III, Fig. 6).Table IIIγ-Globin protein expression in erythrocytes of transgenic miceLinesRed blood cells expressing γ-globin%Wild type A100 C100 D100 H100 J100 Q100−108T to C A50 B50 C10 D50 E40 F40 G30 H80−108T to C/−153G to A A100 B60 C80 D—aRNA undetectable.

These cases present a challenging and unsolved problem in genetic counseling. Large genetic screens of ankyrin-deficient HS patients identified the ankyrin promoter mutations studied in this report (4Miraglia del Giudice E. Nobili B. Francese M. D'Urso L. Iolascon A. Eber S. Perrotta S. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A.

Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In several of these cases, additional mutations in the coding region were found in the ankyrin gene in trans to the allele with the promoter mutation (9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A. Gallagher P.G. Schroter W. Forget B.G. Lux S.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Leite R.C. Basseres D.S. Ferreira J.S. Alberto F.L. Costa F.F. Saad S.T. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As the inheritance is recessive, it is anticipated that all patients heterozygous for ankyrin gene promoter mutations have an additional ankyrin gene mutation in trans.These promoter mutations are common in the general population, with a frequency of ∼2–3% (9Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A. Gallagher P.G. Schroter W. Forget B.G. Lux S.E. Nat.

Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the inheritance of one of these promoter mutations could unmask other ankyrin gene mutations, making this a relatively common cause of recessive HS. It is interesting to note that osmotic fragility screening of random blood donors identified an HS “carrier state” in slightly more than 1% of donors (34Eber S.W. Pekrun A. Neufeldt A. Schroter W. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 64: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Godal H.C. Heisto H. Scand. J. Haematol. 1981; 27: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these donors were potential parents of patients with recessively inherited HS (4Miraglia del Giudice E. Nobili B. Francese M. D'Urso L. Iolascon A. Eber S. Perrotta S. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that some of these donors may be heterozygous for an ankyrin promoter mutation. We attempted to determine the mechanism(s) by which these mutations exert their influence on ankyrin gene expression. The transgenes tested in these assays initiated mRNA transcription at the correct site, suggesting that a defect in transcript initiation is unlikely. The most severe effects on Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA and protein expression were seen in mice with the linked −108/−153 promoter mutations who demonstrated significantly decreased γ-globin mRNA in a position-dependent, copy number-independent manner, as well as variegated distribution of γ-globin protein in erythrocytes. The −108 mutant promoter transgenic mice demonstrated differences only in the cellular distribution of the γ-globin protein. These are interesting observations, as no differences between these promoter mutations and wild type promoter were seen in in vitrostudies. Together, these data suggest that intact chromatin is necessary to manifest the promoter defects. The −153 mutation does not create or abolish consensus sequences for any known DNA-binding proteins and although the −108 mutation occurs in an AP-2 consensus binding sequence, in vitro studies suggest that this is not a functionally important site in wild type ankyrin gene expression (Ref. 12Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this report). It is possible that a previously undescribed DNA-binding protein interacts with either or both of these sites. The upstream −153 mutation is located in a stretch of CpG dinucleotides, a region of potential DNA methylation. DNA methylation controls gene expression by modulating access of regulatory elements to a gene promoter. There is a second ankyrin-1 gene promoter, active in neural and muscle cells, located 40 kilobase pairs upstream of the erythroid promoter (36Gallagher P.G. Wong E. Wong C. Blood. 1998; 92: 300aCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that, in wild type cells in vivo, erythroid cell-specific methylation in the region of the −153 mutation prevents binding of a protein with negative regulatory activity or one with enhancer-blocking activity that creates a boundary element (i.e. an “insulator”). Mutation and disruption of methylation in this region could then facilitate DNA-protein binding. The latter has recently been shown at the H19/Igf2 locus, where methylation mediates the binding and enhancer blocking activity of the multifunctional zinc finger protein CTCF (37Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 38Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M.

Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for this hypothesis comes from the observations that removal of a long range insulator or boundary element from a region can shut down the locus and lead to position effects (40Kleinjan D.J. van Heyningen V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These phenomena, i.e. decreased gene expression and position-dependent expression, were observed in the mutant −153/−108 mice. Future studies will provide insight into how these mutations affect regulation of the ankyrin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2097892072,"By systematic analysis of a human testis library, we have isolated the hH-Rev107-3 cDNA, identical to hH-Rev107-1 cDNA, which was previously described as a class II tumor suppressor gene. In this study, two transcripts (1 and 0.8 kb) were detected by Northern blot in all human tissues, excepted in thymus. The strongest expression was found in testis, skeletal muscle and heart. These two mRNA are probably transcribed from only one gene that we mapped to the q12-q13 region of the chromosome 11. In human testis, hH-Rev107 gene expression was localized, by in situ hybridization, within the round spermatids. To investigate a possible role for hH-Rev107 protein in testicular malignant growth, we examined the expression of this gene in germ cell tumors. A strong hH-Rev107 gene expression was observed in normal testis as well as in samples with preinvasive carcinoma in situ but was completely absent in overt tumors, both seminomas and non-seminomas. By in situ hybridization, CIS was found hH-Rev107 positive and tumor negative. A semi-quantitative assessment of hH-Rev107 mRNA level in testicular germ cell tumors, by RT–PCR, exhibited a ninefold decrease in the gene expression. No gross structural aberrations of hH-Rev107 gene were detected in these human primary tumors. The results suggest that down-regulation of hH-Rev107 may be associated with invasive progression of testicular germ cell tumors."

In the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), the steady-state levels of p53 mRNA markedly increased in immortal CEF cell lines, similar to levels found in primary cells. The de novo synthetic rates of p53 mRNA were relatively similar in primary and immortal cells grown in the presence or absence of CHX. Destabilization of p53 mRNA was observed in the nuclei of immortal, but not primary, CEF cells. The half-life of p53 mRNA in primary cells was found to be a relatively long 23 h compared to only 3 h in immortal cells. The expression of transfected p53 cDNA was inhibited in immortal cells, but restored upon CHX treatment. The 5′-region of the p53 mRNA was shown to be involved in the rapid p53 mRNA destabilization in immortal cells by expression analysis of 5′- and 3′-deleted p53 cDNAs as well as fusion mRNA constructs of N-terminal p53 and N-terminal deleted LacZ genes. Together, it is suggestive that the downregulation of p53 mRNA in immortal CEF cells occurs through a post-transcriptional destabilizing mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1990240568,"E2Fs play a central role in cell proliferation and growth arrest through their ability to regulate genes involved in cell cycle progression, arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies further indicate that this family of transcriptional regulators participate in cell fate/differentiation events. They are thus likely to have a prominent role in controlling the terminal differentiation process and its irreversibility. Here we have specifically examined the role of E2F2 in neuronal differentiation using a gain-of-function approach. Endogenous E2F2 increased in PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) and was also expressed in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing terminal differentiation. While PC12 cells normally undergo reversible dedifferentiation and cell cycle re-entry upon NGF removal, forced expression of E2F2 inhibited these events and induced apoptosis. Thus, E2F2 converted PC12-derived neurons from a reversible to a 'terminally' differentiated, NGF-dependent state, analogous to postmitotic sympathetic neurons. This contrasts with the effects of E2F4, which enhances the differentiation state of PC12 cells without affecting cell cycle parameters or survival. These results indicate that E2F2 may have a unique role in maintaining the postmitotic state of terminally differentiated neurons, and may participate in apoptosis in neurons attempting to re-enter the cell cycle. It may also be potentially useful in promoting the terminally arrested/differentiated state of tumor cells."

Although the holoenzyme is universally composed of both RNA and protein, the subunit composition differs dramatically among the holoenzymes derived from bacteria and eukaryotes (3Frank D. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A single protein component and RNA molecule constitute the bacterial RNase P holoenzyme, whereas as many as nine proteins play a role in the nuclear RNase P function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Frank D.

The RNase P RNAs derived from bacterial and some archaeal sources catalyze precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) cleavage in vitro under appropriate ionic conditions in the absence of protein (5Guerrier-Takada C.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7803-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although the eukaryotic RNase P RNAs contain many of the secondary structural elements present in the prokaryotic RNA subunits, a demonstrable catalytic activity in RNA-alone reactions has not been established for any eukaryotic RNAs. We have previously reported that proteins constitute significant components of the active site architecture for the eukaryotic RNase P holoenzyme (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings were based upon the observation that for RNase P enzymes from both Tetrahymena thermophila and human HeLa cell sources, proteins rather than RNA were able to form efficient cross-linked products with photo-reactive substrates. Conversely, the protein complement of the Escherichia coli RNase P was not required for the RNA subunit to form a corresponding cross-linked product with substrate. One potential role for protein components in the eukaryotic system may be to position the pre-tRNA substrate in the active site for efficient and accurate processing. Our previous work with RNase P preparations derived from T. thermophila and HeLa sources illustrated that a single protein component of the holoenzyme resides in proximity to the substrate (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For example, a 36-kDa protein component of the T. thermophila holoenzyme (p36) forms a specific protein-RNA adduct with pre-tRNA substrates. The proximity of an RNase P protein subunit to the substrate does not prove that the protein component contacts the substrate within the active site. Furthermore, our previous cross-linking studies were not of sufficient resolution to reveal details about the pre-tRNA substrate surface that lie proximal to the protein to which the RNA was ultimately cross-linked. To address these questions, we have extended our biochemical analyses to study substrate-protein interactions for the RNase P holoenzyme derived from S. cerevisiae. RNA binding experiments reveal that one protein component of the yeast nuclear RNase P, Pop3p, possesses high affinity RNA-binding properties with preferences for single-stranded RNA. Consistent with this observation, Pop3p interacts with a 39-nucleotide-long region that surrounds the RNase P cleavage site within a pre-tRNA substrate. Mutational studies reveal that the highly charged C-terminal region of Pop3p is involved in RNA-binding interactions and may provide a direct role in substrate recognition. The results described here provide further evidence for the model that proteins facilitate substrate binding in the active site for eukaryotic RNase P function.

Following amplification, the DNA was subsequently digested with restriction enzymes, and the DNA corresponding to POP3 was cloned into the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Several Pop3p mutants were created for the identification of a RNA-binding domain of the protein. The following oligonucleotides were used to create the Pop3p mutants used in the binding experiments: N-20: (5′-CGCGGATCCCCCGTGCTAGACAATCCGTTCAC-3′) and 3′ WT oligo; N-64: (CGCGGATCCCCTTGGGAGCTGTATACAGATTTC-3′) and 3′ WT oligo; C-8: 5′ WT oligo and (5′-CGCAAGCTTCTATGGCACTGTAGTTTTCAACAG-3′); 3KA: 5′ WT oligo and (5′-CGCAAGCTTCTAAGCTTGCCTAGCAGCCGAGACAATTGGCACTGTAGT-3′); RQA: 5′ WT oligo and (5′-CGCAAGCTTCTACTTAGCAGCCTTCTTCGAGA- CAATTGGCAC-3′). The QIAexpress (Qiagen) pQE expression system utilizes an isopropylthiogalactopyranoside-inducible T5 promoter and two lac operator sequences to ensure efficient repression. An N-terminal 6xHis tag was incorporated into the coding sequence during cloning to facilitate rapid affinity purification of the recombinant protein using Ni(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. An N-terminal extension of the natural coding sequence does not interfere with Pop3p function, because a Protein A-Pop3p fusion protein is biologically active in vivo (9Dichtl B. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This recombinant form of Pop3p (designated as H6Pop3p) was used for all of the experiments described herein. E. coli strain SG13009[pREP4] was transformed with pQE30POP3, and clones were selected for H6Pop3p protein expression using ampicillin and kanamycin antibiotic selection. A total of four 1-liter cultures of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin were grown at 37 °C until the A600 was 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced with isopropylthiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Recombinant protein was purified from crude lysates by Ni(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions were diluted 1:10 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed versus R150 buffer (50 mm citrate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 6.5) for a total of five 1-liter exchanges at 4 °C. Typical yields from this procedure range from 8 to 12 mg of soluble protein per liter of induced culture. H6Pop3p is stable at 4 °C in R150 buffer for several months. Protein could also be stored at −80 °C for ≥6 months without losing activity, as assessed by filter binding with S. cerevisiae RNase P RNA (described below). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically as described by Mach et al. (10Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Mature RNase P RNA from S. cerevisiae was transcribed in vitro from a BstNI-linearized pGEM7 DNA template (pScPRNA) using T7 RNA polymerase. The synthetic yeast tRNAPhe was transcribed in vitro from a BstNI-linearized p67YFO DNA template using either Sp6 RNA polymerase to generate precursor tRNA, or T7 RNA polymerase to generate mature tRNA (11Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 1033-1037Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The Tetrahymena thermophila L-21/Sca RNA was transcribed in vitro from the template pT7L-21 that was linearized with ScaI using T7 RNA polymerase. Internally labeled RNA molecules were made by including [α-32P]ATP in the transcription reaction. Transcripts were gel-purified and refolded using previously described procedures (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). End-labeled RNAs were prepared for use in the filter retention experiments. For the 5′-end labeling of pre-tRNA, 500 pmol of pre-tRNA was dephosphorylated in a 100-μl reaction with 5 units of calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 45 °C for 30 min. The RNA was extracted twice each with phenol, phenol-chloroform, chloroform, and ether. The remaining aqueous volume was adjusted to 0.25m NaCl, and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol was added to facilitate precipitation of the RNA overnight at −20 °C. For the 5′-end-labeling reaction, 50 pmol of dephosphorylated pre-tRNA was reacted with 3.3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) in a reaction volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. To prepare 3′-end-labeled pre-tRNA, ∼100 pmol of pre-tRNA was incubated with 6.7 pmol of [5′-32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate in the presence of 10 units of T4 RNA ligase RNA ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP) in a 10-μl reaction volume for 2 h at 37 °C. The 5′- and 3′-end-labeled RNAs were recovered by gel electrophoresis as described previously (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Poly(A) and poly(U) single-stranded RNA homopolymers, as well as poly(I)·poly(C) duplex RNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were resuspended in R150 buffer and stored at −20 °C until use. DNA molecules used in the binding experiments included a single-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CGATAAGCCAGCTGCATTAATG-3′, Operon, Inc.) and a plasmid DNA (pTSSp6) that was CsCl-banded at least three times prior to use to ensure the plasmid DNA preparation was free of RNA contamination. A modified filter binding assay was used for the determination of dissociation constants assuming a bimolecular equilibrium for each experiment. H6Pop3p was initially preincubated with 1 μg of a deproteinized, total yeast RNA hydrolysate preparation at 37 °C for 10 min to limit nonspecific protein-RNA interactions. Typically, a fixed concentration of internally labeled RNA (100 pm) was incubated with various H6Pop3p concentrations (0.1–500 nm) in a 100-μl reaction volume and placed on ice for 0.5–1 h. An 80-μl aliquot of the reaction was applied to a BA85 Protran nitrocellulose filter with an underlying NA45-DEAE membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) under vacuum using a double-filter dot-blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell) described by Wong and Lohman (12Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters were soaked in R150 buffer for at least 30 min prior to filtration. The DEAE membranes were soaked immediately before use. Following filtration, each filter was dried and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or a Cyclone Storage phosphor system (Packard). For the competition experiments, a fixed concentration of H6Pop3p (100 nm) was incubated with a mixture of nucleic acids consisting of a fixed concentration of internally labeled S. cerevisiae RNase P RNA (100 pm) and a varying concentration of unlabeled competitor nucleic acids. The competitor nucleic acids of defined length were used in the range of 0.1–500 nm, based upon their calculated mole transcript concentrations. The competitor nucleic acids of unknown length were used in the range of 25 nm to 500 μm, based on their calculated mole nucleotide concentrations. Filter retention experiments were employed to determine the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of pre-tRNA important for Pop3p interaction (13Ryan P.C. Draper D.E.,. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9949-9956Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Typically, end-labeled pre-tRNA was partially hydrolyzed in the presence of 25 mm NaOH for 45 s at 90 °C in a 100-μl reaction volume. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 6.0) to yield a final concentration of 150 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). RNAs were refolded by the addition of a refolding buffer to a final concentration of 8 mm MgCl2and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The partially hydrolyzed RNA was then used in a filter binding assay with H6Pop3p (75 nm) as described above and passed through nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose filters were immediately washed in 2 ml of TE/NaCl buffer (0.25 m NaCl/0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/0.001 m Na2EDTA) containing 2% SDS for 2 h. This mixture was extracted with the addition of an equal volume of phenol for 2 h. The RNA in the resultant aqueous phase was recovered as a precipitate following the addition of 3 volumes of 100% ethanol and an overnight incubation of the ethanol-aqueous mixture at −20 °C. The RNA products were separated on a 6% denaturing gel alongside sequencing standards; subsequently, the gel was dried and exposed to a Cyclone Storage phosphor screen for analysis on a Cyclone Storage phosphor system. The sequencing standards were prepared by subjecting the end-labeled, full-length RNAs to limited alkaline hydrolysis or partial RNase T1 digestion. To explore the nucleic acid binding characteristics of this protein, protein-RNA mixtures were subjected to a modified filter binding assay in which a modified dot-blot apparatus was fitted with a nitrocellulose filter and an underlying DEAE filter (12Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The data were fitted to a retention efficiency and a Kd value assuming a bimolecular equilibrium. As seen in Fig. 1 A, H6Pop3p binds to the S. cerevisiae RNase P RNA with high affinity. A dissociation constant (Kd) value of 16.3 ± 1.5 nm has been calculated that represents an average of five independent experiments. A Hill analysis of the data yields a Hill coefficient of 1.2, suggesting that this interaction is non-cooperative (Fig. 1 B). H6Pop3p was also tested for its ability to bind substrate pre-tRNA and mature tRNA. H6Pop3p prefers to bind substrate relative to product by roughly 3-fold (Fig. 1 C). The ability of H6Pop3p to interact with RNA under a variety of buffer conditions was also tested. Specifically, the dependence of magnesium(II) on the H6Pop3p-RNase P RNA binding interaction was explored using various concentrations of either MgCl2 or Mg(C2H3O2)2 in the binding reactions. As seen in Fig. 2 A, magnesium(II) has no effect on the interaction within the range of 0–100 mm. In addition, the ionic strength dependence of the H6Pop3p-RNase P RNA interaction was tested in binding reactions containing varying concentrations of either CH3CO2NH4or NH4Cl. The results shown in Fig. 2 B indicate that the RNA-protein interaction is hindered by high ionic strength conditions above 0.5 m, suggesting a role for ionic contacts in the formation of the RNA-protein complex. A competition assay was used to investigate the interaction of H6Pop3p with a wide variety of nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids chosen included both single- and double-stranded RNA molecules as well as DNA molecules. The H6Pop3p concentration (100 nm) was held constant above the Kd level for H6Pop3p- S. cerevisiae RNase P RNA interaction (16.3 nm), and the labeled S. cerevisiae RNase P RNA remained constant at 100 pm. Unlabeled competitor nucleic acids were included in the reaction mixtures at varying concentrations. Some RNA molecules were also shown to possess a high affinity to H6Pop3p as revealed by direct titration of each RNA as an internally labeled molecule with H6Pop3p. None of the DNA molecules served as efficient competitor nucleic acids to H6Pop3p-RNase P RNA binding. As summarized in TableI, H6Pop3p preferentially binds single-stranded RNAs or complex RNAs with some single-stranded character.Table ISpecificity of H6Pop3p-nucleic acid interactionNucleic acidaThe nucleic acids were defined and prepared according to procedures stated under “Experimental Procedures.”Direct titrationbDissociation constants calculated from at least three independent filter binding experiments with internally labeled RNA molecules.CompetitioncMole nucleotide concentration of unlabeled competitor nucleic acid at fraction bound = 50%.nmμmS. cerevisiae RNase P RNA16.3 ± 1.56.6 ± 0.7 pre-tRNA42.5 ± 7.5NDdND, not determined. tRNA125.0 ± 15.0NDT. thermophila L-21/Scal RNA19.5 ± 0.58.2 ± 0.2 Poly(A)NAeNA, not applicable.

Open table in a new tab Although H6Pop3p did not show specificity for a given RNA molecule, the data suggested that the protein prefers to bind single-stranded RNAs and prefers to bind pre-tRNA relative to tRNA. To determine more precisely the RNA-binding site on pre-tRNA, we used a filter retention procedure with end-labeled substrates. End-labeled pre-tRNAs that contain 32P at either the 5′ or 3′ terminus were randomly fragmented by hydrolysis and used as substrates in binding reactions containing H6Pop3p. The RNA products that were retained by the nitrocellulose filter by virtue of binding H6Pop3p were extracted and analyzed on a sequencing gel to determine the minimal length of RNA that interacted with H6Pop3p. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 3. When the pre-tRNA is 5′-end-labeled, the smallest RNA that H6Pop3p is able to retain extends from the 5′ terminus to nucleotide positions +14 to +18 (Fig. 3 A). When the pre-tRNA is labeled at the 3′ terminus, the smallest RNAs that H6Pop3p is able to retain extend from the 3′-end to nucleotide position −21 (Fig. 3 B). These experiments permit the inference that Pop3p displays a preference for binding a ∼39-nucleotide-long region near the 5′-end of pre-tRNA (Fig. 4). This region surrounds the cleavage site for pre-tRNA processing by the RNase P holoenzyme and expands across structural elements important for RNase P substrate recognition by RNase P (14McClain W.H.

Nucleotides are numbered from the site of cleavage (arrow) with the first nucleotide of the mature tRNA denoted as +1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify specific regions that contribute to Pop3p's RNA binding behavior, we first created a series of terminal deletion mutations of the natural coding sequence of Pop3p. Genes that encoded two N-terminal deletions were engineered that removed the first 20 or 64 amino acids, respectively. A gene that encoded a C-terminal deletion was also engineered that removed the last eight amino acids of the protein. Fig. 5 shows a diagram of the Pop3p mutant constructs. Filter binding assays with these proteins demonstrated that the removal of the highly charged C-terminal residues dramatically reduces the affinity of the protein to RNA (TableII).Table IIRNA-binding properties of H6Pop3p mutantsProteinDissociation constantaDissociation constants were calculated from at least three independent filter binding experiments with internally labeled RNA molecules.S. cerevisiae RNase P RNApre-tRNAnmH6Pop3p16.3 ± 1.542.5 ± 7.5N-2018 ± 219 ± 1N-6427.5 ± 7.570 ± 10C-819 ± 2300 ± 253KA11.5 ± 0.5250 ± 45RQA16.3 ± 2.7150 ± 35a Dissociation constants were calculated from at least three independent filter binding experiments with internally labeled RNA molecules. Open table in a new tab Site-specific mutations were created to reveal the identity of residues important for RNA binding activity (Fig. 5). The attenuation of Pop3p's high affinity binding properties suggests that the 3 lysine residues may play a role in pre-tRNA binding activity (Table II). These residues have a more pronounced affect on binding substrate than on binding the RNase P RNA subunit (Table II), suggesting that these residues may provide substrate recognition and interaction functions. The lack of a demonstrable catalytic activity for eukaryotic RNase P RNAs suggests a more critical role for protein subunits in eukaryotes than the protein subunit provides in the bacterial holoenzyme. The lack of catalytic activity in eukaryotic RNase P RNA-alone reactions and the apparent abundance of protein subunits in the eukaryotic holoenzyme that lie in the vicinity of the pre-tRNA substrate led to our original proposal that the eukaryotic RNase P holoenzyme possesses a protein-rich active site (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cross-linking analyses with a photoreactive substrate pre-tRNA and an RNase P holoenzyme preparation from S. cerevisiae confirmed that several protein species lie in proximity to the substrate. 2E. M. Brusca, H. L. True, and D. W. Celander, unpublished observations. As is evident for holoenzymes from HeLa cells and the ciliated protozoa T. thermophila, proteins of the S. cerevisiae holoenzyme may provide a critical role in active site architecture formation. The data presented in this study provide further support that protein(s) may provide substrate recognition for eukaryotic RNase P holoenzymes. Three observations implicate Pop3p as a component of the active site topology of the S. cerevisiae RNase P holoenzyme. First, the recombinant form of Pop3p shows a marked preference for single-stranded RNA versus double-stranded RNA. This intriguing observation is consistent with recent findings that have shown that single-stranded RNA homopolymers inhibit the nuclear RNase P reaction, whereas double-stranded non-substrate RNA molecules had little inhibitory effect (18Ziehler W.A. Day J.J. Fierke C.A. Engelke D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9909-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this regard, Pop3p or other protein components that are associated with the active site may discriminate among potential substrate RNA molecules and provide to the active site only those RNA molecules with requisite features, i.e. a 5′-leader sequence. Second, Pop3p prefers to bind pre-tRNA relative to tRNA. The ability of the protein to distinguish substrates and products provides a role for Pop3p during the catalytic cycle whereby it may serve to limit product inhibition following substrate cleavage. This phenomenon is seen in the bacterial RNase P holoenzyme in which the Bacillus subtilis P protein is able to cross-link to the 5′-leader sequence of pre-tRNA but not to the mature tRNA (19Niranjanakumari S. Stams T. Crary S.M. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15212-15217Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Finally, Pop3p recognizes sequences surrounding the site of pre-tRNA processing. The protein’s proximity to pre-tRNAs may serve to position or orient the substrate’s 5′-leader sequence in the active site for proper processing to occur. This proposal is consistent with the role of the protein subunit in bacterial RNase P in which the protein component interacts directly with the 5′-leader sequence to facilitate the processing reaction (19Niranjanakumari S. Stams T. Crary S.M. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15212-15217Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,20Kurz J.C. Niranjanakumari S. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2393-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested a role for several conserved structural elements common among all precursor tRNAs for RNase P substrate recognition (14McClain W.H. Guerrier-Takada C. Altman S. Science. 1987; 238: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Carrara G. Calandra P. Fruscoloni P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 92: 2627-2631Google Scholar). Acceptor stem integrity combined with the D/T loop interactions are important for the processing reaction, whereas the anti-codon arm is of little importance (16Mohan A. Levinger L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Hardt W.-D. Schlegl J. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13046-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of one or more protein subunits to recognize these features may ensure proper substrate identification and placement within the active site. That Pop3p recognizes sequences encompassing the 5′-leader sequence, the acceptor stem, and portions of the D stem-loop supports a role for this protein in substrate recognition. In addition to providing substrate recognition functions, proteins may also be required to interact with the RNA components of RNase P and RNase MRP (21Pluk H. Van Eenennaam H. Rutjes S.A. Pruijn G.J.M. Van Venrooij W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This interaction is presumably reliant on conserved structural features among the two RNA components, because little primary sequence is conserved between them. Protein binding sites on RNA molecules are often characterized by a set of secondary and tertiary features that allow the RNA to fold into a unique three-dimensional array of nucleotide phosphates allowing ionic contact sites to contribute to specificity in RNA-protein interactions (22Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The H6Pop3p-P RNA interaction is inhibited by elevated salt concentrations, supporting a role for ionic contacts in the binding interaction. Specificity may be resolved in the context of the holoenzyme where protein-protein interactions are likely to provide further scaffolding in these complex ribonucleoproteins. Following the biochemical purification and identification of holoenzyme components from the S. cerevisiae RNase P, it was noted that eight of the nine essential protein components shared a short region of highly charged residues (4Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although this stretch of amino acid sequence does not comprise a known RNA-binding motif, it was speculated that these regions may be involved in RNA-binding interactions for the ribozyme. Pop3p has several stretches of basic residues within the natural open reading frame. In general, protein components of RNase P holoenzymes from diverse phylogenetic origins do not share a high degree of amino acid sequence conservation. However, it is noteworthy that modification of a short stretch of basic residues common in most of the S. cerevisiae RNase P proteins significantly alters the RNA-binding properties of Pop3p. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of Pop3p appears to play a role in substrate recognition and RNA-binding in general. This study represents the first detailed biochemical analysis for a protein-RNA interaction for a eukaryotic RNase P. The roles proteins play in eukaryotic RNase P holoenzyme function have yet to be elucidated. Proteins may provide RNA-chaperone and stabilization activities, assist in subcellular localization, or play more direct roles in the catalytic cycle. Pop3p constitutes the first identified protein essential for RNase P activity in S. cerevisiae that is able to recognize a pre-tRNA substrate in a biochemically relevant manner. Thus, a protein-rich active site in which proteins facilitate substrate recognition and positioning for efficient processing is consistent with the role of protein subunits in other eukaryotic organisms (7True H.L. Celander D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7193-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2077955011,"Proteolysis of the yeast G1cyclins is triggered by their Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2 are ubiquitinated by the SCF-Grr1 complex and then degraded by the 26 S proteasome. In this study, we identified a cak1 allele in a genetic screen for mutants that stabilize the yeast G1 cyclins. Further characterization showed that Cln2HA was hypophosphorylated, unable to bind Cdc28, and stabilized in cak1 mutants at the restrictive temperature. Hypophosphorylation of Cln2HA could thus explain its stabilization. To test this possibility, we expressed a Cak1-independent mutant of Cdc28 (Cdc28-43244) in cak1mutants and found that Cln2HA phosphorylation was restored, but surprisingly, the phospho-Cln2HA was stabilized. When bound to Cdc28-43244, Cln2HA was recognized and polyubiquitinated by SCF-Grr1. The Cdc28-43244 mutant thus reveals an unexpected complexity in the degradation of polyubiquitinated Cln2HA by the proteasome."

Xcsk is widely expressed during early development, physically interacts with the Src kinase Laloo, and inhibits the generation of mesoderm by the Src kinases. Xcsk activity requires a functional kinase domain; furthermore, a kinase-inactive Xcsk mutant potently synergizes with Laloo during early vertebrate development, suggesting a fundamental role for the Src kinase-Csk regulatory circuit during mesoderm induction, in vivo."

These results indicate a second role of phytase in Ca2+mobilization during germination of mung been seed via a salvage pathway that involves allosteric activation by myo-inositol trisphosphate. d-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate or phytic acid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4,5)P3, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 4,5)P3,d-myo-inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate 3,4)P3, d-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate any of the isomers Ins(1,4,5)/(2,4,5)/(1,3,4)P3 4,4′- dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid receptor for Ins(1,4,5)P3 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Phytase (d-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate hydrolase) from mung bean seed, Vigna radiata, is a neutral phosphatase that dephosphorylates myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, InsP6,1 in the following sequential way: InsP6 → InsP5 → InsP4 → InsP3 → InsP2 → InsP → Ins. It is ubiquitous in its occurrence. Its amount increases during the germination of seed (1Mandal N.C. Biswas B.B. Plant Physiol. 1970; 45: 4-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phytase isolated from 72-h germinating mung bean seeds is a monomeric enzyme of molecular mass of 160 kDa with a pH optimum of 7.5 (2Mandal N.C. Burman S. Biswas B.B. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 495-502Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A previous study (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that in the sequential dephosphorylation of InsP6, the enzyme displays increasing affinity for the substrate, InsPn (n = 1–6), with a decrease in the number of phosphate groups. Binding of the substrates at the catalytic site in phytase is characterized by dissociation constants in the micromolar range (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This report (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed the presence of a high affinity (dissociation constant in the nanomolar order) non-catalytic site, specific for Ins(1,4,5)/(2,4,5)/(1,3,4)P3, in phytase. Phytase-myo-inositol trisphosphate complex formed at the high affinity site forms a ternary complex with the putative receptor for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and enhances the level of calcium release from microsomal/vacuolar suspension in vitro. The amount of calcium mobilized by the high affinity complex was about three times greater than that released by myo-inositol trisphosphate alone. Another interesting observation was that the complex formation at the high affinity site also activates otherwise inactive Ins(1,3,4)P3 for calcium mobilization from vacuoles/microsomes (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).These results imply that the high affinity InsP3-binding site is distinct from the catalytic site and has an important physiological role. Therefore, we examined the influence of the high affinity InsP3 binding to phytase on its substrate binding and hydrolyzing activity involving the catalytic site. Present studies suggest that saturation of the high affinity binding site with Ins(1,4,5)/(2,4,5)/(1,3,4)P3 leads to an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for InsP6. It is associated with a concurrent increase in the rate of hydrolysis of InsP6 by phytase. In order to find a molecular explanation of the above observation, we have also carried out an enzymatic dissection of phytase using trypsin. The results conclusively illustrate that the two sites are functionally non-overlapping and distinct.Signal-activated hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by phospholipase C is the only known pathway of the production of myo-inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), a well known second messenger that manifests many of its effects by inducing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in eukaryotic systems (4Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 5Shears S.B. Parry J.B. Tang E.K.Y. Irvine R.F. Michell R.H. Kirk C.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Low levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and a large excess of InsP6 in seeds seem to suggest the existence of an alternative pathway for the production of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) in plants (6Drobak B.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 287-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The previous report (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) indicates the presence of such an alternate pathway, which leads to production of inositol trisphosphates. The results presented here further support the presence of such an alternate pathway. We have also noticed a significant homology between Homer, a protein implicated in signaling pathway (8Kammermeier P.J. Xiao B. Tu J.C Worley P.F. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7238-7245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a tryptic fragment (5 kDa) that contains the high affinity site for binding to Ins(1,4,5)P3 and mobilizes Ca2+ from microsomes/vacuoles isolated from the hypocotyls of germinating mung bean seeds. Below we have discussed the significance of the results vis-à-vis an alternate pathway of production of myo-inositol trisphosphate involving phytase and its biological role during germination of mung bean seeds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInsP6, Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(2,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4)P3, trypsin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, benzamidine, 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, bovine serum albumin, and Fura-2 were purchased from Sigma. Sephadex G-100 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bis-ANS was from Molecular Probes. Prestained SDS-PAGE standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Mung bean (V. radiata) seeds were purchased from seed multiplication farm, Behrampur, West Bengal, India.Two batches of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (specific activity, 0.677 and 21 μCi/nmol, respectively) and one batch of [3H]InsP6 (specific activity, 20.5 μCi/nmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from BRIT, India. [32P]InsP6 was obtained from the precursor, [32P]orthophosphoric acid, by a method reported earlier (9Saio K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1964; 5: 393-400Google Scholar). In brief, the method consists of ion-exchange-based fractionation of myo-inositol phosphates from the mung bean seeds germinating for 48 h in [32P]orthophosphoric acid-enriched medium. Concentration of purified InsP6 was evaluated by estimation of phosphate liberated from InsP6after its complete digestion of InsP6 with perchloric acid for 3 h at 180 °C (10Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1929; 81: 629-636Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Specific activity of stock [32P]InsP6 was 248 cpm/pmol.Isolation of PhytasePhytase was isolated from cotyledons of 72-h germinating seeds by the modified method of Mandal and co-workers (2Mandal N.C. Burman S. Biswas B.B. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 495-502Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The preparation was tested for phytase activity from estimation of liberated phosphate from the substrate, InsP6, at 37 °C. Purity of the protein was confirmed by means of SDS-PAGE from the presence of a single band of 160 kDa. Contamination of nonspecific phosphatase in the purified enzyme was not detected because the preparation does not hydrolyze glucose 6-phosphate, which is a substrate for phosphatase (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For fluorescence spectroscopic studies, the protein, which was eluted from the 5% non-denaturing gel, was passed through Sephadex G-75 (Superfine) to remove possible fluorescent contaminants from the gel. Its concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the Bradford assay (12Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar).Limited Proteolysis of Phytase by TrypsinTrypsin, insoluble enzyme attached to beaded agarose (from Bovine Pancreas, suspended in ∼10 mm acetic acid, pH 3.2), was washed repeatedly with excess of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. Phytase (75 μg) was incubated with 4 units of trypsin in the 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mmNaCl for 3 h at 30 °C. Trypsin was removed from the incubation mixture by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min. A 7.5% SDS-PAGE was done to characterize the fragments of trypsinized phytase. Size-exclusion chromatography of the trypsinized phytase was carried out to isolate the tryptic fragments for further experiments. Trypsinized phytase (after removal of trypsin) was loaded onto Sephadex G-100 column (0.5 × 30.0 cm). The tryptic fragments were eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at an elution rate of 0.1 ml/min. Fractions were monitored using fluorescence intensity at 340 nm (λex = 278 nm, where λex indicates excitation wavelength). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated. Concentration of the fragments was determined using the method of Lowry et al. (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the Bradford assay (12Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar).Assay of Phytase ActivityAssay of enzyme activity for phytase and its tryptic fragments is based on the estimation of inorganic phosphate liberated from the phytase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the substrate, InsP6. In all assays, the concentration of phytase/its tryptic fragment(s) was 625 nm, whereas that of InsP6 was 2 mm. During the assay with native enzyme, it was incubated with InsP6 for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. In experiments to check the effect of the high affinity site upon the catalytic potential of phytase, the site was first saturated by preincubation of phytase either with 300 nm Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(2,4,5)P3 or 500 nm Ins(1,3,4)P3 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 15 min followed by the routine assay procedure. Inorganic phosphate liberated was estimated by the ascorbate method (13Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Varner H. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar) or by the method of continuous fluorimetry (14Banik U. Ray S. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 611-614PubMed Google Scholar). The method of continuous fluorimetry was employed during the early phase of catalysis (1–5 min) when the amount of phosphate liberated from the substrate was too low to be detected by the ascorbate method. In this method, phosphate released from InsP6 hydrolysis is coupled to the nucleoside phosphorylase reaction using 7-methylguanosine as a fluorescent substrate (14Banik U. Ray S. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 611-614PubMed Google Scholar). In either of the above methods inorganic phosphate was quantitated from the calibration curve using standards in the same range of concentrations as that liberated from InsP6 by phytase.For enzyme kinetics under different conditions, phytase was incubated with InsP6 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for various time intervals, and the phosphate liberated was quantitated as explained above. The kinetics of enzyme activity is expressed in units of phosphate (μmol) liberated per h per mg of protein at 37 °C (2Mandal N.C. Burman S. Biswas B.B. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 495-502Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Bitar K. Reinhold J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Yang W. Matsuda Y. Sano S. Masutani H. Nakagawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1075: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Reconstitution AssayIn all reconstitution studies the tryptic fragments were mixed at equimolar ratio in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Reconstituted mixture was assayed for phytase activity as mentioned above using InsP6 as the substrate.Fluorescence Spectroscopic StudiesAll fluorescence spectra were recorded in Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 278 nm (excitation slit width = 5 nm and emission slit width = 10 nm). The steady value of fluorescence emission at 340 nm with time indicated the absence of any potential photodegradation of the enzyme. All dissociation constants were evaluated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at different temperatures. In general temperatures were kept at or below 15 °C to avoid enzymatic cleavage of the substrate, InsP6 (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). During fluorescence titration, aliquots of the corresponding myo-inositol phosphate were added to a fixed concentration of phytase/tryptic fragment(s). Fluorescence emission spectra of the protein (λem = 300-450 nm and λex = 278 nm where λem indicates fluorescence emission wavelength) were monitored as a function of the input concentrations of ligand.During evaluation of the dissociation constant of phytase (or its tryptic fragment)-InsP6 interaction in the presence of InsP3, the enzyme was preincubated with 300 nmIns(1,4,5)/(2,4,5)P3 or 500 nmIns(1,3,4)P3 for 15 min at the experimental temperature, and then aliquots of InsP6 were added.Dissociation constant (Kd) for protein-substrate interaction was determined by means of nonlinear curve fitting of the experimental points based on the following equilibrium: L + P ⇔ L − P; where L and P denote the ligand and protein, respectively. Curve fitting was done according to Equations 1 and 2. Goodness of the fit was ascertained by least square analysis.Kd=Cp−(ΔF/ΔFmax)CpCl−(ΔF/ΔFmax)Cp/(ΔF/ΔFmax)CpEq. 1 Cp(ΔF/ΔFmax)2−(Cp+Cl+Kd)(ΔF/ΔFmax)+Cl=0Eq. 2 where ΔF is the change in fluorescence emission intensity at 340 nm after addition of each aliquot of the ligand to the protein; ΔFmax is the same parameter when the protein is totally bound to the ligand; Cl is the input concentration of the ligand; and Cp, the initial concentration of the protein. Double-reciprocal plot (1/ΔF versus 1/Cl, 17) was used for determination of ΔFmax using Equation3,1/ΔF=1/ΔFmax+Kd/ΔFmax(Cl)Eq. 3 As stated in a previous report (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), hydrolysis of InsP6 by phytase in the absence and presence of InsP3 is found to be insignificant at the experimental temperatures.Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out by recording fluorescence intensities at 340 nm (λex = 295 nm). Aliquots from a stock solution of a neutral quencher acrylamide were added successively to phytase (0.3 μm) preincubated with 300 nm Ins(1,4,5)P3 and 2 mmInsP6 for 15 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. Quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 258-297Google Scholar), Fo/F = 1 + Ksv[Q], where Foand F are the initial and final fluorescence intensities, respectively. Ksv is the quenching constant, and [Q] denotes the input concentration of acrylamide. A modified Stern-Volmer plot (19Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was also done to estimate the accessible (fe) fraction of tryptophan residues according to Equation 4,Fo/(Fo−F)=1/(Ksvfe[Q])+1/feEq. 4 For fluorescence studies with bis-ANS, it was dissolved in freshly distilled dimethyl sulfoxide. The concentration of the solution was determined from ε396 = 24,300m−1 cm−1. All fluorescence emission spectra (λem = 420–600 nm, λex = 399 nm) were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at 15 °C in a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer. Fluorimetric titrations were done by adding aliquots of bis-ANS to a fixed concentration of phytase (0.3 μm) under different conditions. The fluorescence value at 484 nm was recorded after it became steady. The value was corrected for fluorescence of bis-ANS alone in buffer and contribution of the buffer, if any.Filter Binding AssayIn general, radiolabeled InsP6/Ins(1,4,5)P3 was incubated with a fixed concentration of phytase or its tryptic fragment. The mixture was incubated under appropriate conditions of buffer and temperature. The temperature was kept low to avoid possible hydrolysis of the substrate by the enzyme (or its tryptic fragment). The incubation mixture was spotted onto Whatman GF/C filter paper, washed with the same buffer, dried, and counted. Nonspecific binding was checked in the presence of 10-fold excess of non-radioactive InsP6/Ins(1,4,5)P3.For evaluation of dissociation constant for phytase-InsP6interaction, different concentrations of [3H]InsP6 (specific activity, 2288 cpm/nmol) were incubated with phytase in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at 10 °C for 45 min. Specifically bound count was plotted as a function of input concentrations of InsP6 to construct the binding isotherm. The dissociation constant was calculated from the concentration of InsP6 corresponding to half of the bound counts/min.Binding of InsP6 to phytase was also checked after phytase was preincubated with InsP3. Phytase and Ins(1,4,5)/(2,4,5)P3 (300 nm) or Ins(1,3,4)P3 (500 nm) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, for 15 min at 4 °C. [3H]InsP6 (specific activity, 2288 cpm/nmol) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm. The normal filter binding assay was conducted, and specifically bound counts were determined.To determine stoichiometry of binding, phytase or its tryptic fragment was incubated with [32P]InsP6 (specific activity, 248 cpm/pmol) or [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3(specific activity, 110 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Moles of ligand bound were calculated from specifically bound counts (from the filter binding assay). The quotient of the ligand bound and input concentration of protein used gave the stoichiometry “n.”Dissociation constant for phytase or its tryptic fragment-Ins(1,4,5)P3 interaction at the high affinity site was determined by filter binding assay using [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 after incubating the components in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 10 °C for 1 h. The dissociation constant was calculated from the binding isotherm as explained above.Evaluation of Thermodynamic ParametersFree energy of the interaction, ΔG, was evaluated (20Castellan G.W. Physical Chemistry. Narosa Publishing House (Indian Student Edition), New Delhi, India1989: 277-294Google Scholar), using Equation 5,ΔG=−RT lnKaEq. 5 where the association constantKa=1/KdEq. 6 Ka determined at three different temperatures was used for calculation of the thermodynamic parameters. Changes in enthalpy [ΔH] and entropy [ΔS] were evaluated from van't Hoff plots of ln Ka against 1/T according to the Equations 6 and 7,lnKa=−ΔH/RT+ΔS/REq. 7 where R and T are universal gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively (10Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1929; 81: 629-636Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Preparation of Microsomes/Vacuoles and Assay of Ca2+ReleaseMicrosomes/vacuoles were prepared as reported earlier (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hypocotyls from 48-h germinating mung bean seeds were homogenized in buffer A containing 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.25m sucrose, 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 10 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone. The homogenate was passed through two layers of cheesecloth. It was then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 40 min, and the supernatant was finally centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the microsomes/vacuoles. This pellet was resuspended in buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 for Ca2+ uptake and release experiments. The concentration of the protein in the microsomal/vacuolar suspension was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Concentration of calcium was evaluated by using Ca2+indicator fluorescent dye Fura-2 (λem = 510 nm and λex = 340 nm) in a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer. For the evaluation of Ca2+ influx and efflux, microsomal/vacuolar suspension (260 μg/ml) in buffer (containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) was incubated at 20 °C with 3 mm NaN3 to prevent any mitochondrial uptake, Fura-2 (1 μm), and CaCl2 (100 μm). ATP was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to initiate the uptake of Ca2+ by the microsomes/vacuoles. Uptake was monitored from the decrease in fluorescence of Fura-2. After the process of uptake had reached equilibrium as indicated from absence of any fluorescence change, Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex with phytase/tryptic fragment(s) of phytase/equimolar mixture of two relevant tryptic fragments was added to stimulate Ca2+release. Calcium release was followed over a period of 20 s.Concentration of released Ca2+ was calculated from the following Equation 8 (21Mazorow D.L. Millar D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar),[Ca2+]=KdF−Fmin/Fmax−FEq. 8 where Kd (dissociation constant for Fura-2-Ca2+ interaction) = 135 nm (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 360: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar),Fmax, the maximum fluorescence of Fura-2 in presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and Fmin, the minimum fluorescence of Fura-2 in the presence of 5 mm EGTA. F is the fluorescence of Fura-2 upon addition of ATP or Ca2+-mobilizing agents.Amino Acid Sequencing and Homology SearchingConcentrated 5-kDa tryptic fragment was electrophoresed on a 20% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, protein was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and an automated protein sequenator (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to sequence about 12 amino acids from the N-terminal end. Homology search for the amino acid sequence was carried out using the Fasta-3 program (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9344) Google Scholar) with SWALL and SPTrEMBL as data bases (www.ebi.ac.uk). The upper expectation value (E value) was set at 1.0, and the lower expectation value was 1 ×e −6. Search for structural homology was carried out using CATH program (24Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FSSP search program (25Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe validity of the fluorescence method to evaluate the ligand binding potential of phytase and its tryptic fragments is indicated from the fact that the values obtained from this method agree well with the results from a more direct binding method using radiolabeled ligand(s). The experimental observations could be summed up to the following conclusions. Dual functions of phytase can be attributed to two different sites in the protein. That is why the dual functions could be dissected in two tryptic fragments each with one function. Restoration of both activities by mixing the two fragments further supports this. The effect of saturation of the high affinity site with myo-inositol trisphosphate upon the catalytic potential of phytase is reflected from change in two parameters, namely dissociation constant for the substrate, InsP6, and activity of the enzyme for the same substrate. The important and probably physiologically significant result is the demonstrated interaction between the two sites. We have also noticed that the interaction between the two sites is mutual. Another important observation follows from the homology search. They are discussed in detail below.Alteration in the affinity of phytase for the substrate, InsP6, upon saturation of the high affinity site with InsP3 is clearly indicated from Table I. A comparison of the energetics shown in Table II further corroborates the conclusion. Although the entropy-driven nature of the phytase-InsP6association remains unaltered, values of all associated thermodynamic parameters change. It might occur as a result of myo-inositol trisphosphate-induced conformational change in the enzyme. A change in conformation has been indicated from earlier reports. This was concluded from the observed decrease in tryptophan accessibility of phytase, when it is saturated with myo-inositol trisphosphate at the high affinity site. Results from the present study have thrown light on the nature of the change. The association alters the conformation such that there is a reduction in the hydrophobic pocket in native phytase. That is why the extent of binding to bis-ANS undergoes a reduction along with a decrease in the fluorescence emission intensity of the extrinsic fluorophore. The conformational change, however, does not lead to any alteration in the secondary structure of phytase, because the far-UV CD spectra of phytase does not change significantly upon addition of myo-inositol trisphosphates (figure not shown).The observed effect of the high affinity association upon the substrate binding potential of phytase is further substantiated by the kinetic data. It is clear that high affinity binding leads to an enhancement in the catalytic rate. Since the dephosphorylation reaction is sequential, we have restricted to a demonstration of the increase in apparent overall rate rather than a detailed analysis. These data support the conclusion that InsP3 acts as an activator of phytase. Whereas 300 nmIns(1,4,5)P3/Ins(2,4,5)P3 could activate the enzyme allosterically, 500 nm Ins(1,3,4)P3isomer could also induce the effect although to a lesser degree. This observation is consistent with the earlier reported trend in Ca2+ mobilization potentials of the three trisphosphate isomers (3Dasgupta S. Dasgupta D. Sen M. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).We have carried out a detailed characterization of the two binding sites. For that purpose, tryptic digestion of the enzyme was performed successfully to show that the two func"
