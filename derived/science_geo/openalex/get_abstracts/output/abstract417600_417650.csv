https://openalex.org/W1981098031,"IL-22 Protects the Thymus One of the side effects associated with radiation treatment and some types of chemotherapy is damage to the thymus. Immunological T cells develop in the thymus, and so damage to this organ results in immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to infectious disease. Although the organ eventually recovers, therapies that speed this recovery process are of interest. Dudakov et al. (p. 91 , published online 1 March; see the Perspective by Bhandoola and Artis ) now show in mice that interleukin-22 (IL-22) production in the thymus is increased in response to radiation damage and that this cytokine promotes thymic repair. After radiation treatment, IL-23 production by thymic dendritic cells induced IL-22 secretion by a population of radio-resistant innate lymphoid cells. IL-22 appeared to mediate its effects by promoting the survival and proliferation of thymic epithelial cells."

Models of the postglacial spread of boreal plants argue for dispersal from southern refugia; however, Parducci et al. (p. 1083 ) have shown that both spruce and pine were present in small ice-free regions of Scandinavia much earlier than thought. DNA haplotyping confirmed that a remnant mitochondrial type of spruce, once unique to Scandinavia, now lives alongside the more common spruce originating from Eastern Europe. Evidence from lake cores collected from central and northern Norway indicated the survival of conifers as early as 22,000 years before the present, when apart from ice-free pockets, most of Scandinavia was covered by ice."
https://openalex.org/W2018372594,"Shape-Shifting Signals Although orthogonal signaling systems seem to direct various developmental processes, few tissues remain in the same shape as they are at initiation to that of the final form. Arabidopsis leaves are free of the cell migrations that complicate animal development, and thus allowed Kuchen et al. (p. 1092 ) to track and model the trajectory of leaf growth under a variety of perturbations. Varying the values of parameters in their model produced outputs of different leaf shapes ranging from obcordate, ovate, and oval to elliptic, and offered predictions for genes that regulate the developmental process. The meristem at the growing tip of plants is home to stem cells and is the source of newly differentiating shoots and leaves. New leaves make their first appearance as bulges at the side of the dome-shaped meristem. Although these developmental events are under hormonal control, they also seem to be constrained by the physical properties of the meristem. Kierzkowski et al. (p. 1096 ) tested physical effects acting on the shoot apical meristem of growing tomato shoots that alter turgor pressure. Again, mathematical modeling combined with observations of plant tissue helped to define the different zones in the meristem that respond to diverse mechanical stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1994780933,"Waste Not The organic matter in wastewater is a potentially vast and sustainable energy source; however, most wastewater treatment plants consume energy. Cusick et al. (p. 1474 , published online 1 March) combined a microbial fuel cell with a reverse-electrodialysis system to boost the voltage output and the power density over a simple microbial fuel cell. The use of ammonium bicarbonate as a fuel for reverse electrodialysis while microorganisms simultaneously turn organic matter into electricity not only allows for the capturing of waste heat, but could eventually produce enough energy to offset the energy used in conventional wastewater treatment systems."
https://openalex.org/W1970363868,"A major challenge in biology is to understand how buds comprising a few cells can give rise to complex plant and animal appendages like leaves or limbs. We address this problem through a combination of time-lapse imaging, clonal analysis, and computational modeling. We arrive at a model that shows how leaf shape can arise through feedback between early patterns of oriented growth and tissue deformation. Experimental tests through partial leaf ablation support this model and allow reevaluation of previous experimental studies. Our model allows a range of observed leaf shapes to be generated and predicts observed clone patterns in different species. Thus, our experimentally validated model may underlie the development and evolution of diverse organ shapes."

https://openalex.org/W2087973518,"The Rho GTPase Rac regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization to form cell surface extensions (lamellipodia) required for cell migration/invasion during cancer metastasis. Rac hyperactivation and overexpression are associated with aggressive cancers; thus, interference of the interaction of Rac with its direct upstream activators, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), is a viable strategy for inhibiting Rac activity. We synthesized EHop-016, a novel inhibitor of Rac activity, based on the structure of the established Rac/Rac GEF inhibitor NSC23766. Herein, we demonstrate that EHop-016 inhibits Rac activity in the MDA-MB-435 metastatic cancer cells that overexpress Rac and exhibits high endogenous Rac activity. The IC(50) of 1.1 μM for Rac inhibition by EHop-016 is ∼100-fold lower than for NSC23766. EHop-016 is specific for Rac1 and Rac3 at concentrations of ≤5 μM. At higher concentrations, EHop-016 inhibits the close homolog Cdc42. In MDA-MB-435 cells that demonstrate high active levels of the Rac GEF Vav2, EHop-016 inhibits the association of Vav2 with a nucleotide-free Rac1(G15A), which has a high affinity for activated GEFs. EHop-016 also inhibits the Rac activity of MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells and reduces Rac-directed lamellipodia formation in both cell lines. EHop-016 decreases Rac downstream effects of PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) activity and directed migration of metastatic cancer cells. Moreover, at effective concentrations (<5 μM), EHop-016 does not affect the viability of transformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) and reduces viability of MDA-MB-435 cells by only 20%. Therefore, EHop-016 holds promise as a targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic cancers with high Rac activity."

Sulfa drugs target dihydropteroate synthase, a key enzyme in the bacterial folate pathway. By performing the reaction in the crystalline form of the enzyme, Yun et al. (p. 1110 ) have characterized the key structural intermediates. In combining structural data with theoretical and mutagenesis studies, they propose a detailed mechanism for dihydropteroate synthase catalysis. By resolving this structure with a sulfa drug bound to the enzyme, they showed how inhibition occurred and indicated how resistance could emerge."
https://openalex.org/W1999399962,"Diversity in Immune Adversity Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and has the potential to cause life-threatening infections. Many variants of this pathogen are recognized that have subtly different capsule (an external polysaccharide coat) structures, which prompt distinct immune responses from the host and allow classification of this pathogen into serotypes. A consistent pattern of multiple coexisting serotypes occurs in human populations. Cobey and Lipsitch (p. 1376 , published online 1 March) probed the mechanisms behind serotype coexistence by developing an ecological model and feeding it data from nasopharyngeal carriage studies."
https://openalex.org/W2026723397,"Accumulation of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide within the brain is hypothesized to be one of the main causes underlying the pathogenic events that occur in Alzheimer disease (AD). Consequently, identifying pathways by which Aβ is cleared from the brain is crucial for better understanding of the disease pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics. Cellular uptake and degradation by glial cells is one means by which Aβ may be cleared from the brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of Aβ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in Aβ uptake, whereas increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of Aβ. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of Aβ and facilitated the vesicular transport of Aβ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on Aβ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that Aβ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting that an interaction between LDLR and Aβ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated Aβ uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates Aβ uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial LDLR levels may promote Aβ degradation within the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2054714035,"Cold Dust Atmospheric dust affects air quality, air and ocean chemistry, ocean biology, and climate, so understanding its origins is important to many fields. Hot, dry, desert regions at low latitudes are well-understood sources, but the role of higher-latitude regions in dust production has not been considered. Prospero et al. (p. 1078 ) present a 6-year record of measurements made on an island south of Iceland, which revealed frequent episodes of dust-production associated with glacial outwash plains and outburst floods. Much of this dust is transported southward and deposited in the North Atlantic, making it a potentially important supply of iron to drive ocean production in that region."
https://openalex.org/W2056140158,"Building Blocks of Earth Earth formed from an explosive and energetic series of collisions that accreted material over millions of years. Comparisons between rocks from Earth's interior and more primitive extraterrestrial samples can help tease apart the composition of Earth's starting material; however, discrepancies between the abundance of certain elements or their isotope ratios often obscure their origin. Fitoussi and Bourdon (p. 1477 , published online 1 March) analyzed the silicon isotopes of a suite of rocks from chondritic meteorites and the Moon to reconcile some of the previous models. By tuning Earth accretion models to account for these Si isotope signatures, enstatite chondrites could be ruled out as the sole end-member composition for bulk Earth. Instead, a heterogeneous mixture of several types of chondritic meteorites is more likely."
https://openalex.org/W1993260746,"We have discovered that 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) inhibits binding of a PIP-box sequence peptide to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein by competing for the same binding site, as evidenced by the co-crystal structure of the PCNA-T3 complex at 2.1 Å resolution. Based on this observation, we have designed a novel, non-peptide small molecule PCNA inhibitor, T2 amino alcohol (T2AA), a T3 derivative that lacks thyroid hormone activity. T2AA inhibited interaction of PCNA/PIP-box peptide with an IC50 of ∼1 μm and also PCNA and full-length p21 protein, the tightest PCNA ligand protein known to date. T2AA abolished interaction of PCNA and DNA polymerase δ in cellular chromatin. De novo DNA synthesis was inhibited by T2AA, and the cells were arrested in S-phase. T2AA inhibited growth of cancer cells with induction of early apoptosis. Concurrently, Chk1 and RPA32 in the chromatin are phosphorylated, suggesting that T2AA causes DNA replication stress by stalling DNA replication forks. T2AA significantly inhibited translesion DNA synthesis on a cisplatin-cross-linked template in cells. When cells were treated with a combination of cisplatin and T2AA, a significant increase in phospho(Ser139)histone H2AX induction and cell growth inhibition was observed.

Numerous cancer drug discovery programs have targeted specific pathways mediated by oncogene products. Often these agents are not therapeutically efficacious in diverse cancers, presumably because tumors can be supported by multiple mechanisms (e.g. not “addictive” to the pathway targeted). This leads to failure of proof-of-concept validation in the cancer drug discovery programs. Such therapeutics have been proven successful for cancers if they are addictive to the pathway (1Weinstein I.B. Joe A.K. Mechanisms of disease. Oncogene addiction. A rationale for molecular targeting in cancer therapy.Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2006; 3: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). However, there is a high risk of resistance based on mutation of the pathway components targeted, as seen in mutations of BCR-ABL by imatinib (2Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L.

In contrast, therapeutics targeting non-oncogenic mediators that ubiquitously support cancers, such as histone deacetylase, heat-shock proteins, ubiquitin ligase, spliceosome, and proteasome, have been successful (4Luo J.

Several translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases also interact with PCNA (6Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Given its diverse functions, PCNA is regarded as one of the essential non-oncogenic mediators supporting cancer growth (9Stoimenov I. Helleday T. PCNA on the crossroad of cancer.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); therefore, inhibitors of PCNA could be useful for cancer therapeutics. Although post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, emerged as important for PCNA functions (10Acharya N. Yoon J.H. Gali H. Unk I. Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Roles of PCNA-binding and ubiquitin-binding domains in human DNA polymerase eta in translesion DNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pfander B. Jentsch S. PCNA, the maestro of the replication fork.Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Thus, the PCNA/PIP-box interaction is absolutely essential for many PCNA functions, and consequently compounds inhibiting this interaction can be expected to inhibit PCNA functions. In this study, we have created a small molecular inhibitor of the PCNA/PIP-box interaction and investigated its pharmacological effects in cells from a chemotherapeutic viewpoint. proliferating cell nuclear antigen cytoskeletal phospho(Ser139)histone H2AX nucleotide excision repair PCNA-interacting protein box T2 amino alcohol ((S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diiodophenoxy)phenol) 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine translesion DNA synthesis thyroid hormone receptor 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside fluorescence polarization interdomain connecting loop Polϵ, and Polη, polymerase δ, ϵ, and η, respectively.

Briefly, 20 μl of the assay solution was transferred into each well of a black 384-well plate using Wellmate (Matrix). Twenty nanoliters of the test compounds in DMSO solution were pin-transferred (V&P Scientific) by Biomek (Beckman Coulter) into the PCNA-PL solution in triplicate to give a final drug concentration of 10 μm in each well. The negative control in each plate was DMSO, whereas the positive control was unlabeled PL-peptide as a self-competitor. After 30 min, the fluorescence was read using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 485-nm excitation (20-nm bandpass) and 535-nm emission (20-nm bandpass) filters and the supplied 510-nm dichroic mirror. FP values were calculated in millipolarization units. All data processing was performed using in-house programs in the Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys, version 7.0.1). The quality of the primary screen was assessed by Z-prime and other screening quality metrics. 91 compounds (0.24% hit rate) showing >40% decrease in fluorescence polarization were further validated by establishing dose response (10 μm to 0.5 μm final concentration) in triplicate using a freshly prepared batch of each compound in at least two different FP buffers. Among compounds giving regenerative saturating sigmoidal dose-response curves, T3 was selected for validation in this study. Human PCNA was overexpressed and purified by a procedure similar to that previously reported (12Hishiki A. Shimizu T. Serizawa A. Ohmori H. Sato M. Hashimoto H. Crystallographic study of G178S mutant of human proliferating cell nuclear antigen.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 819-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystals of PCNA-T3 complex were obtained by sitting-drop vapor diffusion methods by mixing of equal volumes of protein solution (9 mg/ml PCNA, 1 mm T3, 9 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, and 10% DMSO) and a reservoir solution (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate). Cubic crystals were obtained in several days at 293 K. Prior to x-ray diffraction experiments, crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution containing 20% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data were collected under N2 gas steam (100 K) at Photon Factory beamline BL-5A. Diffraction data were processed using the program HKL2000. The structure of the PCNA-T3 complex was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP. Model building was performed with the program COOT. Structure refinement was performed with the programs CNS and REFMAC. The geometries of the final structure were validated with the program PROCHECK.

A His protein interaction pull-down kit (Thermo Scientific) was used, in which a 4:1 mixture of TBS and lysis buffer provided in the kit was used as the buffer throughout. For immobilizing p21, 100 μg of p21His6 was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl (50% suspension) of prewashed cobalt chelate resin in 500 μl of the buffer and washed with the buffer four times. Separately, PCNA (500 nm) in 500 μl of the buffer was mixed with the indicated final concentration of T2AA and transferred to the p21-immobilized resin. After the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C, the resin was washed with buffer four times, and the bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of the buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. Each 10 μl of the eluted samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Oriole fluorescent gel stain (Bio-Rad) and a FluorChem imager (Alpha Innotech). The cells treated as indicated were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected in a spin tube, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor mixture and Halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific) using approximately twice the volume of the cell pellet on ice for 0.5 h. Protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Normalized amounts of samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE as indicated and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with SuperBlock buffer (Thermo Scientific) and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in SuperBlock at 4 °C overnight, rinsed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 three times for 10 min, incubated with the corresponding secondary IgG-HRP conjugate in SuperBlock at room temperature for 1 h, and rinsed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min. Proteins probed on the membrane were visualized by chemiluminescence using WestPico reagent (Thermo Scientific) and developed on BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The cells were treated with drugs as indicated in a black (transparent flat bottom) 384-well or 96-well plate. Cellular viability was determined by using Alamar Blue reagent (Invitrogen) on an EnVision plate reader according to the manufacturer's recommendations and normalized with signal from wells of DMSO treatment = 100% and of no cells = 0%. Cells grown on a coverslip were incubated with the indicated concentrations of T2AA for 24 h at 37 °C, rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, pre-extracted with ice-cold CSK buffer (100 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose) containing 0.3% Triton X-100, Halt protease inhibitor mixture and Halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific) for 5 min on ice, and rinsed once with the CSK buffer to remove Triton X-100 from the specimens. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed three times with PBS for 5 min each, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, and rinsed once with PBS for 5 min. The specimens were blocked with PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.03% Triton X-100 for 60 min, applied anti-PCNA antibody (1:3200) and anti-Polδ3 antibody (2.9 μg/ml) or anti-phospho(Ser33)RPA32 antibody (4.0 μg/ml) in antibody buffer (PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.03% Triton X-100), incubated overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C, and rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min each at room temperature. The specimens were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) antibody (1:500) in the antibody buffer for 2 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature in the dark, rinsed once with PBS for 5 min, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) antibody (1:500) in the antibody buffer for 2 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature in the dark, and rinsed three times with PBS for 5 min. The coverslips were mounted in VectaShield containing DAPI at 1 μg/ml (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence imaging for chromatin was performed on a C1Si microscope (Nikon) with a Cascade 512B photomultiplier (Photometrics). Images were processed using EZC1 (Nikon) and Photoshop (Adobe) software. Phospho-Chk1 and γH2AX staining was performed in the same manner except using anti-phospho(Ser345)Chk1 antibody (1:50) or anti-phospho(Ser139)histone H2AX antibody (1:500) and omitting the pre-extraction and methanol treatment steps. DNA replication in U2OS and/or HeLa cells were analyzed by the rates of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation by a method reported previously (13Taddei A. Roche D. Sibarita J.B. Turner B.M. Almouzni G. Duplication and maintenance of heterochromatin domains.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells were propagated at a subconfluent density onto a coverslip in a 6-well culture plate the day before the assay. Cells were treated with T2AA for 24 h at the indicated concentrations. During the last 15 min in the incubation period, BrdU was added at a concentration of 10 μm. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, cells were treated with 4 n hydrochloric acid for 10 min and extensively rinsed with PBS. After blocking cells with 3% FBS in PBS for 20 min, anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml; clone 44, BD Pharmingen) was added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min each. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min each and mounted in VectaShield containing DAPI (1 μg/ml). Fluorescence microscopy was done on an E800 microscope (Nikon) with a DXM1120 digital camera (Nikon). Images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe). For quantitative analyses, BrdU incorporation was measured with the APC BrdU Flow Kit (BD Pharmingen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were pulsed with 20 μm BrdU 15 min before harvesting. The populations of BrdU-positive cells (a) and mean BrdU intensity in S-phase cells (b) were recorded. Total BrdU incorporation was defined as a × b. For cell cycle analysis, cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/well of 6-well plates in 2 ml of medium, treated with drugs as indicated, trypsin-lifted, washed once with PBS, suspended in propidium iodide (PI) solution (0.05 mg/ml), and treated with ribonuclease A (2 μg/ml; Calbiochem) at room temperature for 30 min. For apoptosis analysis, cells were cultured at 1 × 105 cells/well of 12-well plates in 1 ml of medium and treated with drugs as indicated. Dead cells detached in the medium were recovered by centrifuge, and live cells attached on the wells were lifted by trypsin. Both dead and live cells were combined and washed once with PBS, and the number of cells in each sample was adjusted to 1–3 × 105. The cells were stained with Annexin-V-FITC reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendation, followed by staining with PI. For γH2AX staining, cells were cultured at 4 × 105 cells/well of 12-well plates in 1 ml of medium, treated with drugs as indicated, trypsin-lifted and stained by using the FlowCellect H2A.X DNA Damage kit (FCCH025142, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All samples were filtered through 40-μm nylon mesh prior to running flow cytometry. The flow data were acquired using an LSRII flow cytometer equipped with 405-, 488-, 561-, and 640-nm lasers (BD Biosciences). The cisplatin-modified plasmid was constructed, and the TLS assay was performed as previously described (14Sawai T. Kawanishi M. Takamura-Enya T. Yagi T. Establishment of a method for analyzing translesion synthesis across a single bulky adduct in human cells.Genes Environ. 2009; 31: 24-30Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, two oligonucleotides, 5′-GGGAGATCTGGAAGGATCTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCAGATCCTTCCAGATCTCCC-3′, were annealed and inserted between the sites of EcoRV and EcoRI in pUCSV40H. The resultant plasmid was designated as pUCSV40H+BglII. A 13-mer oligonucleotide modified with a 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) platinum cross-link (Pt-GTG) was prepared as described previously (15Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Assaying for the dual incisions of nucleotide excision repair using DNA with a lesion at a specific site.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 314: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This oligonucleotide has the cross-link at the underlined site of 5′-CCTTCGTGCTCCC-3′. An unmodified 13-mer oligonucleotide was used for the construction of control plasmid. These oligonucleotides were purified with HPLC and PAGE. To form a gapped duplex plasmid, pUCSV40H and pUCSV40H+BglII were digested with EcoRV and ScaI, respectively, mixed, and incubated as described previously (14Sawai T. Kawanishi M. Takamura-Enya T. Yagi T. Establishment of a method for analyzing translesion synthesis across a single bulky adduct in human cells.Genes Environ. 2009; 31: 24-30Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The gapped duplex plasmid was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of the purified 13-mer oligonucleotide, which is complementary to the gap sequence except for a bulge in the middle in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 16 °C for 6 min. The covalently closed circle plasmid was purified with equilibrium centrifugation on a CsCl gradient. The plasmids with and without the cisplatin adduct are hereafter referred to as Pt-GTG and Mock-GTG, respectively. For cellular TLS assay, nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient XP2OS(SV40) cells (16Kawanishi M. Enya T. Suzuki H. Takebe H. Matsui S. Yagi T. Mutagenic specificity of a derivative of 3-nitrobenzanthrone in the supF shuttle vector plasmids.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1468-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were used to avoid elimination of the cross-link by NER. The cells were transfected with Pt-GTG or Mock-GTG plasmid (150 ng) using a Qiagen Effectene Reagent kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) as described previously (14Sawai T. Kawanishi M. Takamura-Enya T. Yagi T. Establishment of a method for analyzing translesion synthesis across a single bulky adduct in human cells.Genes Environ. 2009; 31: 24-30Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the cells were exposed to 5 μm T2AA or 0.25% DMSO (as solvent control) for 48 h. The plasmids were extracted from the cells by using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), digested with the restriction endonuclease DpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove the unreplicated plasmids, and introduced into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The E. coli was plated onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin, X-gal, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. In this system, if the cisplatin-modified strand was replicated as a template (i.e. TLS), the reading frame of the lacZ gene of progeny plasmids would be functional; hence, E. coli colonies became blue. If the opposite strand was replicated (i.e. damage-induced strand loss), progeny plasmids would have a dysfunctional reading frame of the lacZ gene; hence, E. coli colonies showed a white color. Therefore, TLS frequency (%) was defined as (number of blue colonies/number of total colonies) × 100. We have established a high-throughput screening protocol to find agents that inhibit biochemical PCNA/PIP-box interactions. This method uses conventional FP for screening chemical libraries by competing the binding of recombinant PCNA protein and fluorescently tagged PL-peptide that possesses a PIP-box sequence, which was previously optimized for high PCNA affinity (IC50 of ∼100 nm in self-competition; data not shown) (11Kontopidis G. Wu S.Y. Zheleva D.I. Taylor P. McInnes C. Lane D.P. Fischer P.M. Walkinshaw M.D. Structural and biochemical studies of human proliferating cell nuclear antigen complexes provide a rationale for cyclin association and inhibitor design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1871-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have screened ∼38,000 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs and those with known biological activity, and then carefully verified initial hits. After eliminating nonspecific compounds by establishing dose-response curves for the hit compounds with at least two independent experiments, we have ensured that T3 (Fig. 1A) is a true inhibitor of PCNA/PL-peptide binding at IC50 of ∼3 μm (Fig. 1C). To further determine if T3 is binding to the bona fide PIP-box interaction site of PCNA or an allosteric site to trigger conformational change that leads to abolishing PCNA/PL-peptide interaction, we have solved the co-crystal structure of the PCNA-T3 complex (Fig. 2A; the detailed interactions of T3 with PCNA amino acids are depicted in Fig. 2C). T3 binds to the same PCNA cavity that PIP-box protein sequences tightly bind, by inducing an additional binding cavity with allosteric movement of the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) of PCNA. This IDCL movement around the cavity is unique to the PCNA-T3 complex and is not observed in other PCNA complex structures reported to date (Fig. 2B). This suggests that IDCL has a role in accommodating ligands with additional interactions. Indeed, 3,3′-diiodothyronine, a T3 derivative, showed remarkably lower affinity than that of T3 (data not shown). This is presumably because the 5-iodine atom is missing, and thus it disables the induction of the IDCL movement. T3 is a very potent thyroid hormone, and this property precludes its use as a PCNA inhibitor. The carboxylic acid and 3′-iodine of T3 is essential for its thyroid hormone activity (17Leeson P.D. Ellis D. Emmett J.C. Shah V.P. Showell G.A. Underwood A.H. Thyroid hormone analogues. Synthesis of 3′-substituted 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronines and quantitative structure-activity studies of in vitro and in vivo thyromimetic activities in rat liver and heart.J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the PCNA-T3 crystal structure, the 3′-iodine atom of T3 is positioned out from the cavity (Fig. 2A), suggesting that it is dispensable for binding. Therefore, we have created a T3 derivative compound in which the carboxylic acid of T3 is replaced by an alcohol and the 3′-iodine is removed. The new compound T2AA (Fig. 1A) showed almost no thyroid hormone activity in a TR reporter assay (Fig. 1B) but inhibited the PCNA/PL-peptide binding at an IC50 value of ∼1 μm, a slightly better potency than that of T3 (Fig. 1C). We next investigated if T2AA can inhibit PCNA interaction with a full-length protein. p21 is a protein containing a PIP-box with the highest affinity to PCNA known to date (5Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. PCNA, the maestro of the replication fork.Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Thus, if T2AA can inhibit PCNA-p21 interaction, theoretically T2AA can perturb any PCNA/PIP-box protein interactions in cells. A pull-down assay was carried out by using recombinant p21 protein immobilized on cobalt beads. PCNA protein was incubated with it in the presence of T3 or T2AA. They diminished the intensity of the PCNA band on the immobi"

The basic model, supported by centuries of chemical theory and experiment, invokes a series of internal rearrangements that lead to a fleeting high-energy transition-state geometry from which lower-energy products emerge. Over the past decade, several molecules have been shown to manifest a competing dissociation mechanism such that alongside trajectories that pass through the transition state, there are energetically accessible pathways that roam around it. Grubb et al. (p. 1075 ; see the Perspective by Jordan and Kable ) showed that the light-induced reaction of NO 3 to form NO and O 2 proceeded exclusively by roaming. Although there are distinct pathways to the products in two different electronic states, neither one passes through a conventional transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2050658429,"Motivation Accurate identification of peptides binding to specific Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC-II) molecules is of great importance for elucidating the underlying mechanism of immune recognition, as well as for developing effective epitope-based vaccines and promising immunotherapies for many severe diseases. Due to extreme polymorphism of MHC-II alleles and the high cost of biochemical experiments, the development of computational methods for accurate prediction of binding peptides of MHC-II molecules, particularly for the ones with few or no experimental data, has become a topic of increasing interest. TEPITOPE is a well-used computational approach because of its good interpretability and relatively high performance. However, TEPITOPE can be applied to only 51 out of over 700 known HLA DR molecules. Method We have developed a new method, called TEPITOPEpan, by extrapolating from the binding specificities of HLA DR molecules characterized by TEPITOPE to those uncharacterized. First, each HLA-DR binding pocket is represented by amino acid residues that have close contact with the corresponding peptide binding core residues. Then the pocket similarity between two HLA-DR molecules is calculated as the sequence similarity of the residues. Finally, for an uncharacterized HLA-DR molecule, the binding specificity of each pocket is computed as a weighted average in pocket binding specificities over HLA-DR molecules characterized by TEPITOPE. Result The performance of TEPITOPEpan has been extensively evaluated using various data sets from different viewpoints: predicting MHC binding peptides, identifying HLA ligands and T-cell epitopes and recognizing binding cores. Among the four state-of-the-art competing pan-specific methods, for predicting binding specificities of unknown HLA-DR molecules, TEPITOPEpan was roughly the second best method next to NETMHCIIpan-2.0. Additionally, TEPITOPEpan achieved the best performance in recognizing binding cores. We further analyzed the motifs detected by TEPITOPEpan, examining the corresponding literature of immunology. Its online server and PSSMs therein are available at http://www.biokdd.fudan.edu.cn/Service/TEPITOPEpan/."
https://openalex.org/W2028571879,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nonstructural protein 1(NS1) attenuates type-I interferon (IFN) production during RSV infection; however the precise role of RSV NS1 protein in orchestrating the early host-virus interaction during infection is poorly understood. Since NS1 constitutes the first RSV gene transcribed and the production of IFN depends upon RLR (RIG-I-like receptor) signaling, we reasoned that NS1 may interfere with this signaling. Herein, we report that NS1 is localized to mitochondria and binds to mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Live-cell imaging of rgRSV-infected A549 human epithelial cells showed that RSV replication and transcription occurs in proximity to mitochondria. NS1 localization to mitochondria was directly visualized by confocal microscopy using a cell-permeable chemical probe for His6-NS1. Further, NS1 colocalization with MAVS in A549 cells infected with RSV was shown by confocal laser microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy. NS1 protein is present in the mitochondrial fraction and co-immunoprecipitates with MAVS in total cell lysatesof A549 cells transfected with the plasmid pNS1-Flag. By immunoprecipitation with anti-RIG-I antibody, RSV NS1 was shown to associate with MAVS at an early stage of RSV infection, and to disrupt MAVS interaction with RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene) and the downstream IFN antiviral and inflammatory response. Together, these results demonstrate that NS1 binds to MAVS and that this binding inhibits the MAVS-RIG-I interaction required for IFN production."
https://openalex.org/W2116184599,"Recurrent outbreaks of a disease in pond-cultured juvenile and subadult Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp in several districts in China remain an important problem in recent years. The disease was characterized by “white tail” and generally accompanied by mass mortalities. Based on data from the microscopical analyses, PCR detection and 16S rRNA sequencing, a new Vibrio harveyi strain (designated as strain HLB0905) was identified as the etiologic pathogen. The bacterial isolation and challenge tests demonstrated that the HLB0905 strain was nonluminescent but highly virulent. It could cause mass mortality in affected shrimp during a short time period with a low dose of infection. Meanwhile, the histopathological and electron microscopical analysis both showed that the HLB0905 strain could cause severe fiber cell damages and striated muscle necrosis by accumulating in the tail muscle of L. vannamei shrimp, which led the affected shrimp to exhibit white or opaque lesions in the tail. The typical sign was closely similar to that caused by infectious myonecrosis (IMN), white tail disease (WTD) or penaeid white tail disease (PWTD). To differentiate from such diseases as with a sign of “white tail” but of non-bacterial origin, the present disease was named as “bacterial white tail disease (BWTD)”. Present study revealed that, just like IMN and WTD, BWTD could also cause mass mortalities in pond-cultured shrimp. These results suggested that some bacterial strains are changing themselves from secondary to primary pathogens by enhancing their virulence in current shrimp aquaculture system."

https://openalex.org/W2046346070,"Aeromonas species are common inhabitants of aquatic environments giving rise to infections in both fish and humans. Identification of aeromonads to the species level is problematic and complex due to their phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity.Aeromonas hydrophila or Aeromonas sp were genetically re-identified using a combination of previously published methods targeting GCAT, 16S rDNA and rpoD genes. Characterization based on the genus specific GCAT-PCR showed that 94 (96%) of the 98 strains belonged to the genus Aeromonas. Considering the patterns obtained for the 94 isolates with the 16S rDNA-RFLP identification method, 3 clusters were recognised, i.e. A. caviae (61%), A. hydrophila (17%) and an unknown group (22%) with atypical RFLP restriction patterns. However, the phylogenetic tree constructed with the obtained rpoD sequences showed that 47 strains (50%) clustered with the sequence of the type strain of A. aquariorum, 18 (19%) with A. caviae, 16 (17%) with A. hydrophila, 12 (13%) with A. veronii and one strain (1%) with the type strain of A. trota. PCR investigation revealed the presence of 10 virulence genes in the 94 isolates as: lip (91%), exu (87%), ela (86%), alt (79%), ser (77%), fla (74%), aer (72%), act (43%), aexT (24%) and ast (23%).This study emphasizes the importance of using more than one method for the correct identification of Aeromonas strains. The sequences of the rpoD gene enabled the unambiguous identication of the 94 Aeromonas isolates in accordance with results of other recent studies. Aeromonas aquariorum showed to be the most prevalent species (50%) containing an important subset of virulence genes lip/alt/ser/fla/aer. Different combinations of the virulence genes present in the isolates indicate their probable role in the pathogenesis of Aeromonas infections."
https://openalex.org/W1996517171,"Glutathione (GSH) dysregulation at the gene, protein, and functional levels has been observed in schizophrenia patients. Together with disease-like anomalies in GSH deficit experimental models, it suggests that such redox dysregulation can play a critical role in altering neural connectivity and synchronization, and thus possibly causing schizophrenia symptoms. To determine whether increased GSH levels would modulate EEG synchronization, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, was administered to patients in a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol for 60 days, followed by placebo for another 60 days (or vice versa). We analyzed whole-head topography of the multivariate phase synchronization (MPS) for 128-channel resting-state EEGs that were recorded at the onset, at the point of crossover, and at the end of the protocol. In this proof of concept study, the treatment with NAC significantly increased MPS compared to placebo over the left parieto-temporal, the right temporal, and the bilateral prefrontal regions. These changes were robust both at the group and at the individual level. Although MPS increase was observed in the absence of clinical improvement at a group level, it correlated with individual change estimated by Liddle's disorganization scale. Therefore, significant changes in EEG synchronization induced by NAC administration may precede clinically detectable improvement, highlighting its possible utility as a biomarker of treatment efficacy.

https://openalex.org/W2049832349,"TWINKLE is a nucleus-encoded human mitochondrial (mt)DNA helicase. Point mutations in TWINKLE are associated with heritable neuromuscular diseases characterized by deletions in the mtDNA. To understand the biochemical basis of these diseases, it is important to define the roles of TWINKLE in mtDNA metabolism by studying its enzymatic activities. To this end, we purified native TWINKLE from Escherichia coli. The recombinant TWINKLE assembles into hexamers and higher oligomers, and addition of MgUTP stabilizes hexamers over higher oligomers. Probing into the DNA unwinding activity, we discovered that the efficiency of unwinding is greatly enhanced in the presence of a heterologous single strand-binding protein or a single-stranded (ss) DNA that is complementary to the unwound strand. We show that TWINKLE, although a helicase, has an antagonistic activity of annealing two complementary ssDNAs that interferes with unwinding in the absence of gp2.5 or ssDNA trap. Furthermore, only ssDNA and not double-stranded (ds)DNA competitively inhibits the annealing activity, although both DNAs bind with high affinities. This implies that dsDNA binds to a site that is distinct from the ssDNA-binding site that promotes annealing. Fluorescence anisotropy competition binding experiments suggest that TWINKLE has more than one ssDNA-binding sites, and we speculate that a surface-exposed ssDNA-specific site is involved in catalyzing DNA annealing. We propose that the strand annealing activity of TWINKLE may play a role in recombination-mediated replication initiation found in the mitochondria of mammalian brain and heart or in replication fork regression during repair of damaged DNA replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2091385951,"Two classes of F420-dependent reductases (FDR-A and FDR-B) that can reduce aflatoxins and thereby degrade them have previously been isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis. One class, the FDR-A enzymes, has up to 100 times more activity than the other. F420 is a cofactor with a low reduction potential that is largely confined to the Actinomycetales and some Archaea and Proteobacteria. We have heterologously expressed ten FDR-A enzymes from diverse Actinomycetales, finding that nine can also use F420H2 to reduce aflatoxin. Thus FDR-As may be responsible for the previously observed degradation of aflatoxin in other Actinomycetales. The one FDR-A enzyme that we found not to reduce aflatoxin belonged to a distinct clade (herein denoted FDR-AA), and our subsequent expression and analysis of seven other FDR-AAs from M. smegmatis found that none could reduce aflatoxin. Certain FDR-A and FDR-B enzymes that could reduce aflatoxin also showed activity with coumarin and three furanocoumarins (angelicin, 8-methoxysporalen and imperatorin), but none of the FDR-AAs tested showed any of these activities. The shared feature of the compounds that were substrates was an α,β-unsaturated lactone moiety. This moiety occurs in a wide variety of otherwise recalcitrant xenobiotics and antibiotics, so the FDR-As and FDR-Bs may have evolved to harness the reducing power of F420 to metabolise such compounds. Mass spectrometry on the products of the FDR-catalyzed reduction of coumarin and the other furanocoumarins shows their spontaneous hydrolysis to multiple products."
https://openalex.org/W1979775113,"HemaMax, a recombinant human interleukin-12 (IL-12), is under development to address an unmet medical need for effective treatments against acute radiation syndrome due to radiological terrorism or accident when administered at least 24 hours after radiation exposure. This study investigated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of m-HemaMax (recombinant murine IL-12), and HemaMax to increase survival after total body irradiation (TBI) in mice and rhesus monkeys, respectively, with no supportive care. In mice, m-HemaMax at an optimal 20 ng/mouse dose significantly increased percent survival and survival time when administered 24 hours after TBI between 8–9 Gy (p<0.05 Pearson's chi-square test). This survival benefit was accompanied by increases in plasma interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and erythropoietin levels, recovery of femoral bone hematopoiesis characterized with the presence of IL-12 receptor β2 subunit–expressing myeloid progenitors, megakaryocytes, and osteoblasts. Mitigation of jejunal radiation damage was also examined. At allometrically equivalent doses, HemaMax showed similar pharmacokinetics in rhesus monkeys compared to m-HemaMax in mice, but more robustly increased plasma IFN-γ levels. HemaMax also increased plasma erythropoietin, IL-15, IL-18, and neopterin levels. At non-human primate doses pharmacologically equivalent to murine doses, HemaMax (100 ng/Kg and 250 ng/Kg) administered at 24 hours after TBI (6.7 Gy/LD50/30) significantly increased percent survival of HemaMax groups compared to vehicle (p<0.05 Pearson's chi-square test). This survival benefit was accompanied by a significantly higher leukocyte (neutrophils and lymphocytes), thrombocyte, and reticulocyte counts during nadir (days 12–14) and significantly less weight loss at day 12 compared to vehicle. These findings indicate successful interspecies dose conversion and provide proof of concept that HemaMax increases survival in irradiated rhesus monkeys by promoting hematopoiesis and recovery of immune functions and possibly gastrointestinal functions, likely through a network of interactions involving dendritic cells, osteoblasts, and soluble factors such as IL-12, IFN-γ, and cytoprotectant erythropoietin."
https://openalex.org/W2119585270,"Background COUP-TF interacting protein 2 [(Ctip2), also known as Bcl11b] is an important regulator of skin homeostasis, and is overexpressed in head and neck cancer. Ctip2ep−/− mice, selectively ablated for Ctip2 in epidermal keratinocytes, exhibited impaired terminal differentiation and delayed epidermal permeability barrier (EPB) establishment during development, similar to what was observed in Ctip2 null (Ctip2−/−) mice. Considering that as an important role of Ctip2, and the fact that molecular networks which underlie cancer progression partially overlap with those responsible for tissue remodeling, we sought to determine the role of Ctip2 during cutaneous wound healing. Methodology/Principal Findings Full thickness excisional wound healing experiments were performed on Ctip2L2/L2 and Ctip2ep−/− animals per time point and used for harvesting samples for histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblotting. Results demonstrated inherent defects in proliferation and migration of Ctip2 lacking keratinocytes during re-epithelialization. Mutant mice exhibited reduced epidermal proliferation, delayed keratinocyte activation, altered cell-cell adhesion and impaired ECM development. Post wounding, Ctip2ep−/− mice wounds displayed lack of E-Cadherin suppression in the migratory tongue, insufficient expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) in the dermis, and robust induction of K8. Importantly, dysregulated expression of several hair follicle (HF) stem cell markers such as K15, NFATc1, CD133, CD34 and Lrig1 was observed in mutant skin during wound repair. Conclusions/Significance Results confirm a cell autonomous role of keratinocytic Ctip2 to modulate cell migration, proliferation and/or differentiation, and to maintain HF stem cells during cutaneous wounding. Furthermore, Ctip2 in a non-cell autonomous manner regulated granulation tissue formation and tissue contraction during wound closure."

https://openalex.org/W2028228502,"Fibroblasts from the fro/fro mouse, with a deletion in the Smpd3 gene coding for the active site of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSMase2), secreted increased amounts of hyaluronan (HA). This was reversed by transfection with the Smpd3 gene, suggesting a connection between sphingolipid and glycosaminoglycan metabolism. The deficiency of NSMase2 resulted in storage of sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol with a 50% reduction in ceramides (Cer). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that increased HA secretion resulted from increased hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) activity localized to sphingolipid-enriched lipid rafts. Although cholesterol levels were also elevated in lipid rafts from mouse fibroblasts deficient in lysosomal acid SMase activity (deletion of the Smpd1−/− gene), there was no increase in HA secretion. We then showed that in fro/fro fibroblasts, the reduced ceramide was associated with decreased phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and increased phosphorylation of its substrate Akt-p, together with PI3K, PDK1, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), and p70S6K, although PTEN was unaffected. Exogenous ceramide, as well as inhibitors of Akt (Akt inhibitor VIII), PI 3-kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin), and mTOR (rapamycin) reduced secretion of HA, whereas the NSMase2 inhibitor GW4869 increased HA synthesis and secretion. We propose that NSMase2/Cer are the key mediators of the regulation of HA synthesis, via microdomains and the Akt/mTOR pathway. Fibroblasts from the fro/fro mouse, with a deletion in the Smpd3 gene coding for the active site of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSMase2), secreted increased amounts of hyaluronan (HA). This was reversed by transfection with the Smpd3 gene, suggesting a connection between sphingolipid and glycosaminoglycan metabolism. The deficiency of NSMase2 resulted in storage of sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol with a 50% reduction in ceramides (Cer). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that increased HA secretion resulted from increased hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) activity localized to sphingolipid-enriched lipid rafts. Although cholesterol levels were also elevated in lipid rafts from mouse fibroblasts deficient in lysosomal acid SMase activity (deletion of the Smpd1−/− gene), there was no increase in HA secretion. We then showed that in fro/fro fibroblasts, the reduced ceramide was associated with decreased phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and increased phosphorylation of its substrate Akt-p, together with PI3K, PDK1, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), and p70S6K, although PTEN was unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2064092874,"Black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) feed on blood, and are important vectors of Onchocerca volvulus, the etiolytic agent of River Blindness. Blood feeding depends on pharmacological properties of saliva, including anticoagulation, but the molecules responsible for this activity have not been well characterized.Two Kunitz family proteins, SV-66 and SV-170, were identified in the sialome of the black fly Simulium vittatum. As Kunitz proteins are inhibitors of serine proteases, we hypothesized that SV-66 and/or -170 were involved in the anticoagulant activity of black fly saliva. Our results indicated that recombinant (r) SV-66 but not rSV-170 inhibited plasma coagulation. Mutational analysis suggested that SV-66 is a canonical BPTI-like inhibitor. Functional assays indicated that rSV66 reduced the activity of ten serine proteases, including several involved in mammalian coagulation. rSV-66 most strongly inhibited the activity of Factor Xa, elastase, and cathepsin G, exhibited lesser inhibitory activity against Factor IXa, Factor XIa, and plasmin, and exhibited no activity against Factor XIIa and thrombin. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated that rSV-66 bound with highest affinity to elastase (K(D) = 0.4 nM) and to the active site of FXa (K(D) = 3.07 nM). We propose the name ""Simukunin"" for this novel protein.We conclude that Simukunin preferentially inhibits Factor Xa. The inhibition of elastase and cathepsin G further suggests this protein may modulate inflammation, which could potentially affect pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2048106728,"The small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays a spectrum of DNA damage responses similar to humans. In order to identify new DNA damage response genes, we isolated in a forward genetic screen 14 new mutations conferring hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. We present here our characterization of lem-3, one of the genes identified in this screen. LEM-3 contains a LEM domain and a GIY nuclease domain. We confirm that LEM-3 has DNase activity in vitro. lem-3(lf) mutants are hypersensitive to various types of DNA damage, including ionizing radiation, UV-C light and crosslinking agents. Embryos from irradiated lem-3 hermaphrodites displayed severe defects during cell division, including chromosome mis-segregation and anaphase bridges. The mitotic defects observed in irradiated lem-3 mutant embryos are similar to those found in baf-1 (barrier-to-autointegration factor) mutants. The baf-1 gene codes for an essential and highly conserved protein known to interact with the other two C. elegans LEM domain proteins, LEM-2 and EMR-1. We show that baf-1, lem-2, and emr-1 mutants are also hypersensitive to DNA damage and that loss of lem-3 sensitizes baf-1 mutants even in the absence of DNA damage. Our data suggest that BAF-1, together with the LEM domain proteins, plays an important role following DNA damage - possibly by promoting the reorganization of damaged chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2082622548,"Macrophages are well known long-lived reservoirs of HIV-1. Unlike activated CD4(+) T cells, this nondividing HIV-1 target cell type contains a very low level of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for proviral DNA synthesis whereas the ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) levels remain in the millimolar range, resulting in an extremely low dNTP/rNTP ratio. Biochemical simulations demonstrate that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) efficiently incorporates ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) during DNA synthesis at this ratio, predicting frequent rNMP incorporation by the virus specifically in macrophages. Indeed, HIV-1 RT incorporates rNMPs at a remarkable rate of 1/146 nucleotides during macrophage infection. This greatly exceeds known rates for cellular replicative polymerases. In contrast, little or no rNMP incorporation is detected in CD4(+) T cells. Repair of these rNMP lesions is also substantially delayed in macrophages compared with CD4(+) T cells. Single rNMPs embedded in a DNA template are known to induce cellular DNA polymerase pausing, which mechanistically contributes to mutation synthesis. Indeed, we also observed that embedded rNMPs in a dsDNA template also induce HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis pausing. Moreover, unrepaired rNMPs incorporated into the provirus during HIV-1 reverse transcription would be generally mutagenic as was shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most importantly, the frequent incorporation of rNMPs makes them an ideal candidate for development of a new class of HIV RT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2086685132,"Observing spatial and temporal variations of marine biodiversity from non-destructive techniques is central for understanding ecosystem resilience, and for monitoring and assessing conservation strategies, e.g. Marine Protected Areas. Observations are generally obtained through Underwater Visual Censuses (UVC) conducted by divers. The problems inherent to the presence of divers have been discussed in several papers. Video techniques are increasingly used for observing underwater macrofauna and habitat. Most video techniques that do not need the presence of a diver use baited remote systems. In this paper, we present an original video technique which relies on a remote unbaited rotating remote system including a high definition camera. The system is set on the sea floor to record images. These are then analysed at the office to quantify biotic and abiotic sea bottom cover, and to identify and count fish species and other species like marine turtles. The technique was extensively tested in a highly diversified coral reef ecosystem in the South Lagoon of New Caledonia, based on a protocol covering both protected and unprotected areas in major lagoon habitats. The technique enabled to detect and identify a large number of species, and in particular fished species, which were not disturbed by the system. Habitat could easily be investigated through the images. A large number of observations could be carried out per day at sea. This study showed the strong potential of this non obtrusive technique for observing both macrofauna and habitat. It offers a unique spatial coverage and can be implemented at sea at a reasonable cost by non-expert staff. As such, this technique is particularly interesting for investigating and monitoring coastal biodiversity in the light of current conservation challenges and increasing monitoring needs."
https://openalex.org/W1967443722,"Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP1), a myristoylated Ca(2+) sensor in vision, regulates retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC). We show that protein-myristoyl group interactions control Ca(2+) sensitivity, apparent affinity for RetGC, and maximal level of cyclase activation. Mutating residues near the myristoyl moiety affected the affinity of Ca(2+) binding to EF-hand 4. Inserting Phe residues in the cavity around the myristoyl group increased both the affinity of GCAP1 for RetGC and maximal activation of the cyclase. NMR spectra show that the myristoyl group in the L80F/L176F/V180F mutant remained sequestered inside GCAP1 in both Ca(2+)-bound and Mg(2+)-bound states. This mutant displayed much higher affinity for the cyclase but reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity of the cyclase regulation. The L176F substitution improved affinity of myristoylated and non-acylated GCAP1 for the cyclase but simultaneously reduced the affinity of Ca(2+) binding to EF-hand 4 and Ca(2+) sensitivity of the cyclase regulation by acylated GCAP1. The replacement of amino acids near both ends of the myristoyl moiety (Leu(80) and Val(180)) minimally affected regulatory properties of GCAP1. N-Lauryl- and N-myristoyl-GCAP1 activated RetGC in a similar fashion. Thus, protein interactions with the central region of the fatty acyl chain optimize GCAP1 binding to RetGC and maximize activation of the cyclase. We propose a dynamic connection (or ""tug"") between the fatty acyl group and EF-hand 4 via the C-terminal helix that attenuates the efficiency of RetGC activation in exchange for optimal Ca(2+) sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2027446111,"Due to drawbacks of live attenuated vaccines, much more attention has been focused on screening of Brucella protective antigens as subunit vaccine candidates. Brucella is a facultative intracellular bacterium and cell mediated immunity plays essential roles for protection against Brucella infection. Identification of Brucella antigens that present T-cell epitopes to the host could enable development of such vaccines. In this study, 45 proven or putative pathogenesis-associated factors of Brucella were selected according to currently available data. After expressed and purified, 35 proteins were qualified for analysis of their abilities to stimulate T-cell responses in vitro. Then, an in vitro gamma interferon (IFN-γ) assay was used to identify potential T-cell antigens from B. abortus. In total, 7 individual proteins that stimulated strong IFN-γ responses in splenocytes from mice immunized with B. abortus live vaccine S19 were identified. The protective efficiencies of these 7 recombinant proteins were further evaluated. Mice given BAB1_1316 (CobB) or BAB1_1688 (AsnC) plus adjuvant could provide protection against virulent B. abortus infection, similarly with the known protective antigen Cu-Zn SOD and the license vaccine S19. In addition, CobB and AsnC could induce strong antibodies responses in BALB/c mice. Altogether, the present study showed that CobB or AsnC protein could be useful antigen candidates for the development of subunit vaccines against brucellosis with adequate immunogenicity and protection efficacy."

Free electrons can also wreak a degree of havoc within a liquid environment as they generate local reactive fragments, which then couple with the surrounding solvent to form a slew of products. Alexander et al. (p. 1072 ) explored what happens if reactive electrons emerged at the surface of such a liquid. To generate these conditions, they bombarded a shallow film of deuterated glycerol with sodium atoms that ionized on impact and discovered, in contrast with bulk liquid, that solvent-derived deuterium atoms escaped from the surface into the gas phase before they could react any further."
https://openalex.org/W2078436729,"The immense biodiversity of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa might be the result of high rates of microallopatry caused by mountain barriers surpassing 4000 meters leading to patchy habitat distributions. We test the influence of geographic structures on the phylogenetic patterns among Buthus scorpions using mtDNA sequences. We sampled 91 individuals of the genus Buthus from 51 locations scattered around the Atlas Mountains (Antiatlas, High Atlas, Middle Atlas and Jebel Sahro). We sequenced 452 bp of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene which proved to be highly variable within and among Buthus species. Our phylogenetic analysis yielded 12 distinct genetic groups one of which comprised three subgroups mostly in accordance with the orographic structure of the mountain systems. Main clades overlap with each other, while subclades are distributed parapatrically. Geographic structures likely acted as long-term barriers among populations causing restriction of gene flow and allowing for strong genetic differentiation. Thus, genetic structure and geographical distribution of genetic (sub)clusters follow the classical theory of allopatric differentiation where distinct groups evolve without range overlap until reproductive isolation and ecological differentiation has built up. Philopatry and low dispersal ability of Buthus scorpions are the likely causes for the observed strong genetic differentiation at this small geographic scale."
https://openalex.org/W2087682411,"The urea cycle converts toxic ammonia to urea within the liver of mammals. At least 6 enzymes are required for ureagenesis, which correlates with dietary protein intake. The transcription of urea cycle genes is, at least in part, regulated by glucocorticoid and glucagon hormone signaling pathways. N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) produces a unique cofactor, N-acetylglutamate (NAG), that is essential for the catalytic function of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of ureagenesis, carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). However, despite the important role of NAGS in ammonia removal, little is known about the mechanisms of its regulation. We identified two regions of high conservation upstream of the translation start of the NAGS gene. Reporter assays confirmed that these regions represent promoter and enhancer and that the enhancer is tissue specific. Within the promoter, we identified multiple transcription start sites that differed between liver and small intestine. Several transcription factor binding motifs were conserved within the promoter and enhancer regions while a TATA-box motif was absent. DNA-protein pull-down assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Sp1 and CREB, but not C/EBP in the promoter and HNF-1 and NF-Y, but not SMAD3 or AP-2 in the enhancer. The functional importance of these motifs was demonstrated by decreased transcription of reporter constructs following mutagenesis of each motif. The presented data strongly suggest that Sp1, CREB, HNF-1, and NF-Y, that are known to be responsive to hormones and diet, regulate NAGS transcription. This provides molecular mechanism of regulation of ureagenesis in response to hormonal and dietary changes."
https://openalex.org/W2050354792,"We investigated the impact of CHIKV strains on some Aedes albopictus (Skuse) reproductive parameters and the possibility of vertical transmission. Two strains were collected in the area where the epidemic occurred in 2007, one isolated from mosquitoes, the other one isolated from a viraemic patient. Different types of blood meals, either infected or non-infected, were offered to Ae. albopictus females, that were then analyzed at increasing time post infection. The virus titre, measured by two RT-PCR methods in the blood meals, influenced the rate of infection and the rate of dissemination of CHIKV in Ae. albopictus body. We found individual variability with respect to the infection/dissemination rates and their latency both considering the female's body and appendages. The hatching rate was significantly lower for the eggs laid by the infected females than for the control eggs, while the mortality during the larval development (from first instar larva to adult emergence) was similar among the progeny of infected and non-infected female groups. Our findings seem to support the hypothesis that the vertical transmission is a rare event under our conditions, and that a certain time period is required in order to get the ovarioles infected. Field observations conducted during the Spring 2008 showed no evidence of the presence of infected overwintering progeny produced by Ae. albopictus females infected during the 2007 outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2038499424,"Interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) is formed during fetal development and stable for the life span of the mouse. In addition, brown adipocytes also appear in white fat depots (wBAT) between 10 and 21 days of age in mice maintained at a room temperature of 23°C. However, this expression is transient. By 60 days of age the brown adipocytes have disappeared, but they can re-emerge if the adult mouse is exposed to the cold (5°C) or treated with β3-adrenergic agonists. Since the number of brown adipocytes that can be induced in white fat influences the capacity of the mouse to resist the obese state, we determined the effects of the nutritional conditions on post-natal development (birth to 21 days) of wBAT and its long-term effects on diet-induced obesity (DIO). Under-nutrition caused essentially complete suppression of wBAT in inguinal fat at 21 days of age, as indicated by expression of Ucp1 and genes of mitochondrial structure and function based upon microarray and qRT-PCR analysis, whereas over-nutrition had no discernible effects on wBAT induction. Surprisingly, the suppression of wBAT at 21 days of age did not affect DIO in adult mice maintained at 23°C, nor did it affect the reduction in obesity or cold tolerance when DIO mice were exposed to the cold at 5°C for one week. Gene expression analysis indicated that mice raised under conditions that suppressed wBAT at 21 days of age were able to normally induce wBAT as adults. Therefore, neither severe hypoleptinemia nor hypoinsulinemia during suckling permanently impaired brown adipogenesis in white fat. In addition, energy balance studies of DIO mice exposed to cold indicates that mice with reduced adipose stores preferentially increased food intake, whereas those with larger adipose tissue depots preferred to utilize energy from their adipose stores."
https://openalex.org/W1975924215,"The yeast mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (ymLeuRS) performs dual essential roles in group I intron splicing and protein synthesis. A specific LeuRS domain called CP1 is responsible for clearing noncognate amino acids that are misactivated during aminoacylation. The ymLeuRS CP1 domain also plays a critical role in splicing. Herein, the ymLeuRS CP1 domain was isolated from the full-length enzyme and was active in RNA splicing in vitro. Unlike its Escherichia coli LeuRS CP1 domain counterpart, it failed to significantly hydrolyze misaminoacylated tRNA(Leu). In addition and in stark contrast to the yeast domain, the editing-active E. coli LeuRS CP1 domain failed to recapitulate the splicing activity of the full-length E. coli enzyme. Although LeuRS-dependent splicing activity is rooted in an ancient adaptation for its aminoacylation activity, these results suggest that the ymLeuRS has functionally diverged to confer a robust splicing activity. This adaptation could have come at some expense to the protein's housekeeping role in aminoacylation and editing."
https://openalex.org/W2029356541,"In Lao PDR, where more than 8% of the population are chronic carriers of HBsAg, multiple genotypes and subgenotypes co-circulate and are prone to generate recombinant viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple clones per donor revealed mixed infections of subgenotypes B1, B2, B4, C1, C5, I1 and I2 in almost 6% of HBsAg positive rejected blood donors. Recombination analyses and distance calculations furthermore showed that about 65% (17/26) of the mixed infected donors showed recombinations in the S-gene alone, involving the predominant genotypes B and C. These results suggest that, at least in Laos, hepatitis B virus (HBV) mixed infections lead to frequent recombinations. In many donors with recombinant strains, the recombinant fragment and a non-recombinant strain of the same genotype co-existed (127/185 analysed recombinant fragments). For a large proportion of these (60/127), the most closely related known virus was found, although not always exclusively, in the same donor. Recombinant virus strains are largely distinct. This is reflected in an unexpected diversity in recombination breakpoints and the relatively rare recombinations with identical recombination patterns of the same genotypes in different donors. Recent recombination events would explain the limited spread of each of the recombinants. Using a published mutation rate of 4.2 × 10(-5) mutations per site and year, the observed minimum genetic distances of 0-0.60% between parent strain and recombinant fragment would correspond to 0-71 years of evolution from a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Thus several lines of evidence are suggestive of recent independent recombination events, a proportion of these even occurring within the same donors. In conclusion, our analyses revealed a high variability of mixed infections as a very probable breeding ground of multiple variable recombination events in Laos that so far have not led to new dominant strains."
https://openalex.org/W2042164425,"Early diagnosis of young adults at risk of schizophrenia is essential for preventive approaches of the illness. Nevertheless, classic screening instruments are difficult to use because of the non-specific nature of the signs at this pre-onset phase of illness. The objective of the present contribution was to propose an innovating test that can probe the more specific symptom of psychosis, i.e., the sense of agency, which is defined as being the immediate experience of oneself as the cause of an action. More specifically, we tested whether motor agency is abnormal in early psychosis.Thirty-two young symptomatic patients and their age-matched controls participated in the study. 15 of these patients were at ultra high-risk for developing psychosis (UHR), and 17 patients were suffering from first-episode psychosis (FEP). Patients' neurocognitive capacities were assessed through the use of seven neuropsychological tests. A motor agency task was also introduced to obtain an objective indicator of the degree of sense of agency, by contrasting force levels applied during other and self-produced collisions between a hand-held objet and a pendulum.As reported in the literature for adult controls, healthy adolescents used more efficient force levels in self than in other-imposed collisions. For both UHR and FEP patients, abnormally high levels of grip force were used for self-produced collisions, leading to an absence of difference between self and other. The normalized results revealed that motor agency differentiated patients from controls with a higher level of sensitivity than the more classic neuropsychological test battery.This study is in favour of the existence of an abnormal sense of agency early in the psychotic illness. Because it is quick and none verbal, motor agency may be a valuable tool to use in complement to classic interviews, especially when investigating complex ineffable experiences that are difficult to explicitly describe."

Imaging experiments demonstrated that Gαo expression promoted GRIN translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas Sprouty2 expression failed to do so. Given the role of Sprouty2 in the regulation of growth factor-mediated MAPK activation, we examined the contribution of the GRIN-Sprouty2 interaction to CB1 cannabinoid receptor regulation of FGF receptor signaling. In Neuro-2A cells, a system that expresses all of the components endogenously, modulation of GRIN levels led to regulation of MAPK activation. Overexpression of GRIN potentiated FGF activation of MAPK and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Sprouty2. Pretreatment with Go/i-coupled CB1 receptor agonist attenuated subsequent FGF activation of MAPK. Decreased expression of GRIN both diminished FGF activation of MAPK and blocked CB1R attenuation of MAPK activation.

https://openalex.org/W1985426883,"Insulin analogues comprising acidic amino acid substitutions at position B10 have previously been shown to display increased mitogenic potencies compared to human insulin and the underlying molecular mechanisms have been subject to much scrutiny and debate. However, B10 is still an attractive position for amino acid substitutions given its important role in hexamer formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between the receptor binding properties as well as the metabolic and mitogenic potencies of a series of insulin analogues with different amino acid substitutions at position B10 and to identify a B10-substituted insulin analogue without an increased mitogenic to metabolic potency ratio.A panel of ten singly-substituted B10 insulin analogues with different amino acid side chain characteristics were prepared and insulin receptor (both isoforms) and IGF-I receptor binding affinities using purified receptors, insulin receptor dissociation rates using BHK cells over-expressing the human insulin receptor, metabolic potencies by lipogenesis in isolated rat adipocytes, and mitogenic potencies using two different cell types predominantly expressing either the insulin or the IGF-I receptor were systematically investigated. Only analogues B10D and B10E with significantly increased insulin and IGF-I receptor affinities as well as decreased insulin receptor dissociation rates displayed enhanced mitogenic potencies in both cell types employed. For the remaining analogues with less pronounced changes in receptor affinities and insulin receptor dissociation rates, no apparent correlation between insulin receptor occupancy time and mitogenicity was observed.Several B10-substituted insulin analogues devoid of disproportionate increases in mitogenic compared to metabolic potencies were identified. In the present study, receptor binding affinity rather than insulin receptor off-rate appears to be the major determinant of both metabolic and mitogenic potency. Our results also suggest that the increased mitogenic potency is attributable to both insulin and IGF-I receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2028818272,"Chimeric genes are significant sources of evolutionary innovation that are normally created when portions of two or more protein coding regions fuse to form a new open reading frame. In plant mitochondria astonishingly high numbers of different novel chimeric genes have been reported, where they are generated through processes of rearrangement and recombination. Nonetheless, because most studies do not find or report nucleotide variation within the same chimeric gene, evolution after the origination of these chimeric genes remains unstudied. Here we identify two alleles of a complex chimera in Silene vulgaris that are divergent in nucleotide sequence, genomic position relative to other mitochondrial genes, and expression patterns. Structural patterns suggest a history partially influenced by gene conversion between the chimeric gene and functional copies of subunit 1 of the mitochondrial ATP synthase gene (atp1). We identified small repeat structures within the chimeras that are likely recombination sites allowing generation of the chimera. These results establish the potential for chimeric gene divergence in different plant mitochondrial lineages within the same species. This result contrasts with the absence of diversity within mitochondrial chimeras found in crop species."
https://openalex.org/W1979167474,"Previous works have demonstrated that protein rigidity is related to thermodynamic stability, especially under conditions that favor formation of native structure. Mechanical network rigidity properties of a single conformation are efficiently calculated using the integer body-bar Pebble Game (PG) algorithm. However, thermodynamic properties require averaging over many samples from the ensemble of accessible conformations to accurately account for fluctuations in network topology. We have developed a mean field Virtual Pebble Game (VPG) that represents the ensemble of networks by a single effective network. That is, all possible number of distance constraints (or bars) that can form between a pair of rigid bodies is replaced by the average number. The resulting effective network is viewed as having weighted edges, where the weight of an edge quantifies its capacity to absorb degrees of freedom. The VPG is interpreted as a flow problem on this effective network, which eliminates the need to sample. Across a nonredundant dataset of 272 protein structures, we apply the VPG to proteins for the first time. Our results show numerically and visually that the rigidity characterizations of the VPG accurately reflect the ensemble averaged properties. This result positions the VPG as an efficient alternative to understand the mechanical role that chemical interactions play in maintaining protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1991767363,"Background Health outcomes in developing countries continue to lag the developed world, and many countries are not on target to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The private health sector provides much of the care in many developing countries (e.g., approximately 50 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa), but private providers are often poorly integrated into the health system. Efforts to improve health systems performance will need to include the private sector and increase its contributions to national health goals. However, the literature on constraints private health care providers face is limited. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyze data from a survey of private health facilities in Kenya and Ghana to evaluate growth constraints facing private providers. A significant portion of facilities (Ghana: 62 percent; Kenya: 40 percent) report limited access to finance as the most significant barrier they face; only a small minority of facilities report using formal credit institutions to finance day to day operations (Ghana: 6 percent; Kenya: 11 percent). Other important barriers include corruption, crime, limited demand for goods and services, and poor public infrastructure. Most facilities have paper-based rather than electronic systems for patient records (Ghana: 30 percent; Kenya: 22 percent), accounting (Ghana: 45 percent; Kenya: 27 percent), and inventory control (Ghana: 41 percent; Kenya: 24 percent). A majority of clinics in both countries report undertaking activities to improve provider skills and to monitor the level and quality of care they provide. However, only a minority of pharmacies report undertaking such activities. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that improved access to finance and improving business processes especially among pharmacies would support improved contributions by private health facilities. These strategies might be complementary if providers are more able to take advantage of increased access to finance when they have the business processes in place for operating a successful business and health facility."
https://openalex.org/W2023768964,"Mutations in genes for any of the six subunits of NADPH oxidase cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), but almost 2/3 of CGD cases are caused by mutations in the X-linked CYBB gene, also known as NAD (P) H oxidase 2. Approximately 260 patients with CGD have been reported in Japan, of whom 92 were shown to have mutations of the CYBB gene and 16 to have chromosomal deletions. However, there has been very little detailed analysis of the range of the deletion or close understanding of the disease based on this. We therefore analyzed genomic rearrangements in X-linked CGD using array comparative genomic hybridization analysis, revealing the extent and the types of the deletion genes. The subjects were five Japanese X-linked CGD patients estimated to have large base deletions of 1 kb or more in the CYBB gene (four male patients, one female patient) and the mothers of four of those patients. The five Japanese patients were found to range from a patient exhibiting deletions only of the CYBB gene to a female patient exhibiting an extensive DNA deletion and the DMD and CGD phenotype manifested. Of the other three patients, two exhibited CYBB, XK, and DYNLT3 gene deletions. The remaining patient exhibited both a deletion encompassing DNA subsequent to the CYBB region following intron 2 and the DYNLT3 gene and a complex copy number variation involving the insertion of an inverted duplication of a region from the centromere side of DYNLT3 into the deleted region."
