https://openalex.org/W2030695915,"The crystal structure of recombinant wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been solved to a resolution of 1.9 A by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods. The protein is in the shape of a cylinder, comprising 11 strands of beta-sheet with an alpha-helix inside and short helical segments on the ends of the cylinder. This motif, with beta-structure on the outside and alpha-helix on the inside, represents a new protein fold, which we have named the beta-can. Two protomers pack closely together to form a dimer in the crystal. The fluorophores are protected inside the cylinders, and their structures are consistent with the formation of aromatic systems made up of Tyr66 with reduction of its C alpha-C beta bond coupled with cyclization of the neighboring glycine and serine residues. The environment inside the cylinder explains the effects of many existing mutants of GFP and suggests specific side chains that could be modified to change the spectral properties of GFP. Furthermore, the identification of the dimer contacts may allow mutagenic control of the state of assembly of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2010978356,Excessive sodium (Na + ) in salinized soils inhibits plant growth and development. A mutation in the SOS3 gene renders Arabidopsis thaliana plants hypersensitive to Na + -induced growth inhibition. SOS3 encodes a protein that shares significant sequence similarity with the calcineurin B subunit from yeast and neuronal calcium sensors from animals. The results suggest that intracellular calcium signaling through a calcineurin-like pathway mediates the beneficial effect of calcium on plant salt tolerance.

This was demonstrated on arrays of 1-micrometer lines by near- and far-field magnetooptical microscopy. The coercive force and magnetic anisotropy of the irradiated regions can be accurately controlled by the irradiation fluence. If combined with high-resolution lithography, this technique holds promise for ultrahigh-density magnetic recording applications."
https://openalex.org/W2012183985,"When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, perception alternates spontaneously between each monocular view, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Functional brain imaging in humans was used to study the neural basis of these subjective perceptual changes. Cortical regions whose activity reflected perceptual transitions included extrastriate areas of the ventral visual pathway, and parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in spatial attention; whereas the extrastriate areas were also engaged by nonrivalrous perceptual changes, activity in the frontoparietal cortex was specifically associated with perceptual alternation only during rivalry. These results suggest that frontoparietal areas play a central role in conscious perception, biasing the content of visual awareness toward abstract internal representations of visual scenes, rather than simply toward space."

Studies of this protein promise a better understanding of how ion pumps function. Together with a large amount of spectroscopic and mutational data, the atomic structure of bacteriorhodopsin, determined in the last decade at increasing resolutions, has suggested plausible but often contradictory mechanisms. X-ray diffraction of bacteriorhodopsin crystals grown in cubic lipid phase revealed unexpected two-fold symmetries that indicate merohedral twinning along the crystallographic c axis. The structure, refined to 2.3 angstroms taking this twinning into account, is different from earlier models, including that most recently reported. One of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of the proton acceptor Asp85 is connected to the proton donor, the retinal Schiff base, through a hydrogen-bonded water and forms a second hydrogen bond with another water. The other carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp85 accepts a hydrogen bond from Thr89. This structure forms the active site. The nearby Arg82 is the center of a network of numerous hydrogen-bonded residues and an ordered water molecule. This network defines the pathway of the proton from the buried Schiff base to the extracellular surface."
https://openalex.org/W2038287838,"Black carbon (BC) enters the ocean through aerosol and river deposition. BC makes up 12 to 31 percent of the sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) at two deep ocean sites, and it is 2400 to 13,900 carbon-14 years older than non-BC SOC deposited concurrently. BC is likely older because it is stored in an intermediate reservoir before sedimentary deposition. Possible intermediate pools are oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and terrestrial soils. If DOC is the intermediate reservoir, then BC is 4 to 22 percent of the DOC pool. If soils are the intermediate reservoir, then the importance of riverine carbon in the ocean carbon cycle has been underestimated."

https://openalex.org/W2079722293,"The ""good genes"" hypothesis predicts that mating preferences enable females to select mates of superior genetic quality. The genetic consequences of the preference shown by female gray tree frogs for long-duration calls were evaluated by comparing the performance of maternal half-siblings sired by males with different call durations. Offspring of male gray tree frogs that produced long calls showed better performance during larval and juvenile stages than did offspring of males that produced short calls. These data suggest that call duration can function as a reliable indicator of heritable genetic quality."
https://openalex.org/W2030134162,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapse involves interacting signaling components, including calcium (Ca 2+ )/calmodulin–dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways. Postsynaptic injection of thiophosphorylated inhibitor-1 protein, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase–1 (PP1), substituted for cAMP pathway activation in LTP. Stimulation that induced LTP triggered cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous inhibitor-1 and a decrease in PP1 activity. This stimulation also increased phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr 286 and Ca 2+ -independent CaMKII activity in a cAMP-dependent manner. The blockade of LTP by a CaMKII inhibitor was not overcome by thiophosphorylated inhibitor-1. Thus, the cAMP pathway uses PP1 to gate CaMKII signaling in LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2085482846,"Simulations with a synchronously coupled atmosphere–ocean–vegetation model show that changes in vegetation cover during the mid-Holocene, some 6000 years ago, modify and amplify the climate system response to an enhanced seasonal cycle of solar insolation in the Northern Hemisphere both directly (primarily through the changes in surface albedo) and indirectly (through changes in oceanic temperature, sea-ice cover, and oceanic circulation). The model results indicate strong synergistic effects of changes in vegetation cover, ocean temperature, and sea ice at boreal latitudes, but in the subtropics, the atmosphere–vegetation feedback is most important. Moreover, a reduction of the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean leads to a warming of the Southern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W1970581527,"Signaling pathways that stabilize interleukin-2 (IL-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) in activated T cells were examined. IL-2 mRNA contains at least two cis elements that mediated its stabilization in response to different signals, including activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). This response was mediated through a cis element encompassing the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the beginning of the coding region. IL-2 transcripts lacking this 5' element no longer responded to JNK activation but were still responsive to other signals generated during T cell activation, which were probably sensed through the 3' UTR. Thus, multiple elements within IL-2 mRNA modulate its stability in a combinatorial manner, and the JNK pathway controls turnover as well as synthesis of IL-2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2004335914,"The light-induced insulator-metal transition in the ""colossal magnetoresistance"" compound Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 is shown to generate a well-localized conducting path while the bulk of the sample remains insulating. The path can be visualized through a change of reflectivity that accompanies the phase transition. Its visibility provides a tool for gaining insight into electronic transport in materials with strong magnetic correlations. For example, a conducting path can be generated or removed at an arbitrary position just because of the presence of another path. Such manipulation may be useful in the construction of optical switches."

https://openalex.org/W2319589010,"Radicicol, a macrocyclic anti-fungal antibiotic, has the ability to suppress transformation by diverse oncogenes such as Src, Ras and Mos. Despite this useful property, the mechanism by which radicicol exerts its anti-transformation effects is currently unknown. To understand the transformation-suppressing effects of radicicol, a biotinylated derivative of radicicol was chemically synthesized and used as a probe in a Western-blot format to visualize cellular proteins that interact with radicicol. In transformed and untransformed mouse fibroblasts, the most prominent cellular protein that bound to radicicol had a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa. Further analysis revealed that this protein was the mouse homologue of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (HSP90). This was confirmed by demonstrating the ability of radicicol to specifically bind purified human HSP90. Specificity of binding was demonstrated by the inhibition of binding of biotinylated radicicol by the native drug. Taken together with other studies the present observations suggest that the anti-transformation effects of radicicol may be mediated, at least in part, by the association of radicicol with HSP90 and the consequent dissociation of the Raf/HSP90 complex leading to the attenuation of the Ras/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2029039327,"The relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia hermsii, alternates infections between a mammal and a tick vector. Whether the spirochete changes phenotypically in the different hosts was examined by allowing the tick vector Ornithodoros hermsi to feed on mice infected with serotype 7 or serotype 8 of B. hermsii. Upon infection of ticks, the spirochetal serotype-specific variable major proteins (Vmps) 7 and 8 became undetectable and were replaced by Vmp33. This switch from a bloodstream- to tick-associated phenotype could be induced in culture by a decrease in temperature. After tick-bite transmission back to mice, the process was reversed and the spirochetes resumed expression of the same Vmp present in the previous infectious blood meal."

https://openalex.org/W2032971882,"Bcl-2 and a Bcl-2-binding protein BAG-1 function in protection from apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. Deregulated expression of Bcl-2 leads to inhibition of apoptosis and is correlated with development of various cancers. Here, we provide evidence that prolonged cell survival introduced by overproduction of Bcl-2 or BAG-1 strongly enhances peritoneal dissemination of human gastric cancer MKN74 cells. Gene transfer-mediated overexpression of Bcl-2 or BAG-1 led to prolonged cell survival of MKN74 cells against serum-starved apoptosis and anoikis. When the viable transfectants were inoculated into the intraperitoneal cavity of BALB/c nude mice, the Bcl-2-expressing MKN74 cells and the BAG-1-expressing MKN74 cells exhibited strongly enhanced peritoneal dissemination in BALB/c nude mice and whole disseminated tumor weights were increased by 4-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively, compared with the control transfectants. The enhanced peritoneal dissemination of MKN74-Bcl-2 and MKN74-BAG-1 transfectants correlated well with resistance to cell death induced by serum-starvation and anoikis. However, the overexpression of Bcl-2 or BAG-1 caused no significant difference among the transfectants in cell growth rates, either in vitro or in vivo. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that resistance to apoptosis is a crucial factor for development of peritoneal dissemination of human gastric cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2079859497,"The cellular components of the neuronal signaling pathways of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are only beginning to be elucidated. Here we show that in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the Eph receptors EphA3, EphA4, and EphB2 in embryonic retina serve as binding sites for the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain of Src kinase. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB2 was detected in Src immunoprecipitates from transfected Cos cells, indicating that EphB2 and Src can physically associate. Interestingly, a form of Src with reduced electrophoretic mobility and increased tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in Cos cells expressing tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB2, suggesting a functional interaction between EphB2 and Src. Yeast two-hybrid analysis in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that phosphorylated tyrosine 611 in the juxtamembrane region of EphB2 is crucial for the interaction with the SH2 domain of Src. In contrast, binding of the carboxy-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase Cγ was not abolished upon mutation of tyrosine 611 in EphB2. Phosphopeptide mapping of autophosphorylated full-length EphB2, and wild-type and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of the EphB2 cytoplasmic domain fused to LexA, showed tyrosine 611 in the sequence motif YEDP as a major site of autophosphorylation in EphB2. Our mutational analysis also indicated that tyrosines 605 and 611 are important for EphB2 kinase activity. We propose Src kinase as a downstream effector that mediates the neuron's response to Eph receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2314141730,"Loss of attachment to an extracellular matrix substrate arrests the growth of untransformed cells in the G1 phase. This anchorage-dependent cell cycle arrest is linked to increased expression of the p21Cip1 (p21) and p27Kip1 (p27) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The result is a loss of cdk2-associated kinase activity, especially that of cyclin E-cdk2. The levels of p21 and p27 are also upregulated in unattached transformed cells, but cyclin E-cdk2 activity remains high, and the cells are able to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Increased expression of cyclin E and cdk2 appears to be partially responsible for the maintenance of cyclin E-cdk2 activity in transformed cells. To explore further the regulation of cyclin E-cdk2 in transformed cells, we have analysed the subcellular distribution of cyclin-cdk complexes and their inhibitors in normal human fibroblasts, their transformed counterparts, and in various human tumor cell lines. In substrate-attached normal fibroblasts, cyclin E and cdk2 were exclusively in the nuclear fraction, associated with one another. When normal fibroblasts were detached and held in suspension, cyclin E-cdk2 complexes remained nuclear, but were now found associated with the p21 and p27 cdk inhibitors and lacked histone H1 phosphorylating activity. In contrast, the transformed fibroblasts and tumor cells, which are anchorage-independent, had more than half of their cyclin E, cdk2, p21 and p27 in the cytoplasmic fraction, both in attached and suspended cultures. The cytoplasmic p21 and p27 were bound to cyclin E-cdk2, as well as to complexes containing cyclin A and cyclin D. The nuclear cyclin E-cdk2 complexes from the transformed cells grown in suspension contained only low levels of p21 and p27 and had histone H1 kinase activity. Thus, at least three mechanisms contribute to keeping cyclin E-cdk2 complexes active in suspended anchorage-independent cells: cyclin E and cdk2 are upregulated, as reported previously, cdk inhibitors are sequestered away from the nucleus by cytoplasmic cyclin-cdk complexes, and the binding of the inhibitors to nuclear cyclin E-cdk2 complexes is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2335009979,"Using a polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning procedure, we have identified a novel member, termed ANA (from Abundant in Nueroepithelium Area), of Tob/BTG1 family of antiproliferative genes. Molecular cloning and analysis of cDNAs revealed that the human and mouse ANA encoded a protein of 252 amino acids. The amino-terminal half of ANA was homologous to the previously characterized antiproliferative gene products, BTG1, PC3/TIS21/BTG2, and Tob. The human ANA gene was localized at chromosome 21q11.2-q21.1. ANA was expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines, its expression being high in the ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, and lung. Further analysis revealed that ANA expression was high in the ventricular zone of the developing central nervous system. Finally, overexpression of ANA impaired serum-induced cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase. In conclusion, ANA is a fourth member of the Tob/BTG1 family that might play roles in neurogenesis in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2314735012,"Cytogenetically, testicular germ cell tumors of adolescents and adults (TGCTs) are characterized by gain of 12p-sequences, most often through isochromosome formation (i(12p)). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has shown that i(12p))-negative TGCTs also cryptically contain extra 12p-sequences. The consistency of 12p-over-representation in all histological subtypes of TGCTs, including their preinvasive stage, suggests that gain of one or more genes on 12p is crucial in the development of this cancer. So far, studies aimed at the identification of the relevant gene(s) were based on the `candidate-gene approach'. No convincing evidence in favor of or against a particular gene has been reported. We combined conventional karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, and FISH to identify TGCTs with amplifications of restricted regions of 12p. Out of 49 primary TGCTs (23 without i(12p), 13 with and 13 unknown), eight tumors (six without i(12p) and two unknown) showed amplifications corresponding to 12p11.1-p12.1. Using bicolour-FISH, physical mapping, and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reactions, the size of the shortest region of overlap of amplification (SROA) was estimated to be between 1750–3000 kb. In addition, we mapped a number of genes in and around this region. While fourteen known genes could be excluded as candidates based on their location outside this region, we demonstrate that KRAS2, JAW1 and SOX5 genes are localized within the SROA. While KRAS2 and JAW1 map to the proximal border of the SROA, SOX5 maps centrally in the SROA. KRAS2 and JAW1 are expressed in all TGCTs, whereas one 12p amplicon-positive TGCT lacks expression of SOX5. The critical region of 12p over-represented in TGCTs is less than 8% of the total length of the short arm of chromosome 12. It will be helpful in the identification of the gene(s) involved in TGCT-development."
https://openalex.org/W1970056895,"A cluster analysis of the stratigraphic distribution of all Ordovician trilobite families, based on a comprehensive taxonomic database, identified two major faunas with disjunct temporal diversity trends. The Ibex Fauna behaved as a cohort, declining through the Ordovician and disappearing at the end-Ordovician mass extinction. In contrast, the Whiterock Fauna radiated rapidly during the Middle Ordovician and gave rise to all post-Ordovician trilobite diversity. Its pattern of diversification matches that of the Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna; hence, trilobites were active participants in the great Ordovician radiations. Extinction patterns at the end of the Ordovician are related to clade size: Surviving trilobite families show higher genus diversity than extinguished families."
https://openalex.org/W2141044609,"The cross pressure (P) and temperature (T) dependence of the elastic moduli (Cij) of single-crystal samples of periclase (MgO) from acoustic wave travel times was measured with ultrasonic interferometry: partial differential2C11/ partial differentialP partial differentialT = (-1.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-3) per kelvin; partial differential2C110/ partial differentialP partial differentialT = (1. 7 +/- 0.7) x 10(-3) per kelvin; and partial differential2C44/ partial differentialP partial differentialT = (-0.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) per kelvin. The elastic anisotropy of MgO decreases with increasing pressure at ambient temperature, but then increases as temperature is increased at high pressure. An assumption of zero cross pressure and temperature derivatives for the elastic moduli underestimates the elastic anisotropy and overestimates the acoustic velocities of MgO at the extrapolated high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of Earth's mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2322643328,"A paradox of Flt-1, a tyrosine kinase receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is that the ligand cannot activate the receptor to stimulate growth of cells that exogenously overexpress the receptor. In order to find Flt-1 kinase-dependent biological systems, we obtained for the first time activated forms of the Flt-1 kinase in a ligand-independent manner. Replacement of the ABL sequences in the human leukemia oncoprotein BCR–ABL with the cytoplasmic domain of Flt-1 (BCR–FLT) followed by a retroviral random mutagenesis scheme gave constitutively active artificial chimera BCR–FLTm with mutations within the Flt-1 sequence. Like BCR–ABL it could, but not the original BCR–FLT, transform Rat1 fibroblasts, abrogate cytokine dependence in Ba/F3 cells, and induce neurite-like structures in neuronal PC12 cells. Interestingly, Rat1 cells transformed by BCR–FLTm formed tube-like structures in basement membrane matrix. BCR–FLTm retroviruses may be a very useful tool to investigate an as yet uncovered functions of the Flt-1 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2324578623,"Src transformation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts has been shown to be dependent on Ras function. Since we recently showed that the signaling pathways that mediate Ras transformation of RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells are distinct from those that cause Ras transformation of fibroblasts, we utilized three approaches to determine if Src transformation of RIE-1 cells is dependent on Ras. First, although both Ras and Src cause upregulation of an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-dependent autocrine growth loop, only Ras transformation required this activity. Second, whereas both Src and Ras caused upregulation of the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), only Ras transformation was blocked by the inhibition of MAPK activation by treatment with the PD 98059 MEK inhibitor. Third, treatment with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 blocked Ras, but not Src, transformation. Taken together, these observations suggest that Src transformation of RIE-1 cells is not dependent on Ras. Finally, we determined that Ras activation of Raf-independent pathways alone is sufficient to cause growth transformation of RIE-1 cells. Thus, both Ras and Src cause transformation of RIE-1 cells via pathways distinct from those required to cause transformation of NIH3T3 cells."
