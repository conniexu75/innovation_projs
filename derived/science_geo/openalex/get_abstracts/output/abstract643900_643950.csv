https://openalex.org/W2992529563,"Our aim was to assess the utility of a novel machine learning software (Orbit Image Analysis) in the histological quantification of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) clots. We analyzed 50 AIS blood clots retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Following H&E staining, quantification of clot components was performed by two different methods: a pathologist using a reference standard method (Adobe Photoshop CC) and an experienced researcher using Orbit Image Analysis. Following quantification, the clots were categorized into 3 types: RBC dominant (≥60% RBCs), Mixed and Fibrin dominant (≥60% Fibrin). Correlations between clot composition and Hounsfield Units density on Computed Tomography (CT) were assessed. There was a significant correlation between the components of clots as quantified by the Orbit Image Analysis algorithm and the reference standard approach (ρ = 0.944**, p < 0.001, n = 150). A significant relationship was found between clot composition (RBC-Rich, Mixed, Fibrin-Rich) and the presence of a Hyperdense artery sign using the algorithmic method (X2(2) = 6.712, p = 0.035*) but not using the reference standard method (X2(2) = 3.924, p = 0.141). Orbit Image Analysis machine learning software can be used for the histological quantification of AIS clots, reproducibly generating composition analyses similar to current reference standard methods."
https://openalex.org/W2992473850,"Biological control is a great hope for reducing the overutilization of pesticides in agricultural soils. It often involves microorganisms or molecules produced by microorganisms that will be able to interact with either a plant or pathogens of this plant to reduce the growth of the pathogen and limit its negative impact on the host plant. When new biocontrol products are developed, strains were mostly selected based on their ability to inhibit a pathogen of interest under in vitro conditions via antagonistic effects. Strains with no in vitro effect are often discarded and not tested in planta. But is the in vitro selection of bacterial agents according to their antagonism activities towards a plant pathogen the best way to get effective biocontrol products? To answer this question, we used wheat and the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum as a study pathosystem model. A library of 205 soil bacteria was screened in 2 types of in vitro growth inhibition tests against F. graminearum, and in an in planta experiment. We find strains which do not have inhibition phenotypes in vitro but good efficacy in planta. Interestingly, some strains belong to species (Microbacterium, Arthrobacter, Variovorax) that are not known in the literature for their ability to protect plants against fungal pathogens. Thus, developing a biocontrol product against F. graminearum must be preferentially based on the direct screening of strains for their protective activity on wheat plants against fungal diseases, rather than on their in vitro antagonistic effects on fungal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2937339363,"We measure how accurately replication of experimental results can be predicted by black-box statistical models. With data from four large-scale replication projects in experimental psychology and economics, and techniques from machine learning, we train predictive models and study which variables drive predictable replication. The models predicts binary replication with a cross-validated accuracy rate of 70% (AUC of 0.77) and estimates of relative effect sizes with a Spearman ρ of 0.38. The accuracy level is similar to market-aggregated beliefs of peer scientists [1, 2]. The predictive power is validated in a pre-registered out of sample test of the outcome of [3], where 71% (AUC of 0.73) of replications are predicted correctly and effect size correlations amount to ρ = 0.25. Basic features such as the sample and effect sizes in original papers, and whether reported effects are single-variable main effects or two-variable interactions, are predictive of successful replication. The models presented in this paper are simple tools to produce cheap, prognostic replicability metrics. These models could be useful in institutionalizing the process of evaluation of new findings and guiding resources to those direct replications that are likely to be most informative."
https://openalex.org/W2992817960,"Purpose To understand how different methodologies of qualitative research are able to capture patient experience of the hospital journey. Methods A qualitative study of orthopaedic patients admitted for hip and knee replacement surgery in a 250-bed university hospital was performed. Eight patients were shadowed from the time they entered the hospital to the time of transfer to rehabilitation. Four patients and sixteen professionals, including orthopaedists, head nurses, nurses and administrative staff, were interviewed. Results Through analysis of the data collected four main themes emerged: the information gap; the covering patient-professionals relationship; the effectiveness of family closeness; and the micro-integration of hospital services. The three different standpoints (patient shadowing, health professionals’ interviews and patients’ interviews) allowed different issues to be captured in the various phases of the journey. Conclusions Hospitals can significantly improve the quality of the service provided by exploring and understanding the individual patient journey. When dealing with a key cross-functional business process, the time-space dynamics of the activities performed have to be considered. Further research in the academic field can explore practical, methodological and ethical challenges more deeply in capturing the whole patient journey experience by using multiple methods and integrated tools."
https://openalex.org/W2993333104,"Objectives To determine the psychopathological profile of patients with central sensitization (CS) in a sample of knee osteoarthritis, with and without CS, and fibromyalgia, and to compare their psychopathological profiles. Methods The final sample consists of 19 patients with osteoarthritis and CS (mean 66.37 years ± 8.77), 41 osteoarthritis patients without CS (mean 66.8 ± 7.39 years), 47 fibromyalgia patients (mean 46.47 years ± 7.92) and 26 control subjects (mean 51.56 years ± 11.41). The psychopathological profile was evaluated with the Millon Multiaxial Clinical Inventory. Results The average score of MCMI-III reflect higher scores in the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis-CS groups. Patients with osteoarthritis-CS are more likely to report larger scores in Borderline and Major Depression scales. Fibromyalgia patients are more likely to report more increased scores in Somatoform and Major Depression, versus osteoarthritis-CS group. Fibromyalgia patients versus osteoarthritis without CS are more likely to report higher scores in Schizoid, Depression, Histrionic, Sadistic, Borderline, Somatoform, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depression scales. Discussion Patients with CS have less differences in their psychopathological profiles as well as in both osteoarthritis groups and greatest differences are obtained between the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis without CS, so perhaps presence of CS is the key to differentiate those groups and not chronic pain. An exhaustive assessment brings more accurate psychopathological profiles, thus better psychological treatment could be applied."
https://openalex.org/W2994060089,"The current technologies of algal biofuels production and wastewater treatment (e.g., aerobic) process are still in question, due to the significant amount of fresh water and nutrients requirements for microalgae cultivation, and negative energy balance in both processes, especially when considered in the context of developing counties around the world. In this research, a simplistic sustainable approach of algal biofuels production from wastewater was proposed using a Hybrid Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (HABR) and Photobioreactor (PBR) system. The study suggests that the HABR was capable of removing most of the organic and solid (>90% COD and TSS removal) from wastewater, and produced a healthy feedstock (high N: P = 3:1) for microalgae cultivation in PBRs for biofuels production. A co-culture of Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella sorokiniana, and Scenedesmus simris002 showed high lipid content up to 44.1%; and the dominant FAMEs composition (C16-C18) of 87.9% in produced biofuels. Perhaps, this proposed low-cost technological approach (e.g., HABR-PBR system) would connect the currently broken link of sustainable bioenergy generation and wastewater treatment pathway for developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2994559831,"Background Colorectal cancer incidence in the UK and other high-income countries has been increasing rapidly among young adults. This is the first analysis of colorectal cancer incidence trends by sub-site and socioeconomic deprivation in young adults in a European country. Methods We examined age-specific national trends in colorectal cancer incidence among all adults (20–99 years) diagnosed during 1971–2014, using Joinpoint regression to analyse data from the population-based cancer registry for England. We fitted a generalised linear model to the incidence rates, with a maximum of two knots. We present the annual percentage change in incidence rates in up to three successive calendar periods, by sex, age, deprivation and anatomical sub-site. Results Annual incidence rates among the youngest adults (20–39 years) fell slightly between 1971 and the early 1990s, but increased rapidly from then onwards. Incidence Rates (IR) among adults 20–29 years rose from 0.8 per 100,000 in 1993 to 2.8 per 100,000 in 2014, an average annual increase of 8%. An annual increase of 8.1% was observed for adults aged 30–39 years during 2005–2014. Among the two youngest age groups (20–39 years), the average annual increase for the right colon was 5.2% between 1991 and 2010, rising to 19.4% per year between 2010 (IR = 1.2) and 2014 (IR = 2.5). The large increase in incidence rates for cancers of the right colon since 2010 were more marked among the most affluent young adults. Smaller but substantial increases were observed for cancers of the left colon and rectum. Incidence rates in those aged 50 years and older remained stable or decreased over the same periods. Conclusions Despite the overall stabilising trend of colorectal cancer incidence in England, incidence rates have increased rapidly among young adults (aged 20–39 years). Changes in the prevalence of obesity and other risk factors may have affected the young population but more research is needed on the cause of the observed birth cohort effect. Extension of mass screening may not be justifiable due to the low number of newly diagnosed cases but clinicians should be alert to this trend."
https://openalex.org/W2993221294,"The cecum of poultry harbors a complex and dynamic microbial community which plays important roles in preventing pathogen colonization, detoxifying harmful substances, nutrient processing, and harvesting of the ingestion. Understanding and optimizing microbial communities could help improve agricultural productivity. In this study, we analyzed the composition and function of cecal microbiota of Wenchang chicken (a native breed of Bantam) before and after fattening, using high throughput sequencing technology. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes V3-V4 hypervariable regions was used to characterize and compare the cecal microbiota of Wenchang chicken before fattening (free-range in hill) and after fattening (cage raising). Sixteen phyla were shared by the 20 samples. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the top two abundant phyla being 80% of the total microbiota. Samples of chickens prior to fattening were more dispersed than those after fattening. Twenty four microbes could be considered as biomarkers and 3 phyla revealed differences by variance analysis which could distinguish the two groups. Cecal microbiota in the before fattening group had higher abundance of functions involved in digestive system and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. The composition and function of cecal microbiota in Wenchang chicken before and after fattening under the two feeding modes, free range in hillside and cage raising, were found to be different. These results can be attributed to the differences in feeding modes and growth stages. In-depth study on the functions and interactions of intestinal microbiota can help us in developing strategies for raising Wenchang chickens and provide valuable information for the study of microbiota in the chicken gut."
https://openalex.org/W2993353895,"Illicit drug use rates are high among Canadian youth, and are particularly pronounced in Northern Ontario. The availability and accessibility of effective substance use-related treatments and services are required to address this problem, especially among rural and remote Northern communities. In order to assess specific service and treatment needs, as well as barriers and deterrents to accessing and utilizing services and treatments for youth who use illicit drugs in Northern Ontario, we conducted the present study.This study utilized a mixed-methods design and incorporated a community-based participatory research approach. Questionnaires were administered in conjunction with audio-recorded semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups with youth (aged 14-25) who live in Northern Ontario and use illicit drugs. Interviews with 'key informants' who work with the youth in each community were also conducted. Between August and December 2017, the research team traveled to Northern Ontario communities and carried out data collection procedures.A total of 102 youth and 35 key informants from eleven different Northern Ontario communities were interviewed. The most commonly used drugs were prescription opioids, cocaine and crack-cocaine. Most participants experienced problems related to their drug use, and reported 'fair' mental and physical health status. Qualitative analyses highlighted an overall lack of services; barriers to accessing treatment and services included lack of motivation, stigmatization, long wait-lists and transportation/mobility issues. Articulated needs revolved around the necessity of harm reduction-based services, low-threshold programs, specialized programming, and peer-based counselling.Although each community varied in terms of drug use behaviors and available services, an overall need for youth-specific, low-threshold services was identified. Information gathered from this study can be used to help inform rural and remote communities towards improving treatment and service system performance and provision."
https://openalex.org/W2991986094,"Background Anemia is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, therefore having a major impact on the overall health and survival of diabetic patients. However, there is a paucity of evidence of anemia among diabetic patients in Ethiopia, particularly in Harari Region. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of anemia and associated factors among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending public hospitals in Harari Region, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 25 to March 30, 2019. Probability proportion to size sampling, followed by simple random sampling, was utilized to select 374 T2DM patients. To collect the data, mixed methods were applied using questionnaires and checklist. Participants were tested for anemia based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Data was double entered to EpiData version 3.1 and exported into Stata version 14.0 for statistical analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted; Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were computed. Level of significance was declared at p-value less than 0.05. Results The study revealed 34.8% of the participants were anemic (CI: 28.7, 40.9). Being male (AOR = 2.92, CI: 1.65, 5.17), physical inactivity (AOR = 2.58, CI: 1.50, 4.44), having nephropathy (AOR = 2.43, CI: 1.41, 4.21), poor glycemic control (AOR = 1.98, CI: 1.17, 3.34), recent history of blood loss (AOR = 4.41, CI: 1.26, 15.44) and duration of diabetes for five years and greater(AOR = 1.72, CI: 1.01, 2.96)were all significantly associated with anemia. Conclusions Anemia was a major health problem among T2DM patients in the study area. Therefore, routine screening of anemia for all T2DM patients aiding in early identification and improved management of diabetes will lead to improved quality of life in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2994088798,"Spaying of female dogs is a widespread practice, performed primarily for population control. While the consequences of early spaying for health are still being debated, the consequences for behaviour are believed to be negligible. The current study focused on the reported behaviour of 8981 female dogs spayed before 520 weeks (ten years) of life for reasons other than behavioural management, and calculated their percentage lifetime exposure to gonadal hormones (PLGH) as a proportion of their age at the time of being reported to the online Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). We found that 23 behaviours differed between entire and spayed dogs, of which 12 were associated with PLGH and 5 with age-at-spay (AAS). Two behaviours, chewing and howling, were significantly more likely in dogs with longer PLGH. In contrast, longer PLGH was associated with significantly reduced reporting of 10 (mostly unwelcome) behaviours. Of these, one related to fearfulness and three to aggression. The current data suggest that dogs' tendency to show numerous behaviours can be influenced by the timing of spaying. They indicate how female dog behaviour matures when gonadal hormones are allowed to have their effect. The differences reported here between undesirable behaviours of spayed and entire dogs were in the range of 5.33% and 7.22%, suggesting that, for some dogs, partial or complete denial of maturation may reduce howling and chewing and improve retrieval and recall, but have other undesirable consequences. Veterinarians may take these data into account to discuss the risks and benefits of spaying with clients, and the timing of the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2992397026,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health concern. With a propensity to progress towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, NAFLD is an important link amongst a multitude of comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular and kidney disease. As several in vivo models of hyperglycemia and NAFLD are employed to investigate the pathophysiology of this disease process, we aimed to characterize an in vitro model of hyperglycemia that was amenable to address molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets at the cellular level. Utilizing hyperglycemic cell culturing conditions, we induced steatosis within a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2 cells), as confirmed by electron microscopy. The deposition and accumulation of lipids within hyperglycemic HepG2 cells is significantly greater than in normoglycemic cells, as visualized and quantified by Nile red staining. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), diagnostic biomarkers for liver damage and disease, were found to be upregulated in hyperglycemic HepG2 cells as compared with normoglycemic cells. Suppression of CEACAM1, GLUT2, and PON1, and elevation of CD36, PCK1, and G6PK were also found to be characteristic in hyperglycemic HepG2 cells compared with normoglycemic cells, suggesting insulin resistance and NAFLD. These in vitro findings mirror the characteristic genetic and phenotypic profile seen in Leprdb/J mice, a well-established in vivo model of NAFLD. In conclusion, we characterize an in vitro model displaying several key genetic and phenotypic characteristics in common with NAFLD that may assist future studies in addressing the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets to combat this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2993953294,"Introduction The concentration of dialysate calcium (dCa) has been suggested to affect vascular calcification, but evidence is scarce. Calcification propensity reflects the intrinsic capacity of serum to prevent calcium and phosphate to precipitate. The use of citric-acid dialysate may have a beneficial effect on the calcification propensity due to the chelating effect on calcium and magnesium. The aim of this study was to compare the intradialytic and short-term effects of haemodialysis with either standard acetic-acid dialysate with dCa1.50 (A1.5) or dCa1.25 (A1.25), as well as citric-acid dialysate with dCa1.50 (C1.5) in bicarbonate dialysis on the calcification propensity of serum. Methods Chronic stable hemodialysis patients were included. This multicenter randomized cross-over study consisted out of a baseline week (A1.5), followed by the randomized sequence of A1.25 or C1.5 for one week after which the alternate treatment was provided after a washout week with A1.5. Calcification propensity of serum was assessed by time-resolved nephelometry where the T50 reflects the transition time between formation of primary and secondary calciprotein particles. Results Eighteen patients (median age 70 years) completed the study. Intradialytic change in T50 was increased with C1.5 (121 [90–152]min) compared to A1.25 (83 [43–108]min, p<0.001) and A1.5 (66 [18–102]min, p<0.001). During the treatment week, predialysis T50 increased significantly from the first to the third session with C1.5 (271 [234–291] to 280 [262–339]min, p = 0.002) and with A1.25 (274 [213–308] to 307 [256–337]min, p<0.001), but not with A1.5 (284 [235–346] to 300 [247–335]min, p = 0.33). Conclusion Calcification propensity, as measured by the change in T50, improved significantly during treatment in C1.5 compared to A1.25 and A1.5. Long-term studies are needed to investigate the effects of different dialysate compositions concentrations on vascular calcification and bone mineral disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2993673111,"Dogs are often commensal with human settlements. In areas where settlements are adjacent to wildlife habitat, the management of dogs can affect risk of spillover of disease to wildlife. We assess dog husbandry practices, and measure the prevalence of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) in dogs, in 10 villages in Nepal’s Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), an important region for Himalayan wildlife. A high proportion (58%) of owned dogs were allowed by their owners to roam freely, and many village dogs originated from urban areas outside the region. CDV antibodies, indicating past exposure, were detected in 70% of dogs, and 13% were positive for P-gene, suggesting current circulation of CDV. This is the first detection of canine distemper virus in a National Park in Nepal Himalaya. Dogs were generally in good condition, and none exhibited clinical signs of CDV infection, which suggests that infections were asymptomatic. CDV exposure varied with village location and age of dogs, but this variation was minor, consistent with high rates of movement of dogs across the region maintaining high seroprevalence. Residents reported the occurrence of several species of wild carnivores in or close to villages. These results suggest a high potential for transmission of CDV from village dogs to wild carnivores in ACA. We suggest that control of dog immigration, along with vaccination and neutering of dogs could mitigate the risk of CDV spillover into wild carnivore populations."
https://openalex.org/W2992812637,"As a key homeostasis regulator in mammals, the MERTK receptor tyrosine kinase is crucial for efferocytosis, a process that requires remodeling of the cell membrane and adjacent actin cytoskeleton. Membrane and cytoskeletal reorganization also occur in endothelial cells during inflammation, particularly during neutrophil transendothelial migration (TEM) and during changes in permeability. However, MERTK’s function in endothelial cells remains unclear. This study evaluated the contribution of endothelial MERTK to neutrophil TEM and endothelial barrier function. In vitro experiments using primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells found that neutrophil TEM across the endothelial monolayers was enhanced when MERTK expression in endothelial cells was reduced by siRNA knockdown. Examination of endothelial barrier function revealed increased passage of dextran across the MERTK-depleted monolayers, suggesting that MERTK helps maintain endothelial barrier function. MERTK knockdown also altered adherens junction structure, decreased junction protein levels, and reduced basal Rac1 activity in endothelial cells, providing potential mechanisms of how MERTK regulates endothelial barrier function. To study MERTK’s function in vivo, inflammation in the lungs of global Mertk-/- mice was examined during acute pneumonia. In response to P. aeruginosa, more neutrophils were recruited to the lungs of Mertk-/- than wildtype mice. Vascular leakage of Evans blue dye into the lung tissue was also greater in Mertk-/- mice. To analyze endothelial MERTK’s involvement in these processes, we generated inducible endothelial cell-specific (iEC) Mertk-/- mice. When similarly challenged with P. aeruginosa, iEC Mertk-/- mice demonstrated no difference in neutrophil TEM into the inflamed lungs or in vascular permeability compared to control mice. These results suggest that deletion of MERTK in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and in all cells in vivo aggravates the inflammatory response. However, selective MERTK deletion in endothelial cells in vivo failed to replicate this response."
https://openalex.org/W2993259396,"Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring, sulfate-containing, organic compound. It has been shown to stimulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblast-like cells and bone formation. In this study, we investigated whether MSM influences the differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) into osteoblast-like cells and their osteogenic potential. Here, we report that MSM induced osteogenic differentiation through the expression of osteogenic markers such as osterix, osteopontin, and RUNX2, at both mRNA and protein levels in SHED cells. An increase in the activity of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization confirmed the osteogenic potential of MSM. These MSM-induced effects were observed in cells grown in basal medium but not osteogenic medium. MSM induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2), which may be responsible for the cross-linking of extracellular matrix proteins (collagen or osteopontin), and the mineralization process. Inhibition of TG2 ensued a significant decrease in the differentiation of SHED cells and cross-linking of matrix proteins. A comparison of mineralization with the use of mineralized and demineralized bone particles in the presence of MSM revealed that mineralization is higher with mineralized bone particles than with demineralized bone particles. In conclusion, these results indicated that MSM could promote differentiation and osteogenic potential of SHED cells. This osteogenic property is more in the presence of mineralized bone particles. TG2 is a likely cue in the regulation of differentiation and mineral deposition of SHED cells in response to MSM."
https://openalex.org/W2993837022,"There is growing evidence that modification of tropical forests to pasture or other anthropic uses (anthropization) leads to land surface warming at local and regional scales; however, the degree of this effect is unknown given the dependence on physiographic and atmospheric conditions. We investigated the dependence of satellite land surface temperature (LST) on the fraction of anthropized area index, defined as the fraction of non-forested percentual area within 120m square boxes, sampled over a large tropical forest dominated ecosystem spatial domain in the Atlantic Forest biome, southeastern Brazil. The LST estimated at a 30 m resolution, showed a significant dependence on elevation and topographic aspect, which controlled the average thermal regime by 2~4°C and 1~2°C, respectively. The correction of LST by these topographic factors allowed to detect a dependence of LST on the fraction of non-forested area. Accordingly, the relationship between LST and the fraction of non-forested area showed a positive linear relationship (R2 = 0.63), whereby each 25% increase of non-forest area resulted in increased 1°C. As such, increase of the maximum temperature (~4°C) would occur in the case of 100% increase of non-forested area. We conclude that our study area, composed to Atlantic forest, appears to show regulatory characteristics of temperature attenuation as a local climatic ecosystem service, which may have mitigation effects on the accelerated global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2992991269,"Participatory sensing is gaining popularity as a method for collecting and sharing information from distributed local environments using sensor-rich mobile devices. There are a number of participatory sensing applications currently in wide use, such as location-based service applications (e.g., Waze navigation). Usually, these participatory applications collect tremendous amounts of sensing data containing personal information, including user identity and current location. Due to the high sensitivity of this information, participatory sensing applications need a privacy-preserving mechanism, such as anonymity, to secure and protect personal user data. However, using anonymous identifiers for sensing sources proves difficult when evaluating sensing data trustworthiness. From this perspective, a successful participatory sensing application must be designed to consider two challenges: (1) user privacy and (2) data trustworthiness. To date, a number of privacy-preserving reputation techniques have been proposed to satisfy both of these issues, but the protocols contain several critical drawbacks or are impractical in terms of implementation. In particular, there is no work that can transparently manage user reputation values while also tracing anonymous identities. In this work, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation framework called BPRF to transparently manage user reputation values and provide a transparent tracing process for anonymous identities. The performance evaluation and security analysis show that our solution is both practical and able to satisfy the two requirements for user privacy and data trustworthiness."
https://openalex.org/W2993037236,"PCSK9 is a protein secreted by the liver that binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), causing LDLR internalization, decreasing the clearance of circulating LDL particles. Mutations in PCSK9 that strengthen its interactions with LDLR result in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and early onset atherosclerosis, while nonsense mutations of PCSK9 result in cardio-protective hypocholesterolemia. These observations led to PCSK9 inhibition for cholesterol lowering becoming a high-interest therapeutic target, with antibody drugs reaching the market. An orally-available small molecule drug is highly desirable, but inhibiting the PCSK9/LDLR protein-protein interaction (PPI) has proven challenging. Alternate approaches to finding good lead candidates are needed. Motivated by the FH mutation data on PCSK9, we found that modeling the PCSK9/LDLR interface revealed extensive electron delocalization between and within the protein partners. Based on this, we hypothesized that compounds assembled from chemical fragments could achieve the affinity required to inhibit the PCSK9/LDLR PPI if they were selected to interact with PCSK9 in a way that, like LDLR, also involves significant fractional charge transfer to form partially covalent bonds. To identify such fragments, Simulated Annealing of Chemical Potential (SACP) fragment simulations were run on multiple PCSK9 structures, using optimized partial charges for the protein. We designed a small molecule, composed of several fragments, predicted to interact at two sites on the PCSK9. This compound inhibits the PPI with 1 μM affinity. Further, we designed two similar small molecules where one allows charge delocalization though a linker and the other doesn’t. The first inhibitor with charge delocalization enhances LDLR surface expression by 60% at 10 nM, two orders of magnitude more potent than the EGF domain of LDLR. The other enhances LDLR expression by only 50% at 1 μM. This supports our conjecture that fragments can have surprisingly outsized efficacy in breaking PPI’s by achieving fractional charge transfer leading to partially covalent bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2993992216,"Rational new strategies are needed to treat tumors resistant to kinase inhibitors. Mechanistic studies of resistance provide fertile ground for development of new approaches. Cancer drug addiction is a paradoxical resistance phenomenon, well-described in MEK-ERK-driven solid tumors, in which drug-target overexpression promotes resistance but a toxic overdose of signaling if the inhibitor is withdrawn. This can permit prolonged control of tumors through intermittent dosing. We and others showed previously that cancer drug addiction arises also in the hematologic malignancy ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) resistant to ALK-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This is driven by the overexpression of the fusion kinase NPM1-ALK, but the mechanism by which ALK overactivity drives toxicity upon TKI withdrawal remained obscure. Here we reveal the mechanism of ALK-TKI addiction in ALCL. We interrogated the well-described mechanism of MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor addiction in solid tumors and found it does not apply to ALCL. Instead, phosphoproteomics and confirmatory functional studies revealed that the STAT1 overactivation is the key mechanism of ALK-TKI addiction in ALCL. The withdrawal of TKI from addicted tumors in vitro and in vivo leads to overwhelming phospho-STAT1 activation, turning on its tumor-suppressive gene-expression program and turning off STAT3's oncogenic program. Moreover, a novel NPM1-ALK-positive ALCL PDX model showed a significant survival benefit from intermittent compared with continuous TKI dosing. In sum, we reveal for the first time the mechanism of cancer drug addiction in ALK-positive ALCL and the benefit of scheduled intermittent dosing in high-risk patient-derived tumors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2994028422,"The aim of this study was to compare cases of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) with and without HIV in a state in northeastern Brazil.We performed a comparative study in the state's referral hospital for infectious/parasitic diseases located in Northeast Brazil between January 2007 and July 2017. The data obtained using this protocol were analyzed with SPSS.In total, 252 patients were evaluated, including 126 with coincident VL/HIV and 126 with VL alone. Both groups primarily consisted of male patients. The most commonly affected ages were 30-39 years in the coinfected group and 19-29 years in the VL group (p < 0.001). Fever and anorexia (p = 0.001), which were more common in those with VL alone, were frequently observed, while diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and dyspnea were more common in patients with VL/HIV coinfection (p<0.005). According to the hemogram results, leukocyte levels were lower in the VL group (p < 0.0001). Additionally, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels differed between the groups, with higher levels in patients with VL (p < 0.001). On average, HIV was diagnosed 2.6 years before VL (p < 0.001), and VL relapse was observed only in the coinfection group (36.5% of cases). Fever (β = +0.17; p = 0.032) in the first VL/HIV episode was identified as a risk factor for relapse (R2 = 0.18). More deaths occurred in the VL/HIV group (11.1%) than in the VL group (2.4%).VL/HIV was found to be prevalent among young adults, although the median patient age was higher in the VL/HIV group. The classic symptomatology of VL was more common in patients not coinfected with HIV; therefore, attention is needed in patients with HIV who present with any symptoms that suggest the presence of VL, especially in endemic areas. No cases of VL relapse occurred in patients without HIV, and death was more common in the VL/HIV co-infected group."
https://openalex.org/W2949911923,"Faced with limitations in data availability, funding, and time constraints, ecologists are often tasked with making predictions beyond the range of their data. In ecological studies, it is not always obvious when and where extrapolation occurs because of the multivariate nature of the data. Previous work on identifying extrapolation has focused on univariate response data, but these methods are not directly applicable to multivariate response data, which are common in ecological investigations. In this paper, we extend previous work that identified extrapolation by applying the predictive variance from the univariate setting to the multivariate case. We propose using the trace or determinant of the predictive variance matrix to obtain a scalar value measure that, when paired with a selected cutoff value, allows for delineation between prediction and extrapolation. We illustrate our approach through an analysis of jointly modeled lake nutrients and indicators of algal biomass and water clarity in over 7000 inland lakes from across the Northeast and Mid-west US. In addition, we outline novel exploratory approaches for identifying regions of covariate space where extrapolation is more likely to occur using classification and regression trees. The use of our Multivariate Predictive Variance (MVPV) measures and multiple cutoff values when exploring the validity of predictions made from multivariate statistical models can help guide ecological inferences."
https://openalex.org/W2991752287,"Objective Maternal obesity is associated with an increase in maternal, foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationships between maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index and (1) neonatal outcome in preterm infants, and (2) neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of corrected age. Method We conducted a single-centre cohort study. Infants born between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation between January 2009 and December 2013, hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit of Angers University Hospital, and with available data regarding maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index were eligible. Three groups were defined according to maternal body mass index: normal (n = 418), overweight (n = 136) and obese (n = 89). The primary outcome was neurodevelopment at 2 years of corrected age. Children with a non-optimal neuromotor and/or psychomotor assessment and/or a sensory disability were regarded as having a “non-optimal neurodevelopmental outcome”. Neuromotor function was regarded as non-optimal when cerebral palsy was present or when the clinical examination revealed neurological signs of abnormal muscular tone. Psychomotor assessment was regarded as non-optimal if the revised Brunet-Lézine test was < 85 or when the overall score in the parental Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) was < 185. Finally, sensory disabilities such as blindness and children who required a hearing aid were taken into account. The secondary outcome was the composite criteria of neonatal complications. Multivariable analysis included the following variables: mother’s age, gestational age, smoking during pregnancy, magnesium sulphate and steroid treatment during pregnancy, twin status, gender, socioeconomic status and social security benefits for those with low incomes. Results The study population was composed of 643 preterm infants. Among them, 520 were assessed at 2 years. There was no difference in the proportion of infants with non-optimal neurodevelopmental outcomes between the three groups (16.6% for obese, 13.5% for overweight, 16.9% for normal body mass index mothers; p = 0.73). According to multivariable analysis, being born from an overweight or obese mother was not associated with an increased risk of non-optimal neuro-development at 2 years (adjusted OR = 0.84 [0.40–1.76] for obese, adjusted OR = 0.83 [0.43–1.59] for overweight mothers). There was no difference in the proportion of preterm infants with a non-optimal composite criterion of neonatal complications between the three groups. In the multivariable analysis, being born from an overweight or obese mother was not associated with an increased risk of non-optimal neonatal outcomes (adjusted OR = 0.95 [0.49–1.83] for obese, adjusted OR = 1.18 [0.69–2.01] for overweight mothers). Conclusion In this large prospective cohort of preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation, we found no relationship between maternal body mass index and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of corrected age and no relationship between maternal body mass index and neonatal outcomes. Other prematurity-related factors may be more relevant for neurodevelopmental outcome than the mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI."

The results of this study are as follows: (1) the calculation results of traffic accessibility can reflect the real situation because spatial distribution has an obvious feature of circle-like structure, and the development level of each township has high consistency; (2) major change characteristics in land use are that cultivated and forest lands are decreasing, and construction land is increasing, and it is obvious that the increase of construction land is featured by spatial autocorrelation and clusters of construction areas along the city borders; (3) traffic accessibility has a significant impact on land use status and changes and socioeconomic development, while the number of facilities has weak impact on land use, which is a reflection of advanced infrastructure in the urban agglomeration; and (4) the construction of transport infrastructure promotes the transformation of land use from water to construction land, therefore, more emphasis should be placed on protecting the river system in future infrastructure construction so as to improve the ecological benefits in the river basin."
https://openalex.org/W2993557544,"Species richness and composition of current vegetation may reflect historical land use. We develop and examine the hypothesis that regional distribution and richness of fleshy-fruited woody plants, a group sharing life-form and dispersal system, reflect historical land use in open or semi-open habitats. Historical land use was based on maps from around the year 1900 for two regions in Sweden, and field data was gathered from surveys made in these regions. Species richness was positively related to historical land use indicated as open habitat in 1900. In one of the regions, five out of nine examined species were positively related to historical land use (with historical effect R2 ranging between 0.03 and 0.22). In the other region, we found a weaker positive relationship with historical land use in two out of nine examined species (R2 0.01 and 0.02). We conclude that current occurrence and richness of fleshy-fruited woody species is partly a legacy of historical land use, and that regions may vary in this respect. Based on a comparison between the two regions examined here, we discuss some potential causes behind this variation."
https://openalex.org/W2992125743,"Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii. Human Q fever is typically acquired through inhalation of contaminated aerosols, resulting in an initial pulmonary infection. In this study, BALB/c mice were infected with C. burnetii via an intratracheal (IT) route using a non-invasive aerosol pulmonary delivery device to directly place the living C. burnetii organisms into the lungs of the mice. The bacterial loads, pathological lesions, and antibody and cellular responses were analyzed and compared with those of mice infected via an intraperitoneal (IP) route. Compared with mice infected via an IP route, mice infected via an IT route exhibited a higher bacterial load and more severe pathological lesions in the heart and lungs at days 3 and 7 post-infection (pi). The levels of interferon-γ and IL-12p70 in the serum of mice infected via the IT route were significantly higher than those of mice infected via the IP route at day 3 pi. In conclusion, this murine model of acute C. burnetii infection via IT inoculation closely resembles the natural route of C. burnetii infection than that of IP injection. Thus, this newly developed model will be useful for investigating the pathogenesis and immunity of C. burnetii aerosol infection, as well as for the evaluation of therapeutic drugs and preventive vaccines of Q fever."
https://openalex.org/W2993074149,"The spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) assesses the risk of weaning failure by evaluating some physiological responses to the massive venous return increase imposed by discontinuing positive pressure ventilation. This trial can be very demanding for some critically ill patients, inducing excessive physical and cardiovascular stress, including muscle fatigue, heart ischemia and eventually cardiac dysfunction. Extubation failure with emergency reintubation is a serious adverse consequence of a failed weaning process. Some data suggest that as many as 50% of patients that fail weaning do so because of cardiac dysfunction. Unfortunately, monitoring cardiovascular function at the time of the SBT is complex. The aim of our study was to explore if central venous pressure (CVP) changes were related to weaning failure after starting an SBT. We hypothesized that an early rise on CVP could signal a cardiac failure when handling a massive increase on venous return following a discontinuation of positive pressure ventilation. This CVP rise could identify a subset of patients at high risk for extubation failure.Two-hundred and four mechanically ventilated patients in whom an SBT was decided were subjected to a monitoring protocol that included blinded assessment of CVP at baseline, and at 2 minutes after starting the trial (CVP-test). Weaning failure was defined as reintubation within 48-hours following extubation. Comparisons between two parametric or non-parametric variables were performed with student T test or Mann Whitney U test, respectively. A logistic multivariate regression was performed to determine the predictive value on extubation failure of usual clinical variables and CVP at 2-min after starting the SBT.One-hundred and sixty-five patients were extubated after the SBT, 11 of whom were reintubated within 48h. Absolute CVP values at 2-minutes, and the change from baseline (dCVP) were significantly higher in patients with extubation failure as compared to those successfully weaned. dCVP was an early predictor for reintubation (OR: 1.70 [1.31,2.19], p<0.001).An early rise in CVP after starting an SBT was associated with an increased risk of extubation failure. This might represent a warning signal not captured by usual SBT monitoring and could have relevant clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2994051783,"Diet-derived fatty acids have well-proven varying effects on human health. In particular, trans fatty acids (TFA) are associated with high risk of cardiovascular diseases whereas, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered to be beneficial to the human health. In this study, we report fatty acid profiling of 75 food samples from India belonging to three broad categories, viz., perishable deep-fried, non-perishable deep-fried and bakery. Lipids were extracted from the snacks and fatty acids converted into methyl esters and analysed by gas chromatography. Thirty-seven detected fatty acids were classified into four categories: saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), PUFA, and TFA, of which SFA represented the most abundant class in two-third of the samples. The highest average proportions of TFA and SFA of 3.26% and 56.1%, respectively, in total fatty acids were found in the bakery products; whereas, that of PUFA (38%) in the perishable deep-fried products. Principal Component Analysis depicted clustering of many samples according to the above-mentioned categories and helped predict the oil usage. Lower TFA content in all the samples and high proportion of PUFA in a quarter of the samples is suggestive of a better trend as compared to earlier studies."

https://openalex.org/W2993706670,"The biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae causes serious damage to Brassicaceae crops grown worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism of the Brassica rapa response remains has not been determined. Long noncoding RNA and mRNA expression profiles in response to Plasmodiophora brassicae infection were investigated using RNA-seq on the Chinese cabbage inbred line C22 infected with P. brassicae. Approximately 5,193 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, among which 1,345 were upregulated and 3,848 were downregulated. The GO enrichment analysis shows that most of these mRNAs are related to the defense response. Meanwhile, 114 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 31 upregulated and 83 downregulated. Furthermore, a total of 2,344 interaction relationships were detected between 1,725 mRNAs and 103 lncRNAs with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. We also found 15 P. brassicaerelated mRNAs and 16 lncRNA interactions within the correlation network. The functional annotation showed that 15 mRNAs belong to defense response proteins (66.67%), protein phosphorylation (13.33%), root hair cell differentiation (13.33%) and regulation of salicylic acid biosynthetic process (6.67%). KEGG annotation showed that the vast majority of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolism pathways and plant-pathogen interactions. These results provide a new perspective on lncRNA-mRNA network function and help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of P. brassicae infection."
https://openalex.org/W2994588602,"Objective To estimate the prevalence, incidence and persistence of anal HPV infection and squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SILs) among men living with HIV (MLHIV), and determine their risk factors. Methods We enrolled MLHIV ≥18 years, who attended 6-monthly visits for 18 months. Socio-behavioural data were collected by questionnaire. Clinicians collected blood sample (CD4+ count and HIV plasma viral load), anal swabs (HPV DNA testing) and anal smears (Bethesda classification) at each visit. HPV DNA testing and classification of smears were done at enrolment and last follow-up visit (two time points). Factors associated with persistent anal HPV infection and SILs were evaluated with generalized estimating equations logistic regression and standard logistic regression respectively. Results Mean age of 304 participants was 38 (Standard Deviation, 8) years; 25% reported >1 sexual partner in the past 3 months. Only 5% reported ever having sex with other men. Most (65%) participants were taking antiretroviral treatment (ART), with a median CD4+ count of 445 cells/μL (IQR, 328–567). Prevalence of any-HPV infection at enrolment was 39% (88/227). In total, 226 men had anal HPV DNA results at both enrolment and final visits. Persistence of any-anal HPV infection among 80 men who had infection at enrolment was 26% (21/80). Any persistent anal HPV infection was more frequent among MLHIV with low CD4+ count (<200 vs. >500 cells/μL; aOR = 6.58; 95%CI: 2.41–17.94). Prevalence of anal SILs at enrolment was 49% (118/242) while incidence of SILs among MLHIV who had no anal dysplasia at enrolment was 27% (34/124). Of the 118 men who had anal dysplasia at enrolment, 15% had regressed and 38% persisted by month 18. Persistent anal HPV infection was associated with persistent SILs (aOR = 2.95; 95%CI: 1.08–10.89). ART status or duration at enrolment were not associated with persistent anal HPV infection or persistent SILs during follow-up. Conclusion In spite of a high prevalence of anal HPV, HIV-positive heterosexual men have a low burden of anal HPV related disease. HPV vaccine and effective ART with immunological reconstitution could reduce this burden of infection."

The ubiquity of smartphones with embedded position (GPS) and motion (accelerometer) sensors motivates their possible use in these tasks. In this paper, we investigate the use of two real-time digital filters to achieve highly accurate yet reasonably priced measurements of boat speed and distance traveled. Both filters combine acceleration and location data to estimate boat distance and speed; the first using a complementary frequency response-based filter technique, the second with a Kalman filter formalism that includes adaptive, real-time estimates of effective accelerometer bias. The estimates of distance and speed from both filters were validated and compared with accurate reference data from a differential GPS system with better than 1 cm precision and a 5 Hz update rate, in experiments using two subjects (an experienced club-level rower and an elite rower) in two different boats on a 300 m course. Compared with single channel (smartphone GPS only) measures of distance and speed, the complementary filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 44%, 42%, and 73%, respectively, while the Kalman filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 48%, 22%, and 82%, respectively. Both filters demonstrate promise as general purpose methods to substantially improve estimates of important rowing performance metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2992078203,"Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) coupled with automated species identification is a promising tool for species monitoring and conservation worldwide. However, high false indications of presence are still an important limitation and a crucial factor for acceptance of these techniques in wildlife surveys. Here we present the Assemblage of Focal Species Recognizers—AFSR, a novel approach for decreasing false positives and increasing models’ precision in multispecies contexts. AFSR focusses on decreasing false positives by excluding unreliable sound file segments that are prone to misidentification. We used MatlabHTK, a hidden Markov models interface for bioacoustics analyses, for illustrating AFSR technique by comparing two approaches, 1) a multispecies recognizer where all species are identified simultaneously, and 2) an assemblage of focal species recognizers (AFSR), where several recognizers that each prioritise a single focal species are then summarised into a single output, according to a set of rules designed to exclude unreliable segments. Both approaches (the multispecies recognizer and AFSR) used the same sound files training dataset, but different processing workflow. We applied these recognisers to PAM recordings from a remote island colony with five seabird species and compared their outputs with manual species identifications. False positives and precision improved for all the five species when using AFSR, achieving remarkable 0% false positives and 100% precision for three of five seabird species, and < 6% false positives, and >90% precision for the other two species. AFSR’ output was also used to generate daily calling activity patterns for each species. Instead of attempting to withdraw useful information from every fragment in a sound recording, AFSR prioritises more trustworthy information from sections with better quality data. AFSR can be applied to automated species identification from multispecies PAM recordings worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2992479468,"Purpose This study aimed to use graph theoretical analysis of anatomical covariance derived from structural MRI to reveal how the gray matter connectivity pattern is altered after corpus callosotomy (CC). Materials and methods We recruited 21 patients with epilepsy who had undergone CC. Enrollment criteria were applied: (1) no lesion identified on brain MRI; (2) no history of other brain surgery; and (3) age not younger than 3 years and not older than 18 years at preoperative MRI evaluation. The most common epilepsy syndrome was Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (11 patients). For voxel-based morphometry, the normalized gray matter images of pre-CC and post-CC patients were analyzed with SPM12 (voxel-level threshold of p<0.05 [familywise error-corrected]). Secondly, the images of both groups were subjected to graph theoretical analysis using the Graph Analysis Toolbox with SPM8. Each group was also compared with 32 age- and sex-matched control patients without brain diseases. Results Comparisons between the pre- and post-CC groups revealed a significant reduction in seizure frequency with no change in mean intelligence quotient/developmental quotient levels. There was no relationship among the three groups in global network metrics or in targeted attack. A regional comparison of betweenness centrality revealed decreased connectivity to and from the right middle cingulate gyri and medial side of the right superior frontal gyrus and a partial shift in the distribution of betweenness centrality hubs to the normal location. Significantly lower resilience to random failure was found after versus before CC and versus controls (p = 0.0450 and p = 0.0200, respectively). Conclusion Graph theoretical analysis of anatomical covariance derived from structural imaging revealed two neural network effects of resection associated with seizure reduction: the reappearance of a structural network comparable to that in healthy children and reduced connectivity along the median line, including the middle cingulate gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W2992588408,"Introduction The public health burden of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) among women in rural areas of low-income countries is poorly addressed because health care seeking for treatment of RTIs is inadequate. There are gaps in knowledge about whether low care seeking behavior stems from challenges in accessing health care versus women's recognition of and response to RTI-specific disease symptoms. We aim to identify determinants of care seeking behavior and analyze the difference in utilization of health care resources in response to symptoms of an RTI versus non-RTI disease symptoms in rural India. This will aid in the design of interventions that promote RTI care seeking behavior. Methods Our analysis uses data from a cross-sectional, population-based surveillance survey among rural, non-pregnant women in Odisha, India, from 2013–2014 (n = 3,600). We utilized bivariate logistic regression to determine the degree that certain determinants are associated with a woman’s likelihood to seek RTI treatment, and chi-Squared tests to assess for differences in health care resources used for non-RTI versus RTI symptoms. Results Married women were significantly more likely to seek health care for RTI symptoms (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2–3.0) while unmarried adolescents were less likely to seek treatment (OR = 0.4, CI: 0.2–0.6). There was no association between RTI health care seeking with education level, belief about whether symptoms can be treated, or poverty. The majority (73.8%) of women who did not seek treatment for RTI symptoms reported not seeking treatment because they did not know treatment was needed. Women utilized formal health care providers at a higher rate in response to RTI symptoms than in response to their most recent symptoms of any kind (p = 0.003). Conclusions Community-based reproductive health education interventions are needed to increase health care seeking behavior for RTIs in rural Indian women. Interventions should target unmarried women and focus on both sexual health education and access to care."

This provided the first study about tunicates above hydrothermal vents worldwide. We chose seven different stations for sample collection. Sampling was carried out in September of 2009, 2014, and 2015 (autumn) and June 2015 (summer). A total of ten tunicate species were identified belonging to the classes Appendicularia and Thaliacea during the above periods throughout the area. Considering the limited diversity of these organisms worldwide (40 species are identified in each class), we affirm that Kueishantao, a shallow water hydrothermal vent field, with 10 species provided an unexpected biodiversity hot spot for pelagic tunicates. The sampling of the organisms in the surface waters provided higher abundances compared to oblique tows. Comparing results from three autumn seasons we found that temperature values correlated with changes in tunicate abundances. We discovered strong seasonal changes in pelagic tunicate abundances over the entire survey period, with the highest abundances observed during autumn."

The major result of the study is that for different irregular particle shapes, a range of beam powers generally leads to trapping. The trapping power range depends on whether the particle can be characterized as elongated or flattened, and the range is also limited by Brownian forces."

Being male, occupational exposure to contaminated soil with avian droppings, CD4+ T cell levels <100 cell/μL and viral load >1000 copies/mL were significant predictors of Cryptococcal antigenemia. Therefore, public health measures, adherence to ART and early treatment are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2991791361,"Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, especially Southeast Asia. International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date, no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers.Since 2006, Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometer-based non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature ≥38°C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection.In 2011, of the 3,719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries, 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged ≥60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-29.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.1), skin rashes (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI, 3.4-35.1), or a tympanic temperature ≥39°C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all p values < 0.05). Compared with travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for ≤7 days, those who traveled 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and ≥29 days were also more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2, 14.9, 39.0 and 12.0, respectively).These clinical and epidemiological features can facilitate timely recognition and diagnosis of imported dengue in febrile inbound passengers and therefore help prevent domestic transmission of dengue virus."
https://openalex.org/W2992995639,"One of the key arguments given to oppose the ""sin taxes"" is that they are regressive in nature and place disproportionately higher cost on the poor thereby reducing their net wealth. The response to a reduction in net wealth attributed to tax can potentially have significant effects through an increase in alcohol purchase by heavy drinkers reinforcing or even offsetting the direct price or substitution effect of these taxes in reducing alcohol consumption. Comparatively little is known empirically about the net wealth effect associated with changes in alcohol tax policy, and this study aims to help fill this gap in the literature. In this study we aim to estimate how the wealth effects of introducing a minimum unit price (MUP) of A$2.00 per standard drink vary over the distribution (quantiles) of alcohol consumers. The data used in this study is a longitudinal panel of 1,395 households' daily alcohol purchases (scanner data) recorded over a full year. Our analysis involves (i) quantile regression to estimate income elasticity over the distribution of consumption, and (ii) using these elasticities to estimate the potential wealth effects of a hypothetical change in alcohol prices from introducing an MUP policy. We control for consumer demographic characteristics, alcohol product prices and prices of close substitutes, and quarterly seasonal effects. We find that the estimated wealth effect from increasing the price of alcohol under a MUP policy is not significant at any point over the distribution of alcohol consumers. The policy increases per capita tax impact by less than A$5.00 per week for light/moderate consumers (50th-80th quantile) and decreases their daily per capita alcohol consumption by less than 0.02 standard drinks. Wealth effects attributable to an MUP policy are likely to be negligible. Substitution effects of the policy dominate the wealth effects in generating key health related outcomes such as reductions in alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2993649995,"We propose a novel approach to investigate the effects of sensitization, habituation and dishabituation in the brain using the analysis of the reaction-diffusion memory unit (RDMU). This unit consists of Morris-Lecar-type sensory, motor, interneuron and two input excitable cables, linked by four synapses with adjustable strength defined by Hebbian rules. Stimulation of the sensory neuron through the first input cable causes sensitization by activating two excitatory synapses, C1 and C2, connected to the interneuron and motor neuron, respectively. In turn, the stimulation of the interneuron causes habituation through the activation of inhibitory synapse C3. Likewise, dishabituation is caused through the activation of another inhibitory synapse C4. We have determined sensitization-habituation (BSH) and habituation-dishabituation (BHDH) boundaries as functions between synaptic strengths C2 and C3 at various strengths of C1 and C4. When BSH and BHDH curves shift towards larger values of C2, the RDMU can be easily inhibited. On the contrary, the RDMU can be easily sensitized or dishabituated if BSH and BHDH curves shift towards smaller values of C2. Our numerical simulations readily demonstrate that higher values of the Morris-Lecar relaxation parameter, greater leakage and potassium conductances, reduced length of the interneuron, and higher values of C1 all result in easier habituation of the RDMU. In contrast, we found that at higher values of C4 the RDMU becomes significantly more prone to dishabituation. Based on these simulations one can quantify BSH and BHDH curve shifts and relate them to particular neural outcomes."

Competing theories claim that neutral vs. selective processes have a greater influence on the genetic variation within a population. A key difference among theories is the relationship between population size and genetic diversity. Our study tests this empirically by sampling two species of herbivorous lizards (Dipsosaurus dorsalis and Sauromalus ater) and two species of carnivorous lizards (Crotaphytus bicinctores and Gambelia wislizenii) that vary in population size at the same locality, and comparing metrics of genetic diversity. Contrary to neutral expectations, results from four independent loci showed levels of diversity were usually higher for species with smaller population sizes. This suggests that selective processes may be having an important impact on intraspecific diversity in this reptile community, although tests showed little evidence for selection on the loci sequenced for this study. It is also possible that idiosyncratic histories of the focal species may be overriding predictions from simple neutral models. If future studies show that lack of correlation between population size and genetic diversity is common, methods using genetic diversity to estimate population parameters like population size or time to common ancestor should be used with caution, as these estimates are based on neutral theory predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2992743676,"Because animal feces contain organic matter and plant seeds, dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) are important for the circulation of materials and secondary seed dispersal through burying feces. Dung beetles are usually generalists and use the feces of various mammals. Additionally, the larval stages have access to feces from only one mammal species leaving them susceptible to changes in animal fauna and variations in animal populations. Here, we explain the effects of resource availability changes associated with sika deer (Cervus nippon) overabundance on dung beetle larvae feeding habits in Japan. δ15N values were notably higher in raccoon dog and badger dung than in that of other mammals. A dung beetle breeding experiment revealed that the δ15N values of dung beetle exoskeletons that had fed on deer feces during their larval stage were significantly lower than those of beetles that had fed on raccoon dog feces. The δ15N values of the adult exoskeleton were significantly lower in a deer high-density area than in a low-density area in large dung beetles only. It is possible that the high-quality feces, such as those of omnivores, preferred by the large beetles decrease in availability with an increase in deer dung; large beetles may therefore be unable to obtain sufficient high-quality feces and resort to using large amounts of low-quality deer feces. Small dung beetles may use the easily obtained feces that is in high abundance and they may also use deer feces more frequently with increases in deer density. These findings suggest that a larval resource shift associated with deer overabundance may affect ecosystem functions such as soil nutrient cycling and seed dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2994262302,"The changes in sap flow of Salix psammophila growing on a gentle slope (lower slope, P1), a middle slope (P2), and an upper slope (P3), and the response of sap flow to meteorological factors at the different slope positions were studied using the continuous and synchronized observations, the instrument were wrapped stem flowmeter EMS 62 sap-flow heat-balance-based system and the LSI-LASTEM automatic weather station. The results revealed that the soil moisture content was the highest and the growth conditions of Salix psammophila were the best at P1, followed by P2. At P3, however, although good apical dominance was observed, the proportion of dead branches was the highest. Furthermore, the daily variation patterns of sap flow on the three slopes presented as multi-peak bell-shaped curves. The daily accumulation changes in sap flow showed a trend of P1 > P3 > P2, and within the same diameter range, the sap flow at P1 was significantly different from that at P2 and P3, whereas the sap flow at P2 and P3 did not vary significantly. All the three slopes showed a significant and positive correlation with photosynthetically active radiation, atmospheric temperature, and vapor pressure difference, and a significant and negative correlation with relative humidity; however, the degrees of correlation varied slightly. The stepwise regression analysis showed that, at different slopes, different variables were selected for different branch diameters, but photosynthetically active radiation and atmospheric temperature played dominant roles on all slopes. This study reveals the sap flow pattern of Salix psammophila on different slopes and its response mechanism to meteorological factors, which was essential for understanding the restoration ability, physiological adaptability, and ecosystem stability of Salix psammophila communities."
https://openalex.org/W2992608228,"Protracted conflict is one of the largest human challenges that have persistently undermined economic and social progress. In recent years, there has been increased emphasis on using statistical and physical science models to better understand both the universal patterns and the underlying mechanics of conflict. Whilst macroscopic power-law fractal patterns have been shown for death-toll in wars and self-excitation models have been shown for roadside ambush attacks, very few works deal with the challenge of complex dynamics between gangs at the intra-city scale. Here, based on contributions to the historical memory of the conflict in Colombia, Medellin's gang-confrontation-network is presented. It is shown that socio-economic and violence indexes are moderate to highly correlated to the structure of the network. Specifically, the death-toll of conflict is strongly influenced by the leading eigenvalues of the gangs' conflict adjacency matrix, which serves a proxy for unstable self-excitation from revenge attacks. The distribution of links based on the geographic distance between gangs in confrontation leads to the confirmation that territorial control is a main catalyst of violence and retaliation among gangs. As a first attempt to explore the time evolution of the confrontation network, the Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra (BLV) dynamic interaction network analysis is applied to quantify the spatial embeddedness of the dynamic relationship between conflicting gangs in Medellin. However, the non-stationary character of the violence in Medellin during the observation period restricts the application of the BLV model and results suggest that more involved and comprehensive models are needed to described the dynamics of Medellin's armed conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2992612189,"The reaction-diffusion equation serves to model systems in the diffusion regime with sources. Specific applications include diffusion processes in chemical reactions, as well as the propagation of species, diseases, and populations in general. In some of these applications the location of an outbreak, for instance, the source point of a disease or the nest of a vector spreading a virus is important. Also important are the environmental parameters of the domain where the process diffuses, namely the space-dependent diffusion coefficient and the proliferation parameter of the process. Determining both, the location of a source and the environmental parameters, define an inverse problem that in turn, involves a partial differential equation. In this paper we classify the values of these parameters using Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained with numerical solutions of the reaction-diffusion problem. Our set up has accuracy of classifying the outbreak location above 90% and 77% of classifying both, the location and the environmental parameters. The approach presented in our analysis can be directly implemented by measuring the population under study at specific locations in the spatial domain as function of time."
https://openalex.org/W2994566212,"The hatching enzymes or choriolysins are key proteases in fish life cycle controlling the release of larvae to surrounding environment that have been suggested as target for novel biotechnological uses. Due to the large amounts of eggs released by the flatfish Solea senegalensis, during the spawning season, the hatching liquid properties and choriolysin-encoding genes were investigated in this species. A genomic analysis identified four putative genes referred to as SseHCEa, SseHCEb, SseLCE and SseHE. The phylogenetic analysis classified these paralogs into two clades, the clade I containing SseHCE paralogs and the clade II containing two well-supported subclades named as HE and LCE. The two SseHCE paralogs were intron-less and both genes were tandemly arrayed very close in the genome. The synteny and gene rearrangement identified in the flatfish lineage indicated that the duplication of these two paralogs occurred recently and they are under divergent evolution. The genes SseHE and SseLCE were structured in 8 exons and 7 introns and the synteny was conserved in teleosts. Expression studies confirmed that the four genes were expressed in the hatching gland cells and they migrate co-ordinately from the head to around the yolk sac close to the hatch with specific temporal and intensity expression profiles. Although the mRNA levels of the four genes peaked in the hours previous to larval hatching, the SseHCE and SseLCE paralogs kept a longer expression than SseHE after hatching. These expression patterns were consistent even when larvae were incubated at different temperatures that modified hatching times. The analysis of hatching-liquid using SDS-PAGE and zymography analyses of hatching liquid identified a major band of expected choriolysin size. The optimal pH for protease activity was 8.5 and inhibition assays using EDTA demonstrated that most of the activity in the hatching liquid was due to metalloproteases with Ca2+ ions acting as the most effective metal to restore the activity. All these data provide new clues about the choriolysin evolution and function in flatfish with impact in the aquaculture and the blue cosmetic industry."
https://openalex.org/W2994604415,"Previous studies have shown that Automatic Positive Airway Pressure devices display different behaviors when connected to a bench using theoretical respiratory cycle scripts. However, these scripts are limited and do not simulate physiological behavior during the night. Our aim was to develop a physiological bench that is able to simulate patient breathing airflow by integrating polygraph data. We developed an algorithm analyzing polygraph data and transformed this information into digital inputs required by the bench hardware to reproduce a patient breathing profile on bench. The inputs are respectively the simulated respiratory muscular effort pressure input for an artificial lung and the sealed chamber pressure to regulate the Starling resistor. We did simulations on our bench for a total of 8 hours and 59 minutes for a breathing profile from the demonstration recording of a Nox T3 Sleep Monitor. The simulation performance results showed that in terms of relative peak-valley amplitude of each breathing cycle, simulated bench airflow was biased by only 1.48% ± 6.80% compared to estimated polygraph nasal airflow for a total of 6,479 breathing cycles. For total respiratory cycle time, the average bias ± one standard deviation was 0.000 ± 0.288 seconds. For patient apnea events, our bench simulation had a sensitivity of 84.7% and a positive predictive value equal to 90.3%, considering 149 apneas detected both in polygraph nasal simulated bench airflows. Our new physiological bench would allow personalizing APAP device selection to each patient by taking into account individual characteristics of a sleep breathing profile."
https://openalex.org/W2993107966,"Research examining the reliability of stiffness measures during hopping has shown strong consistency in leg-spring stiffness (kleg), but high variability in joint stiffness (kjoint) measures. Sled-based systems (SBS) reduce movement degrees-of-freedom and are used to examine stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function under controlled conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability of kleg and kjoint during single-leg hopping within an SBSKinematic and kinetic data were collected on four occasions (Day_1, Day_2, Day_3 and Day_3Offset). Participants completed two trials of single-leg hopping at different frequencies (1.5, 2.2 and 3.0 Hz) while attached to an inclined-SBS. Stiffness was determined using models of leg-spring (kleg) and torsional (kjoint) stiffness. Statistical analysis identified absolute and relative measures of reliability. Results showed moderate reliability for kleg at 1.5 Hz between inter-day testing bouts, and weak consistency at 2.2 and 3.0 Hz. Examination of intra-day comparisons showed weak agreement for repeated measures of kleg at 1.5 and 2.2 Hz, but moderate agreement at 3.0 Hz. Limits in kleg reliability were accompanied by weak-to-moderate agreement in kjoint measures across inter- and intra-day testing bouts. Results showed limits in the reliability of stiffness measures relative to previous reports on overground hopping. Lack of consistency in kleg and kjoint may be due to the novelty of hopping within the current inclined-SBS. Constraints imposed on the hopping task resulting from SBS design (e.g. additional chair mass, restricting upper body movement) may have also influenced limits in kleg and kjoint reliability. Researchers should consider these findings when employing inclined-SBS of a similar design to examine SSC function."
https://openalex.org/W2993763703,"Equine laminitis is a disease of the digital epidermal lamellae typified by epidermal cell proliferation and structural collapse. Most commonly the disease is caused by hyperinsulinemia, although the pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Insulin can activate the epidermal growth factor (EGF) system in other species and the present study tested the hypothesis that upregulation of EGF receptor (EGFR) signalling is a key factor in laminitis pathophysiology. First, we examined lamellar tissue from healthy Standardbred horses and those with induced hyperinsulinemia and laminitis for EGFR distribution and quantity using immunostaining and gene expression, respectively. Phosphorylation of EGFR was also quantified. Next, plasma EGF concentrations were compared in healthy and insulin-infused horses, and in healthy and insulin-dysregulated ponies before and after feeding. The EGFR were localised to the secondary epidermal lamellae, with stronger staining in parabasal, rather than basal, cells. No change in EGFR gene expression occurred with laminitis, although the receptor showed some phosphorylation. No difference was seen in EGF concentrations in horses, but in insulin-dysregulated ponies mean, post-prandial EGF concentrations were almost three times higher than in healthy ponies (274 ± 90 vs. 97.4 ± 20.9 pg/mL, P = 0.05). Although the EGFR does not appear to play a major pathogenic role in hyperinsulinemic laminitis, the significance of increased EGF in insulin-dysregulated ponies deserves further investigation."
