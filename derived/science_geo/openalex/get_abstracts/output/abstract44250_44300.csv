https://openalex.org/W2005393972,"A 30-amino-acid segment of C/EBP, a newly discovered enhancer binding protein, shares notable sequence similarity with a segment of the cellular Myc transforming protein. Display of these respective amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The periodic array of at least four leucines was also noted in the sequences of the Fos and Jun transforming proteins, as well as that of the yeast gene regulatory protein, GCN4. The polypeptide segments containing these periodic arrays of leucine residues are proposed to exist in an alpha-helical conformation, and the leucine side chains extending from one alpha helix interdigitate with those displayed from a similar alpha helix of a second polypeptide, facilitating dimerization. This hypothetical structure is referred to as the ""leucine zipper,"" and it may represent a characteristic property of a new category of DNA binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089414651,"HeLa cell p34, homolog of the yeast cdc2+/CDC28 protein kinase, has been investigated. p34 was phosphorylated at two or more sites and existed in a complex with p13, the previously identified homolog of the suc1+ gene product of S. pombe. A fraction of the most highly phosphorylated form of p34 was also associated with p62, a newly identified protein that became phosphorylated in vitro. The phosphorylation state of p34, its association with p62, and the protein kinase activity of the complex were each subject to cell cycle regulation. In newly born cells early in G1, p34 was unphosphorylated, not associated with p62, and inactive as a protein kinase. Each of these conditions was reversed in G2 and the p34/p62 complex was maximally active as a protein kinase, with respect to both endogenous and exogenous substrates, during mitotic metaphase. p34 may act to regulate the G2/M transition in HeLa cells."

https://openalex.org/W1613736574,"Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is derived from an inactive precursor by proteolytic cleavage. To study IL-1 beta processing, we expressed the precursor in Escherichia coli, partially purified it, and used it as a substrate for various potentially relevant protease preparations. The precursor alone was virtually inactive, but incubation with membranes from human monocytes or myeloid cell lines yielded a 500-fold increase in IL-1 bioactivity. Western blot analysis of the incubated material showed that the 31,000-Da precursor is broken down to three major products, ranging from 17,400 to about 19,000 Da. The most active of these products is the smallest one, and it co-migrates during electrophoresis with mature IL-1 beta. Four purified known proteases were also tested for their effect on precursor IL-1 beta, and none of these products co-migrated with the mature protein. Chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease yielded slightly larger products, which were highly active. Elastase and trypsin yielded substantially larger products, and these had little IL-1 activity. The products of three of the known proteases were identified by NH2-terminal sequencing. These results show conclusively that proteolysis of precursor IL-1 beta generates biological activity and that the cleavage must occur close to the mature NH2 terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2019427862,"The formation of a dynamic tubulovesicular membrane network that resembles the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been observed in extracts of cultured chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF cells) using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. Initially, membranes in the CEF extracts appeared amorphous and aggregated, but with time, membrane tubules moved out along stationary microtubules. The membrane tubules formed new branches on intersecting microtubules and fused with other branches to form a network of interconnected polygons. The tubulovesicular network was solubilized by detergent and took on a beaded morphology in a hypotonic buffer. Formation of the tubulovesicular network required ATP and microtubules. The network did not contain elements of the plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, or mitochondria but could be labeled with ER markers. We suggest that the tubulovesicular network contains components from the ER and is formed by membrane associated motors moving upon microtubules in a process we call microtubule-dependent tethering."

https://openalex.org/W1547803736,"Ricin A-chain cleaves the N-glycosidic bond at A-4324 in 28 S rRNA when intact rat ribosomes are the substrate. Cleavage occurs at a concentration of the toxin of 1 X 10(-10) M, and specificity for this single residue is retained when the concentration is as high as 3 X 10(-7) M. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for the reaction is 2.6 microM, and the turnover number (Kcat) is 1777 min-1. The same N-glycosidic bond is cleaved by ricin A-chain in naked 28 S rRNA, but at a greatly reduced rate. The Km value for this reaction is 5.8 microM. The results suggest that the A-chain has a similar affinity for 28 S rRNA in ribosomes and in the absence of ribosomal proteins. Ricin A-chain has no effect on 23 S rRNA in Escherichia coli ribosomes, however, the N-glycosidic bond at A-2600 in naked 23 S rRNA is cleaved by the toxin; this corresponds to the ricin site in eukaryotic 28 S rRNA. Since the Km value (3.3 microM) for the reaction with E. coli 23 S rRNA approximates that obtained with rat liver ribosomes, it is possible that E. coli ribosomal protein(s) protect this site against ricin attack in intact ribosomes. Ricin A-chain also acted on naked 16 S rRNA cleaving the N-glycosidic bond of adenine at position 1014. The results suggest that ricin A-chain recognizes a specific structure in rRNA, perhaps a loop and stem having the sequence GAGA in the loop."
https://openalex.org/W1982910659,"The yeast alpha 2 protein is a cell-type-specific transcriptional repressor. It acts by binding to an operator located upstream of each of its target genes. In this paper, we describe a protein (GRM) that is present in all cell types and binds cooperatively with alpha 2 resulting in an unusual arrangement of the two proteins at the operator. A dimer of alpha 2 occupies the two ends of the operator and straddles the GRM protein, which binds to the center of the operator. Using mutant operators, we show that the recognition sequences for both GRM and alpha 2 are required for repression of a test promoter in vivo. Finally, we deduce that the GRM/alpha 2 cooperativity is mediated through a protein-protein interaction between GRM and the N-terminal domain of alpha 2. This conclusion follows from the observation that the isolated C-terminal domain of alpha 2 can co-occupy the operator with GRM but does not bind cooperatively with GRM."
https://openalex.org/W1489585221,"Cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils store a variety of cationic polypeptides, which exert in vitro a potent antibacterial action and are potentially involved in host defense mechanisms. From an acid extract of bovine neutrophil granules we have purified over 2,000-fold a dodecapeptide exhibiting bactericidal activity against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at 10(-7)-10(-5) M concentration. The purification procedure involved only two steps of ion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. The peptide, named bactenecin, has the amino acid sequence, Arg-Leu-Cys-Arg-Ile-Val-Val-Ile-Arg-Val-Cys-Arg, maintained in a cyclic structure by a disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues. Computer modeling of the dodecapeptide resulted in a conformation in which the chain adopts an antiparallel extended structure forming a gamma turn at residue 7."
https://openalex.org/W1986756715,"Newly synthesized proteins to be exported out of the cytoplasm of bacterial cells have to pass across the inner membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria ATP, a membrane potential, the products of the sec genes and leader peptidases (enzymes which cleave the N-terminal signal peptides of the precursor proteins) are required. The mechanism of translocation, however, remains elusive. Important additional roles for membrane lipids have been repeatedly suggested both on theoretical grounds and on the basis of experiments with model systems but no direct evidence had been obtained. We demonstrate here, using mutants of Escherichia coli defective in the synthesis of the major anionic membrane phospholipids, that phosphatidylglycerol is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized outer-membrane proteins across the inner membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1533581019,"Mutant LF-1 of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus has been described by Metz and co-workers (Metz, J. G., Pakrasi, H., Seibert, M., and Arntzen, C. J. (1986) FEBS Lett. 205, 269-274) to be inactive for light-driven oxygen evolution, despite a functional Photo-system II reaction center. A polypeptide, D1, implicated in the ligation of the primary photoreactants of photosystem II, was shown to migrate with an apparent higher molecular mass on LDS-PAGE in the mutant than in the wild-type (WT) strain. We show here that polypeptide D1 is synthesized in a precursor form in Scenedesmus WT. Following synthesis and insertion into the thylakoid membrane, a 1.5-2-kDa oligopeptide is clipped off with a half-time of 1-2 min, yielding the mature 34-kDa form of the polypeptide. No processing of polypeptide D1 from mutant LF-1 was observed to take place. We show here that polypeptide D1 of LF-1 displays an identical proteolytic fingerprint pattern to the precursor D1 polypeptide of the wild-type strain. These both have molecular masses about 1.5-2 kDa higher than that of the mature WT polypeptide. A polyclonal antibody elicited by a synthetic oligopeptide (14-mer), predicted from the psbA gene nucleotide sequence to be homologous to the COOH terminus of the precursor D1 of spinach, cross-reacts only with D1 of mutant LF-1 and not with mature D1 of spinach, Chlamydomonas, or of Scenedesmus WT. This observation demonstrates that the greater molecular mass of polypeptide D1 from mutant LF-1 and of Scenedesmus WT precursor D1 is derived from a COOH-terminal extension. We conclude that the LF-1 mutant lacks the appropriate nuclear-encoded protease which processes polypeptide D1 at its COOH terminus from the precursor to the mature form. Such processing would appear to be a necessary step toward the stable incorporation of manganese into the oxygen-evolving site."
https://openalex.org/W1589440578,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit membrane complex. It consists of two disulfide-linked polymorphic chains (either alpha-beta or gamma-delta heterodimers) which are noncovalently linked to five invariant chains. The CD3-gamma and CD3-delta chains bear N-linked carbohydrates and the CD3-epsilon and zeta chains are nongly-cosylated. Further analysis of the zeta chain in murine T cells demonstrates that it can exist as either a homodimer or disulfide linked to an additional protein with an apparent Mr of 22,000. The partial peptide map of this 22-kDa protein is different than zeta and all of the CD3 components. Like zeta, it has no apparent N-linked carbohydrate chains. We have chosen to refer to this subunit as the eta chain of the TCR. Ninety percent of zeta in cloned and nonclonal populations of T cells exist as a homodimer, and the remainder is found linked to the eta chain. The tight regulation of the zeta-zeta to zeta-eta ratio suggests an important functional role for these structural components of the TCR."
https://openalex.org/W1919855132,"Yeast sec53 cells incubated at a restrictive temperature (37 degrees C) accumulate inactive and incompletely glycosylated forms of secretory proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. A defect in glycosylation of alpha-factor precursor has been reproduced in vitro using membranes and cytosol isolated from sec53 mutant cells. Normal glycosylation is restored in reactions supplemented with a cytosolic fraction from wild type cells, with GDP-mannose, or with mannose 1-phosphate and GTP, but not with mannose 6-phosphate and GTP. This pattern of stimulation suggests that extracts of sec53 cells are deficient in phosphomannomutase activity or in the production of a precursor of mannose 1-phosphate. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that SEC53 encodes the yeast phosphomannomutase. Direct assay of soluble fractions from independent alleles of sec53 shows low to negligible phosphomannomutase, but nearly normal levels of phosphomannoisomerase activity. The residual phosphomannomutase activity in mutant cell lysates is thermolabile in proportion to the severity of the sec53 cell growth defect. Introduction of the SEC53 gene on a multicopy plasmid into sec53 or wild type yeast and into Salmonella typhimurium results in an increase in phosphomannomutase activity that correlates with elevated expression of the Sec53 protein. Finally, the Sec53 protein and phosphomannomutase activity cofractionate exactly in a 70-fold partial purification involving gel filtration and DEAE chromatography. The secretory defect in sec53 cells may now be explained by a deficit in GDP-mannose production."
https://openalex.org/W1604742230,"Abstract Polysialic acid-containing glycoproteins consisting of extended chains of at least 55 sialyl residues (DP55, where DP represents degree of polymerization) are expressed on human neuroblastoma cells, CHP-134. The strategy used for detecting these unique carbohydrate structures was based on the use of two highly specific prokaryotic-derived enzyme systems and an anti-polysialosyl antibody (H.46). These probes were developed for the detection of polysialic acid on neural cell adhesion molecules (Troy, F. A., Hallenbeck, P. C., McCoy, R. D., and Vimr, E. R. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 138, 169-185). Proof for the presence of long chain multimers of sialic acid was based on two types of experiments which utilized: 1) a glycopeptide fraction of CHP-134 cells, labeled metabolically with D-[3H]GlcN and 2) a membrane fraction from CHP-134 cells which served as an exogenous acceptor of [14C] NeuNAc residues in an Escherichia coli K1 sialyltransferase assay. In vitro, this enzyme CMP-NeuNAc:poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of [14C]NeuNAc from CMP-[14C]NeuNAc to exogenous acceptors containing at least 3 sialyl residues. In the first series of experiments, endo-N-acetylneuraminidase (Endo-N), a bacteriophage-derived enzyme specific for hydrolyzing poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl chains containing a minimum of 5 sialyl residues was used. Limit Endo-N digestion of the 3H-glycopeptides from the [3H] GlcN-labeled cells released short [3H]sialyl oligomers [( 3H]DP1-6) which were degraded to [3H]NeuNAc by exosialidase. Partial Endo-N digestion released a series of [3H]sialyl oligomers extending up to DP55. The longer (DP20-55) and intermediate sized (DP10-20) oligomers were isolated and converted to short oligomers ((3H]DP1-6) by retreating with Endo-N, thus confirming their identity as homo-oligomers of alpha-2,8-linked [3H]NeuNAc residues. In the second series of experiments, a membrane fraction of CHP-134 cells was radiolabeled in vitro with [14C]NeuNAc by E. coli K1 sialyltransferase. The membrane fraction had a major portion of radioactivity that was high Mr and polydisperse (Mr 100,000-250,000) as demonstrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Using Western blotting, pre-existing material of similar size was shown to react with antibody H.46.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1498646052,"Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is anchored to the plasma membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-glycan (PI-G) moiety. During processing of nascent PLAP, a 29-residue COOH-terminal peptide is cleaved out and the PI-G moiety is attached to the newly created COOH terminus of the mature protein. To investigate the structural requirements of the COOH terminus of the nascent protein for PI-G tailing and anchoring to the plasma membrane, we have transfected COS cells with wild type and mutant forms of cDNA encoding human prepro-PLAP. Utilizing a series of COOH-terminal deletion mutants of prepro-PLAP, it was found that to be PI-G-tailed the newly synthesized protein must possess an uncharged, predominantly hydrophobic amino acid sequence of a minimal length in the COOH-terminal peptide. While forms of prepro-PLAP with 17 consecutive hydrophobic residues in the terminal sequence yielded PI-G-tailed and membrane-bound products, prepro-PLAP mutants with 13 or fewer of such residues yielded hydrophilic proteins that were no longer PI-G-tailed but efficiently secreted into the medium. Studies using cassette mutants demonstrated that the precise amino sequence of the COOH-terminal region could be altered as long as minimal hydrophobicity and length was maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1541512177,"The mutator gene, mutT, has been cloned into an expression vector and overproduced in Escherichia coli. The gene product has been purified to over 90% homogeneity as judged by gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition of the protein and the sequence of the 20 amino acids of the N-terminal region agree well with the nucleotide sequence of the gene reported by Akiyama et al. (Akiyama, M., Horiuchi, T., and Sekiguchi, M. (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 206, 9-16) and indicate that the first of the potential initiation codons (position 164) of the open reading frame in the PvuII fragment carrying the mutT gene is the site of initiation of translation of the 15,000-Da polypeptide. A novel nucleoside triphosphatase activity which has a preference for dGTP is associated with the purified protein, and preliminary experiments are consistent with the notion that the mutT gene product is the enzyme responsible for this activity."

This portion of the protein has been expressed in an in vitro transcription and translation system and has been tested for its ability to interact with carbohydrates using affinity chromatography on immobilized sugars. A distinct specificity of the binding interaction is demonstrable, with fucose and galactose being the preferred ligands. However, the affinity of the expressed domain of the proteoglycan core protein is lower than that of the other known binding domains, since it elutes from the columns even in the presence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2067559738,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a well-characterized polypeptide hormone with diverse biological activities, including stimulation of astrocyte division. A soluble astrocyte mitogen inhibitor, immunologically related to the EGF receptor, is present in rat brain. Injury to the brain causes a time-dependent reduction in the levels of this inhibitor and the concomitant appearance of EGF receptor on the astrocyte surface. Intracerebral injection of antibody capable of binding the inhibitor caused the appearance of numerous reactive astrocytes. EGF receptor-related inhibitors may play a key role in the control of glial cell division in both normal and injured brain."
https://openalex.org/W1573298275,"Intact human neutrophils hydrolyzed N-formyl-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe (fMLP) and released Leu-[3H]Phe, cleaving 45-50% of the peptide within 20 min at 37 degrees C. The dipeptide after its release was then hydrolyzed to free amino acids by a dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11). This activity, present in plasma membrane-enriched fractions of neutrophil lysates, was also inhibited over 90% by phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11). Dithiothreitol and EDTA inhibited the activity to a comparable degree, suggesting the requirement for a heavy metal cofactor. Bestatin and amastatin, inhibitors of aminopeptidases (but not human kidney NEP), did not inhibit the rate of fMLP degradation but prevented the production of free phenylalanine and enhanced the accumulation of Leu-Phe. Of other inhibitors, alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin slightly enhanced the rate of fMLP hydrolysis by neutrophils, and others tested were ineffective. Rabbit antiserum to homogeneous human kidney NEP reacted specifically with a 100-kDa protein present in sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized neutrophils. The Mr of this protein was slightly larger than that of the kidney enzyme in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The antiserum incubated with intact cells specifically inhibited the degradation of fMLP over 70%. First, we confirm that NEP present on the plasma membrane cleaves fMLP at the Met-Leu bond; then the dipeptide Leu-Phe is cleaved by a dipeptidase. Finally, inhibition of NEP completely blocks fMLP-mediated chemotaxis. Thus, the enzyme may play an important role in modulating chemotactic responses."

https://openalex.org/W1569246897,"Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to produce mutants in the hinge region of the regulatory subunit (R) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, urea treated to produce cAMP-free regulatory (R), and analyzed in vitro for catalytic (C) subunit inhibitory activity in the presence and absence of cAMP. When assayed in the absence of cAMP, wild type R dimer inhibited C with an IC50 of 40 nM. Replacement of amino acid residue Ser-145 (the autophosphorylation site of yeast R) with Ala or Gly produced mutants which were 2-10-fold better inhibitors of C, while replacement with Glu, Asp, Lys, or Thr produced mutants which were 2-5-fold worse inhibitors of C relative to wild type R. When assayed in the presence of cAMP, all R subunits had a decreased affinity for C subunit, with Ser-145 and Thr-145 undergoing autophosphorylation. These results suggest that the amino acid at position 145 of R contributes to R-C interaction and therefore influences the equilibrium of yeast protein kinase subunits in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1572225275,"The effects of estradiol (E2) on c-myc proto-oncogene expression were studied in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. A biphasic modulation in c-myc mRNA levels occurs during the first 24 h of E2 (1 nM) exposure and in the absence of changes in MCF-7 culture growth, with transcript levels rising 4-6-fold within 1 h, returning to near base-line level after 3-6 h, and increasing again after 24 h of exposure. In contrast, the growth-inhibiting antiestrogen, tamoxifen (1 microM), reduces c-myc to 20% of the pretreatment level within 3-6 h of exposure, and this early decline is followed by a gradual return toward base-line level after continuous 72-h treatment. In ER-negative cells there is no change in c-myc expression following E2 exposure. MCF-7 nuclear runon assays show that c-myc transcription rates remain unchanged from base line for 24 h after E2 administration; as well, cycloheximide inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-myc expression and prevents E2 modulation of transcript levels. These results indicate that post-transcriptional modulation of c-myc by E2 is mediated by a labile degradative protein or otherwise dependent on active protein synthesis. We also developed MCF/nm and MCF/dm sublines by transfecting normal cells with human c-myc exons 2-3, transcriptionally driven by a retroviral long terminal repeat. Expression of the transfected c-myc genes in these sublines remains constant and elevated 10-fold, while transcript levels from the endogenous proto-oncogene continue to be modulated by E2. These findings suggest that in ER-positive breast cancer cells, E2 can modulate c-myc mRNA levels by a post-transcriptional mechanism that depends on gene sequences upstream from c-myc exon 2."
https://openalex.org/W1537778845,"Dihydrofolate reductase from wild-type Escherichia coli (WT-ECDHFR) and from a mutant enzyme in which aspartate 27 is replaced by asparagine have been compared with respect to the binding of the inhibitor methotrexate (MTX). Although the Asp27----Asn substitution causes only small changes in the association rate constants (kon) for the formation of binary and ternary (with NADPH) complexes, the dissociation rate constants for these complexes (koff) are increased for the mutant enzyme by factors of about 5- and 100-fold, respectively, at pH 7.65. In binding experiments, the initial MTX binary and ternary complexes of the mutant enzyme were found to undergo relatively rapid isomerization (kobs approximately 17 and 145 s-1, respectively). Although such rapid isomerization of complexes of WT-ECDHFR could not be detected in binding experiments, evidence of a slow isomerization (k = 4 x 10(-3) s-1) of the ternary WT-ECDHFR.MTX.NADPH complex was obtained from progress of inhibition experiments. This slow isomerization increases binding of MTX to WT-ECDHFR only 2.4-fold (much less than previously estimated). From presently available data, we could not determine the contribution of the rapid isomerization of complexes to the binding of MTX to the mutant enzyme. The Asp27----Asn substitution increases the overall dissociation constant (KD) 9-fold for the binary complex and 85-fold for the ternary complex. When it is also taken into account that a proton ultimately derived from the solvent must be added to MTX bound to the WT enzyme, but not to MTX bound to the mutant enzyme, these increases in KD for the mutant enzyme correspond to decreases in binding energy for MTX of 3.9 and 5.2 kcal/mol at pH 7.65 for the binary and ternary complexes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1508076001,"Limited proteolysis, gel filtration, and circular dichroism have been used to identify at least three distinct conformational states of a proteolytic fragment containing the ligand-binding domain of the chicken receptor for endocytosis of glycoproteins. Differences in the ligand-binding activity of intact receptor brought about by changing Ca2+ concentrations and pH values can be correlated with different physical states of the binding domain present under similar conditions. An active, ligand-binding state can be detected at either pH 7.8 or 5.4, but 10-fold higher concentrations of Ca2+ are required to stabilize this state at the lower pH. In all cases, the dependence on Ca2+ concentration is second-order, suggesting that two Ca2+ ions are bound to each domain. These studies demonstrate an interdependence between the effects of Ca2+ concentration and pH on both ligand-binding activity and receptor conformation, which is important to consider when describing the binding and dissociation of ligand during endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2098141388,"We have previously demonstrated that insulin stimulates glycerolipid synthesis and phospholipid hydrolysis in BC3H-1 myocytes, resulting in the generation of membrane diacylglycerol, a known cellular mediator. This led us to the original proposal that diacylglycerol may contribute to the mediation of insulin action, especially stimulation of glucose transport. The fact that agents such as phenylephrine and phorbol esters, which increase or act as membrane diacylglycerols, are fully active in stimulating glucose transport in this tissue lent further support to this proposal. In this paper, we demonstrate that the diacylglycerol analogues PMA (4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and mezerein (both possessing 12 beta- and 13 alpha-O-linked substituents as well as a 4 beta-hydroxyl group) each increase the Vmax of the glucose transporter as does insulin. Diacylglycerol generated by the addition of phospholipase C also stimulates glucose uptake to a maximum which is equal and nonadditive to that of insulin, while addition of the narrowly active phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C which generates the putative phosphoinositol-glycan mediator of Saltiel et al. (Saltiel, A., Fox, J., She Lin, P., and Cutrecasas, P. (1986) Science 233, 967-972) stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase in these cells without any effect on glucose uptake. Pretreatment of the myocytes with PMA resulted in desensitization of subsequent glucose uptake to stimulation by phenylephrine, but had no effect on stimulation of glucose uptake by phospholipase C or by insulin, indicating that PMA pretreatment primarily desensitizes agonist-induced polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis which, as we have previously shown, is not involved in the insulin-induced generation of diacylglycerol. This was confirmed by the absence of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization during insulin administration, as measured by the sensitive fluorescent probe fura-2 in attached monolayer BC3H-1 myocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that insulin-generated diacylglycerol satisfies several criteria for a mediator of insulin action, including the demonstration that insulin-stimulated endogenous diacylglycerol generation is antecedent to glucose transport and has an identical insulin dose-response curve and moreover that the magnitude and time course of subsequent stimulation of glucose transport is reproduced by the addition of the simple exogenous diacylglyerol, dioctanoylglycerol, in the complete absence of the hormone. These results establish a central role for insulin-induced glycerolipid metabolism in mediating insulin-stimulated glucose transport in BC3H-1 myocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1505165592,"N-Glycosylation occurs cotranslationally as soon as the growing polypeptide chain enters the endoplasmic reticulum, before the final native-like folded state is reached. We examined the role of the carbohydrate chains in the mechanism of protein folding. The in vitro folding and association of yeast invertase are used as an experimental system. External invertase contains approximately 50% carbohydrate, whereas cytoplasmic invertase is not glycosylated. The functional native state of both proteins is a homodimer. At pH greater than or equal to 6.5 and at protein concentrations below 3 micrograms/ml, the kinetics of reactivation and the final yields are similar for the two invertases. For both proteins, reactivation is a sequential reaction with a lag phase at the beginning. The nonglycosylated protein tends to aggregate during reactivation at low pH and at protein concentrations above 3 micrograms/ml. After separation of inactive material, the renatured protein is indistinguishable from the original native state by a number of physicochemical and functional criteria. The results suggest that the carbohydrate moiety does not affect the mechanism of folding and association of invertase. However, glycosylation improves the solubility of unfolded or partially folded invertase molecules and hence leads to a suppression of irreversible aggregation. Such a protective effect may also be important for the in vivo maturation of nascent glycosylated protein chains."

https://openalex.org/W44464786,"Insulin is able to down-regulate its specific cell surface receptor in cultured human lymphocytes. The effect of vanadate, a known insulinomimetic agent, was examined to determine whether it could mimic insulin to down-regulate the insulin receptor. Exposure of cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9) to vanadate (0-200 microM) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell surface insulin receptors to 60% of control, while insulin (100 nM) down-regulated to 40%. The vanadate effect, in contrast to the rapid effect of insulin, was slow to develop (4-6 h). Surface receptor recovery after 18 h exposure was rapid after vanadate removal (20 min), but it required hours after insulin suggesting the presence of an intracellular (cryptic) pool of receptors after vanadate treatment. Insulin binding to Triton X-100-solubilized whole cells after 18 h treatment revealed that total cell receptors had decreased to 50% of control after insulin but increased to 120 and 189% of control after 100 and 200 microM vanadate, respectively. Furthermore, vanadate inhibited the insulin-mediated loss of total cell receptors from 50 to 28%. Removal of cell surface receptors by trypsin before cell solubilization revealed that 100 microM vanadate increased insulin binding to 321% of control indicating an accumulation of intracellular receptors. Labeling of cell surface proteins with Na125I and lactoperoxidase followed by immunoprecipitation of solubilized receptors with anti-receptor antibody after incubation for various times up to 20 h and quantitation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that, while insulin shortened t1/2 from 7.3 to 5.3 h, vanadate prolonged receptor t1/2 to 14 h. No effect of vanadate was detected on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity with up to 4 h incubation at the vanadate concentrations used in this study. Furthermore, human growth hormone surface receptors were similarly down-regulated by vanadate. We conclude that 1) vanadate has an apparent insulin-like effect to down-regulate cell surface insulin receptors in cultured human lymphocytes; 2) in contrast to insulin-induced down-regulation which is associated with receptor degradation vanadate causes an accumulation of intracellular (cryptic) receptors and inhibits insulin receptor degradation; and 3) these effects of vanadate may be exerted on other cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1599790720,"A rapid and dramatic decrease in c-myc mRNA has been associated with the differentiation of a variety of cell types and may be a critical step in the maturation process. In this study, we have simultaneously measured steady-state c-myc protein and c-myc mRNA levels in differentiating Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Northern blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA indicated a greater than 85% decrease in c-myc transcripts following a brief exposure to the inducing agents, dimethyl sulfoxide or hypoxanthine. The short half-life of the c-myc protein (approximately 30 min) suggests that its level should fall in a similar fashion. Surprisingly, immunoblots of total cell proteins and immunoprecipitations of 35S-labeled protein revealed that c-myc protein levels remain approximately constant. This unexpected finding was accounted for in part by an increase in the c-myc protein half-life to 75-85 min. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins also demonstrated that the undifferentiated MEL cell synthesizes equal amounts of two c-myc-related proteins, p59 and p61. In contrast, MEL cell populations in the late stages of differentiation express predominantly the higher molecular weight species. This latter observation represents the first report of a temporal shift in the relative abundance of the two c-myc isoforms during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1578553020,"Abstract We have studied the limited cleavage of H2a in the H2a:H2b histone dimer by the H2a-specific protease under physiological conditions (neutral pH, 0.1 M NaCl) using a variety of histone-DNA reconstitutes as substrates and/or regulators of the partially purified enzyme. Under these conditions the protease cleaves H2a in dimer-DNA reconstitutes but not in octamer-DNA reconstitutes. Treatment of the enzyme with saturating amounts of H3:H4 tetramer-DNA prior to addition of dimer-DNA substrate results in complete inhibition of H2a-specific proteolysis. Sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments indicate that the protease binds reversibly to tetramer-DNA and that this leads to the reversible inhibition of enzymatic activity. Using three different tetramer-DNA complexes, we found native tetramer-DNA to be a more effective inhibitor than either trypsin-treated tetramer-DNA or acetylated tetramer-DNA. We conclude that under physiological conditions, the H2a-specific protease binds primarily to the highly basic amino-terminal domain of the H3:H4 tetramer, and this binding lowers the effective concentration of enzyme available to cleave H2a. Although no cleaved H2a is produced when protease is mixed with native octamer-DNA, incubation of the enzyme with acetylated octamer-DNA results in H2a-specific proteolysis. This is the first demonstration that the H2a-specific protease activity can be modulated by a physiologically relevant process (e.g. histone acetylation). We propose that the sequestered protease may be functionally regulated in vivo through reversible post-translational modifications to the NH2-terminal domains of the histone H3:H4 tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1499956845,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three genes TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3 encode catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. We have purified and characterized the catalytic subunit, C1, encoded by the TPK1 gene. In order to purify C1 completely free of C2 and C3, a strain was constructed that contained only the TPK1 gene and genetic disruptions of the other two TPK genes. The cellular level of C1 was increased by expressing the genes for C1 (TPK1) and yeast regulatory subunit (BCY1) on multiple copy plasmids within this strain. Purification was accomplished by a two-column procedure in which holoenzyme was chromatographed on Sephacryl-200, then bound to an anti-regulatory subunit immunoaffinity column. Pure C1 was released from the antibody column by addition of cAMP. The protein migrated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel with an Mr of 52,000. Kinetic analysis showed that the apparent Km for ATP and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly was 33 and 101 microM, respectively. The kcat was determined to be 640 min-1. The protein weakly autophosphorylated, incorporating less than 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of catalytic subunit. NH2-terminal sequencing revealed that the protein was blocked."
https://openalex.org/W1578495425,"S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase from Escherichia coli is rapidly inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. In the presence of excess N-ethylmaleimide inactivation follows pseudo first-order kinetics, and loss of enzyme activity correlates with the incorporation of 2 eq of N-[ethyl-2-3H]maleimide/subunit. Preincubation of the enzyme with methionine and the ATP analog adenylylimidodiphosphate reduced the rate of N-ethylmaleimide incorporation more than 30-fold. Two N-[ethyl-2-3H]maleimide-labeled tryptic peptides were purified from the modified enzyme by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The modified residues were identified as cysteine 90 and cysteine 240 by comparison of the amino acid compositions of these peptides with the protein sequence. These are the first residues to be implicated in the activity and/or structure of the enzyme. N-Ethylmaleimide-modified S-adenosylmethionine synthetase exists mainly as a dimer in conditions where the native enzyme is a tetramer. Accumulation of the dimer parallels the loss of the enzyme activity. When an enzyme sample was partially inactivated, separation of tetrameric and dimeric enzyme forms by gel filtration revealed that the residual enzyme activity was solely present in the tetramer and N-[ethyl-2-3H] maleimide was present predominantly in the dimer. Gel filtration studies of the tetramer-dimer equilibrium for the native enzyme indicated that the dissociation constant between the tetramer and dimers is less than 6 x 10(-11) M. Similar studies for the N-ethylmaleimide-modified protein indicated that the dissociation constant of the tetramer is approximately 4 x 10(-4) M. Upon modification the strength of dimer-dimer interactions is diminished by at least 9 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W1570283245,"Yeast invertase exists in two different forms. The cytoplasmic enzyme is nonglycosylated, whereas the external invertase contains about 50% carbohydrate of the high mannose type. The protein moieties of both enzymes are identical. The two invertases have been used previously as a model system to investigate the influence of covalently linked carbohydrate chains on the stability of large glycoproteins, and controversial results were obtained. Here, we measured thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding by various probes, such as the loss of enzymatic activity, and by the changes in absorbance and fluorescence. The ranges of stability of the two invertases were found to be essentially identical, indicating that the presence of a high amount of carbohydrate does not significantly contribute to the stability of external invertase. Earlier findings that invertase is stabilized by glycosylation could not be confirmed. The stability of this glycoprotein is apparently determined by the specific interactions of the folded polypeptide chain. Unlike the glycosylated form, the carbohydrate-free invertase is prone to aggregation in the denatured state at high temperature and in a partially unfolded form in the presence of intermediate concentrations of guanidinium chloride."

https://openalex.org/W1535760802,"Binding interactions between the membrane-associated vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and its prothrombin and factor X substrates have been investigated in liver microsomes. Both substrates are firmly attached to microsomal membrane fragments which also harbor the carboxylase. In vitro 14CO2 gamma-carboxylation of these substrates, triggered by reduced vitamin K1H2, resulted in release of 14C-labeled prothrombin precursors from the membrane fragments, but no release of 14C-labeled factor X precursors could be demonstrated, which suggested a difference in early processing of these substrates by the carboxylase. Warfarin treatment of rats resulted in a 3-fold increase in the membrane concentration of factor X antigens and a 20-fold increase in 14C gamma-carboxylation of the membrane pool of factor X carboxylase substrates. There was a dose-response relationship between the amount of drug administered to the rats and 14C labeling of the membrane pool of factor X carboxylase substrates. On the other hand, the membrane concentration of prothrombin antigens did not increase in response to the drug, and 14CO2 gamma-carboxylation of the membrane pool of prothrombin carboxylase substrates was the same in warfarin and saline-treated rats. The results demonstrate significant differences in the interaction between the carboxylase and its prothrombin and factor X substrates. It appears that the different interactions result from binding of the prothrombin and the factor X precursors to separate microsomal membrane proteins that are involved in the gamma-carboxylation reaction. Warfarin appears to induce the factor X precursor-specific but not the prothrombin precursor-specific binding proteins, which suggests a new mechanism for the action of warfarin. These binding proteins may be under different genetic control. Treatment of the prothrombin and the factor X carboxylase substrates with endonuclease H showed that the rat prothrombin and the human factor X carboxylase substrates are high mannose glycoproteins. The human prothrombin and the rat factor X carboxylase substrates did not, on the other hand, change their migration in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels after endonuclease H treatment. The data demonstrate differences in the glycoprotein nature of the rat and the human carboxylase substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1507669417,"Abstract In order to establish more firmly the immunoregulatory effect of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and develop a means to provide material for possible clinical use, the nucleotide sequence for PF4 was synthesized utilizing a ligation strategy of six duplexes ranging from 27 to 43 base pairs in length. The individual oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an automated system. The resultant gene segment (226 base pairs), which incorporated convenient HindIII and BamHI overhangs at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, was cloned into the pIN-III-ompA-2-expression vector in Escherichia coli, affording a fusion protein of Mr = 8900 with 7 additional amino acids at the amino terminus and 4 at the carboxyl terminus and with aspartic acid rather than asparagine in position 47. The recombinant PF4 (rPF4) was purified by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. It reacted with a monoclonal mouse anti-human PF4 antibody on a Western blot and in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rPF4 protein exhibited an immunoregulatory effect like that of human PF4 in its ability to reverse concanavalin A-induced immunosuppression in BALB/c mice."
https://openalex.org/W2164642652,"Weanling mice were fed ad libitum from age 23 to 37 days either an 18 or an 0.6% protein diet. Half the animals in each dietary group received supplemental triiodothyronine (T3, 0.2 mg/kg diet). T3 increased the primary in vivo antibody response of protein-deficient mice to sheep red blood cells, as measured by both splenic plaque-forming cells (PFC) per 106 nucleated spleen cells and serum hemagglutinin titers. T3 also increased PFC/spleen in well-nourished mice. The effect on protein-deficient animals was achieved although nutritional status in these animals, as estimated by weight loss and carcass composition, was further impaired by T3 supplementation. These results support the hypothesis that immune functions can be improved independendy of nutritional status in severe (wasting) malnutrition. Insofar as T3 was effective in a model of malnutrition that does not reduce serum total or free T3 levels, the phenomenon appears to represent a pharmacological action of the hormone.—Perry, K.

https://openalex.org/W1555564714,"We have identified a novel stress-inducible protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine and two-dimensional gel analysis. The protein was characterized biochemically to gain further insight into mechanisms regulating the stress response. It has a Mr = 118,000 and exists in two forms of pI = 4.2 (p118A) and pI = 4.3 (p118B). p118A and p118B are modified by N-glycosylation. Tunicamycin treatment revealed the presence of precursor proteins of Mr = 105,000, pI = 4.1 (p105A) and pI = 4.25 (p105B). The synthesis of p118A and p118B was almost completely shut off in cycling cells and was increased 11-fold following a mild heat shock. Both forms of p118 decayed in a biphasic manner under induced conditions. A tight correlation was observed in the kinetics of thermotolerance induction and p118A synthesis. Other forms of stress such as sulfur starvation which lead to arrest in the unbudded phase also resulted in enhanced synthesis of both p118A and p118B. However, in cell division cycle mutants blocked at various stages at the restrictive temperature, p118A and p118B had different synthetic patterns. Taken together, these data imply a role for induced p118 in proliferation arrest in the unbudded state."

These highly homologous proteins process a diverse range of growth factors and hormones to their biologically active form, usually by cleavage at a basic residue. gamma-Renin, however, cleaves at a Leu-Leu bond in a similar fashion to renin. We have identified and sequenced the gene and a cDNA encoding gamma-renin. The complete predicted amino acid sequence was determined, and residues that may be important in the unusual cleavage pattern exhibited by gamma-renin are discussed. The nucleotide sequence enabled design of a gene-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide which was used to determine in which mouse tissues gamma-renin is expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1591570669,"Monoclonal antibodies raised against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of Electrophorus electricus electroplaque have been used as probes to characterize putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in goldfish brain. One monoclonal antibody (mAb), mAb 47, recognized a protein which binds both (-)-[3H]nicotine and 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin with high affinity. Another monoclonal antibody (mAb 172) recognized a protein which binds (-)-[3H]nicotine but not 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin. Both antibodies precipitated a protein(s) (biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine) in the absence, but not in the presence, of excess purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo nobiliana. The dilution of mAb 47 that precipitated half of the maximum amount of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding protein was the same as that which precipitated half of the maximum amount of (-)-[3H]nicotine binding activity. When used in combination, the two antibodies precipitated more (-)-[3H]nicotine radioactivity than either antibody alone. The (-)-[3H]nicotine and 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding component-mAb complexes were characterized by sucrose density centrifugation. In the presence of either mAb 172 or 47, the (-)-[3H] nicotine binding component migrated further into the gradient, but only mAb 47 shifted the 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin peak. Incubation of solubilized brain extract with alpha-bungarotoxin-coupled Sepharose reduced the amount of (-)-[3H]nicotine radioactivity precipitated by mAb 47 but not by mAb 172. These data suggest that the antibodies may recognize distinct subtypes of (-)-nicotine binding sites in goldfish brain, one subtype which binds both 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin and (-)-[3H]nicotine and a second subtype which binds only (-)-[3H] nicotine."
