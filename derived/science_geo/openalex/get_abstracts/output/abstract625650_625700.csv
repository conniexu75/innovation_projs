https://openalex.org/W2910178341,"An increase in antifungal resistant Candida strains has been reported in recent years. The aim of this study was to detect mutations in resistance genes of azole-resistant, echinocandin-resistant or multi-resistant strains using next generation sequencing technology, which allows the analysis of multiple resistance mechanisms in a high throughput setting.Forty clinical Candida isolates (16 C. albicans and 24 C. glabrata strains) with MICs for azoles and echinocandins above the clinical EUCAST breakpoint were examined. The genes ERG11, ERG3, TAC1 and GSC1 (FKS1) in C. albicans, as well as ERG11, CgPDR1, FKS1 and FKS2 in C. glabrata were sequenced.Fifty-four different missense mutations were identified, 13 of which have not been reported before. All nine echinocandin-resistant Candida isolates showed mutations in the hot spot (HS) regions of FKS1, FKS2 or GSC1. In ERG3 two homozygous premature stop codons were identified in two highly azole-resistant and moderately echinocandin-resistant C. albicans strains. Seven point mutations in ERG11 were determined in azole-resistant C. albicans whereas in azole-resistant C. glabrata, no ERG11 mutations were detected. In 10 out of 13 azole-resistant C. glabrata, 12 different potential gain-of-function mutations in the transcription factor CgPDR1 were verified, which are associated with an overexpression of the efflux pumps CDR1/2.This study showed that next generation sequencing allows the thorough investigation of a large number of isolates more cost efficient and faster than conventional Sanger sequencing. Targeting different resistance genes and a large sample size of highly resistant strains allows a better determination of the relevance of the different mutations, and to differentiate between causal mutations and polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2910575871,"Many members of the public and important stakeholders operating at the upper end of the food chain, may be unfamiliar with how food is produced, including within modern animal production systems. The intensification of production is becoming increasingly common in modern farming. However, intensive systems are particularly susceptible to production diseases, with potentially negative consequences for farm animal welfare (FAW). Previous research has demonstrated that the public are concerned about FAW, yet there has been little research into attitudes towards production diseases, and their approval of interventions to reduce these. This research explores the public's attitudes towards, and preferences for, FAW interventions in five European countries (Finland, Germany, Poland, Spain and the UK). An online survey was conducted for broilers (n = 789), layers (n = 790) and pigs (n = 751). Data were analysed by means of Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. The results suggest that the public have concerns regarding intensive production systems, in relation to FAW, naturalness and the use of antibiotics. The most preferred interventions were the most ""proactive"" interventions, namely improved housing and hygiene measures. The least preferred interventions were medicine-based, which raised humane animal care and food safety concerns amongst respondents. The results highlighted the influence of the identified concerns, perceived risks and benefits on attitudes and subsequent behavioural intention, and the importance of supply chain stakeholders addressing these concerns in the subsequent communications with the public."

In this study, osteoinductive and osteoconductive super paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNP) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles were incorporated into a di-block copolymer based thermo-responsive hydrogel, methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-polyalanine (mPA), at various concentrations to afford composite, injectable hydrogels. Incorporating nanoparticles into the thermo-responsive hydrogel increased the complex viscosity and decreased the gelation temperature of the starting hydrogel. Functionally, the integration of inorganic nanoparticles modulated bio-markers of bone differentiation and enhanced bone mineralization. Moreover, this study adopted the emerging method of using either a supplementary static magnetic field (SMF) or a moving magnetic field to elicit biological response. These results demonstrate that combining external (magnet) and internal (scaffold) magnetisms is a promising approach for bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2909428958,"Treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with direct acting antivirals (DAA) can prevent new infections since cured individuals cannot transmit HCV. However, as DAAs are expensive, many countries defer treatment to advances stages of fibrosis, which results in ongoing transmission. We assessed the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of treatment initiation in different stages of infection in the Netherlands where the epidemic is mainly concentrated among HIV-infected MSMs.We calibrated a deterministic mathematical model to the Dutch HCV epidemic among HIV-infected MSM to compare three different DAA treatment scenarios: 1) immediate treatment, 2) treatment delayed to chronic infection allowing spontaneous clearance to occur, 3) treatment delayed until F2 fibrosis stage. All scenarios are simulated from 2015 onwards. Total costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and epidemiological impact were calculated from a providers perspective over a lifetime horizon. We used a DAA price of €35,000 and 3% discounting rates for cost and QALYs.Immediate DAA treatment lowers the incidence from 1.2/100 person-years to 0.2/100 person-years (interquartile range 0.1-0.2) and the prevalence from 5.0/100 person-years to 0.5/100 person-years (0.4-0.6) after 20 years. Delayed treatment awaiting spontaneous clearance will result in a similar reduction. However, further delayed treatment to F2 will increases the incidence and prevalence. Earlier treatment will cost society €68.3 and €75.1 million over a lifetime for immediate and awaiting until the chronic stage, respectively. The cost will increase if treatment is further delayed until F2 to €98.4 million. Immediate treatment will prevent 7070 new infections and gains 3419 (3019-3854) QALYs compared to F2 treatment resulting in a cost saving ICER. Treatment in the chronic stage is however dominated.Early DAA treatment for HIV-infected MSM is an excellent and sustainable tool to meet the WHO goal of eliminating HCV in 2030."
https://openalex.org/W2909858610,"Environmental degradation is causing global warming, which is of the utmost concern to both physical and social scientists. A number of potential determinants of environmental degradation are analysed in the literature. This study examines the role of government expenditure and financial development in environmental degradation in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for the Venezuelan economy. Time series data have been analysed for this purpose. The long-term relationship between the variables in this study is established through a bounds test in the presence of an unknown structural break. The results of this study confirm the EKC hypothesis. It is found that energy use is harming the quality of the environment not only in the long run but also in the short run. This study finds a positive impact of government expenditure on environmental degradation, which indicates that the Venezuelan government is not taking its expenditure for a sustainable environment into account. Moreover, this study finds that financial development is hindering environmental degradation. This means that financial institutions in Venezuela can help to develop the concept of sustainable energy in the country and the Venezuelan government can reduce carbon emissions through financial development."
https://openalex.org/W2909926438,"The imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses plays a pivotal role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development and progression. To clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease, we performed a temporal analysis of immune response-mediated inflammatory progression in a cigarette smoke (CS)-induced mouse model with a focus on the balance between Th17 and Treg responses.C57BL/6 mice were exposed to CS for 1, 3 or 6 months to induce COPD, and the control groups were maintained under filtered air conditions for the same time intervals. We then performed functional (respiratory mechanics) and structural (alveolar enlargement) analyses. We also quantified the NF-κB, TNF-α, CD4, CD8, CD20, IL-17, IL-6, FOXP3, IL-10, or TGF-β positive cells in peribronchovascular areas and assessed FOXP3 and IL-10 expression through double-label immunofluorescence. Additionally, we evaluated the gene expression of NF-κB and TNF in bronchiolar epithelial cells.Our CS-induced COPD model exhibited an increased proinflammatory immune response (increased expression of the NF-κB, TNF-α, CD4, CD8, CD20, IL-17, and IL-6 markers) with a concomitantly decreased anti-inflammatory immune response (FOXP3, IL-10, and TGF-β markers) compared with the control mice. These changes in the immune responses were associated with increased alveolar enlargement and impaired lung function starting on the first month and third month of CS exposure, respectively, compared with the control mice.Our results showed that the microenvironmental stimuli produced by the release of cytokines during COPD progression lead to a Th17/Treg imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2909914704,"Explaining the processes underlying the emergence of monument construction is a major theme in contemporary anthropological archaeology, and recent studies have employed spatially-explicit modeling to explain these patterns. Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) is famous for its elaborate ritual architecture, particularly numerous monumental platforms (ahu) and statuary (moai). To date, however, we lack explicit modeling to explain spatial and temporal aspects of monument construction. Here, we use spatially-explicit point-process modeling to explore the potential relations between ahu construction locations and subsistence resources, namely, rock mulch agricultural gardens, marine resources, and freshwater sources—the three most critical resources on Rapa Nui. Through these analyses, we demonstrate the central importance of coastal freshwater seeps for precontact populations. Our results suggest that ahu locations are most parsimoniously explained by distance from freshwater sources, in particular coastal seeps, with important implications for community formation and inter-community competition in precontact times."
https://openalex.org/W2908972532,"Prg4, also known as Lubricin, acts as a joint/boundary lubricant. Prg4 has been used to prevent surgically induced osteoarthritis (OA) in mice. Surgically induced OA serves as a good model for post-traumatic OA but is not ideal for recapitulating age-related OA. Reduced expression of the TGF-β type II receptor (TGFβR2) is associated with age-related OA in clinical samples, so we previously characterized a mouse model that exhibits OA due to expression of a mutated dominant-negative form of TGFβR2 (DNIIR). Prg4 expression was significantly reduced in DNIIR mice. Furthermore, we showed that Prg4 was a transcriptional target of TGF-ß via activation of Smad3, the main signal transducing protein for TGF-ß. The objective of the present study was to determine whether maintenance of Prg4, a down-stream transcriptional target of TGF-ß, prevents OA associated with attenuated TGF-ß signaling in mice.Wild-type, DNIIR, and bitransgenic mice that express both DNIIR and Prg4, were compared. Mice were assessed with a foot misplacement behavioral test, μCT, histology, and Western blot.Compared to DNIIR mice, bitransgenic DNIIR+Prg4 mice missed 1.3 (0.4, 2.1) fewer steps while walking (mean difference (95% confidence interval)), exhibited a cartilage fibrillation score that was 1.8 (0.4, 3.1) points lower, exhibited cartilage that was 28.2 (0.5, 55.9) μm thicker, and exhibited an OARSI score that was 6.8 (-0.9, 14.5) points lower. However, maintenance of Prg4 expression did not restore levels of phosphorylated Smad3 in DNIIR mice, indicating Prg4 does not simply stimulate TGF-ß signaling.Our results indicate that maintenance of Prg4 expression prevents OA progression associated with reduced TGF-β signaling in mice. Since there was no evidence that Prg4 acts by stimulating the TGF-ß signaling cascade, we propose that Prg4, a transcriptional target of TGF-ß, attenuates OA progression through its joint lubrication function."
https://openalex.org/W2909045589,"Introduction Medication review (MR) is a pharmacy practice conducted in different settings that has a positive impact on patient health outcomes. In this context, systematic reviews on MR have restricted the assessment of this practice using criteria such as methodological quality, practice settings, and patient outcomes. Therefore, expanding research on this subject is necessary to facilitate the understanding of the effectiveness of MR and the comparison of its results. Aim To examine the panorama of systematic reviews on pharmacist-participated MR in different practice settings. Methods A literature search was undertaken in Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases through January 2018 using keywords for ""medication review"", ""systematic review"", and ""pharmacist"". Two independents investigators screened titles, abstracts, full texts; assessed methodological quality; and, extracted data from the included reviews. Results Seventeen systematic reviews were included, of which sixteen presented low to moderate methodological quality. Most of reviews were conducted in Europe (n = 7), included controlled primary studies (n = 16), elderly patients (n = 9), and long-term care facilities (n = 8). Seven reviews addressed MR as an intervention and thirteen reviews cited collaboration between physicians and pharmacists in the practice of MR. In addition, thirteen terminologies for MR were used and the main objective was to identify and solve drug-related problems and/or optimize the drug use (n = 11). Conclusion There is considerable heterogeneity in practice settings, population, definitions, terminologies, and approach of MR as well as poor description of patient care process in the systematic reviews. These facts may limit the comparison, summarization and understanding of the results of MR. Furthermore, the methodological quality of most systematic reviews was below ideal. Thus, international agreement on the MR process is necessary to assess, compare and optimize the quality of care provided."
https://openalex.org/W2908874850,"Q fever is a worldwide zoonotic disease reported in humans and many animal species including cattle. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of Coxiella (C.) burnetii shedding in Polish dairy cattle herds and to identify the pathogen's genotypes and sequence types (STs) using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and multispacer sequence typing (MST) methods. The presence of C. burnetii DNA was detected using a commercial real-time PCR kit, targeting the IS1111 element. Overall, 1,439 samples from 279 herds were tested including: 897 individual milk specimens, 101 bulk tank milk samples, 409 genital tract swabs and 32 placentas. Furthermore, 30 consumer milk samples, including 10 from vending machines and 77 dairy products were also analyzed. C. burnetii shedding was confirmed in 31.54% of tested cattle herds as well as in 69.16% of consumer milk and dairy products. Among real-time PCR-positive samples, 49 specimens obtained from 49 cattle herds and 8 samples of purchased dairy products were selected for genotyping. Overall, five previously known MLVA genotypes (I, J, BG, BE, and NM) and three new ones (proposed as PL1, PL2, and PL3) were identified. Two MST sequence types were recorded: ST16 and a novel sequence (ST61). The new genotypes and sequence types need further research particularly into their pathogenicity to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2909965463,"A decline in malaria morbidity and mortality has been documented in Ethiopia since 2005 following a scale-up of the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). However, universal access to LLINs ownership and use has not yet been achieved. This study aimed to determine ownership and use of LLINs over time in south-central Ethiopia.A cohort of 17,142 individuals residing in 3,006 households was followed-up from October 2014 to January 2017 (121 weeks). New PermaNet2.0 LLINs were given to households in October 2014. Once per week, the LLIN use status was documented for each individual. A survey was conducted after 110 weeks of LLIN distribution to determine LLIN ownership. A multilevel negative binomial regression model was fitted to identify significant predictors of LLIN use.At baseline, the LLIN ownership was 100%. After 110 weeks only 233 (8%) of the households owned at least one LLIN. The median proportion of LLIN use per individuals during the study period was only 14%. During the first year (week 1-52) the average LLIN use per individuals was 36% and during the second year (week 53-104) it was 4.6%. More frequent LLIN use was reported among age group [5-14 years (adjusted IRR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22), 15-24 years (adjusted IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.45), ≥25 years (adjusted IRR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.83-2.17)] compared to <5 years, and household head educational status [read and write (adjusted IRR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.26), primary (adjusted IRR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.27), secondary or above (adjusted IRR = 1.20, 95% CI (1.11-1.30)] compared to illiterate. Having a family size of over five persons (adjusted IRR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.84) was associated with less frequent use of LLINs compared to a family size of ≤5 persons.The study showed a low LLIN ownership after 110 weeks and a low LLIN use during 121 weeks of follow-up, despite 100% LLIN coverage at baseline. The study highlights the need to design strategies to increase LLIN ownership and use for setting similar to those studied here."
https://openalex.org/W2910812212,"Oropharyngeal dysphagia is frequent in hospitalized post-stroke patients and is associated with increased mortality and comorbidities. The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the impact of dysphagia on Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and costs. The hospital perspective was used to assess costs.Hospital discharge databases comparing hospital stays for ischemic stroke associated with dysphagia vs stroke without dysphagia in France and Switzerland were analyzed. The French Medical Information System Program (PMSI) database analysis focused on 62'297 stays for stroke in the public sector. 6'037 hospital stays for stroke were analyzed from the Swiss OFS (Office fédéral de la statistique: Statistique des coûts par cas 2012) database. Diagnosis codes and listing of procedures were used to identify dysphagia in stroke patients.Patients with post-stroke dysphagia accounted for 8.4% of stroke hospital stays in Switzerland, which is consistent with recently reported prevalence of dysphagia at hospital discharge (Arnold et al, 2016). The French database analysis identified 4.2% stays with post-stroke dysphagia. We hypothesize that the difference between the Swiss and French datasets may be explained by the limitations of an analysis based on diagnosis and procedure coding. Patients with post-stroke dysphagia stayed longer at hospitals (LOS of 23.7 vs. 11.8 days in France and LOS of 14.9 vs. 8.9 days in Switzerland) compared with patients without post-stroke dysphagia. Post-stroke dysphagia was associated with about €3'000 and CHF14'000 cost increase in France and Switzerland respectively.In this study post-stroke dysphagia was associated with increased LOS and higher hospital costs. It is difficult to isolate the impact of dysphagia in patients with multiple symptoms and disabilities impacting rehabilitation and recovery. After adjusting for confounding factors by matching stays according to age, sex and stroke complications, post-stroke dysphagia association with increased LOS and higher hospital costs was found to be independent of sensory or motor complications.Post-stroke dysphagia is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs."
https://openalex.org/W2908785533,"Background A thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 2b is defined as a good recanalization result although the reperfusion may only cover 50% of the affected territory. An additional mTICI2c category was introduced to further differentiate between mTICI scores. Despite the new mTICI2c category, mTICI2b still covers a range of 50–90% reperfusion which might be too imprecise to predict neurological improvement after therapy. Aim To compare the 7-point “expanded TICI” (eTICI) scale with the traditional mTICI in regard to predict functional independence at 90 days. Methods Retrospective review of 225 patients with large artery occlusion. Angiograms were graded by 2 readers according the 7-point eTICI score (0% = eTICI0; reduced clot = eTICI1; 1–49% = eTICI2a, 50–66% = eTICI2b50; 67–89% = eTICI2b67, 90–99% = eTICI2c and complete reperfusion = eTICI3) and the conventional mTICI score. The ability of e- and mTICI to predict favorable outcome at 90days was compared. Results Given the ROC analysis eTICI was the better predictor of favorable outcome (p-value 0.047). Additionally, eTICI scores 2b50, 2b67 and 2c (former mTICI2b) were significantly superior at predicting the probability of a favorable outcome at 90 days after endovascular therapy with a p-value of 0.033 (probabilities of 17% for mTICI2b50, 24% for mTICI2b67 and 54% for mTICI2c vs. 36% for mTICI2b). Conclusions The 7-point eTICI allows for a more accurate outcome prediction compared to the mTICI score because it refines the broad range of former mTICI2b results."
https://openalex.org/W2910193627,"Antibiotic susceptibility testing is often performed to determine the most effective antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection, or perhaps to determine if a particular strain of bacteria is becoming drug resistant. Such tests, and others used to determine efficacy of candidate antibiotics during the drug discovery process, have resulted in a demand for more rapid susceptibility testing methods. Here, we have developed a susceptibility test that utilizes chemiluminescent determination of ATP release from bacteria and the overall optical density (OD600) of the bacterial solution. Bacteria release ATP during a growth phase or when they are lysed in the presence of an effective antibiotic. Because optical density increases during growth phase, but does not change during bacterial lysing, an increase in the ATP:optical density ratio after the bacteria have reached the log phase of growth (which is steady) would indicate antibiotic efficacy. Specifically, after allowing a kanamycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (E.coli) to pass through the growth phase and reach steady state, the addition of levofloxacin, an antibiotic to which E. coli is susceptible, resulted in a significant increase in the ATP:OD600 ratio in comparison to the use of kanamycin alone (1.80 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.28). This difference could be measured 20 minutes after the addition of the antibiotic, to which the bacteria are susceptible, to the bacterial sample. Furthermore, this method also proved useful with gram positive bacteria, as the addition of kanamycin to a chloramphenicol-resistant strain of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) resulted in an ATP:OD600 ratio of 2.14 +/- 0.26 in comparison to 0.62 +/- 0.05 for bacteria not subjected to the antibiotic to which the bacteria are susceptible. Collectively, these results suggest that measurement of the ATP:OD600 ratio may provide a susceptibility test for antibiotic efficacy that is more rapid and quantitative than currently accepted techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2910605356,"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis are prevalent bacterial causes of swine infections. Morbidity, mortality and positively impacting the financial burden of infection occurs with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Increasing antimicrobial resistance complicates drug therapy and resistance prevention is now a necessity to optimize therapy and prolong drug life. Mutant bacterial cells are said to arise spontaneously in bacterial densities of 107−109 or greater colony forming units/ml. Antibiotic drug concentration inhibiting growth of the least susceptible cell in these high density populations has been termed the mutant prevention concentration (MPC). In this study MPC and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tilmicosin and tulathromycin were determined against the swine pathogens A. pleuropneumoniae, P.multocida and S. suis. The following MIC90/MPC90 values (mg/L) for 67 A. pleuropneumoniae and 73 P. multocida strains respectively were as follows: A. pleuropneumoniae 0.031/0.5, ≤0.016/0.5, 0.5/2, 4/32, 2/32; P. multocida 0.004/0.25, 0.016/0.125, 0.5/0.5, 8/16, 0.5/1. For 33 S. suis strains, MIC90 values (mg/L) respectively were as follows: 1, 0.25, 4, ≥8 and ≥8. A total of 16 S. suis strains with MIC values of 0.063–0.5 mg/L to ceftiofur and 0.25–0.5 mg/L to enrofloxacin were tested by MPC; MPC values respectively were 0.5 and 1 mg/L respectively. MPC concentrations provide a dosing target which may serve to reduce amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility. Drug potency based on MIC90 values was ceftiofur > enrofloxacin >florfenicol = tulathromycin > tilmicosin; based on MPC90 values was enrofloxacin > ceftiofur > tulathromycin > florfenicol ≥ tilmicosin."
https://openalex.org/W2910976122,"The present study aimed to estimate the differences in rates of prehypertension and hypertension in children and adolescents among three regions with different socioeconomic status in China, and explore the corresponding risk factors associated with prehypertension and hypertension to guide the prevention. Blood pressure measurements of 13 762 children and adolescents aged 6–17 years were obtained from a prospective national survey (the China Health and Nutrition Survey, 1991–2011). Prehypertension and hypertension were defined by age and gender, according to China’s standard criteria. Chi-square tests were used to compare the differences in the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension among three regions. Trend chi-square tests were used to detect the trends in rates of prehypertension and hypertension over survey years. Logistic regression models were used to detect the potential risk factors of prehypertension and hypertension in children and adolescents. During the survey years, the overall prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension were 6.0% and 10.6%. The corresponding rates in the western region were lowest, but increased rapidly over the two decades (84.0% and 122.6% increases respectively, P<0.001). The overall hypertension rate remained high in the eastern region, despite the slower increase (24.2% increase). In the central region, although the prehypertension rate remained stable, the rate of hypertension had a 94.8% increase these years (P<0.0001). According to the results of logistic regression, age, body mass index (BMI) and waist/height ratio (WHtR) were associated with prehypertension and hypertension. Children and adolescents in the eastern region had the highest level of prehypertension and hypertension, while the rapid increase of blood pressure in the western and central regions were also supposed to concern. Improvement of the healthy lifestyle is urgent for prehypertension and hypertension prevention in children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2908922145,"The information technology is a pivotal source of communication between patients and healthcare providers for managing chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to assess the capacity and willingness of patients to use information technology for managing chronic diseases.A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was employed. Study was conducted in six tertiary care hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. The study population consisted of patients aged ≥18 years and diagnosed with a minimum of one chronic non-communicable disease. A structured questionnaire was administered to the study participants for data collection. SPSS was used for data analysis.Among the 400 respondents, hypertension (39.5%) was the leading chronic condition followed by diabetes (27.5%). Majority of the patients owned a cell phone (90.7%) and had internet access (66.2%). Almost half of the respondents (51.0%) were willing to use text messages; whereas 78.5% and 75.7% of the respondents were reluctant to use video conference and e-mail as a source of communication with healthcare providers. Reason for unwillingness to use e-mail was the patients' desire to be directly examined by the doctor; whereas unfamiliarity with the use of text message and video conference was the major reason for not using these technologies. Logistic regression analysis revealed that interest in using e-mail to interact with specialist was more among those participants who had good self-reported health (OR = 2.579, 95%CI = 1.276-5.212, p = .008), access to internet (OR = 5.416, 95%CI = 2.777-10.564, p < .001), and those who owned a cell phone (OR = 12.944, 95%CI = 1.751-95.704, p = .012). Interest in using text messages to interact with specialist was more among participants with middle-income group (OR = 2.303, 95%CI = 1.389-3.818, p < .001), residency in close proximity to healthcare professional (OR = 3.529, 95%CI = 2.333-5.339, p < .001), access to internet (OR = 3.253, 95%CI = 2.102-5.033, p < .001) and among those who owned a cell phone (OR = 46.709, 95%CI = 6.335-344.377, p < .001). Interest in using video conference to interact with specialist was more among those participants who had access to internet (OR = 5.840, 95%CI = 2.825-12.069, p < .001) and among those who owned a cell phone (OR = 11.177, 95%CI = 1.510-82.725, p = .018).This study concluded that nearly half of the respondents were willing to use text messages; whereas, majority was reluctant in using video conference and e-mail as a source of communication with healthcare providers. Most of the respondents who were located farther from the health care provider were willing to use video conferencing in case it could save more than 60 minutes of their time."
https://openalex.org/W2909996535,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions, difficulty with communication, and repetitive behavior patterns. In humans affected by ASD, there is a male pre-disposition towards the condition with a male to female ratio of 4:1. In part due to the complex etiology of ASD including genetic and environmental interplay, there are currently no available medical therapies to improve the social deficits of ASD. Studies in rodent models and humans have shown promising therapeutic effects of oxytocin in modulating social adaptation. One pharmacological approach to stimulating oxytocinergic activity is the melanocortin receptor 4 agonist Melanotan-II (MT-II). Notably the effects of oxytocin on environmental rodent autism models has not been investigated to date. We used a maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model of autism to assess the therapeutic potential of MT-II on autism-like features in adult male mice. The male MIA mice exhibited autism-like features including impaired social behavioral metrics, diminished vocal communication, and increased repetitive behaviors. Continuous administration of MT-II to male MIA mice over a seven-day course resulted in rescue of social behavioral metrics. Normal background C57 male mice treated with MT-II showed no significant alteration in social behavioral metrics. Additionally, there was no change in anxiety-like or repetitive behaviors following MT-II treatment of normal C57 mice, though there was significant weight loss following subacute treatment. These data demonstrate MT-II as an effective agent for improving autism-like behavioral deficits in the adult male MIA mouse model of autism."
https://openalex.org/W2910977771,"With the increase of the camera resolution, the number of pixels contained in froth image is increased, which brings many challenges to image segmentation. Froth size and distribution are the important index in froth flotation. The segmentation of froth images is always a problem in building flotation model. In segmenting froth images, Otsu method is usually used to get a binary image for classification of froth images, this method can get a satisfactory segmentation result. However, each gray level is required to calculate each of the between-class variance, it takes a longer time in froth images with a large number of pixels. To solve this problem, an improved method is proposed in this paper. Most froth images have the pixel distribution characteristic that the gray histogram curve is a sawtooth shape. The proposed method uses polynomial to fit the curve of gray histogram and takes the characteristic of gray histogram's valley into consideration in Otsu method. Two performance comparison methods are introduced and used. Experimental comparison between Otsu method and the proposed method shows that the proposed method has a satisfactory image segmentation with a low computing time."
https://openalex.org/W2908688737,"Canine-mediated human rabies is endemic to the entire African continent, where the disease burden is often highest in rural communities of resource-limited countries. In this study, we analysed an animal rabies outbreak, which had persisted since 2010 in the predominantly metropolitan capital city of Zimbabwe, Harare. As rabies is considered to disproportionally affect rural communities, the persistence of urban rabies in this metropolitan setting is of interest. In order to gain an improved understanding of the epidemiology of the outbreak under investigation, we utilised both routine surveillance data that had been collected during the first eight years of the outbreak (2010–2017), as well as molecular epidemiological analyses relying on the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology. This approach allowed us to characterize virus transmission by identifying specific suburbs within the city limits where persistent disease transmission took place, while also confirming that immunologically naïve dogs were the most likely reservoir species in and around the city. In addition to gaining an improved local understanding of the outbreak, we are also able to infer that rabies was likely introduced to the city in 2010 when a rabid animal was moved from the north-east of Zimbabwe into Harare–resulting in an epizootic event. The work presented here not only showcased the value of combining conventional and molecular epidemiological data, but also highlighted the importance of maintaining rabies vaccination coverage and continued public awareness in urban areas where the risk appears to be low. By educating the general population on rabies and relying on owners to bring their companion animals to strategically placed vaccination points, the control and elimination of rabies from Harare may be feasible."

Having a good malaria knowledge leads to practicing the prevention of malaria and seeking a health care. Researches regarding pregnant women's knowledge on malaria in Ethiopia is limited. So the aim of this study was to assess malaria knowledge and its associated factors among pregnant woman, 2018.An institutional-basedcross-sectional study was conducted in Adis Zemen Hospital. Data were collected using pre-tested, an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire among 236 mothers. Women's knowledge on malaria was measured using six malaria-related questions (cause of malaria, mode of transmission, signs and symptoms, complication and prevention of malaria). The collected data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were computed to identify predictor variables at 95% confidence interval. Variables having P value of <0.05 were considered as predictor variables of malaria knowledge.A total of 235 pregnant women participated which makes the response rate 99.6%. One hundred seventy two pregnant women (73.2%) of mothers had good knowledge on malaria.Women who were from urban (AOR; 2.4: CI; 1.8, 5.7), had better family monthly income (AOR; 3.4: CI; 2.7, 3.8), attended education (AOR; 1.8: CI; 1.4, 3.5) were more knowledgeable.Majority of participants had good knowledge on malaria. Educational status, household monthly income and residence werepredictors of malaria knowledge. Increasing women's knowledge especially for those who are from rural, have no education, and have low monthly income is still needed."
https://openalex.org/W2909793383,"Monitoring viral infections of cell cultures is largely neglected although the viruses may have an impact on the physiology of cells and may constitute a biohazard regarding laboratory safety and safety of bioactive agents produced by cell cultures. PCR, immunological assays, and enzyme activity tests represent common methods to detect virus infections. We have screened more than 300 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA sequencing and 60 whole exome sequencing human cell lines data sets for specific viral sequences and general viral nucleotide and protein sequence assessment applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus specific PCR analyses. Both, the results obtained from the direct alignment method and the Taxonomer alignment method revealed a complete concordance with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus species. Taxonomer further uncovered a bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 most likely introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq data sets were more sensitive for virus detection although a significant proportion of cell lines revealed low numbers of virus specific alignments attributable to low level nucleotide contamination during RNA preparation or sequencing procedure. Low quality reads leading to Taxonomer false positive results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data before analysis. One further important result is that no viruses were detected that had never been shown to occur in cell cultures. The results prove that the currently applied testing of cell cultures is adequate for the detection of contamination and for the risk assessment of cell cultures. The results emphasize that next generation sequencing is an efficient tool to determine the viral infection status of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2910076691,"Constantly, aquatic ecosystems are under pressure by complex mixtures of contaminants whose effects are not always easy to evaluate. Due to this, organisms are sought in which early warning signs may be detected upon the presence of potentially toxic xenobiotic substances. Thereby, the study evaluated the incidence of deformities and other morphometric variations in the mentum and wing of Chironomus columbiensis exposed to water from some of the Colombian Andes affected by mining, agriculture, and cattle raising. Populations of C. columbiensis were subjected throughout their life cycle (24 days) for two generations (F1 and F2). Five treatments were carried out in controlled laboratory conditions (water from the site without impact, site of mining mercury, mining mercury + cyanide, cattle raising, and agriculture) and the respective control (reconstituted water). Thereafter, the percentage of deformities in the mentum was calculated, and for the morphometric analysis 29 landmarks were digitized for the mentum and 12 for the wing. As a result, four types of deformities were registered in the C. columbiensis mentum, like absence of teeth, increased number of teeth, fusion and space between teeth, none of them detected in the individuals from the control. Additionally, the highest incidence of deformity in F1 occurred in the treatment of mining mercury, while for F2 this took place in the treatments of mining mercury + cyanide, cattle raising and agriculture. Differences were also found with respect to the morphometric variations of the mentum and wing of C. columbiensis among the control and the treatments with water from the creeks intervened. The treatments of mining mercury + cyanide and agriculture had the highest morphological variation in the mentum and wing of C. columbiensis. The results suggest that the anthropogenic impacts evaluated generate alterations in the oral apparatus of the larval state of C. columbiensis and in the adult state provoke alterations in the wing shape (increased width and reduced basal area). These deformities may be related to multiple stress factors, among them the xenobiotics metabolized by the organisms under conditions of environmental contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2910014011,"Liver diseases are life-threatening and need urgent medical treatments. Conventional treatment is expensive and toxic, so the urge for nutraceutical hepatoprotective agents is crucial. This study is considered the first metabolic profile of Aeschynomene elaphroxylon (Guill. & Perr.) extracts of; flowers, leaves & bark adopting UPLC-Orbitrap HRMS analysis to determine their bioactive metabolites, and it was designed to investigate the potential hepatoprotective activity of A. elaphroxylon flowers and bark extracts against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. Forty-nine compounds of various classes were detected in the three extracts, with triterpenoid saponins as the major detected metabolite. Flowers and bark extracts presented similar chemical profile while leaves extract was quite different. The antioxidant activities of the flowers, leaves & bark extracts were measured by in vitro assays as Fe+3 reducing antioxidant power and Oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It revealed that flowers and bark extracts had relatively high antioxidant activity as compared to leaves extract. Based on the metabolic profile and in vitro antioxidant activity, flowers and bark ethanolic extracts were chosen for alleviation of hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 in rats. The hepatoprotective activity was studied through measuring hepatotoxicity biomarkers in serum (ALT, AST, and Albumin). Liver tissues were examined histopathologically and their homogenates were used in determining the intracellular levels of oxidative stress biomarkers (MDA, GSH), inflammatory markers (TNF-α). Flowers and bark ethanolic extracts exerted a significant hepatoprotective effect through reduction in the activities of ALT, AST and Albumin, the tested extracts reduced oxidative stress by increasing GSH content and reducing the MDA level. Furthermore, the extracts decreased levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-α. Moreover, the present study revealed the potentiality of A. elaphroxylon in ameliorating the CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. In this aspect, A. elaphroxylon can be used with other agents as a complementary drug."
https://openalex.org/W2910092799,"Previous studies have found a positive effect of cosmetics on certain behavioral measures, such as the tip given to waitresses by male patrons. These studies have employed confederates who usually wear cosmetics. We therefore sought to examine whether the positive effect found in these studies could, in part, be explained by a change in behavior. In order to test the possibility of a ‘cosmetics placebo effect’, we employed a confederate to solicit donations from passersby. On some days our confederate would not have any cosmetics applied to her face (i.e., no cosmetics condition), on some days cosmetics were pretended to be applied to her face (i.e., placebo cosmetics condition), and on other days cosmetics were actually applied to her face (i.e., cosmetics condition). In line with previous research, we found that across conditions men donated significantly more than women to our female solicitor, providing support for the ‘showoff hypothesis’, in which male generosity serves as a mating tactic. When investigating men’s donations in more detail, we found that the highest percentage of donations came in the cosmetics condition, followed by the placebo cosmetics condition, and then by no cosmetics condition. The effect of condition on donation rates, however, was not statistically significant. Our study was limited to one solicitor and one dependent variable (i.e., percentage of people approached who donated) and therefore future research would benefit from using more confederates as well as examining other behavioral measures. Given the influence of cosmetics use on so many real-world outcomes, we believe that further exploration into a possible ‘cosmetics placebo effect’ would be valuable."
https://openalex.org/W2910993487,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in American Indian communities. The Strong Heart Study (SHS) was initiated in response to the need for population based estimates of cardiovascular disease in American Indians. Previous studies within SHS have identified correlations between heart disease and deficiencies in mannose binding lectin (MBL), a motif recognition molecule of the innate immune system. MBL mediates the immune response to invading pathogens including Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp), which has also been associated with the development and progression of CVD. However, a link between MBL2 genotype and Cp in contributing to heart disease has not been established. To address this, SHS collected baseline Cp antibody titers (IgA and IgG) and MBL2 genotypes for common functional variants from 553 individuals among twelve participating tribes. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter, designated X/Y, correlated significantly with increased Cp IgG titer levels, whereas another promoter SNP (H/L) did not significantly influence antibody levels to Cp. Two variants within exon 1 of MBL2, the A and B alleles, also displayed significant association with Cp antibody titers. Some MBL2 genotypes were absent from the population, suggesting linkage disequilibrium may be operating within the SHS cohort. Additional factors, such as increasing age and socioeconomic status, were also associated with increased Cp IgG antibody titers. This study demonstrates that MBL2 genotype associates with immune reactivity to C. pneumoniae in the SHS cohort. Thus, MBL2 may contribute to the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among American Indians indirectly through pathogen interactions in addition to its previously defined roles."
https://openalex.org/W2911132131,"Background and Objective The shortage of doctors, especially in rural areas, is a major concern in India, which in turn affects the effective delivery of health care services. To support new policies able to address this issue, a study was conducted to determine the discouraging and encouraging factors affecting medical students’ interests towards working in rural areas. Methods This cross-sectional, descriptive qualitative study has been conducted in three states of North India. It comprised six focus group discussions, each consisting of 10–20 medical students of six government medical colleges. The verbatim and thematic codes have been transcribed by using a ‘categorical aggregation approach’. The discussions were thematically analyzed. Results Ninety medical students participated in the study. The discouraging factors were grouped under two broad themes namely unchallenging professional environment (poor accommodation facilities and lack of necessary infrastructure; lack of drug and equipment supplies; inadequate human resource support; lesser travel and research opportunities) and gap between financial rewards and social disadvantages (lower salary and incentives, social isolation, political interference, lack of security). Similarly, the encouraging factors were congregated under three main themes namely willingness to give back to disadvantaged communities (desire to serve poor, underprivileged and home community), broader clinical exposure (preferential admission in post-graduation after working more than 2–3 years in rural areas) and higher status and respect (achieving higher social status). Conclusions This qualitative study highlights key factors affecting medical students’ interest to work in rural areas. A substantial similarity was noted between the factors which emerge from the current study and those documented in other countries. These findings will help policymakers and medical educators to design and implement a comprehensive human resource strategy that shall target specific factors to encourage medical students to choose job positions in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2909651452,"Objectives Precarious employment (PE) is a social determinant of poor health of workers. However, this population usually lack a sampling frame, making it challenging to identify the characteristics of this group. Web-based respondent driven sampling (webRDS) recruits individuals online through the social network and can provide population estimates. This study aims to assess the performance of webRDS in a population of workers with PE. Method WebRDS was used for recruitment and data collection in the PRecarious EMployment In Stockholm (PREMIS) study. Cross-sectional questionnaire data was collected between November 2016 and May 2017. Eligible participants were living and/or working in Stockholm County, 18–65 years old, had a personal identification number and were currently employed. WebRDS performance was assessed by the total sample size, length of recruitment chains, sample composition, sample proportions and estimated RDSII population proportions with confidence intervals. Results The webRDS process resulted in a sample of 358 recruits and a total sample of 415 participants, recruited over 1–15 waves. Of the participating seeds and recruits, 60% and 48%, respectively, successfully recruited at least one peer. The sample composition stabilized for all variables assessed. The sample proportions and RDSII estimates differed by 1–8% and the confidence intervals included the sample proportions for all variables except one. Conclusions WebRDS successfully recruited a sufficient sample of workers with precarious employment from which population estimates could be made. Future studies should consider implementing webRDS on a national level in order to further study this population."
https://openalex.org/W2910696989,"To fully utilize the characteristic climatic conditions in the southern region of China, a two-crop-a-year cultivation system technique for 'Kyoho' grape was developed during the past decade. After summer harvest in June, appropriate pruning and chemical treatments promote flowering and fruiting, which enables a second harvest in late December. Due to climatic differences between the two crop growing seasons, grape phenol and carotenoid metabolism differ greatly. The reported study analyzed the transcriptome of the carotenoid and phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathways in grapes at four different stages during the two growing seasons. Compared with those in summer grapes, expression levels of the majority of genes involved in the carotenoid metabolic pathway in winter grapes were generally upregulated. This result was associated with lower rainfall and much more abundant sunlight during the second growing season. On the other hand, summer cropping strongly triggered the expression of upstream genes in the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathway at E-L 33 and E-L 35. Transcript levels of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were upregulated in winter grapes at the mature stage. Together, these results might indicate that more flavonoids would be synthesized in ripe winter grapes during the mature stage of the second crop under much drier conditions, longer sunlight hours and lower temperature. These data provide a theoretical foundation for the secondary metabolism of berries grown under two-crop-a-year cultivation systems."
https://openalex.org/W2910092817,"Wolf spiders are abundant and voracious predators at the soil-plant interface in cotton crops. Among other prey, they attack late-instar larvae of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa spp., an economically important pest. Consequently, wolf spiders in transgenic Bt cotton could provide significant biological control of Bt-resistant Helicoverpa larvae that descend to the soil to pupate. The predator-prey interactions between wolf spiders and Helicoverpa could, however, be constrained by the presence of alternative prey and intraguild predators. This study used laboratory enclosures to analyse the effect of alternative prey on predatory selection of the wolf spider Tasmanicosa leuckartii Thorell. The prey included another wolf spider Hogna crispipes Koch (potential intraguild predator), the ground cricket Teleogryllus commodus Walker (minor pest), and Helicoverpa armigera larvae (major pest). We tested if encounter rates, prey vulnerability, and prey nutritional content influenced the likelihood that a prey was attacked. In three-way food webs, Tasmanicosa encountered and attacked Teleogryllus and Helicoverpa in similar frequencies. However, in the presence of a competing intraguild predator and potential prey (Hogna) in a four-way food web, Tasmanicosa did not always attack Teleogryllus at first encounter, but still attacked Helicoverpa at each encounter. Helicoverpa (protein-poor) and Hogna (protein-rich) were consumed by Tasmanicosa in similar proportions, suggesting that Tasmanicosa might benefit from nutrient balance as an outcome of diverse prey in this food web. As Teleogryllus (protein rich) escapes quicker than Helicoverpa and Hogna, Hogna may be an easier protein-rich option than Teleogryllus. Field surveys showed that while Teleogryllus was the most common prey, wolf spiders feed on diverse insect taxa, as well as other spiders. That Tasmanicosa readily attacked Helicoverpa larvae in the presence of alternative prey is an encouraging result that supports the potential of Tasmanicosa predation to assist in the control of Bt-resistant Helicoverpa larvae and thereby inhibit the proliferation and spread of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2909835183,"Aneuploids of a single species that have lost or gained different chromosomes are useful for genomic analysis. The polyploid nature of many crops including oilseed rape (Brassica napus) allows these plants to tolerate the loss of individual chromosomes from homologous pairs, thus facilitating the development of aneuploid lines. Here, we selected 39 lines from advanced generations of an intergeneric hybridization between Brassica rapa and Orychophragmus violaceus with accidental pollination by B. napus. The lines showed a wide spectrum of phenotypic variations, with some traits specific to O. violaceus. Most lines had the same chromosome number (2n = 38) as B. napus. However, we also identified B. napus nulli-tetrasomics with 22 A-genome and 16 C-genome chromosomes and lines with the typical B. napus complement of 20 A-genome and 18 C-genome chromosomes, as revealed by FISH analysis using a C-genome specific probe. Other lines had 2n = 37 or 39 chromosomes, with variable numbers of A- or C-genome chromosomes. The formation of quadrivalents by four A-genome chromosomes with similar shapes suggests that they were derived from the same chromosome. The frequent homoeologous pairing between chromosomes of the A and C genomes points to their non-diploidized meiotic behavior. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) analysis revealed substantial genomic changes of the lines compared to B. rapa associated with O. violaceus specific DNA bands, but only a few genes were identified in these bands by DNA sequencing. These novel B. napus aneuploids and introgressants represent unique tools for studies of Brassica genetics and for Brassica breeding projects."
https://openalex.org/W2908711842,"Chlamydia pneumoniae is one of the two major species of the Chlamydiaceae family that have a profound effect on human health. C. pneumoniae is linked to a number of severe acute and chronic diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract including pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis and infection by the pathogen might play a role in lung cancer. Following adhesion, Chlamydiae secrete effector proteins into the host cytoplasm that modulate the actin cytoskeleton facilitating internalization and infection. Members of the conserved TarP protein family comprise such effector proteins that polymerize actin, and in the case of the C. trachomatis TarP protein, has been shown to play a critical role in pathogenesis. In a previous study, we demonstrated that, upon bacterial invasion, the C. pneumoniae TarP family member CPn0572 is secreted into the host cytoplasm and recruits and associates with actin via an actin-binding domain conserved in TarP proteins. We have now extended our analysis of CPn0572 and found that the CPn0572 actin binding and modulating capability is more complex. With the help of the fission yeast system, a second actin modulating domain was identified independent of the actin binding domain. Microscopic analysis of HEp-2 cells expressing different CPn0572 deletion variants mapped this domain to the C-terminal part of the protein as CPn0572536-755 binds F-actin in vitro and colocalizes with aberrantly thickened actin cables in vivo. Finally, microscopic and bioinformatic analysis revealed the existence of a vinculin binding sequence in CPn0572. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the function of the TarP family and underscore the existence of several actin binding domains and a vinculin binding site for host actin modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2909028814,"A great deal of ground breaking work has determined that the Tuberin and Hamartin Complex function as a negative regulator of protein synthesis and cell cycle progression through G1/S. This is largely attributed to the GTPase activity of Tuberin that indirectly inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). During times of ample nutrition Tuberin is inhibited by growth factor signaling, including direct phosphorylation by Akt/PKB, allowing for activation of mTOR and subsequent protein synthesis. It is well rationalized that maintaining homeostasis requires communication between cell growth (mTOR signaling) and cell division (cell cycle regulation), however how this occurs mechanistically has not been resolved. This work demonstrates that in the presence of high serum, and/or Akt signaling, direct binding between Tuberin and the G2/M cyclin, Cyclin B1, is stabilized and the rate of mitotic entry is decreased. Importantly, we show that this results in an increase in cell size. We propose that this represents a novel cell cycle checkpoint linking mitotic onset with the nutritional status of the cell to control cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2909514811,"Episodic memory is thought to involve functional interactions of large-scale brain networks that dynamically reconfigure depending on task demands. Although the hippocampus and closely related structures have been implicated, little is known regarding how large-scale and distributed networks support different memory formation demands. We investigated patterns of interactions among distributed networks while human individuals formed item-context memories for two stimulus categories. Subjects studied object-scene and object-location associations in different fMRI sessions. Stimulus-responsive brain regions were organized based on their fMRI interconnectivity into networks and modules using probabilistic module-detection algorithms to maximize measurement of individual differences in modular structure. Although there was a great deal of consistency in the modular structure between object-scene and object-location memory formation, there were also significant differences. Interactions among functional modules predicted later memory accuracy, explaining substantial portions of variability in memory formation success. Increased interactivity of modules associated with internal thought and anti-correlation of these modules with those related to stimulus-evoked processing robustly predicted object-scene memory, whereas decreased interactivity of stimulus-evoked processing modules predicted object-location memory. Assessment of individual differences in network organization therefore allowed identification of distinct patterns of functional interactions that robustly predicted memory formation. This highlights large-scale brain network interactions for memory formation and indicates that although networks are largely robust to task demands, reconfiguration nonetheless occurs to support distinct memory formation demands."
https://openalex.org/W2908971560,"Background In gene expression studies via RT-qPCR many conclusions are inferred by using reference genes. However, it is generally known that also reference genes could be differentially expressed between various tissue types, experimental conditions and animal models. An increasing amount of studies have been performed to validate the stability of reference genes. In this study, two rodent-specific Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs), which are located throughout the transcriptome, were validated and assessed against nine reference genes in a model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). Two different brain regions (i.e. hippocampus and cortex) and two different disease stages (i.e. acute phase and chronic phase) of the systemic kainic acid rat model for TLE were analyzed by performing expression analyses with the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Finally, we performed a rank aggregation analysis and validated the reference genes and the rodent-specific SINEs (i.e. B elements) individually via Gfap gene expression. Results GeNorm ranked Hprt1, Pgk1 and Ywhaz as the most stable genes in the acute phase, while Gusb and B2m were ranked as the most unstable, being significantly upregulated. The two B elements were ranked as most stable for both brain regions in the chronic phase by geNorm. In contrast, NormFinder ranked the B1 element only once as second best in cortical tissue for the chronic phase. Interestingly, using only one of the two algorithms would have led to skewed conclusions. Finally, the rank aggregation method indicated the use of the B1 element as the best option to normalize target genes, independent of the disease progression and brain region. This result was supported by the expression profile of Gfap. Conclusion In this study, we demonstrate the potential of implementing SINEs -notably the B1 element- as a stable normalization factor in a rodent model of TLE, independent of brain region or disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2909268872,"The human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate epitope, composed of a unique sulfated trisaccharide (HSO3-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R), is highly expressed during brain development and regulates higher brain function. However, it remains unclear which glycoprotein carries the HNK-1 epitope in the embryonic brain and the functional role it plays. Here, we showed that one of the major HNK-1 carrier proteins in the embryonic brain is tenascin-C (TNC), an extracellular matrix protein that regulates neurite outgrowth by interacting with the GPI-anchored protein contactin-1 (CNTN). Because the alternatively spliced fibronectin type-III (FNIII) repeats in TNC give rise to many isoforms and affect neuronal function, we evaluated neurite outgrowth of primary hippocampal neurons on purified recombinant FNIII repeats with or without the HNK-1 epitope as a substrate. We found that the presence of the HNK-1 epitope on the C domain of TNC promoted neurite outgrowth, and that this signal was mediated by CNTN, which is an HNK-1-expressing neuronal receptor. The neurite-promoting activity of the HNK-1 epitope on TNC required neuronal HNK-1 expression, which was defective in neurons lacking the glucuronyltransferases GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S. These results suggest that the HNK-1 epitope is a key modifier of TNC and CNTN in the regulation of embryonic brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2909687868,"The process of neuronal differentiation is associated with neurite elongation and membrane biogenesis, and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is the major membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells. During neuroblast differentiation, the transcription of two genes involved in PtdCho biosynthesis are stimulated: Chka gene for choline kinase (CK) alpha isoform and Pcyt1a gene for CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) alpha isoform. Here we show that CKα is essential for neuronal differentiation. In addition, we demonstrated that KDM2B regulates CKα expression and, as a consequence, neuronal differentiation. This factor is up-regulated in the course of the neuroblasts proliferative and undifferentiated state and down-regulated during differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). During proliferation, KDM2B binds to the Box2 located in the Chka promoter repressing its transcription. Interestingly, KDM2B knockdown enhances the levels of CKα expression in neuroblast cells and induces neuronal differentiation even in the absence of RA. These results suggest that KDM2B is required for the appropriate regulation of CKα during neuronal differentiation and to the maintaining of the undifferentiated stage of neuroblast cells."

In contrast, an independent genome wide screen for factors capable of driving drug resistance to the topoisomerase II (Topo II) poisons doxorubicin and etoposide, implicated a role for the nuclear protein C9orf82 in delaying DSBs repair downstream of Topo II, hereby sensitizing cells to DSB induced apoptosis. To determine its function in a genetically defined setting in vivo and ex vivo, we here employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology in zygotes to generate a C9orf82 knockout mouse model. C9orf82ko/ko mice were born at a Mendelian ratio and did not display any overt macroscopic or histological abnormalities. DSBs repair dependent processes like lymphocyte development and class switch recombination (CSR) appeared normal, arguing against a link between the C9orf82 encoded protein and V(D)J recombination or CSR. Most relevant, primary pre-B cell cultures and Tp53 transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from C9orf82ko/ko E14.5 and wild type embryos displayed comparable sensitivity to a number of DNA lesions, including DSBs breaks induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and doxorubicin. Likewise, the kinetics of γH2AX formation and resolution in response to etoposide of C9orf82 protein proficient, deficient and overexpressing MEFs were indistinguishable. These data argue against a direct role of C9orf82 protein in delaying repair of Topo II generated DSBs and regulating apoptosis. The genetically defined systems generated in this study will be of value to determine the actual function of C9orf82 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2911159743,"Background The presence of large or multiple esophageal distinct iodine-unstained lesions (DIULs) is a strong predictor of field cancerization in the upper aerodigestive tract. Several risk factors for DIULs, including genetic polymorphisms of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADH1B, rs1229984; ALDH2, rs671), have been demonstrated in Japanese alcohol-dependent men. However, few evaluations of alcohol-dependent women have been conducted in this field. Methods Using multiple logistic regression models, we investigated the results of screening using esophageal iodine staining and the identification of determinants for esophageal DIULs in 472 Japanese alcohol-dependent women. Results DIULs ≥5 mm, multiple DILUs, and both characteristics were observed in 35 (7.4%), 31 (6.6%), and 16 (3.4%) patients, respectively. DIULs ≥5 mm were histologically diagnosed as low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in 26 patients and superficial squamous cell carcinoma in 9 patients. Although the inactive heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2 genotype was more common (33.3% vs. 11.4%, p = 0.002) in the group with DIULs ≥5 mm than in the group without DIULs ≥5 mm, no significant differences in the results of a questionnaire asking about current and past facial flushing after a glass of beer were seen between the groups with and without DIULs ≥5 mm. When individuals with current or former flushing were assumed to have inactive ALDH2, the sensitivity and specificity of current or former flushing to identify the presence of inactive ALDH2 were 50.0% and 93.5%, respectively; these values were previously reported to be 88% and 92%, respectively, in a Japanese general female population. The low sensitivity in the present study suggests that a lack of alcohol flushing may play a crucial role in the development of alcohol dependence in women with inactive ALDH2. No significant differences in age, usual alcohol consumption, or smoking habits were observed according to ADH1B and ALDH2 genotypes. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the slow-metabolizing ADH1B*1/*1 genotype (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 12.5 [4.82–32.4] and 9.89 [3.50–27.9]), the inactive heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2 genotype (2.94 [1.18–7.38] and 3.79 [1.40–10.3]), a lower body mass index per -1 kg/m2 (1.17 [1.02–1.35] and 1.38 [1.14–1.67]), and a mean corpuscular volume ≥106 fl (3.70 [1.56–8.81] and 3.27 [1.24–8.64]) increased the risk of DIULs ≥5 mm and multiple DIULs, respectively. The combination of ADH1B*1/*1 and ALDH2*1/*2 markedly increased the risk of esophageal DIULs ≥5 mm (39.3 [10.6–146]). Conclusions Japanese alcohol-dependent women shared several common risk factors for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia with alcohol-dependent men, but with considerably different magnitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2909497473,"Background A disturbed self-image is central to the characteristic symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Evaluations of self-relevance (SR) are highly important in cognitive and emotional processing of information and adaptive behavior. Method In the current study, we used affective statements to investigate if SR is altered in patients with higher scores on Borderline Symptom List (BSL-95). Forthyfemale adults with BPD and 20 healthy participants assessed a set of stimuli consisting of sentences in third-person for relevance to self. Results BPD patients exhibited a higher SR for negative contents as compared to healthy controls (p < .001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation coefficient was found between the increased bias in evaluating the SR of stimuli and borderline symptom severity scores, as measured by BSL-95 questionnaire (r = 0.67, p < .001). This effect persisted after controlling for depressive symptoms by a partial correlation analysis. Conclusion Our results revealed an enhanced SR for negative statements, which was related to the severity of individuals’ BPD symptoms. These findings add to the diagnostic information regarding the disturbed organization of self in this clinical population. We suggest the maladaptive evaluation of SR offers an important treatment target for therapeutic approaches to BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2909593025,"Background There is paucity of data on risk factors for reduced fertility in low-income countries. Objective To investigate factors associated with fertility among women in rural north eastern Tanzania. Subjects and methods A cohort of 1248 non-pregnant women was followed with urine pregnancy testing every third month or more regularly if they reported a missed menstrual period. Pregnancy was confirmed with trans-abdominal ultrasound. Information regarding general health, socioeconomic status and obstetric-gynaecological history was collected. Factors associated with conceiving within 180 days were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Among the 1248 women, 736 were followed for 180 days and 209 of these had an ultrasound confirmed pregnancy. During the follow-up period, 169/736 women were diagnosed with urogenital infections, including suspected sexually transmitted or reproductive tract infections, urinary tract infection, and vaginal candidiasis. Urogenital infections were significantly associated with reduced odds of conceiving within 180 days (adjusted OR (AOR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11–0.36). Being above 30 years of age was also negatively associated with odds of conceiving (AOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.77). In contrast, women who recently stopped using hormonal contraceptives (AOR 2.86, 95% CI 1.45–5.70) and women with low socioeconomic status (AOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04–2.33) were significantly more likely to become pregnant within 180 days. Conclusion Urogenital infection seems to be a major health factor associated with reduced chances of conceiving. Considering the availability of effective treatment options for these diseases, public health authorities should increase awareness of diagnostic tools in settings with limited resources in order to improve fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2910789255,"Many countries have passed environmental laws aiming at preserving natural ecosystems, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States. Although those regulations seem to have improved preservation, they may have had unintended consequences in energy production. Here we show that while environmental constraints on hydropower may have preserved the wilderness and wildlife by restricting the development of hydroelectric projects, they led to more greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental regulations gave rise to a replacement of hydropower, which is a renewable, relatively low-emitting source of energy, with conventional fossil-fuel power, which is highly polluting. Our estimates indicate that, on average, each megawatt of fossil fuel power-generating capacity added to the grid because of environmental constraints on hydropower development led to an increase in annual carbon dioxide emissions of about 1,400 tons. Environmental regulations focusing only on the preservation of ecosystems appear to have encouraged electric utilities to substitute dirtier fuels for hydropower in electricity generation."
https://openalex.org/W4253176998,"Introduction The axillary and cephalic veins are used for various clinical purposes but their anatomy is not fully understood. Increased knowledge and information about them as well as superficial veins in the upper arm would be useful. Objective The aim of this study is to contribute to the literature regarding the anatomy of the venous drainage of the upper extremity. Methods The veins of forty upper extremities from twenty one adult cadavers were injected and their axillary regions dissected. The course and pattern of drainage of the venous tributaries in the axillary region were identified and recorded. Results The basilic, brachial, subscapular, lateral thoracic and superior thoracic veins drained mainly into the axillary vein, in common with most textbook descriptions. However, the thoracoacromial veins were observed to drain into the cephalic vein in 70.0% of upper limbs. In addition, a venous channel connecting the distal part and proximal part of the axilla was found along the posterolateral wall of the axilla in 77.5% of the upper limbs. In 95.0% of upper limbs, we discovered a superficial vein which ran from the axillary base and drained directly into the axillary vein. Conclusion The veins from the inferomedial part of the axilla drain into the axillary vein, whereas the veins from the superolateral part of the axilla drain into the cephalic vein. The venous drainage of the axilla is variable and in common with venous drainage elsewhere, does not necessarily follow the pattern of the arterial supply."
https://openalex.org/W2788652238,"To develop and evaluate a low-cost computer-based tool to elicit dietary choices in an incentive compatible manner, which can be used on-line or as part of a laboratory study.The study was conducted with around 255 adults. Respondents were asked to allocate a fixed monetary budget across a choice of around a hundred grocery items with the prospect of receiving these items with some probability delivered to their home by a real supermarket. The tool covers a broad range of food items, allows inference of macro-nutrients and calories, and allows the researcher to fix the choice set participants can choose from. We compare the information derived from our incentivized tool, and compare it to alternative low-cost ways of measuring dietary intake, namely the food frequency questionnaire and a one-shot version of the 24-hour dietary recall, which are both based on self-reports. We compare the calorie intake indicators derived from each tool with a number of biometric measures for each subject, namely weight, body-mass-index (BMI) and waist size.The results show that the dietary information collected is only weakly correlated across the three methods. We find that only the calorie intake measure from our incentivized tool is positively and significantly related to each of the biometric indicators. Specifically, a 10% increase in calorie intake is associated with a 1.5% increase in BMI. By contrast, we find no significant correlations for either of the two measures based on self-reports.The computer-based tool is a promising new, low-cost measure of dietary choices, particularly in one-shot situations where such behaviours are only observed once, whereas other tools like 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires may be more suited when they are administered repeatedly. The tool may be useful for research conducted with limited time and budget."
https://openalex.org/W2908761174,"To segment the inner macular layers (IML) and compare the discriminating abilities of the macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL and pRNFL, respectively) thicknesses in patients with early-stage normal tension glaucoma (NTG).Cross-sectional study.Forty-nine normal subjects and 69 preperimetric glaucoma (PPG) and 60 NTG patients were enrolled. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to obtain pRNFL and macular thickness parameters and segment the IML in all subjects. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were used to compare the diagnostic capabilities of different parameters.The pRNFL, total macular layer (TML), mRNFL, and macular ganglion cell layer (mGCL) were significantly thinner in the NTG group than in the PPG and normal groups. The global and superotemporal pRNFL and the mGCL in the superior outer area were the three best parameters for detecting early NTG. The discriminating capabilities of the superior and inferior mGCL were comparable to those of the corresponding pRNFL (p = 0.573, 0.841). Concerning location, the mGCL had higher AUROCs in the outer sectors (0.863, 0.837) than in the inner sectors (0.747, 0.747). Pearson's correlation coefficients also revealed significant correlations between the mGCL and pRNFL (superior: r = 0.499, inferior: r = 0.624). The strongest correlation was between the mGCL and mean deviation (MD) (superior: r = 0.434 and inferior: r = 0.402).The diagnostic value of mGCL thickness is comparable to that of pRNFL thickness. IMLs in the outer sectors had better diagnostic capabilities than those in the inner sector for detecting early NTG."
https://openalex.org/W2909801703,"Do conservative econometric models that comply with the Golden Rule of Forecasting provide more accurate forecasts?To test the effects of forecast accuracy, we applied three evidence-based guidelines to 19 published regression models used for forecasting 154 elections in Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, U.K., and the U.S. The guidelines direct forecasters using causal models to be conservative to account for uncertainty by (I) modifying effect estimates to reflect uncertainty either by damping coefficients towards no effect or equalizing coefficients, (II) combining forecasts from diverse models, and (III) incorporating more knowledge by including more variables with known important effects.Modifying the econometric models to make them more conservative reduced forecast errors compared to forecasts from the original models: (I) Damping coefficients by 10% reduced error by 2% on average, although further damping generally harmed accuracy; modifying coefficients by equalizing coefficients consistently reduced errors with average error reductions between 2% and 8% depending on the level of equalizing. Averaging the original regression model forecast with an equal-weights model forecast reduced error by 7%. (II) Combining forecasts from two Australian models and from eight U.S. models reduced error by 14% and 36%, respectively. (III) Using more knowledge by including all six unique variables from the Australian models and all 24 unique variables from the U.S. models in equal-weight ""knowledge models"" reduced error by 10% and 43%, respectively.This paper provides the first test of applying guidelines for conservative forecasting to established election forecasting models.Election forecasters can substantially improve the accuracy of forecasts from econometric models by following simple guidelines for conservative forecasting. Decision-makers can make better decisions when they are provided with models that are more realistic and forecasts that are more accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2910139470,"The key visual factors in a classroom environment include the legibility, angle subtended at the eye, illumination, contrast, and colour of the visual task. The study evaluated the visual environmental factors in the school classrooms.The distance Visual Acuity (VA) demand was evaluated based on the size of visual task i.e. the smallest size of chalkboard writing and its viewing distance. The environmental factors which can have an effect on the visibility in classrooms such as illuminance on the chalkboard and at student's desk, chalkboard contrast, light sources and the student's perception of their classroom visual environment were measured. To quantify the distance VA demand and to compare with a standard high contrast VA chart measure, a validation of the measurements was performed by chalkboard simulation experiment. The ""acuity reserve"" to be included to the measured distance VA demand was evaluated.We included twenty-nine classrooms of eight schools. The median distance VA threshold demand was 0.28 logMAR(0.25,0.45). The median illuminance on front desk position and chalkboard contrast was 130 lux(92,208) and 40(36,50) respectively with 62% classrooms having low illumination (<150lux). The acuity reserve evaluated to be included to the distance VA demand was 0.13logMAR and 0.29 logMAR in classrooms with optimal and low chalkboard illumination respectively which was based on the results of the simulation experiment. The median distance VA demand including the acuity reserve was 0.09 logMAR(-0.03,0.23) [Snellen Equivalent: 20/25(20/19,20/34)].The study findings highlight the increased visual task demand in school classrooms and the need for appropriate seating arrangements in classrooms based on the visual acuity of children. The study emphasises regular audit of the classroom environment along with the school eye screening."
https://openalex.org/W2911214184,"Large currents are injected into the earth from grounding poles of HVDC systems under monopole ground return mode. The currents change the earth surface potential and result in DC currents in AC systems. This paper proposes a computationally efficient decoupled circuital calculation method for assessing the unwanted DC currents in AC grids. Firstly, the earth resistive network is acquired by simulating the DC grounding current distribution using Finite Element Method (FEM). Secondly, the earth resistive network and AC grid are combined to develop a decoupled circuital model of the overall system. The acquired model is used to calculate the DC currents in AC grids by solving a set of linear equations. The proposed method is computationally more efficient as compared to field-circuit coupled methods. In addition, its accuracy is proved by showing a close agreement between our results and field-circuit coupled model as well as the actual measurements. Finally, in Shanghai area power grid the DC currents are calculated using the proposed technique. Based on these calculations, remedial measures for reducing the DC currents in AC grid are suggested. Our research results indicate that DC currents in AC systems can be reduced by operating the two HVDC projects with opposite polarities."
https://openalex.org/W2909172752,"Few clinical studies have directly examined the associations of hemoglobin (Hb) levels after hemodialysis (HD) and of the difference in Hb levels before and after HD (ΔHb) with patient outcomes. The present study aimed to determine ΔHb and post-HD Hb levels with nationwide data and to examine their associations with all-cause mortality in patients undergoing HD.This study is based on data from 2008 and 2009 recorded in the Japanese Renal Data Registry. Study endpoints were all-cause mortality within 1-year. The ΔHb and post-HD Hb level as categorical variables using Cox regression for 1-year mortality, adjusting for potential confounders.The median ΔHb was 1.0 g/dl, and the post-HD Hb level was 11.3 g/d. The median pre-HD Hb level was 10.4 g/dl. The risk of mortality was lower with a ΔHb of 0 to 1.0 g/dl (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.01) or > 1.0 g/dl (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84) than with a ΔHb < 0 g/dl. The risk for mortality was also lower with a post-HD Hb of 10 to 11 g/dl (aHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92), 11 to 12 g/dl (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87), or > 12 g/dl (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87) than with a post-HD Hb < 10 g/dl.Both a low ΔHb and a low post-HD Hb level were associated with a higher risk of 1-year mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2909718269,"Spatial release of masking (SRM) is a measure of an individual's ability to perform speech-noise segregation, which is usually quantified by the extent of improvement of the individual's speech recognition performance when the noise is switched from a spatially co-located position (e.g., speech and noise both presented from the front) to a spatially separated position (e.g., speech presented from the front and noise presented from the right side) with reference to the target speech. SRM is a combined measure of head shadow and binaural unmasking benefits. SRM has only been investigated in young children at group level but not at individual participant level in the international literature due to the lack of reliable speech recognition test materials able to detect subtle statistically significant within-participant changes in speech-recognition-in-noise thresholds.The performance to signal-to-noise ratio (P-SNR) functions of twenty-four disyllabic words were obtained from 40 native Mandarin-speaking children aged 3.6-6.2 years with reported normal speech, language and hearing. The test items' difficulty levels were homogenized by adjusting the speech intensity level of each item so that the adjusted signal-to-noise ratio for 50% correct score (SNR-50%) point of each item would overlap at the mean SNR-50% point of all test items. In the MAPID-A, the homogenized test items were randomly presented in an adaptive testing procedure at a fixed noise intensity level, but the speech intensity level of the upcoming test item varied in 2-dB SNR steps depending on the recognition result of the previous test item. The SNR reversal point is marked by a change from a decrease to an increase in the SNR or vice versa. Two successive SNR reversal points marked the boundaries of an excursion. The mid-points from 12 excursions (in dB SNR) were averaged to produce the adaptive SNR-50% measure (aSNR-50%).The aSNR-50% results were obtained from another 12 children aged 4.8-5.3 years with reported normal speech, language and hearing. The average 99% confidence interval (CI) of all participants' mean aSNR-50% values was ±1.61 dB SNR; therefore, 3.22 dB SNR was the average critical difference required to confirm a significant difference in the scores obtained from the same participant between two test conditions. Statistically significant within-participant SRM was identified in 95% of the participants; in other words, aSNR-50% obtained from the spatially separated condition outperformed aSNR-50% obtained from the spatially co-located condition. The adaptive testing procedure was highly reliable, with an within-participant test-retest reliability of 90.6%. and significantly limited testing time to an average of 4.2 min. This research study has fulfilled its aim on detecting subtle within-participant SRM in very young children starting from 4 years of age with a reliable statistical procedure. MAPID-A offers a reliable and efficient clinical tool to investigate speech-recognition-in-noise and SRM performances in young Mandarin-speaking children.The narrow CIs, high test-retest reliability, and short testing time has proven that the MAPID-A is a promising sensitive, reliable and time-efficient clinical tool to detect subtle within-participant speech-recognition-in-noise changes in children as young as 4-5 years. The MAPID-A offers a clinical tool to behaviorally track young children's development in speech-recognition-in-noise and SRM, and to potentially review the development of the auditory neural pathway and the cerebral dominance for speech-recognition-in-noise in young children."
