https://openalex.org/W2049850715,"Weight loss causes loss of menstrual function (amenorrhea) and weight gain restores menstrual cycles. A minimal weight for height necessary for the onset of or the restoration of menstrual cycles in cases of primary or secondary amenorrhea due to undernutrition is indicated by an index of fatness of normal girls at menarche and at age 18 years, respectively. Amenorrheic patients of ages 16 years and over resume menstrual cycles after weight gain at a heavier weight for a particular height than is found at menarche. Girls become relatively and absolutely fatter from menarche to age 18 years. The data suggest that a minimum level of stored, easily mobilized energy is necessary for ovulation and menstrual cycles in the human female."
https://openalex.org/W2039074795,"Abstract Cultured cells derived from either normal or malignant tissues of several species have been tested by injection into the immune-deficient nude mouse in order to determine the cellular properties which are associated with tumorigenicity in vivo. Results show that one in vitro property consistently correlated with neoplastic growth in nude mice is the ability of the cell to form spherical colonies in a semi-solid growth medium such as methyl cellulose suspension. Cellular tumorigenicity is not determined solely by the malignancy of the tissue of origin, since cells derived from nonmalignant tissues become tumorigenic when they are no longer anchorage dependent for growth. In addition, acquisition of infinite growth potential in heteropioid cell lines is not in itself sufficient to confer tumorigenic capacity on the cells. These results suggest that the degree of cell growth in methyl cellulose is a useful parameter in vitro for predicting tumorigenicity in the animal, and also demonstrate the potential usefulness of the nude mouse for analysis of cellular malignancy irrespective of the tissue or species of origin."

https://openalex.org/W2021771504,"The circadian activity rhythms of golden hamsters and two species of deermouse, when released from a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours of darkness into constant darkness, had progressively shorter periods as the animals became older. A possible bearing of this fact on the aging process is briefly outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2054537480,"A purified, metabolically active preparation of brain microvessels was isolated from bovine cerebral cortex by using a simple procedure involving mild disruption of the tissue by homogenization and trapping of the vessels on nylon sieves. This preparation permits in vitro metabolic and structural studies of small blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2044275793,"Eleven subjects squeezed an electronic dynamometer, at each of three force levels, with both their right and left hands. In right-handed subjects the premovement ""readiness"" potentials were larger over the hemisphere contralateral to the responding hand. Left-handed subjects show contralateral dominance when responding with the right hand but not when responding with the left hand. The data suggest that in the potentials studied there is a component associated with the preparation to perform a specific movement, rather than with generalized preparatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1970487871,"Chromosome banding revealed marker chromosomes characteristic of HeLa cells in cultures designated HEK, HEK/HRV, HBT-3, HBT-39B, MA160, and a strain of SA-4TxS-HuSa1. Other HeLa cell characteristics found were glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase type A mobility and lack of the Y chromosome. Conventional chromosome analysis and immunological and enzymatic techniques serve to monitor species specificity and racial origin of the donor. Chromosome banding, however, can monitor intralinear karyotype peculiarity and its evolution during long-term cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W1998112730,Infants with known chronic hypoxemia before death retained a large proportion of the brown fat cells that are normally replaced by white fat cells after birth. Many of these hypoxemic infants also had an abnormal retention of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These same abnormalities were found in many victims of the sudden infant death syndrome.
https://openalex.org/W2017834993,"Voltage clamping giving step commands reveals a steady-state negative resistance characteristic in the current-voltage curves of Aplysia bursting neurons. This is observed below spike threshold in the unstable range through which the membrane potential slowly oscillates. The negative resistance characteristic underlies this instability and shapes the rapid depolarization-hyper-polarization phase of the cycle. When bursting cells are converted to silent cells (by cooling) the negative resistance is abolished; conversely, when normally silent cells are made to burst (by warming) a negative resistance develops. The presence of negative resistance thus enables the bursting cell to oscillate, whereas its absence precluldes such oscillations."

The mean flow velocities obtained were 1.9 centimeters per second in a retinal vein and 2.2 centimeters per second in a retinal artery. Scattered light from a weak helium-neon laser beam focused on the vessel was detected by a photomultiplier, and the temporal correlation of the intensity fluctuations was measured with a photon counting autocorrelator. Autocorrelation functions for blood flowing through glass capillaries were used for calibration."
https://openalex.org/W1988739943,"Sequential blood samples, obtained from freely behaving, nonstressed male rats, showed a pulsatile pattern of growth hormone secretion with a mean interval between peaks of 68 minutes. The bursts of secretion were blocked by lesions of the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei and by administration of a long-acting preparation of synthetic somatostatin."
https://openalex.org/W2088525552,"Pain responses to noxious thermal stimulation decreased in the acupunctured arm of subjects as compared to the arm not treated with acupuncture; this result suggested that effective analgesia had been induced. However, sensory decision theory analysis of the data revealed no difference in discriminability. This failure to find a sensory (physiological) change strongly suggests that analgesia had not been induced. The sole effect of acupuncture was to cause the subjects to raise their pain criterion in response to the expectation that acture works."
https://openalex.org/W2030701515,"The expression of different variants of thymidine kinase (TdR kinase), characterized by electrophoretic mobilities, is related to the replicative state of normal or transformed cultured cells rather than the developmental state of the tissue of origin. The form of thymidine kinase found in actively growing cultured cells, corresponding to the “fetal kinase” of embryonic tissue, migrates as a slow moving species with an Rf of 0.20 on acrylamide gels. The “adult kinase” found in adult tissue or other nongrowing cells migrates as a faster species with an Rf of 0.50 on acrylamide gels."

https://openalex.org/W2059799653,The effects on insulin secretion of alpha and beta anomers of D-glucose were studied in the in vitro perfused rat pancreas. Both phases of insulin release showed consistent stereospecificity for alpha-glucose; this specificity indicates an action of glucose independent of intracellular glucose metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2093417376,"PHENOCOPIES are developmental abnormalities which closely resemble known mutants, and can be induced experimentally1. Phenocopies of a given mutant can be induced by various physicochemical agents, which share a unique and restricted effective period in development. In some instances it has been shown that the period of sensitivity to the agent coincides in turn with the effective period of the mutant itself2,4. This is of special relevance because it places the phenomenon of the phenocopy in the same causal frame as that of gene action. Some of the morphogenetic mutants of Drosophila have been studied in clonal analysis and shown to act cell autonomously5,6. We have investigated whether their phenocopies also result from events taking place at the cellular level."

https://openalex.org/W2088358864,"Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the relaxation times of the water in the crystalline lens show that, as in all interfacial systems, these parameters are markedly reduced from their values in pure water, that T(2) is less than T(1), and that both depend on water content. Determination of diffusion coefficients and studies on physiologically inert lenses indicate that reduced relaxation times do not provide direct evidence for ordering of the bulk of the cell water."

https://openalex.org/W2079276265,"In sum, it appears that legal abortion depressed overall fertility, but particularly illegitimate fertility, by giving women an opportunity to terminate their pregnancies when other means of birth control either had not been used or had failed. If legalized abortion had not been available, an estimated additional 39,000 illegitimate babies and 28,000 legitimate babies would have been born in 1971 in the United States. While this makes up a small part of total births (3,500,000), the illegitimate births prevented represent almost one-tenth of all out-of-wedlock children born in the country in that year. In addition to preventing these births the legalization of abortion appears to have reduced the incidence of pregnancy-related marriages and thereby may have helped to limit subsequent marital disruption. Finally, legal abortion prevented large numbers of illegal abortions from occurring. Our data indicate that well over half—most likely between two-thirds and three-fourths—of all legal abortions in the United States in 1971 were replacements for illegal abortions."

https://openalex.org/W2000550390,"A liquid membrane electrode has been developed with Nernstian response and a high selectivity for carbonate ion. The electrode responds rapidly to carbonate in the 10(-2)M to 10(-6)M range with a selectivity for carbonate over chloride, sulfate, and phosphate of at least 10(3) and negligible bicarbonate response. The electrode properties appear to be suited to chemical, biological, chemical, and oceanographic measurements."

The amplitude of these pulses was decreased after treatment with a disulfide-bond reducing agent. The shot effect may thus depend on the structure or conformation of the receptor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1982576123,"Purified nuclei isolated from mice challenged with nonlethal levels of mercury chloride (10-(3)M) in drinking water for 4 to 7 weeks (experimental) and from animals given deionized water (control) were fractionated and the subsequent fractions were analyzed for mercury by flameless atomic absorption. Control (active) euchromatin contained 1.75 +/- 0.53 micrograms of mercury per milligram of DNA. There was a 12- to 15-fold enrichment of mercury in the euchromatin fraction of challenged animals. Mercury was not detected in control (inactive) heterochromatin, and only trace levels (parts per billion) appeared in experimental heterochromatin. It seems likely that mercury can be incorporated into chromatin as a metal-protein complex, but the possibility of protein-mercury-DNA or mercury-DNA complexes within euchromatin cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1973693926,"Sheep and goats switch from the synthesis of hemoglobin A (α2β2A) to hemoglobin C (α2β2C) when made anemic. We have demonstrated the existence of the asymmetrical hybrid hemoglobin, α2βAβC, in the circulating red cells of anemic sheep. These erythroid cells, therefore, synthesized both A and C hemoglobin simultaneously. Thus, the switch appears to be mediated by selective gene expression rather than by a clonal or cellular selective mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2004695006,Virions of barley stripe mosaic virus were observed attached to microtubules of the spindle apparatus. This phenomenon was found in barley cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. The microtubules may be involved in the assembly and cell-to-cell transfer of the virus.
https://openalex.org/W2036528301,"A decreased rate of biliary excretion of radioactive metabolites of 3,4-benzopyrene was observed in rats given a single dose of nicotine. Prior treatment of rats with nicotine decreased benzopyrene hydroxylase activity in homogenates of liver, lung, and small intestine. The addition of nicotine to incubated tissues also decreased benzopyrene hydroxylase activity. These findings show that nicotine inhibits the metabolism of 3,4-benzopyrene in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1965329011,Analyses of ten species of migratory songbirds killed when the birds flew into television towers in Florida showed a progressive decline in the concentration of DDT and its metabolites (DDD and DDE) in their fat depots for the period 1964 to 1973. This decline is apparently correlated with the decreased usage of DDT in the United States during the same time.

These proteins, usually called lectins, are often able to distinguish cell types by preferentially agglutinating cells which express a particular membrane glycoprotein3. We report here that one lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)4, is able to distinguish a group of mouse leukocytes carrying neither immunoglobulin nor T-cell surface markers."
