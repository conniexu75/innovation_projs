We present here an unprecedented role for PrP against Bax-mediated neuronal apoptosis and show that PrP potently inhibits Bax-induced cell death in human primary neurons. Deletion of four octapeptide repeats of PrP (PrPΔOR) and familial D178N and T183A PrP mutations completely or partially eliminate the neuroprotective effect of PrP. PrP remains anti-apoptotic despite truncation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal peptide, indicating that the neuroprotective form of PrP does not require the abundant cell surface GPI-anchored PrP.

PrP possesses a C-terminal GPI-anchoring signal and a transmembrane domain that can generate type I (CtmPrP) or type II (NtmPrP) transmembrane-spanning isoforms in isolated endoplasmic reticulum microsomes or phospholiposomes (4Stahl N.

Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The complete translocation of PrP is dependent on translocation accessory factors (TrAF). In the absence of TrAF, PrP is exclusively synthesized in a transmembrane topology (7Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of the infectious form of PrP in a number of human and animal neurodegenerative diseases has been extensively studied, the normal function of PrP is still poorly understood. PrP-null mice display no dramatic phenotype (9Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H. DeArmond S. Prusiner S. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). However, evidence indicates that PrP may promote sleep continuity (10Tobler I. Gaus S. Deboer T. Achermann P. Fischer M.

PrP is involved in the regulation of presynaptic copper concentration, intracellular calcium concentration, activation of lymphocytes, astrocyte proliferation, and signal transduction and has antioxidant properties (11Whatley S.A.

In addition, it has been shown that PrP-null neuronal cell lines are more susceptible to serum deprivation-induced cell death and that Bcl-2 overexpression can attenuate the sensitivity of PrP-null neuronal cell lines to serum deprivation (20Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Kurschner and Morgan (21Kurschner C. Morgan J. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kurschner C. Morgan J. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that yeast PrP fusion proteins interact with Bcl-2. Furthermore, four identical N-terminal PrP octapeptide repeats (OR) that are highly conserved in evolution share limited similarity with the Bcl-2 homology domain 2 (BH2) of Bcl-2 proteins (23LeBlanc A. Wang S.S. Handbook of the Aging Brain. Academic Press, NY1998: 202-214Google Scholar, 24Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 proteins are central to the regulation of cell death, and the BH2 domain is crucial to the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 and its interaction with the pro-apoptotic Bax protein (24Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 25Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). Based on these features of PrP, we hypothesized that similar to Bcl-2 family members, PrP may play a role in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, we have investigated the role of PrP in neuronal survival against the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Human Bcl-2 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Walter Nishioka (Vical Inc. San Diego, CA). PrP and PrP-D178N and -T183A DNAs were PCR-amplified as described (26Nitrini R. Rosemberg S. Passos-Bueno M.R. Lughetti P. Papadopoulos M. Carrilho P.E. Caramelli P. Albrecht S. Zatz M. LeBlanc A.C. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Medori R. Tritschler H.J. LeBlanc A. Villare F. Manetto V. Chen H.Y. Xue R. Leal S. Montagna P. Cortelli P. Tinuper P. Avoni P. Mochi M. Baruzzi A. Hauw J. Lugaresi E. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gambetti P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Bax-α cDNA was PCR-amplified from human neuron cDNA. cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript KSII (pBSK−; Stratagene) or pCep4β (Invitrogen). The APP695 construct has been described elsewhere (28LeBlanc A.C. Gambetti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The PrP antisense construct (PrPAS) was made by cloning the entire PrP coding region in the reverse orientation in theBamHI/NotI sites of pCep4β. Deletion of the OR region was performed by PCR amplification of the two regions flanking the ORs using the following primers. To generate the 5′-fragment: forward (PDG2), 5′-TACTGAGAATTCGCAGTCCATTATGGCGAACCTTGGCTGCTGG-3′ and reverse (P3−), 5′-ACCACCGCCCTGAGG-3′; to generate the 3′-fragment: forward (P4+), 5′-ACCCACAGTCAGTGG-3′ and reverse (PDG1), 5′-GTACTGAGGATCCTCCTCATCCCACTATCAGGAAGA-3′. The two fragments were then blunt-end ligated and cloned in the proper orientation in pBSK− and pCep4β. Deletion of the GPI anchor signal was generated by PCR using PDG2 (forward) and reverse 5′-TCCGGATCCCTATCCTCTCTGG-3′ primers. R155 PrP antiserum against residues 36–56 was raised in our laboratory. Human primary neurons were cultured as described (29LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and microinjected with 25 pl containing 0.75 pg of DNA and 2.5 pg of dextran Texas Red (DTR) in phosphate-buffered saline (30Zhang Y. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each injection was done on 200 neurons in at least three independent neuronal preparations. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell death was assessed using the in situ cell detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were read blindly on coded slides. The percentage of cell death was determined as the number of TUNEL and DTR double-positive over the total number of DTR-microinjected neurons. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose 24 h after microinjection of the antisense PrP construct. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% fetal goat serum, incubated with R155 (1:100), and detected with goat anti-rabbit IgAll-FITC. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluency in 6-well plates and transfected with 3 µg of plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfectants were assessed for protein expression at 48 h post-transfection. Stable cell lines for each construct were also studied. Cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h using 100 µCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and PrP was immunoprecipitated in radioimmune precipitation buffer using anti-PrP R155 (31Harlow E. D. L. Using Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 223-265Google Scholar). The immune complexes were separated on Tris-Tricine gels and subjected to autoradiography. Human primary neurons were preincubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of 5 µg/ml brefeldin A or 5 µmmonensin (Sigma), microinjected as described above, and then incubated in the absence or presence of either 5 µg/ml brefeldin A or 5 µm monensin for 12 h. The cells were fixed at the indicated times, and cell death was assessed as described above. The effect of brefeldin A on prion maturation and secretion was studied in neuronal cultures incubated in serum- and methionine-free media in the presence of 5 µg/ml brefeldin A for 1 h and then incubated in 100 µCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 1, 3, and 12 h. Immunoprecipitations were done with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal anti-PrP antisera R155 as previously described (29LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of variance was analyzed with ANOVA followed by post-hoc Dunnett's or Scheffé's test. A p < 0.05 was taken as a significant difference. PrP, Bax, and Bcl-2 are normally expressed in human neurons. However, Bax is not pro-apoptotic unless it is induced through insult or overexpression. We chose to induce Bax-mediated cell death by microinjection of Bax cDNA because cell death can then be directly attributed to Bax overexpression. The role of PrP and Bcl-2 against Bax-mediated cell death was then assessed by co-microinjecting the cDNAs encoding Bcl-2 and PrP with the Bax cDNA in human primary neurons in culture. The cDNAs were expressed under the cytomegalovirus promoter of the episomal Cep4β construct (32Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Bax is known to cause apoptosis in a number of neuronal cells (33Shindler K.S. Latham C.B. Roth K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of Bax cDNA, but not vector pCep4β, Bcl-2, or PrP cDNAs, also induces a rapid cell death in 90% of these human primary neurons within 48 h (Fig.1A). Co-injection of Bax cDNA with either PrP or Bcl-2 cDNA protects against Bax-mediated cell death. The triple injection of PrP, Bcl-2, and Bax does not further enhance protection. In contrast, microinjection of a cDNA encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) does not prevent Bax-mediated cell death. These results show that PrP and Bcl-2 can both efficiently prevent Bax-mediated cell death in human neurons. To test if the neuroprotective function of PrP is merely a consequence of overexpression, endogenous PrP expression was inhibited by injecting neurons with a PrPAS cDNA Cep4β episomal construct. This construct has previously been used successfully to inhibit high levels of APP expression (35LeBlanc A. Kovacs D. Chen H. Villare F. Tykocinski M. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gambetti P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The antisense construct did not induce cell death in the absence of Bax cDNA (Fig. 1B). However, the antisense cDNA enhanced Bax-mediated neuronal cell death at 12 and 24 h of injection. We confirmed that PrP expression decreases in the PrPAS-microinjected neurons by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1B, inset). Therefore, endogenous PrP can protect to some extent against Bax-mediated cell death. The antisense study also indicates that the loss of PrP expression is not a problem for these neurons unless Bax pro-apoptotic properties have been launched. The PrP octapeptide repeat region plays an important role against oxidative stress (15Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Brown D.R. Wong B.-S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In addition, an increase in the number of OR in PrP leads to disease in human and mice (36Owen F. Poulter M. Shah T. Collinge J. Lofthouse R. Baker H. Ridley R. McVey J. Crow T.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Chiesa R. Drisaldi B. Quaglio E. Migheli A. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5574-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether PrP anti-Bax function also requires the octapeptide repeat region, we tested the neuroprotective ability of PrP lacking the four OR with similarity to BH2 (PrPΔOR) against Bax. PrPΔOR abolishes the neuroprotective function of PrP (Fig. 2A). The lack of function of PrPΔOR cDNA construct could be caused by the absence of expression of this mutant PrP. Alternatively, the protein could be expressed but unstable. Because neurons are microinjected, we can only assess the expression of the exogenous PrP by immunocytochemistry. However, neurons express considerable levels of PrP, and it is therefore impossible to test the amount of proteins expressed from the Cep4β constructs in the microinjected neurons. Assuming that recombinant PrP is expressed similarly in neurons and other eukaryotic cells, we verified the expression level of PrP in eukaryotic cells by transfecting erythroleukemia K562 and neuroblastoma M17, two cell lines that lack endogenous expression of PrP. The transfected cells were selected for hygromycin resistance and PrP expression verified by immunoprecipitation of PrP from protein extracts of [35S]methionine metabolically labeled cells. We find that PrPΔOR is expressed at levels comparable with those of wild type PrP (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the loss of function of PrP is likely not a consequence of low PrPΔOR expression levels but rather the result of the disruption of the OR region. To assess the location of the neuroprotective PrP, PrP- and Bax-microinjected neurons were treated with the Golgi-disaggregating agent, BFA or monensin, an ionophore that prevents trafficking of secreted proteins past the cis-Golgi (38Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). BFA and monensin did not alter Bax-mediated cell death but completely inhibited the neuroprotective function of PrP against Bax (Fig. 2C). The action of BFA and monensin on PrP maturation was confirmed by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitating PrP (Fig.2D). In the absence of BFA or monensin, three PrP protein forms were immunoprecipitated. The higher molecular weight form becomes more abundant with time of labeling indicating that this protein represents the mature glycosylated form of PrP. In BFA, only two lower molecular weight proteins were immunoprecipitated, indicating the unglycosylated and immature glycosylated PrP expected of proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The immature PrP accumulates in BFA-treated neurons with time, and after 12 h of labeling represents the most abundant form. However, the mature form of PrP is not seen in BFA at 12 h indicating that BFA has effectively prevented the trafficking of PrP into the Golgi apparatus. Monensin has an effect on PrP that is similar to that of BFA. No mature protein is observed even after 12 h of labeling. However, monensin also reduces the level of PrP expression raising the additional possibility that with monensin treatment, low expression of PrP cannot compensate for the pro-apoptotic effect of Bax overexpression. In normal neurons, a small amount of PrP is immunoprecipitated from secreted medium after 12 h of labeling. However, this released PrP is not observed in BFA- or monensin-treated neurons. These results indicate that trafficking past the cis-Golgi is required for the neuroprotective function of PrP. In most cells, the majority of PrP exists as a GPI-anchored cell surface protein while Bax is a cytosolic protein with a C-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor (8Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 39Hsu Y. Wolter K. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GPI-anchored PrP mediates the neuroprotective function through signal transduction (14Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), we compared the neuroprotective ability of a PrP mutant lacking the GPI-anchor signal peptide sequence (PrPΔGPI)versus wild type PrP against Bax-induced neuronal apoptosis. PrPΔGPI is expressed at much lower levels than wild type PrP but is also secreted in the medium (Fig. 2B). However, PrPΔGPI is still neuroprotective (Fig. 2E) indicating that the cell surface GPI-anchored PrP is not necessary for PrP's neuroprotective function. We additionally tested if C-terminal mutations of PrP associated with prion diseases altered the neuroprotective ability of PrP against Bax-mediated cell death (Fig.3C). Whereas the T183A Familial Atypical Spongiform Encephalopathy (FASE) mutation (26Nitrini R. Rosemberg S. Passos-Bueno M.R. Lughetti P. Papadopoulos M. Carrilho P.E. Caramelli P. Albrecht S. Zatz M. LeBlanc A.C. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) partially inhibits PrP function, the D178N Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) mutation (27Medori R. Tritschler H.J. LeBlanc A. Villare F. Manetto V. Chen H.Y. Xue R. Leal S. Montagna P. Cortelli P. Tinuper P. Avoni P. Mochi M. Baruzzi A. Hauw J. Lugaresi E. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gambetti P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) completely abolishes the PrP neuroprotective function against Bax. These results indicate that the loss of function of PrP may be involved in the pathophysiology of these two diseases. In the present manuscript, we show an unprecedented function for prion protein against Bax-mediated neuronal cell death. Whereas the infectious nature of PrP is extensively studied, little is known about its normal cellular function. Kuwahara et al. (20Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) have shown that neuronal cell lines derived from PrP-null mice were more susceptible to serum deprivation and could be rescued by Bcl-2 or PrP. However, the mechanism by which PrP protected these cells was not proposed. Here, we show that PrP can prevent Bax-mediated cell death to levels equal to the neuroprotective function of Bcl-2. The neuroprotective effect of PrP is strong and prevents almost all Bax-microinjected neurons from cell death. It has previously been demonstrated that PrP protects neurons against oxidative stress through the octapeptide repeats (16Brown D.R. Wong B.-S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that deletion of the octapeptide repeats eliminates the neuroprotective function of PrP against Bax. However, PrP protects only 30% of cells against oxidative stress (15Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 40White A.R. Collins S.J. Maher F. Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. Thyer J.M. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Am. J.

Zhang, unpublished observations. compared with almost 100% protection against Bax. The neuroprotective function of normal PrP against Bax is surprising and unexpected. Generally, negative functions have been attributed to the PrP. However, a natural neuroprotective function is reasonable. First, PrP is highly expressed in some neurons and therefore would be expected to have a beneficial function. Second, the presence of endogenous PrP appears to be neuroprotective in vivo. For example, the presence of endogenous mouse PrP allows the production of hamster scrapie PrP in GFAP-hamster PrP transgenic mice infected with the hamster prion strain, 263K. In addition, transmission of disease is obtained from these mice. However, theprnp+/+ mice do not develop the neurodegenerative disorder observed in mouseprnp-null/GFAP-hamster PrP transgenic mice (41Raeber A.J. Race R.E. Brandner S. Priola S.A. Sailer A. Bessen R.A. Mucke L. Manson J. Aguzzi A. Oldstone M.B. Weissmann C. Chesebro B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6057-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although reduced titers (10–100-fold) of the PrP proteinase K-resistant form and infectivity in the mouse prnp+/+/transgenic hamster PrP could explain the lack of neurotoxicity, an alternative possibility is that the endogenous PrP is neuroprotective against the presence of the scrapie isoform of the PrP. PrP also protects against the cytotoxic effects of Doppel in Purkinge neurons (42Nishida N. Tremblay P. Sugimoto T. Shigematsu K. Shirabe S. Petromilli C. Erpel S.P. Nakaoke R. Atarashi R. Houtani T. Torchia M. Sakaguchi S. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Katamine S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). Bax is a powerful executioner of neurons (33Shindler K.S. Latham C.B. Roth K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find that this is also true in these human primary neurons. Although microinjection of recombinant active caspases leads to a slow death of the human primary neurons (30Zhang Y. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bax induces TUNEL-positive cell death in almost 70% of cells within 12 h (Fig. 1B). Therefore, PrP may be a natural strong protector against a major neuronal pro-apoptotic protein. Our finding that the GPI anchor is not required for PrP's anti-Bax function is also quite surprising. It is well established that the cell surface GPI-anchored PrP is the most abundant isoform of PrP in most cells. The results of the BFA experiment show that the neuroprotective form of PrP requires post-cis-Golgi modification or trafficking for function. However, with deletion of the GPI sequence, which abolishes the possibility of the GPI anchoring of PrP, the function is retained. Therefore, we conclude that the cell surface GPI-anchored PrP is not necessarily required for the neuroprotective function of PrP against Bax and that either a secreted or transmembrane form of PrP can embody the neuroprotective function. Interestingly, we find that the FFI and FASE PrP mutations undergo a loss of function against Bax-mediated cell death. Whether this is because of altered protein conformation or improper trafficking will need to be determined. However, these results suggest a possible mechanism to account for the extensive neuronal loss in these two neurodegenerative diseases. The unusual transmissible features of prion diseases has led to research where the major emphasis is on the “disease-causing” forms of PrP. Therefore, our finding that PrP is actually a strong neuroprotective agent against the major pro-apoptotic Bax protein is counterintuitive. We require further work in order to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism of PrP function against Bax. However, this study shows an interesting twist regarding the function of the already quite fascinating prion protein.

It is generally accepted that this bimodal pattern of methylation is established during development and is then faithfully inherited through subsequent cell divisions by a maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). The pattern of methylation is believed to direct local histone acetylation states. In contrast to this well accepted consensus, we show here using a transient transfection model that an active demethylase is involved in shaping patterns of methylation in somatic cells. Demethylase activity is directed by the state of histone acetylation, and therefore, the resulting methylation pattern is determined by local histone acetylation states contrary to the accepted model. Our data support a new model suggesting that the pattern of methylation is maintained by a dynamic balance of methylation and demethylation activities and the local state of histone acetylation. This provides a simple mechanism for explaining why active genes are not methylated.

Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2725-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for establishing this tight relationship remains unclear. The accepted model is that a sequence of methylation and demethylation events fashion the methylation pattern during development, but it is then faithfully inherited by a semiconservative DNA methyltransferase, DNMT11(2Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Methylation of newly synthesized DNA is exclusively determined by the state of methylation of the parental strand. The pattern of methylation is therefore believed to be fixed in somatic cells. Based on the assumption that DNA conserves its pattern of methylation in somatic cells, numerous experiments used transiently transfected methylated DNA to study the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression. In many of these studies the state of methylation of these ectopically methylated genes following transfection was not determined assuming that the pattern of methylation of the transfected gene did not change. Methylated DNA is associated with methyl CpG binding proteins, such as MeCP2, which reside in a complex with histone deacetylase activity (3Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). The current model is therefore that the pattern of methylation dictates the state of histone acetylation and chromatin configuration (4Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This attractive model explains the compartmentalization of the genome and its inheritance in somatic cells, but it can not explain how genes are demethylated upon their activation. An alternative and opposite interpretation of the tight correlation between histone acetylation is that active chromatin causes demethylation of associated sequences. Such a model can explain why active genes are not methylated and how their unmethylated state is maintained through cell division. This hypothesis that active chromatin can cause demethylation is supported by previous data. Treatment of mammalian cells with general histone deacetylase inhibitors can cause global demethylation of human Epstein-Barr virus producer cell lines' genomes (5Szyf M. Eliasson L. Mann V. Klein G. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8090-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly inNeurospora the deacetylase inhibitor TSA causes selective demethylation (6Selker E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9430-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recent data support the claim that inhibition of histone deacetylation can cause selective demethylation of some genes such as the IgfII receptor (7Hu J.F. Pham J. Dey I. Li T. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but not certain tumor suppressor genes (8Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Whereas this data shows that activation of genes by histone deacetylase inhibitors can lead toward loss of methylation, the mechanism is unclear. This loss of methylation might either be caused by inhibition of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase during replication, by site-specific proteins, by triggering site-specific repair activity, or by active site-specific or general demethylation. In this report we use a transient transfection approach to directly measure demethylation activity in human cells (HEK 293) and show that the state of methylation of DNA is not fixed in somatic cells but is dynamically modulated to correlate with the state of gene activity. This is accomplished by active demethylase activity that is directed by histone acetylation. These data provide a simple mechanism for explaining how active genes are demethylated and maintained in their unmethylated state. HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104/well in a six-well tissue culture dish and transiently transfected with 80 ng of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (9Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were repeated a minimum of three times using different cultures of HEK 293 cells. CAT assays were performed in triplicate as described previously (9Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were maintained as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Co). To serum starve the cells, confluent HEK 293 cells were cultured in a medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 72-h post-transfection. To determine the percentage of cells at different stages of the cell cycle, cells were stained with propidium iodide and the DNA content was measured by flow cytometry. pMetCAT+,SV40CAT, pCMV-GFP, and GFP plasmids were methylated in vitro by incubating 10 µg of plasmid DNA with 20 units of SssI CpG DNA methyltransferase (10Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (New England BioLabs Inc.) in a buffer recommended by the manufacturer containing 160 µmS-adenosylmethionine, at 37 °C for 2 h. After repeating this procedure three times, full protection from HpaII digestion was observed. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with minor modifications (11Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). 5 µg of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA samples was subjected to PCR amplification using the first set of primers described below. PCR products were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions utilizing nested primers. The PCR products of the second reaction were then subcloned using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit (we followed the manufacturer's protocol), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (we followed the manufacturer's protocol, procedure C). The primers used for the bacterial DNA chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) genomic region (GenBank 228 accession numberU65077) were: CAT5′1, 5′-ttgtttaatgtatttataattacat-3′; CAT5′(nested), 5′-taaagaaaaataagtataagtttta-3′; CAT3′1, 5′-ctcacccaaaaattaactaaaa-3′; CAT3′(nested), 5′-tttaaaaaaataaaccaaattttca-3′. The primers used for the enhanced green fluorescence protein (pEGFP-1) (CLONTECH) (GenBankTM accession numberU55761) were: GFP5′1, 5′-gttattatggtgagtaaggg-3′; GFP5′(nested), 5′-ggggtggtgtttattttgg-3′; GFP3′1, 5′-tataactattataattatactcca-3′; GFP3′ (nested), 5′-cttataccccaaaatattacc-3′. CHIP assays (12Crane-Robinson C. Myers F.A. Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were performed by following the Upstate Biotechnology Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay kit protocol (catalog no. 17-295). HEK 293 cells were transfected with 80 ng of in vitro methylatedpMetCAT+, SV40CAT, and pCMV-GFPplasmids, using the calcium phosphate method (see above). A final concentration of 0.3 µm TSA was added or not added to fresh medium 24 h after transfection. Formaldehyde was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 1%, 96-h post-transfection, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and chromatin was immunoprecipitated using an anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) as recommended by the manufacturer. One-tenth of the lysate was kept to quantitate the amount of DNA present in different samples before immunoprecipitation. DNA purified from both the immunoprecipitated and pre-immune (pre) samples was diluted from 1:10 to 1:10,000 serially and was subjected to PCR amplification using the following primers for the CAT and GFP genes: CAT 5′, 5′-cactggatataccaccgttga-3′; CAT 3′, 5′-aaaccctttagggaaataggc-3′; GFP 5′, 5′-caagggcgaggagctgtt-3′; GFP 3′, 5′-cggccatgatatagacgttg-3′. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) digestions (0–60 units) were performed on purified nuclei (13Ramain P. Bourouis M. Dretzen G. Richards G. Sobkowiak A. Bellard M. Cell. 1986; 45: 545-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 mm CaCl2, and 20% glycerol. The MNase reaction was terminated and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Total cell extracts were prepared using standard protocols and resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% for dMTase and 12.5% for GFP protein). After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane and blocking the nonspecific binding with 5% milk, GFP protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-8334) at 1:500 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5000. Transfected dMTase protein was detected using Anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal IgG (Invitrogen, R910-25) at 1:5000 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:20,000 dilution and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). If the methylation pattern of genes in somatic cells is static as predicted by the semiconservative model of methylation, an ectopically methylated gene will remain methylated in somatic cells. If the methylation pattern and its correlation with gene activity are a dynamic balance of methylation and demethylation, then the cell should recognize ectopically methylated DNA and fashion its pattern of methylation in accordance with its state of activity. We therefore first tested the hypothesis that somatic cells can recognize an ectopically methylated gene and demethylate it when it resides downstream from a strong promoter but not when it is found downstream from an inactive or weak promoter. We chose to compare the state of methylation of an identical reporter gene sequence to exclude the possibility that any observed differences in demethylation are a result of a sequence-specific property of the demethylated region. ThepMetCAT+ fusion construct expressing the bacterial (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) CAT reporter gene under the direction of 2 kb of the DNA dnmt1 regulatory region was previously shown to be highly active in P19 cells (9Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is inactive in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A). In comparison, the CAT reporter gene, which is controlled by the SV40 promoter, is highly active in HEK 293 cells (Fig.1A). Both fusion constructs were fully methylated in vitro with SssI methylase and transfected into HEK 293 cells using the calcium phosphate protocol (9Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, DNA from these cells was isolated and the methylation state of CpGs residing in a 265-bp region within the CAT reporter gene was determined by bisulfite mapping. 45% of CpGs became demethylated within the CAT region under the control of theSV40 promoter, whereas almost no demethylation (3.5%) was detected within the CAT region downstream from thednmt1 regulatory region (Fig. 1B). This experiment demonstrates that identical sequences can be differentially demethylated in HEK 293 cells depending on their state of expression. We next determined whether this demethylation is unique to theCAT reporter gene and whether it occurs exclusively when a reporter gene is found downstream from the SV40 promoter. Therefore, we performed the same assay using an in vitromethylated GFP (green fluorescence protein) reporter gene, which is positioned under the control of a different strong viral promoter from CMV (Fig.2A). Sodium bisulfite mapping of a region within the GFP gene, downstream from theCMV promoter, revealed that the GFP reporter became demethylated albeit to a lesser extent than SV40CAT(Fig. 2A, −TSA). This experiment confirms that HEK 293 cells bear a demethylation activity that demethylates ectopically methylated sequences residing downstream from strong promoters. Most or all the CpGs residing in the entire region of 250 bp of GFP are demethylated in some plasmid molecules suggesting that demethylation is regional and not site-specific. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for modifying and activating chromatin, including binding of activators, histone acetylation and deacetylation, ATP-dependent remodeling and formation of a pre-initiation complex (14Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). To determine whether regional demethylation requires histone acetylation, we tested whether the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) increases the demethylation of ectopically methylated reporter genes, (Fig. 2,A and B). Bisulfite mapping of the GFPreporter in transfectants treated with 0.3 µM TSA for 72 h, showed almost complete demethylation compared with limited demethylation in the absence of TSA (Fig. 2A). A representative Southern blot of in vitro methylatedGFP plasmid transfected into HEK cells treated or untreated with TSA is shown in Fig. 2C. The histogram in Fig.2D represents the quantification of demethylation of theGFP reporter gene as determined by Southern blot analyses. The degree of demethylation was determined by quantifying the relative abundance of the fully digested HpaII fragment (529 bp) per lane, by image densitometry. The numbers and standard errors represent the average of demethylation from three independent experiments. A 4-fold increase in demethylation of transfected plasmid occurs in the presence of TSA. These results imply that deacetylated histones protect ectopically methylated DNA from active demethylation in HEK 293 cells. TSA also induces a change in the state of expression of theGFP reporter plasmid, as expected. Fig. 2E shows HEK cells as examined under fluorescent light with regular light overlaid with the same field. Within the same size field, an average of 18% of cells expressed GFP when treated with TSA, versusonly 0.13% of in the absence of TSA. Regional demethylation downstream from strong promoters may be a consequence of the interaction of specific factors with distinct cis elements in the promoter region, or the formation of a pre-initiation complex that might be stimulated by TSA inhibition of histone deacetylation (14Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). To determine whether histone acetylation can trigger demethylation irrespective of the presence of a specific promoter, we tested whether a promoterless GFPconstruct becomes demethylated in HEK cells. As illustrated in Fig.2F, TSA stimulates demethylation of a GFP reporter sequence residing in a promoterless plasmid, as indicated by the almost complete digestion of the GFP sequence with the endonucleaseHpaII (which cleaves the sequence CCGG only when it is not methylated). The relative abundance of fully demethylatedHpaII fragments from four independent experiments was quantified using image densitometry and graphed in Fig. 2G. A 5-fold increase in demethylation of transfected plasmid occurs in the presence of TSA. This data supports the hypothesis that histone acetylation and not necessarily the presence of a unique regulatory region directs the demethylation of a sequence of DNA in HEK cells. pCMV-GFP-transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TSA (Fig.3A) and subjected to Southern blot analysis to investigate the dose response between demethylation and inhibition of histone acetylation. HpaII sensitivity goes from undetectable with 0 µm TSA, to complete with 0.3 µm TSA, demonstrating that demethylation increases with increasing TSA concentration. The extent of demethylation ofGFP in the presence of TSA increases with increasing time (Fig. 3B). HpaII sensitivity goes from undetectable at 48 h post-transfection, to complete after 96 h. This time course also illustrates stability of the transfected plasmid throughout the transfection experiment under these conditions and suggests that demethylation of exogenously introduced methylated plasmid occurs slowly, beginning only 72 h post-transfection. Because the experimental paradigm used to detect demethylation requires the incubation of cells with TSA for 72 h, we determined whether cell cycle arrest is not a factor in changing the methylation pattern. In vitro methylatedGFP-transfected HEK cells were replenished with either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of TSA, or 0.5% fetal calf serum (fcs), and harvested 72 h post-transfection. Harvested cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to determine the cell cycle profile (Fig.4A). Both cell populations that were either serum-starved (0.5% fetal calf serum) or treated with TSA displayed the same shift in cell cycle, from G1toward G2 (Fig. 4A). The state of methylation of transfected GFP plasmid under the different conditions was analyzed by sodium bisulfite mapping (Fig. 4B). Contrary to cells treated with TSA, which displayed 100% demethylation, no significant demethylation occurred in transfected GFPplasmid in serum-starved cells. Because the alterations in the cell cycle profiles of serum-starved and TSA-treated cells were similar, this experiment is consistent with the conclusion that cell cycle changes caused by TSA per se are not responsible for the observed demethylation. To demonstrate that transiently transfected DNA is associated with either acetylated or deacetylated histones and that TSA can alter the state of acetylation of histones bound to the GFP and CAT reporter sequences, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP) using anti acetyl-histone H3 antibody. The results presented in Fig.5show that there is an increased association of the CAT gene sequence with acetylated histones when they reside downstream from the strong SV40promoter/enhancer (Fig. 5A, −TSA,+AB) relative to those residing downstream from the pMet regulatory region (Fig. 5E, −TSA,+AB). TSA increases the abundance of both CAT andGFP sequences associated with acetylated histones (Fig. 5,A and C, +TSA, +AB). Interestingly, TSA treatment does not increase acetylation of histones associated with pMetCAT+ (Fig. 5E,+TSA, +AB), which is consistent with previous studies that demonstrate that not all sequences are acetylated following TSA treatment (8Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the context of factors interacting with some regions renders them inaccessible to HATs. Consistent with our hypothesis, the pMetCAT+ plasmid is not demethylated even after TSA treatment (data not shown). To provide a direct assessment of whether DNA associated with acetylated chromatin is demethylated, SV40CAT plasmid DNA isolated from anti-acetyl H3 histone immunoprecipitated samples, treated or not treated with TSA, was subjected to bisulfite mapping (Fig.5B). All clones analyzed displayed almost complete demethylation, in contrast to non-immunoprecipitated DNA (Fig.5B). The same degree of demethylation was also apparent forpCMVGFP plasmid DNA isolated from immunoprecipitated samples; however, in this case DNA was amplified only from cells treated with TSA (Fig. 5D). DNA could not be immunoprecipitated when attempting to IP fromGFP-transfected cells, which were not treated with TSA, nor from cells transfected with pMetCAT plasmid in the presence or absence of TSA. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that methylated DNA is associated with deacetylated histones as a result of recruitment of histone deacetylases by methylated DNA binding proteins such as MeCP2 (15Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2782) Google Scholar). The SV40promoter seems to be less affected by methylation as evident by the fact that it is partially immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against acetylated histones. The fact that DNA that is associated with acetylated histones is demethylated even in the absence of TSA treatment supports the hypothesis that demethylation following TSA treatment requires acetylation of the histones associated with the specific gene and is not a consequence of a general increase in demethylase activity. This result can explain why TSA treatmentper se does not result in demethylation of all endogenous genes (8Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Experiments with transiently transfected DNA have resulted in the abundance of information on the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes as well as the effects of DNA methylation and histone acetylation and deacetylation on gene expression. However, the issue of whether transiently transfected DNA is assembled into nucleosomes has been controversial (16Smith C.L. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27493-27496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Using plasmids transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, Reeves et al. (17Reeves R. Gorman C.M. Howard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3599-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that nucleosomal ladders are generated, which appeared indistinguishable from those of bulk cellular chromatin. On the other hand, Archer and colleagues (18Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) failed to observe nucleosome repeat patterns on transiently transfected murine mammary tumor virus promoter. To address this question in our study we carried out micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestions of isolated nuclei from cells transiently transfected with methylated GFP in the presence of TSA (Fig. 6). Nuclei were subjected to digestion with increasing amounts of MNase (0–600 units/ml) for 20 min at 20 °C. Bulk DNA was isolated and fractionated on a 1.8% agarose gel (Fig. 6, first panel). Multiplicity of nucleosomal arrays are indicated (1 = mononucleosome, 2 = dinucleosome, etc.). The fractionated DNA was subjected to Southern blot analysis and hybridization with a 32P-labeled GFP fragment (Fig. 6,second panel). Mononucleosomes and dinucleosomes can be detected but at lower doses of MNase than bulk DNA, consistent with previous findings showing that digestion of transcriptionally active genes is more rapid than bulk DNA (19Sun Y.L. Xu Y.Z. Bellard M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data is consistent with the previously proposed model that nucleosomes are deposited onto non-replicating DNA in transfected cells; however, it is possible that the overall structure may not be as organized as replicated cellular chromatin. Nevertheless, the transiently transfected DNA allows one to dissect some of the basic principles of the interaction between demethylase and DNA assembled into nucleosomes. Recent data have demonstrated that binding of a transcriptional activator to its cognate site results in site-specific demethylation by a passive replication-dependent mechanism (20Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism was proposed to explain the demethylation of active genes during development (20Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test whether the demethylation detected after transient transfection and treatment with TSA is occurring by a similar mechanism, we digested DNA prepared from TSA-treated HEK cells that were transiently transfected with in vitro methylatedpCMV-GFP, with the restriction enzymes Dpn1 andXbaI. DpnI cleaves the sequence GATC only when the adenine is methylated on both strands (21McWhinney C. Leffak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because mammalian cells do not bear a methylase that methylates the adenine in GATC, replication of the plasmid in HEK cells will render it resistant toDpnI digestion. XbaI, on the other hand, does not cleave the sequence TCTAGAtc (which is present in pCMV-GFP) when the adenine is methylated (22McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Replication of the plasmid in mammalian cells will render it sensitive to XbaI digestion. However, the data presented in Fig. 7show that, although the transfected pCMV-GFP is fully cleaved with HpaII (Fig. 7A) indicating that it is fully demethylated following TSA treatment, it is completely digested with DpnI and resistant to XbaI (Fig.7B). Control experiments shown in Fig. 7Cdemonstrate that the plasmids are completely methylated prior to their transfection into HEK cells, because they are resistant toHpaII cleavage. These data demonstrate that the plasmid did not replicate in HEK cells. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that increasing histone acetylation induces replication-independent active demethylation of DNA. We recently cloned and demonstrated that the methylated DNA binding protein MBD2b bears a demethylase (dMTase) activity (23Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The availability of a cloned demethylase cDNA allowed us to determine whether the rate-limiting step for demethylation is exclusively the state of acetylation of histones or whether increasing the level of demethylase in the cell could increase demethylation. Methylated GFP was cotransfected with or without the Mbd2b/demethylaseexpression vector His-dMTase (23Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) into HEK 293 cells. We mapped the state of methylation of the transfected GFP gene by bisulfite mapping shown in Fig.8A. The extent of demethylation within the highly CG rich area of the GFP gene is 27% compared with 66% demethylation when dMTase is cotransfected with GFP. Fig. 8B shows a representative Southern blot of transfected GFP in the absence or presence of His-dMTase plasmid. The histograms in Fig. 8C represent the quantification of demethylation of theGFP reporter gene as determined by Southern blot analyses. The degree of demethylation was determined by quantifying the relative abundance of the fully digested HpaII fragment (529 bp) per lane, by image densitometry. The numbers and standard errors represent the average of demethylation from three independent experiments. These experiments demonstrate that demethylation of a given sequence is dependent on the abundance of demethylase in addition t"

An additional protein, which does not correspond to any previously known subunit of the complex I assembly, has now been detected. Denaturing gels of subcomplex Iλ, the hydrophilic arm of complex I, clearly show a hitherto unidentified band, which was digested with trypsin and subjected to mass-spectrometric analysis to provide several peptide sequences, used in cDNA cloning and sequencing. Measurement of the intact protein mass indicated that the N terminus is acetylated. The new complex I subunit (B16.6) is the bovine homolog of GRIM-19, the product of a cell death regulatory gene induced by interferon-β and retinoic acid, thus providing a new link between the mitochondrion and its electron-transport chain and apoptotic cell death.

Denaturing gels of subcomplex Iλ, the hydrophilic arm of complex I, clearly show a hitherto unidentified band, which was digested with trypsin and subjected to mass-spectrometric analysis to provide several peptide sequences, used in cDNA cloning and sequencing. Measurement of the intact protein mass indicated that the N terminus is acetylated. The new complex I subunit (B16.6) is the bovine homolog of GRIM-19, the product of a cell death regulatory gene induced by interferon-β and retinoic acid, thus providing a new link between the mitochondrion and its electron-transport chain and apoptotic cell death. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gene associated with retinoid interferon-induced mortality collisional-induced dissociation electrospray ionization high performance liquid chromatography lauryldimethylamine oxide matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry polymerase chain reaction quadrupole time of flight Mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) catalyzes the first step in the electron transport chain, the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ coupled to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Saraste M.

Complex I from bovine heart mitochondria is a highly complex, multisubunit, membrane-bound assembly, with a molecular mass of over 900 kDa. The sequences of 42 of the subunits of complex I have been reported previously (3Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 5Skehel J.M. Fearnley I.M.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); seven are mitochondrial gene products, whereas the rest are encoded in the nucleus and imported into the organelle from the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic complex I systems are simpler assemblies of 13–14 subunits, all of them conserved in eukaryotes, and contain an equivalent set of redox cofactors (8Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial complex I is a roughly L-shaped assembly (10Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Grigorieff N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Hofhaus G. Weiss H. Leonard K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), with one arm in the plane of the lipid bilayer. The other, containing the more hydrophilic subunits, protrudes from the membrane and can be dissociated from it, producing subcomplex Iλ (13Finel M. Majander A.S. Tyynelä J. De Jong A.M.P. Albracht S.P.J. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,14Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The oxidation of NADH is catalyzed at an active site containing non-covalently-bound flavin mononucleotide, and electrons are transported through the assembly to the ubiquinone acceptor via iron-sulfur clusters. Subcomplex Iλ contains 15 subunits of complex I and all of its known redox cofactors but has no bound ubiquinone; it is thus active in NADH oxidation but only when coupled to artificial electron acceptors such as ferricyanide or hexaamineruthenium. With the aim of unambiguously defining the subunit composition of subcomplex Iλ (13Finel M. Majander A.S. Tyynelä J. De Jong A.M.P. Albracht S.P.J. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), each of the bands resolved by SDS-PAGE1 analysis was examined by peptide-mass mapping. In this way, 14 known subunits of mitochondrial complex I were confirmed as being present in the subcomplex. In addition, a 15th band, not corresponding to any known subunit, was observed, running close to subunit B17.2. This additional protein, which is tightly associated with subcomplex Iλ, was investigated by mass mapping and tandem MS of its tryptic peptides, and the corresponding cDNA was sequenced. The mature protein, of 143 amino acids, has an acetylated α-amino group. The presence of the new protein has also been confirmed in intact complex I, and following the nomenclature for mitochondrial complex I it has been named B16.6 (3Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence clearly identifies subunit B16.6 of mitochondrial complex I to be the bovine homolog of the GRIM-19 protein, the product of a cell death regulatory gene induced by interferon-β and retinoic acid. GRIM-19 has previously been detected in HeLa cells, predominantly in the nucleus, though punctate staining of the cytoplasm was also observed (15Hofman E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X.

Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from bovine hearts (17Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial membranes were prepared by disruption with a Waring blender in the presence of potassium chloride (18Walker J.E. Skehel J.M. Buchanan S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Complex I was purified according to Sazanov et al. (14Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), by solubilization with dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) and ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose HP media (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pooled complex I fractions were either used to prepare subcomplex Iλ (see below) or subjected to further purification using a second ion-exchange separation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration (14Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Subcomplex Iλ was prepared by a procedure developed from that of Finel et al. (13Finel M. Majander A.S. Tyynelä J. De Jong A.M.P. Albracht S.P.J. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Complex I, from the first ion-exchange column above, was precipitated by addition of dodecylmaltoside to 1%, sodium cholate (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) to 1.8%, and ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. After centrifugation, the resulting pellet was dissolved into 1% LDAO (Calbiochem), 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (Melford Laboratories, Ipswich, UK), to a final concentration of ∼10 mg ml−1. Portions were layered onto linear sucrose gradients (12 ml, 5–15% sucrose, 0.5% LDAO, 500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 ×g. The sharp yellow-brown band in the center of the gradient was concentrated to ∼6 mg ml−1 by ultrafiltration (YM-100; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and portions (0.5 ml) were injected onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted (0.3 ml min−1) in a buffer containing 0.1% LDAO, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The colored fractions spanning the apex of the symmetrical absorbance peak (280 nm) were pooled and stored in liquid nitrogen (concentration ∼1 mg ml−1). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Merck and were of analytical grade. SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a 12–22% acrylamide gradient, and gels were stained with either 0.2% Coomassie Blue R250 (7% acetic acid, 50% methanol) or 0.1% colloidal Coomassie G250 (3% phosphoric acid, 6% ammonium sulfate) (20Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 427-448Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequence analysis, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a solution of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Excised Coomassie Blue-stained bands were analyzed by automated Edman degradation using a model 494 Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Bands were excised from the gel, cleaved “in-gel” with trypsin (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), and the mixture of tryptic peptides was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a TofSpec 2E mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK) and α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid as the matrix. Spectra were calibrated using peptides from trypsin autolysis at 2163.057 and 2273.160, and a matrix-related ion at 1060.048 was present in each spectrum. Peptide sequences were obtained by tandem MS after CID with argon gas in a Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with ESI (Micromass Q-TOF; Altrincham, UK), which was tuned and calibrated using the CID fragments of a synthetic peptide, [Glu1] fibrinopeptide B (Sigma-Aldrich). Peptide mixtures from in-gel tryptic digest were desalted on a Poros R2 50-Å reverse-phase support (PerSeptive Biosystems), eluted in 1 µl of 1% formic acid, 60% methanol, introduced into the mass spectrometer from a nano-electrospray interface (22Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar), or transferred directly (1 µl min−1) from an “on-line” capillary HPLC (CapLC; Micromass), following fractionation on a PepMapC18 column (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid. MS and tandem MS data were acquired automatically. Peptide fragmentation spectra were interpreted manually, assembled into Peptide Sequence Tags (23Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), and compared with protein sequence data bases. Peptide sequences were also used to design synthetic oligonucleotide primers (see below) and later for the verification of the cDNA-derived sequence (see Table I).Table ITryptic peptides from subunit B16.6 identified by tandem MSm/zCharge of ionMH+1(monoisotopic)MH+1(sequence)PeptideResiduesSequence622.33+1864.91863.93T2–35–21VKQDMPPVGGYGPIDYK674.43+2021.22020.03T2–45–22VKQDMPPVGGYGPIDYKR818.92+1636.81636.77T37–21QDMPPVGGYGPIDYK661.42+1321.71321.69Non-tryptic11–22PVGGYGPIDYKR638.82+1276.61276.66T11–1258–67RLQIEDFEAR560.82+1120.61120.56T1259–67LQIEDFEAR613.92+1226.71226.72T1368–78IALMPLLQAEK552.33+1654.91653.95T13–1568–81IALMPLLQAEKDRR458.32+915.6915.56T15–1681–87RVLQMLR678.43+2033.12033.04T16–1782–98VLQMLRENLEEEATVMK646.82+1292.61292.60T1788–98ENLEEEATVMK566.82+1132.61132.58T19105–114VGESVFHTTR517.22+1033.41033.50Non-tryptic106–114GESVFHTTR469.82+938.6938.48Non-tryptic120–127MGELYGLR930.02+1858.91836.87T21128–143ASEEVLSATYGFIWYTIdentified sequences within peptides are underlined (I and L are isobaric and are not distinguishable).

Open table in a new tab Identified sequences within peptides are underlined (I and L are isobaric and are not distinguishable).

Subunit B16.6 was also purified by reverse-phase HPLC of subcomplex Iλ on an Aquapore RP-300 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Before application to the column, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 6m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then centrifuged. Subunit B16.6 eluted at ∼63% acetonitrile, immediately following subunit PSST and often co-eluting with the 30-kDa subunit. Portions of eluate were examined by ESI MS as described below. Tryptic digests of the purified subunits, analyzed by tandem MS, provided additional, confirmatory sequence data (see Table I). The molecular mass of intact B16.6, purified by reverse-phase HPLC, was measured by ESI MS using a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, which was tuned and calibrated with a mixture of poly(propylene glycols) over the range ofm/z 59 to 2010 and checked using horse heart myoglobin (average mass 16951.4 Da). Samples were introduced, via a Rheodyne loop, into a stream (3 µl min−1) of 50% aqueous acetonitrile, and spectra were recorded by scanning the first quadrupole (Q1) from 700 to 1700 m/z. cDNA was amplified from total bovine heart cDNA by PCR using Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany). First, the mixed primers F1, F2, R1, and R2, based on partial amino acid sequences from tandem MS, were synthesized (see Fig. 2A). Primers F1 (CARGAYATGCCNCCNGT) and R1 (GTRTACCANARRAANCC) were used to amplify a partial cDNA, and the product of this reaction was then used as template for a second reaction with the two nested primers F2 (ATHGARGAYTTYGARGC) and R2 (CCRTANARYTCNCCCAT). The PCR product from the second reaction was sequenced directly. The partial sequence was extended to the 5′- and 3′-ends using unique primers. For the 3′-extension, the primer F3 (see Fig. 2A) and a reverse oligo(dT) primer were used, and the PCR product was sequenced directly. For the first 5′-extension, bovine heart cDNA with a 5′-poly(A) tail was used as template with reverse primer R3, and the PCR product was sequenced directly, thereby extending the sequence to base 145 (see Fig. 2A). In a second 5′-extension reaction, bovine heart cDNA synthesized using a SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template, with the forward primer TAGAAGCTTGAATTCGGATCCCGCAGAGTACGCGGG (F4) and reverse primer R4. The product was cloned into a pET vector, and colonies identified by PCR screening were used for sequencing. This yielded a set of clones of different lengths, the longest extending 31 bases upstream of the ATG initiator codon. All the cDNA sequences reported, excepting bases 1–3, have been confirmed by at least two independent DNA sequences. The subunits of bovine mitochondrial complex I and subcomplex Iλ were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1) and analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting (data not shown). This confirmed the presence of 14 known components of complex I in subcomplex Iλ (Fig. 1) and also revealed a further band that did not correspond to any known complex I subunit. The new protein was also identified in intact complex I. It could not be removed from the complex by any of the following procedures: extended washing of complex I bound to an ion-exchange column, gel filtration, dialysis, treatment with 2 m NaCl followed by dialysis, ammonium sulfate precipitation, or precipitation by dialysis against a low ionic strength buffer. In addition, the new protein is also present in subcomplex Iλ, prepared by disrupting complex I with LDAO, and purified using a sucrose gradient and gel filtration. Therefore, the new protein is not adventitiously bound to complex I, and because it is present in the complex at approximately the same molar ratio as other subunits (as estimated by gel band intensities and the relative yields in HPLC experiments) it is reasonable to conclude that it is a bona fide subunit of the assembly. The new protein gave no N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation, suggesting that the N terminus is modified (see below) and in accordance with the nomenclature for bovine mitochondrial complex I has been named B16.6 (3Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Subunit B16.6 is observed reproducibly in all our preparations of bovine complex I and subcomplex Iλ. The complicated SDS-PAGE patterns of complex I and the inaccessibility of the N terminus provide likely reasons why B16.6 has been overlooked previously. The tryptic peptide mixture from the unidentified protein band was examined by tandem MS, and amino acid sequences from several tryptic peptides were determined (TableI). These were assembled into Protein Sequence Tags (23Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), and comparison with protein sequence data bases revealed a precise match of one tag ((879.5) L/I E D (522.3)), to the human protein GRIM-19 (accession number AF286697). A number of other peptide sequences (Table I) also aligned readily with the human sequence, suggesting B16.6 to be a homolog of human GRIM-19; they later confirmed the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA sequencing (see below). The nucleotide sequence encoding B16.6 and the deduced amino acid sequence are displayed in Fig. 2A. The 5′-sequence of the cDNA extends 31 bases upstream of the proposed initiator methionine codon and does not contain an in-phase stop codon. The mass of the intact protein measured by ESI MS (16585 Da) was found to be consistent with the mass calculated from the sequence (16584.3 Da), provided that the initiator methionine is cleaved from the mature protein and that the N-terminal alanine residue is acetylated. The B16.6 subunit has a predicted isopotential point of 9.7. Values above pH 9.5 are predicted for approximately half the subunits of mitochondrial complex I and for almost all of the 12 nuclear-encoded subunits with modified N termini. The hydropathy profile (not shown) demonstrates the amphipathic nature of subunit B16.6 (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), with one potential transmembrane α-helical domain between residues 29 and 47 (25Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with B16.6 comprising part of subcomplex Iλ; whereas it is expected to be predominantly hydrophilic, isolated subcomplex Iλ aggregates in the absence of detergent, suggesting the presence of hydrophobic surface patches. Because of its strong association with subcomplex Iλ, subunit B16.6 is likely to be located predominantly on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, but its topography in the inner membrane is not known, and either residues 1–28 or 48–143 could lie in the intermembrane space. The sequences of human GRIM-19 (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and B16.6 from bovine complex I are 83% identical (Fig. 2B). Data base entries (EMBL and EST) for other vertebrate homologs also show high identities with the bovine protein: 94, 83, 81, 73, 73, and 70% for pig, mouse, rat, zebrafish, oryzias, and chicken, respectively. In all species (see also Fig. 2B), the N-terminal sequences are highly conserved, though deletion of the N-terminal 50 amino acids of GRIM-19 did not inhibit cell death (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The 25 C-terminal amino acids are markedly less conserved. In addition, there are a number of plant homologs, for example from soybean, sorghum, cotton fiber, wheat, barley, and barrel medic, which show high identity with each other but a maximum of 46% identity with bovine B16.6. However, the sequence of residues 97–109 remains highly conserved. Deletion of the C-terminal 43 amino acids of GRIM-19 showed their importance in promoting cell death (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), consistent with an important role for residues 97–109. However, this motif does not appear to have the characteristics of an ATP binding domain (26Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) as was suggested by Angell et al.(16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The acetylation of the alanine N terminus and the presence of a methionine at position −1 indicate that, in common with 18 other subunits of complex I, no cleavable presequence is used to target B16.6 to mitochondria (3Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 6Walker J.E. Arizmendi J.M. Dupuis A. Fearnley I.M. Finel M. Medd S.M. Pilkington S.J. Runswick M.J. Skehel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1051-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Of these 18 subunits, 12 are modified at the N terminus, 11 by acetylation and 1 by myristylation; for such proteins, the localization signal must lie within the mature protein (27Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 28Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The cellular distribution of GRIM-19 (B16.6) is complex. It has been detected, with antibodies, primarily in the nucleus of HeLa cells, though “punctate” staining in the cytoplasm, possibly corresponding to mitochondria, was also observed (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcripts of GRIM-19 are particularly elevated in human heart and skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in liver, kidney, and placenta, correlating approximately with the relative abundance of mitochondria in these tissues (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although only one human gene for GRIM-19 has been detected (29Chidambaram N.V. Angell J.E. Ling W. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it remains possible that differential splicing provides the means to target the protein to more than one site. A second possibility is that targeting is controlled by a post-translational modification such as acetylation or phosphorylation. Angell et al. (16Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have suggested that human GRIM-19 is phosphorylated constitutively, but there is no indication from our mass spectrometric analysis for a phosphoryl group in mitochondrial B16.6. Another mitochondrial protein, endonuclease G, has been shown to be released from mitochondria during apoptosis and subsequently translocated to the nucleus (30Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Clearly the targeting of GRIM-19 (B16.6) to either nucleus or mitochondria requires further study. B16.6 is the 43rd subunit of bovine mitochondrial complex I to be identified. It is possible that it represents the completion of the primary structure of this complex enzyme, although a protein with a molecular mass of 10566 (±2) Da, observed in some preparations, has not yet been explained (5Skehel J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2060678423,"To explore the role of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products in the initial phase of stress mediated signaling, we studied the effect of mild, transient oxidative or heat stress on parameters that regulate the cellular concentration of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). When K562 cells were exposed to mild heat shock (42 °C, 30 min) or oxidative stress (50 µmH2O2, 20 min) and allowed to recover for 2 h, there was a severalfold induction of hGST5.8, which catalyzes the formation of glutathione-4-HNE conjugate (GS-HNE), and RLIP76, which mediates the transport of GS-HNE from cells (Awasthi, S., Cheng, J., Singhal, S.

Enhanced LPO was observed in stressed cells, but the major antioxidant enzymes and HSP70 remained unaffected. The stressed cells showed higher GS-HNE-conjugating activity and increased efflux of GS-HNE. Stress-pre-conditioned cells with induced hGST5.8 and RLIP76 acquired resistance to 4-HNE and H2O2-mediated apoptosis by suppressing a sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and caspase 3. The protective effect of stress pre-conditioning against apoptosis was abrogated by coating the cells with anti-RLIP76 IgG, which inhibited the efflux of GS-HNE from cells, indicating that the cells acquired resistance to apoptosis by metabolizing and excluding 4-HNE at a higher rate. Induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76 by mild, transient stress and the resulting resistance of stress-pre-conditioned cells to apoptosis appears to be a general phenomenon since it was not limited to K562 cells but was also evident in lung cancer cells, H-69, H-226, human leukemia cells, HL-60, and human retinal pigmented epithelial cells.

Available evidence suggests that depending upon its intracellular concentration, 4-HNE may differentially affect the cell cycle regulation. For example, it has been shown that at low concentrations, 4-HNE causes proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells (14Ruef J. Rao G.N. Li F. Bode C. Patterson C. Bhatnagar A. Runge M.S. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and K562 cells (6Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Singhal J. Piper J.T. Van Kuijk F.J. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but at relatively higher concentrations, it causes differentiation and apoptosis in these cells (6Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Singhal J. Piper J.T. Van Kuijk F.J. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular concentrations of 4-HNE must be stringently controlled. Because the formation of 4-HNE results from LPO, an uncontrolled process depending on the levels of cellular redox status, the intracellular levels of 4-HNE must be controlled through its metabolism and elimination of the metabolites from cells. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) mediated conjugation of 4-HNE to glutathione (GSH), resulting in the formation of the GSH-conjugate (GS-HNE), is the major pathway for its metabolism (15Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

Thus, the levels of expression and activities of hGST5.8 or/and hGSTA4-4 and RLIP76 may be the major determinants of the intracellular concentrations of 4-HNE. In aerobic organisms, reactive oxygen species such as O 2−, H2O2, OH⋅ are continually generated, and their overproduction during stress (oxidative, chemical, heat) conditions causes adverse effects. Under most of these stress conditions LPO is increased with an expected increase in the formation of 4-HNE. Pro-apoptotic agents such as H2O2 or a variety of xenobiotics (e.g. doxorubicin) also lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and induce LPO, suggesting a possible role of LPO products in apoptotic signaling. This idea is consistent with the results of our recent studies showing that attenuation of LPO in K562 by transfection with hGSTA2–3, which specifically reduces lipid hydroperoxides, blocks H2O2-induced apoptosis in these cells (30Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19220-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A clear link between LPO and stress-mediated apoptotic signaling is, however, not established. We reasoned that if 4-HNE derived from LPO is involved in stress-mediated signaling for apoptosis, then one of the early responses of the cells may be to eliminate 4-HNE through its enhanced conjugation to GSH catalyzed by hGST5.8 and the subsequent transport of the conjugate, GS-HNE, by RLIP76. Therefore, during the present studies we have examined the effect of relatively low levels of heat (30 min, 42 °C) and oxidative (50 µm H2O2, 20 min exposure) stress on the expression and functions of hGST5.8 and RLIP76. K562 cells were chosen for these experiments because these cells constitutively express hGST5.8 (31Singhal S.S. Awasthi S. Pandya U. Piper J.T. Saini M.K. Cheng J.Z. Awasthi Y.C. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 109: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as RLIP76 and, when transfected with RLIP76, show enhanced efflux of GS-HNE (27Awasthi S. Cheng J. Singhal S.S. Saini M.K.

Results of these studies demonstrate that the induction of RLIP76 and hGST5.8 is an early adaptive response of cells exposed to mild heat shock (42 °C, 30 min) or low levels of transient oxidative stress (50 µm H2O2, 20 min), and the cells pre-exposed to these stress conditions suppress H2O2- and 4-HNE-mediated activation of JNK and caspase 3 and acquire resistance to apoptosis. These findings suggest that hGST5.8 and RLIP76 play regulatory roles in mechanisms in stress-mediated apoptosis.

Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase activities were determined in 28,000 ×g supernatants of cell homogenates prepared in buffer A containing 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethnol. For determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and GSH levels, 2-mercaptoethnol was excluded from homogenizing buffer. GST activity toward CDNB was determined by the method of Habig et al.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). GPx activity toward cumene hydroperoxide or H2O2 was measured according to the method described by us earlier (30Yang Y.

Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar), and GSH was measured as non-protein thiols according to the method of Beutler et al. (45Beutler E. Duron O. Kelley B.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 61: 882-888PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled and 4-[3H]GS-HNE were synthesized enzymatically using purified human GSTs. Briefly, 1 µmol of GSH was incubated with 10 µmol of 4-[3H]HNE in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and two units GST at 37 °C for 30 min. GS-HNE conjugate was purified by thin layer chromatography over silica gel G plates as described in Xiao et al. (46Xiao B. Singh S.P. Nanduri B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Ji X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11887-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The authenticity of GS-HNE was confirmed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectra as described previously (15Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E.

The specific activity of [3H]GS-HNE was determined by measuring radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6800), and the concentration of GS-HNE was determined by the previously described colorometic assay (47Lee Y.P. Takahashi T. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 71-77Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In these experiments, 50 × 106 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 2 ml of PBS buffer containing 20 µm 4-[3H]HNE (specific activity 3,800 cpm/nmol). The cells loaded with 4-[3H]HNE were harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g, washed with PBS (2 × 2 ml), resuspended in 2 ml of medium, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C for measuring the transport. After incubation, the cells were harvested, the media was quantitatively separated, and the radioactivity associated with the media and that retained within the cells was determined. Determinations were made in triplicate for the controls (untreated), heat shock-treated and H2O2-treated, and antibody-coated cells in parallel experiments under identical conditions using equal number of cells. For isolation and characterization of GS-HNE, the medium was lyophilized and extracted with 200 µl of 70% ethanol, and the extract was used for HPLC analysis to isolate and characterize [3H]GS-HNE as described above for synthetic GS-HNE. The cells (5 × 106) were allowed to recover for 2 h after a 30-min heat shock and then treated with 20 µm 4-HNE for 2 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cell aliquots (100 µl containing 1 × 105 cells) were layered onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides using Cytospin (500 × g for 5 min) and fixed by treating with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C, and a TUNEL assay was performed using the fluorescein apoptosis detection system (Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In the experiments to determine the effect of RLIP76 antibodies on heat shock protection against 4-HNE-induced apoptosis, pre-immune IgG or anti-RLIP76 IgG was added in the media (final concentration 20 µg/ml) after 1 h of the recovery period. The cells were allowed to recover for an additional 1 h and incubated with 20 µm 4-HNE for 2 h, and apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL assay. To detect apoptosis by DNA-laddering assay, 5 × 106 cells (control or stress-pre-conditioned) were incubated with 20 µm 4-HNE for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 200 µl of PBS, and the genomic DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA-laddering assay was performed as described by us previously (30Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol.

Caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage were determined by Western blot analysis. Briefly, total cell lysates containing 25–50 µg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gels) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were developed with the ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions using the antibodies against caspase 3 and PARP (H-250). The sensitivity of the cells to 4-HNE was measured using the MTT assay (48Mosmann T. J. Immunol.

Our understanding of the molecular basis of reprogramming remains limited. Effort should be directed to understanding the actual biological changes that occur after somatic cell nuclear transfer and the extent to which donor cell nuclei are reprogrammed to direct normal embryo development.DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates crucial aspects of its function. In the mouse, a genome-wide demethylation process occurs both actively and passively during early development, resulting in global hypomethylation at the blastocyst stage (7Howlett S.K. Reik W.

This process erases gamete-specific methylation patterns inherited from parents and may be a prerequisite for the formation of pluripotent stem cells at this stage (12Reik W. Surani A. Genomic Imprinting. Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 1-20Google Scholar). The DNA methylation patterns of any given cell are established as a consequence of dynamic processes of methylation and demethylation. The cell type-specific epigenetic marks obtained through a differentiation pathway are generally stable and heritable, and tightly regulated.The behavior of stably established methylation patterns of a somatically derived genome in a reconstructed oocyte environment where a demethylating activity is known to exist is currently unknown (7Howlett S.K. Reik W. Development. 1991; 113: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sanford J. Forrester L. Chapman V. Chandley A. Hastie N.

Nevertheless, it is evident that donor cell-type DNA methylation patterns should be denuded, thereby resetting the genome of reconstituted embryos for full-term development of cloned embryos. Our recent finding that donor-type DNA methylation patterns are maintained in cloned bovine embryos (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) has raised concerns about potential developmental problems of cloned animals. The question remains whether the methylation anomaly is a common feature of early mammalian clones. Given its generality, the epigenetic anomaly of early embryo clones may be related to the various developmental defects observed in animal cloning (3Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar).Herein, by analyzing pig genomic repeats (heterochromatic satellite DNA sequences and euchromatic PRE-1 repeats) for methylation status, we have investigated whether endogenous demethylation takes place in in vivo- or in vitro-derived early pig embryos, as is observed in mouse embryos (7Howlett S.K. Reik W. Development. 1991; 113: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sanford J. Forrester L. Chapman V. Chandley A. Hastie N.

Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). We have further analyzed whether cloned pig embryos behave in an epigenetic manner similar to normally fertilized embryos during early development. This study provides information regarding the epigenetic reprogramming process that acts upon a differentiated somatic genome transplanted to an enucleated pig oocyte.DISCUSSIONThe moderate to heavy methylation of satellite sequences andPRE-1 SINE repeats is lost as fertilized eggs and reconstituted oocytes cleave to later stages. The typical progressive modes of demethylation shown in both NT (Figs. 3 A and4 E) and normal pig embryos (Figs. 2 and 4, B–D) are reminiscent of a replication-coupled passive demethylation mechanism of early mouse embryos that occurs without any regional preference (7Howlett S.K. Reik W. Development. 1991; 113: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sanford J. Forrester L. Chapman V. Chandley A. Hastie N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2823-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Monk M. Adams R.L. Rinaldi A. Development. 1991; 112: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar, 10Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N.

Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). If the demethylation processes that are observed in the satellite and PRE-1 sequences of NT pig embryos are supported by a passive mechanism, by extrapolation, global demethylation can also be expected to occur in other genomic sequences. However, it is presently unknown if all genomic sequences of the cloned donor genome that need to be demethylated behave similarly to these repeated sequences.The satellite DNA region is heavily methylated in donor cells (Fig. 3). When moved into a recipient oocyte, the initial hypermethylation may undergo one of two possible epigenetic modifications; 1) being maintained by a maintenance methylation activity through successive cycles of replication or, 2) being modified by demethylation. This may be determined by competition between unknown oocyte-specific factors and donor cell-specific factors transferred into the enucleated ooplasm that can block the ability of oocyte-specific factors to reprogram the nucleus (20Prather R.S. Science. 2000; 289: 1886-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Maintenance methylation has been demonstrated in a study with cloned bovine embryos where hypermethylation of a satellite sequence was observed to be maintained up to the blastocyst stage (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Demethylation is herein demonstrated with NT pig embryos. Likewise, thePRE-1 SINE sequences in NT pig embryos were gradually demethylated (Fig. 4 E), whereas the art-2 SINE sequences remained largely methylated in NT bovine embryos (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Endogenous demethylation events were also observed in normal bovine embryos (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It is unknown why such a discrepancy exists between the two species. Demethylation may occur much more efficiently in pig clones than in bovine clones. However, this simple explanation appears to conflict with the observed cloning efficiencies seen empirically in these two mammalian species. The production of cloned offspring in cattle is now routine while pig cloning attempts have only recently been successful (21Polejaeva I.A. Chen S.H. Vaught T.D. Page R.L. Mullins J. Ball S. Dai Y. Boone J. Walker S. Ayares D.L. Colman A. Campbell K.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 22Onishi A. Iwamoto M. Akita T. Mikawa S. Takeda K. Awata T. Hanada H. Perry A.C. Science. 2000; 289: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Therefore, these discordant observations suggest that efficient demethylation of a donor genome alone cannot guarantee the successful development of NT embryos and that other important elements need to be considered for successful cloning (20Prather R.S. Science. 2000; 289: 1886-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,23Young L.E. Fernandes K. McEvoy T.G. Butterwith S.C. Gutierrez C.G. Carolan C. Broadbent P.J. Robinson J.J. Wilmut I. Sinclair K.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar).A somatic donor genome should undergo a global demethylation process in the oocyte environment during early development to reset its own epigenetic characteristics established through a specific course of differentiation. Against the stream of genome-wide demethylation, some genomic loci, such as imprinted DNA regions, must maintain their own allele-specific methylation patterns that are essential to support normal embryonic development. Terminally differentiated somatic cells may be more subject to the epigenetic alterations of imprinted regions than less differentiated cells, and long-term in vitrocultured cells more than short-term versions. The altered epigenetic states of imprinted genes in donor somatic cells may cause developmental failure of resultant cloned embryos. The problem of epigenetic alteration is not limited to donor cells. It was recently reported that manipulation or non-physiological embryo culture environments can also alter the epigenetic status (and subsequently, the expression) of the ovine IGF2R gene, leading to defective fetal programming (23Young L.E. Fernandes K. McEvoy T.G. Butterwith S.C. Gutierrez C.G. Carolan C. Broadbent P.J. Robinson J.J. Wilmut I. Sinclair K.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Thus, at present, the only true indication of reprogramming is the birth of normal offspring. More information is needed regarding the molecular events required and how the events are actually processed in early NT embryos to achieve unimpaired reprogramming and subsequent full-term development. Achievements in animal cloning with differentiated somatic cells have demonstrated that, in principle, a de-differentiation event must occur. A reversal in differentiation should be accompanied by a genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming process involving genomic methylation changes, the assembly of histones and their variants into nucleosomes, and remodeling of other chromatin-associated proteins including linker histones, polycomb groups, and transcription factors (1Latham K.E.

Reik W. Development. 1991; 113: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sanford J. Forrester L. Chapman V. Chandley A. Hastie N.

Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). If the demethylation processes that are observed in the satellite and PRE-1 sequences of NT pig embryos are supported by a passive mechanism, by extrapolation, global demethylation can also be expected to occur in other genomic sequences. However, it is presently unknown if all genomic sequences of the cloned donor genome that need to be demethylated behave similarly to these repeated sequences.The satellite DNA region is heavily methylated in donor cells (Fig. 3). When moved into a recipient oocyte, the initial hypermethylation may undergo one of two possible epigenetic modifications; 1) being maintained by a maintenance methylation activity through successive cycles of replication or, 2) being modified by demethylation. This may be determined by competition between unknown oocyte-specific factors and donor cell-specific factors transferred into the enucleated ooplasm that can block the ability of oocyte-specific factors to reprogram the nucleus (20Prather R.S. Science. 2000; 289: 1886-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Maintenance methylation has been demonstrated in a study with cloned bovine embryos where hypermethylation of a satellite sequence was observed to be maintained up to the blastocyst stage (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Demethylation is herein demonstrated with NT pig embryos. Likewise, thePRE-1 SINE sequences in NT pig embryos were gradually demethylated (Fig. 4 E), whereas the art-2 SINE sequences remained largely methylated in NT bovine embryos (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Endogenous demethylation events were also observed in normal bovine embryos (13Kang Y.K. Koo D.B. Park J.S. Choi Y.H. Chung A.S. Lee K.K. Han Y.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It is unknown why such a discrepancy exists between the two species. Demethylation may occur much more efficiently in pig clones than in bovine clones. However, this simple explanation appears to conflict with the observed cloning efficiencies seen empirically in these two mammalian species. The production of cloned offspring in cattle is now routine while pig cloning attempts have only recently been successful (21Polejaeva I.A. Chen S.H. Vaught T.D. Page R.L. Mullins J. Ball S. Dai Y. Boone J. Walker S. Ayares D.L. Colman A. Campbell K.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 22Onishi A. Iwamoto M. Akita T. Mikawa S. Takeda K. Awata T. Hanada H. Perry A.C. Science. 2000; 289: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Therefore, these discordant observations suggest that efficient demethylation of a donor genome alone cannot guarantee the successful development of NT embryos and that other important elements need to be considered for successful cloning (20Prather R.S. Science. 2000; 289: 1886-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,23Young L.E. Fernandes K. McEvoy T.G. Butterwith S.C. Gutierrez C.G. Carolan C. Broadbent P.J. Robinson J.J. Wilmut I. Sinclair K.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar).A somatic donor genome should undergo a global demethylation process in the oocyte environment during early development to reset its own epigenetic characteristics established through a specific course of differentiation. Against the stream of genome-wide demethylation, some genomic loci, such as imprinted DNA regions, must maintain their own allele-specific methylation patterns that are essential to support normal embryonic development. Terminally differentiated somatic cells may be more subject to the epigenetic alterations of imprinted regions than less differentiated cells, and long-term in vitrocultured cells more than short-term versions. The altered epigenetic states of imprinted genes in donor somatic cells may cause developmental failure of resultant cloned embryos. The problem of epigenetic alteration is not limited to donor cells. It was recently reported that manipulation or non-physiological embryo culture environments can also alter the epigenetic status (and subsequently, the expression) of the ovine IGF2R gene, leading to defective fetal programming (23Young L.E. Fernandes K. McEvoy T.G. Butterwith S.C. Gutierrez C.G. Carolan C. Broadbent P.J. Robinson J.J. Wilmut I. Sinclair K.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Thus, at present, the only true indication of reprogramming is the birth of normal offspring. More information is needed regarding the molecular events required and how the events are actually processed in early NT embryos to achieve unimpaired reprogramming and subsequent full-term development.

To investigate the importance of these residues in the binding activity and hydrolyzing activity against insoluble chitin, site-directed mutagenesis to alanine was carried out. The substitution of Trp-69, Trp-33, or Trp-245 significantly reduced the binding activity to both highly crystalline β-chitin and colloidal chitin. The substitution of Phe-232, which is located closest to the catalytic cleft, did not affect the binding activity. On the other hand, the hydrolyzing activity against β-chitin microfibrils was significantly reduced by the substitution of any one of the four aromatic residues including Phe-232. None of the mutations reduced the hydrolyzing activity against soluble substrates. These results clearly demonstrate that the four exposed aromatic residues are essential determinants for crystalline chitin hydrolysis. Three of them, two in the N-terminal domain and one in the catalytic domain, play vital roles in the chitin binding. Phe-232 appeared to be important for guiding the chitin chain into the catalytic cleft. Based on these observations, a model for processive hydrolysis of crystalline chitin by chitinase A is proposed.

Pfluger H.D. Monzingo A.F. Hollis T. Ropbertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 402-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Monzingo A.F. Marcotte E.M. Hart P.J. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Chitinolytic bacteria generally produce multiple chitinases encoded by different genes. Many chitinolytic bacteria produce only family 18 chitinases, whereas some other bacteria such as Streptomycesspecies produce family 19 chitinases in addition to family 18 chitinases (11Ohno T. Armand S. Hata T. Nikaidou N. Henrissat B. Mitsutomi M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5065-5070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial family 18 chitinases are further classified into three subfamilies, subfamilies A, B, and C (12Suzuki K. Taiyoji M. Sugawara N. Nikaidou N. Henrissat B. Watanabe T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Chitinases in subfamily A have an insertion domain between the seventh and eighth β-strands of the (β/α)8 barrel basic structure, whereas chitinases in subfamilies B and C do not have such an insertion domain. The three-dimensional (3D)1 structure of the three-bacterial family 18 chitinases, all belonging to subfamily A, has been determined including those of chitinase A (ChiA) and chitinase B from Serratia marcescens QMB1466 and chitinase A1 (ChiA1) from Bacillus circulans WL-12 (5Perrakis A.

SerratiaChiA comprises three domains: an N-terminal domain, a catalytic (β/α)8 barrel domain, and a small (α + β) domain, which is inserted in the (β/α)8 barrel domain.Serratia ChiB comprises a catalytic (β/α)8barrel domain and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain (ChBD). B. circulans ChiA1 comprises the catalytic domain (CatD), two fibronectin type III-like domain, and the C-terminal ChBD. The 3D structures of the entire molecules of the former two chitinases were determined by x-ray crystallography. On the other hand, the 3D structures of the domains constituting B. circulans ChiA1 were determined separately. The structures of CatD were determined by x-ray crystallography, and those of ChBD and fibronectin type III-like domain were determined by NMR (8Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. Mitsui Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1999; 75: 269-274Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar,13Ikegami T. Okada T. Hashimoto M. Seino S. Watanabe T. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 2M. Shirakawa, unpublished data. The 3D structure of CatDChiA1 is basically very similar to that of Serratia ChiA. Two small insertion domains, β-domain 1 and β-domain 2, located on top of the (β/α)8 barrel provide a deep cleft for substrate binding (8Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. Mitsui Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1999; 75: 269-274Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of inactivated CatDChiA1complexed with (GlcNAc)7 suggested that the cleavage of the chitin chain occurs at the second linkage from the reducing end. Seven subsites numbered from −5 to +2 in the deep substrate-binding cleft were deduced. The oligomer chain bound to the cleft was bent and twisted at the third sugar ring at subsite −1. Four tryptophans, Trp-285, Trp-164, Trp-433, and Trp-53, in the substrate-binding cleft and one tyrosine, Tyr-56, at the edge of the substrate-binding cleft were identified as the residues interacting with the GlcNAc units of the bound oligomer through stacking interactions. In addition, two exposed Trp residues, Trp-122 and Trp-134, were found outside of the catalytic cleft to be aligned on the extension of the oligomer chain bound to the cleft. These two aromatic residues have been shown to be essential for crystalline chitin hydrolysis and have been proposed to play an important role in guiding a chitin chain into the catalytic cleft during crystalline chitin hydrolysis (14Watanabe T. Ishibashi A. Ariga Y. Hashimoto M. Nikaidou N. Sugiyama J. Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. FEBS lett. 2001; 494: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two exposed aromatic residues and the four aromatic residues in the catalytic cleft of CatDChiA1 are all conserved inSerratia ChiA. In this study, the roles in chitin binding activity and hydrolyzing activity of the two exposed aromatic residues in the catalytic domain and the two additional aromatic residues found on the surface of the N-terminal domain of Serratia ChiA were studied. Escherichia coliXL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was the host strain used throughout the construction of plasmids carrying the chiA genes with various mutations. E. coli DH5α was used as the host strain for the production of the wild-type and mutant chitinase proteins. Plasmid pNCA112 carrying the wild-type chiA gene from S. marcescens 2170 was described previously (15Watanabe T. Kimura K. Sumiya T. Nikaidou N. Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Ferrer S. Regue M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7111-7117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pNCA112 as a template. The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were 5′-CCGACCATCGCCGCGGGCAACACC-3′ for Trp-33 → Ala mutation (W33A), 5′-CCTGGAATTTAGCGAATGGCGACAC-3′ for Trp-69 → Ala mutation (W69A), 5′-GATCCACGATCCGGCCGCCGCGCTGC-3′ for Phe-232 → Ala mutation (F232A), and 5′-GGGCGTGACCGCCGCGGATGACCCC-3′ for Trp-245 → Ala mutation (W245A). The mutant clones were selected after sequencing the entire open reading frame to ensure that the desired mutation was the only mutation in each mutated gene. Sequencing was done by using an automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer (Model 4000L; LI-COR) and the ThermoSequenase fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for sequencing reaction. To create the gene encoding ChiA with a double mutation (W33A/W69A), the second mutation was introduced into the gene encoding W33A by using the primers for W69A mutation. The third mutation of triple mutant (W33A/W69A/W245A) was introduced into the gene encoding W33A/W69A by using the primers for W245A mutation. ChiA and its mutants were produced in E. coli DH5α cells carrying the plasmid pNCA112 or its derivatives and purified from culture supernatants. After collecting chitinase proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), wild-type ChiA, W33A, W69A, W245A, and F232A were purified by chitin affinity column chromatography (16Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follows. Crude chitinase was applied to a chitin affinity column previously equilibrated with 20 mmphosphate buffer. pH 6.0. The column was washed with 3-column volumes of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5m NaCl and 1-column volume of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The chitinase protein then was eluted with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Double and triple mutants, W33A/W69A and W33A/W69A/W245A, were purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography as follows. Crude chitinase obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation was subjected to hydroxypatite column (1.5 × 15 cm) previously washed with 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After washing with an 8-column volume of the same buffer, chitinase was eluted with 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Peak fractions containing purified chitinase were collected and lyophilized. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified chitinases in 12.5% slab gels was conducted by the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Reducing sugar generated by the degradation of various chitinous substrates was measured by a modification of Schales' procedure usingN-acetylglucosamine as a standard (18Imoto T. Yagishita K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1971; 35: 1154-1156Crossref Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total 750 µl) contained purified chitinase and 1 mg (dry weight) of each substrate in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The protein concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid compositions of each protein (19Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). For the chitin binding assay, the protein concentration was estimated by spectrofluorometry (Hitachi F-3010 Spectrofluorometer) at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 342 nm. A separate standard curve was prepared for each protein. Binding assay mixtures in 1-ml glass microtubes containing various concentrations of protein and 0.5 mg of binding assay substrate in 500 µl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, were incubated on ice with occasional mixing. Each mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 9500 ×g to separate the supernatant from substrate with bound protein. The supernatant containing free protein was collected, and the protein concentration was determined. The amount of bound protein was calculated from the difference between the initial protein concentration and the free protein concentration after binding. Enzyme-treated β-chitin microfibrils were deposited on carbon-coated grids and were allowed to dry. All of the electron micrographs were taken with a JEOL 2000EXII electron microscope operated at 100 kV and recorded on Mitsubishi electron microscope film. Diffraction contrast imaging in the bright field mode was used to visualize the sample without further contrast enhancement. The images were taken at magnifications of × 1000 to × 6000 under low dose exposure with the use of a minimum dose system (JEOL). Chitin EX (powdered prawn shell chitin) and carboxymethyl chitin were purchased from Funakoshi Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Soluble chitin and (GlcNAc)5 were obtained from Yaizu Suisan Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan). The degree of deacetylation was 38.8%, and approximate molecular weight of the soluble chitin was from 200,000 to 300,000. Colloidal chitin and glycol chitin were prepared from powdered crab shell chitin purchased from Funakoshi Chemical Co. by the methods described by Jeuniaux (20Jeuniaux C. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 644-650Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and Yamada and Imoto (21Yamada H. Imoto T. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 92: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), respectively. Reduction of (GlcNAc)5 was carried out as described by Yanase et al. (22Yanase Y. Fukamizo T. Hayashi K. Goto S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Microcrystalline β-chitin from vestimentiferan (Lamellibrachia satsuma) was prepared as described previously (23Sugiyama J. Boisset C. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ChiA from S. marcescens QMB1466 comprises three domains: an N-terminal domain with an immunoglobulin-like fold, a catalytic (β/α)8 barrel domain, and a small (α + β) fold domain, which is inserted in the catalytic (β/α)8barrel domain (5Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The role of the N-terminal domain has not yet been clarified, although involvement in interactions with the chitin chain has been suggested (24Perrakis A. Ouzounis C. Wilson K.S. Fold Des. 1997; 2: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the following two observations strongly suggested that the N-terminal domain of SerratiaChiA participates in the chitin binding. First, ChiA from S. marcescens 2170, which has 99.3% amino acid identity with ChiA from QMB1466, has significant chitin binding activity (15Watanabe T. Kimura K. Sumiya T. Nikaidou N. Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Ferrer S. Regue M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7111-7117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the catalytic domains of B. circulans ChiA1 andSerratia ChiA are structurally very similar as shown in Fig.1, and CatDChiA1 does not have significant chitin binding activity (25Watanabe T. Ito Y. Yamada T. Hashimoto M. Sekine S. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The chitin binding activity of B. circulans ChiA1 depends on the C-terminal ChBD (26Hashimoto M. Ikegami T. Seino S. Ohuchi N. Fukada H. Sugiyama J. Shirakawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To examine chitin binding activity of the N-terminal domain itself, the N-terminal domain of ChiA from S. marcescens 2170 was produced by using an E. coli expression system. However, isolated N-terminal domain did not show significant chitin binding activity. 3T. Uchiyama, M. Yamagishi, and T. Watanabe, unpublished results. Therefore, we examined the 3D structure of ChiA reported by Perrakis et al. (5Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 24Perrakis A. Ouzounis C. Wilson K.S. Fold Des. 1997; 2: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and found that Trp-33 and Trp-69 in the N-terminal domain and Trp-245 in the catalytic domain are linearly aligned on the surface of the ChiA molecule (Fig. 1A). These three aromatic residues are assumed to be involved in the chitin binding of ChiA based on the analogy to the cellulose-binding domains of several cellulases. It is well known that three aromatic residues linearly aligned on the surface of cellulose-binding domains play major roles in cellulose binding (27Bray M.R. Johnson P.E. Gilkes N.R. McIntosh L.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2311-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Mattinen M.L. Kontteli M. Kerovuo J. Linder M. Annila A. Lindeberg T. Reinikainen T. Drakenberg T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Simpson H.D. Barras F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, when the 3D structure of CatDChiA1 complexed with (GlcNAc)7 was superimposed on the structure of Serratia ChiA, two exposed aromatic residues, Phe-232 and Trp-245, corresponding to Trp-122 and Trp-134 of B. circulans CatDChiA1 (Fig.1B) that are exclusively required for crystalline chitin hydrolysis, were identified (Fig. 1C). In summary, a total of four linearly aligned aromatic amino acids, two in the N-terminal domain and two in the catalytic domain of Serratia ChiA, thus were identified. Some of these residues must be identical to the residues in the N-terminal domain, which were proposed by Perrakiset al. (24Perrakis A. Ouzounis C. Wilson K.S. Fold Des. 1997; 2: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to be in ideal positions to facilitate an interaction with an extended sugar chain. From the above observations and the structural implication described by Perrakis et al. (24Perrakis A. Ouzounis C. Wilson K.S. Fold Des. 1997; 2: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is hypothesized thatSerratia ChiA binds chitin mainly through the interaction between GlcNAc residues in the chitin chain and the exposed aromatic residues in both the N-terminal and catalytic domains, and that this chitin chain is introduced into the catalytic cleft to be hydrolyzed at the catalytic site located at the bottom of the deep substrate-binding cleft. To investigate the possible importance of the Trp-69, Trp-33, Trp-245, and Phe-232 in the binding activity and hydrolyzing activity against insoluble chitin, site-directed mutagenesis of the four aromatic residues to alanine was carried out. The wild-type and six mutant chitinases, W69A, W33A, W245A, F232A, W33A/W69A, and W33A/W69A/W245A, were produced in E. coli cells carrying a plasmid encoding either a wild-type or mutated chiA gene and purified from the culture supernatants. All mutant chitinases were produced at a level similar to that at which wild-type ChiA was produced. Purification of chitinase proteins was carried out either by chitin affinity column chromatography or by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. F232A behaved like ChiA did on the chitin column; i.e. the two proteins were eluted from the column with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, after the column was washed with the same buffer at pH 5.0. On the other hand, W69A, W33A, and W245A appeared to bind more weakly than wild-type ChiA did and were eluted from the chitin column at the washing step with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, along with many other contaminating proteins. Therefore, 0.5 m NaCl was included in the buffer to prevent elution of these mutant chitinases at the washing step, and purification was finally achieved by elution with 20 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Double and triple mutants of ChiA, W33A/W69A and W33A/W69A/W245A, did not bind chitin column even in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and, therefore, were purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The purified chitinases were essentially homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig.2). Approximately 14 mg of purified chitinase was obtained from a 1-liter culture of E. colicells carrying each chitinase gene. The chitin binding activities of wild-type and mutant ChiAs were studied using colloidal chitin and highly crystalline β-chitin microfibrils isolated from L. satsuma. The binding assay was carried out at pH 6.0 since the optimum pH for the hydrolysis reaction of ChiA is 6.0 (31Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To minimize hydrolysis of the binding substrates, the binding assay mixture was maintained below 4 °C. The binding reaction times were 3 h for β-chitin microfibrils and 1 h for colloidal chitin since preliminary experiments indicated that the binding to β-chitin microfibrils requires approximately 3 h, and that binding to colloidal chitin requires less than 1 h to reach equilibrium (data not shown). Fig. 3shows binding isotherms of the wild-type and mutant ChiAs to β-chitin microfibrils and colloidal chitin. Wild-type ChiA exhibited significant binding activity to both colloidal chitin and β-chitin microfibrils. Substitution of any of the three aromatic residues, Trp-69, Trp-33, or Trp-245 with alanine, reduced the binding activity to β-chitin microfibrils drastically (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, mutation of Phe-232 did not affect the binding activity significantly. The mutations of Trp-69, Trp-33, and Trp-245 also reduced the binding activity to colloidal chitin but less significantly than the cases of β-chitin microfibrils. The effect of mutation of Trp-69, which is located in the N-terminal domain and is most distal to the catalytic cleft among the four aromatic residues, was more severe than the effects of the other two mutations, suggesting special importance of this residues in the binding activity (Fig. 3B). Double and triple mutations of the three residues deprived binding activity to colloidal chitin almost completely. Mutation of Phe-232 did not affect the binding activity to colloidal chitin and to β-chitin microfibrils. These results clearly demonstrated that Trp-69 and Trp-33 in the N-terminal domain and Trp-245 in the catalytic domain are essential for the chitin binding activity of ChiA. Therefore, the chitin binding activity of this enzyme depends not only on the N-terminal domain but also on the catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain is important for the chitin binding activity of this enzyme, but the N-terminal domain alone is not sufficient to confer full binding activity. The effect of the mutations on the hydrolyzing activity against colloidal chitin and β-chitin microfibrils was examined. The hydrolysis of β-chitin microfibrils by 50 pmol of wild-type or mutant ChiA was monitored by measuring the amount of reducing sugar released from the substrates. As shown in Fig.4A, the hydrolyzing activity against β-chitin microfibrils was significantly reduced by all four single mutations including F232A, which did not affect the binding activity, although some hydrolysis was still observed. The effect of F232A was even more severe than that caused by W33A. This observation suggests that the defect in hydrolyzing activity of F232A is not attributed to a defect in chitin binding activity, whereas the defect in the hydrolyzing activity of W69A, W33A, and W245A may be due to, at least in part, a defect in chitin binding activity. Double and triple mutations of the three residues completely impaired hydrolyzing activity against β-chitin microfibrils. Fig. 4B shows the time course of hydrolysis of colloidal chitin by 10 pmol of ChiA and its mutants. Because ChiA hydrolyzes colloidal chitin much faster than β-chitin microfibrils, smaller amounts of the enzymes were used in these experiments. The effects of four single mutations were much less than those observed in the hydrolysis of β-chitin microfibrils. Interestingly, W69A, which caused the most severe defect among four single mutants in the binding activity to colloidal chitin, did not reduce the hydrolyzing activity at all. W33A and W245A, which also reduced the binding activity to colloidal chitin, only slightly reduced the hydrolyzing activity. F232A, which had the same level of binding activity as wild-type ChiA, exhibited the lowest hydrolyzing activity among the four mutant chitinases. On the other hand, double and triple mutations again reduced hydrolyzing activity drastically, although a slight hydrolysis was still observed. The effects of mutations on the hydrolyzing activity against various soluble substrates were also examined. The substrates tested include reduced (GlcNAc)5, soluble chitin, carboxymethyl chitin, and glycol chitin. As shown in TableI, none of the mutations including double and triple mutations reduced the activities against all soluble substrates. The hydrolyzing activities of the six mutant chitinases were essentially the same as that of wild-type ChiA against reduced (GlcNAc)5, soluble chitin and carboxymethyl chitin. Interestingly, F232A exhibited increased activity against the glycol chitin. The specific hydrolyzing activity of F232A against glycol chitin was 2.5-fold higher than that of wild-type ChiA. Both glycol chitin and carboxymethyl chitin are derivatives of chitin chemically modified at the C6 position of GlcNAc residues. In this sense, the two soluble substrates are structurally similar; however, the hydrolyzing activity against carboxymethyl chitin was not affected by the F232A mutation. The reason for this difference is unclear.Table ISpecific hydrolyzing activities of mutant and wild-type ChiA measured on soluble substratesEnzymesSpecific activity1-aOne unit of chitinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme, which produces 1 µmol of reducing sugar/min.Reduced (GlcNAc)5Soluble chitinCarboxymethyl chitinGlycol chitinunit/nmol of enzymeChiA77.22 (100)1-bValues in parentheses represent relative specific activities (%).2.16 (100)1.04 (100)0.11 (100)W33A76.81 (100)2.06 (95)1.11 (107)0.12 (109)W69A83.73 (108)2.16 (100)1.17 (113)0.11 (100)F232A71.03 (92)2.56 (119)1.03 (99)0.28 (255)W245A87.24 (113)2.22 (103)1.15 (111)0.12 (109)Double82.92 (107)1.99 (92)1.18 (114)0.10 (91)Triple88.54 (115)1.95 (90)1.01 (97)0.12 (109)1-a One unit of chitinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme, which produces 1 µmol of reducing sugar/min.1-b Values in parentheses represent relative specific activities (%). Open table in a new tab The β-chitin microfibrils isolated from the protective tubes of L. satsuma are highly crystalline β-chitin as demonstrated by electron microdiffraction (23Sugiyama J. Boisset C. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The microfibrils were treated with intact ChiA and its mutants, and the morphological change was examined by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A, the initial microfibrils displayed a uniform and well defined microfibrillar form. On the other hand, after treatment with ChiA, the microfibrils were primarily shortened, and the tips of the microfibrils were gradually narrowed and sharpened at one end very similar to needles (Fig.5B). The morphology of the microfibriles treated with ChiA are compatible with the notion that the hydrolysis of β-chitin microfibrils by ChiA occurs unidirectionally and processively. β-chitin microfibrils treated with W33A and F232A are shown in Fig.5C and D. W33A and F232A also formed needle tips at one end of the microfibrils clearly demonstrating that the two mutant chitinases are able to hydrolyze crystalline microfibril in part by a manner similar to intact ChiA. The needle tips formed by F232A appeared to be sharpest among three chitinases. This observations seems to be consistent with the idea that this mutant chitinase has a significant defect in introducing chitin chain into the catalytic cleft, and thus the starting of processive hydrolysis of chitin chains occurs less efficiently than do the other chitinases. The shape of the needle tips generated by ChiA is very similar to those observed after treatment with ChiA1 from B. circulans WL-12 (23Sugiyama J. Boisset C. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Hashimoto M. Ikegami T. Seino S. Ohuchi N. Fukada H. Sugiyama J. Shirakawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the β-chitin microfibrils by B. circulans ChiA1 was experimentally demonstrated very recently to occur from the reducing end side of the microfibrils as suggested from the structural study of CatDChiA1. 4T. Imai, T. Watanabe, T. Yui, and J. Sugiyama, submitted for publication. Because the catalytic domains of the two chitinases are very similar as mentioned already, the pointed tips formed by the ChiA must be at the reducing end side of the microfibrils. Studies on the chitin binding activities of mutant ChiAs that have substitutions of the four exposed aromatic residues demonstrated that the three of them, Trp-69, Trp-33, and Trp-245, are essential for the binding activity of ChiA to insoluble chitin substrates. On the other hand, F232A, which is closest to the catalytic cleft among the four mutated aromatic residues, did not affect the binding activity. Because the substitution of any one of the three residues reduced the chitin binding activity, all three residues are indispensable to express full binding activity and, therefore, act cooperatively in the chitin binding of this enzyme. Trp-69 and Trp-33 are located in the N-terminal domain, whereas on the other hand Trp-245 is located in the catalytic domain. This may be the first example of an identification of a site in the catalytic domain of a glycosyl hydrolase required for specific binding to an insoluble substrate. As mentioned already, the N-terminal domain of ChiA has been considered to be the chitin-binding domain (5Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the results obtained in this study clearly demonstrated that this domain is not sufficient for the expression of the full binding activity of this enzyme and does not have significant binding activity by itself alone, although it is indispensable for the binding activity. In this sense, the N-terminal domain could be referred to as an incomplete chitin-binding domain. This is very different from the case of ChBD of B. circulans ChiA1, which was the first ChBD characterized in form isolated from the other domains. Trp-134 in CatD of B. circulans ChiA1, corresponding to Trp-245 ofSerratia ChiA, enhanced the binding activity of ChiA1 (14Watanabe T. Ishibashi A. Ariga Y. Hashimoto M. Nikaidou N. Sugiyama J. Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. FEBS lett. 2001; 494: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, isolated ChBD exhibited significant chitin binding activity by itself, and this domain played a major role in the chitin binding activity of this enzyme (26Hashimoto M. Ikegami T. Seino S. Ohuchi N. Fukada H. Sugiyama J. Shirakawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast to the contribution to chitin binding activity, all four aromatic amino acids replaced in this study appeared to be essential for efficient hydrolysis of highly crystalline β-chitin microfibrils. Substitution of any one of the four aromatic residues decreased the hydrolyzing activity significantly. The defect in crystalline chitin hydrolysis of W69A, W33A, and W245A may be explained, at least in part, by the defect in the binding activity of these mutant chitinases. On the other hand, the reduced hydrolyzing activity of F232A is not related to its binding activity since F232A retained full binding activity. These results clearly demonstrated that the Phe-232 exposed on the surface of the catalytic domain is essential for the hydrolysis of crystalline chitin in a manner not related to chitin binding activity. Koivula et al. (32Koivula A. Kinnari T. Harjunpaa V. Ruohonen L. Teleman A. Drakenberg T. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429 (; Correction (1999) FEBS Lett.447, 334): 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that Trp-272 of Trichoderma reesei Cel6A is an essential determinant of crystalline cellulose hydrolysis. Mutagenesis of this residue selectively impaired crystalline cellulose hydrolysis but not hydrolysis of soluble or amorphous substrates. Because Trp-272 is located close to the entrance of the enclosed catalytic tunnel, the situation of Trp-272 seems to be rather similar to that of Tyr-170 of ChiA, which is located at the edge of the entrance of the substrate-binding cleft. However, although Phe-232 is located outside of the substrate-binding cleft, the effect of the substitution of Phe-232 is similar to that caused by the substitution of Trp-272 of Cel6A. Koivula et al. (32Koivula A. Kinnari T. Harjunpaa V. Ruohonen L. Teleman A. Drakenberg T. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429 (; Correction (1999) FEBS Lett.447, 334): 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested that Trp-272 has a specialized role in crystalline cellulose hydrolysis, possibly in guiding the glucan chain into the catalytic tunnel of Cel6A. These observations and the relative location of Phe-232 to the substrate-binding cleft strongly suggest that Phe-232 plays an important role in guiding and introducing the chitin chain into the catalytic cleft. We suppose that the other aromatic residues, W69A, W33A, and W245A, are also involved in part in guiding the chitin chain into the catalytic cleft, although the extent of their participation is different depending on the position of each aromatic residue. This means that Trp-69, Trp-33, and Trp-245 may have dual roles in crystalline (or insoluble) chitin hydrolysis. Mutations of any one of these three residues reduced the binding activity to colloidal chitin, and W69A affected this binding most severely. On the other hand, hydrolyzing activity of W69A was indistinguishable from that of wild-type ChiA, whereas W33A and W245A exhibited slightly lower activity than W69A, and F232A was the lowest among four single mutants. Although the difference in the hydrolyzing activities between W69A and either W33A or W245A is very small, W33A and W245A always gave slightly lower activities than W69A in several independent experiments. The slightly lower hydrolyzing activities of W33A and W245A as compared with W69A and wild-type ChiA could be explained by the involvement of these residues in guiding a chitin chain into the catalytic cleft since the binding activities of W33A and W245A were significantly higher than that of W69A. In addition, the possible involvement of three residues in guiding the chitin chain may be partly responsible for the drastic reduction in the hydrolyzing activity against both β-chitin microfibrils and colloidal chitin by double and triple mutations. Of course, a complete loss of the binding activity must be another reason for the drastic reduction of hydrolyzing activity by these mutations. Processive hydrolysis of crystalline chitin was suggested by electron microscopy of the β-chitin microfibrils treated with ChiA and its mutants. Processive hydrolysis by polysaccharide-degrading enzymes has been most extensively studied with Cel6A and Cel7A from T. reesei (33Chanzy H. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 285-288Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Imai T. Boisset C. Samejima M. Igarashi K. Sugiyama J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The term “processivity” is used to indicate that an enzyme degrades a polymer chain without dissociating from it between successive catalytic events. Both Cel6A and Cel7A have an active site cleft with tunnel morphology. According to a recent hypothesis, a single glucan chain is introduced at the tunnel entrance and threads through the entire tunnel with eventual release of the product, cellobiose, from the end of the tunnel (32Koivula A. Kinnari T. Harjunpaa V. Ruohonen L. Teleman A. Drakenberg T. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429 (; Correction (1999) FEBS Lett.447, 334): 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of crystalline chitin hydrolysis that were proposed based on the structure of ChiA, especially from the positions of the aromatic residues, and the results obtained in this study, are consistent with the processive action of this enzyme, although ChiA does not have a tunnel-shaped catalytic cleft (see Fig. 6). Binding of ChiA to the crystalline chitin surface is achieved through the interaction among three aromatic residues (Trp-69, Trp-33, and Trp-245) and the GlcNAc residues in a single chitin chain on the crystalline chitin surface. The chitin chain interacting with the three aromatic residues is introduced into the catalytic cleft from the reducing end side of the chain through the interaction with Phe-232. In the catalytic cleft, the introduced chitin chain slides through the cleft to the catalytic site, and the second linkages from the reducing end are progressively cleaved, releasing (GlcNAc)2 units continuously. Tyr-170 at subsite −5, Trp-167 at subsite −3, Trp-539 at subsite −1, Trp-275 at subsite +1, and Phe-396 at subsite +2 in the catalytic cleft play major roles in holding and also in sliding the chitin chain. The Trp residues around the catalytic site, such as Trp-167, Trp-539, Trp-275, and Phe-396, may be mainly responsible for bending and twisting the chitin chain at the subsite −1. The interaction with these multiple aromatic residues, which are located not only within the catalytic cleft but also on the surface of the ChiA molecule, must result in a tight holding of a chitin chain by the enzyme during a number of hydrolyzing reactions, which occurs at the second linkage from the reducing end, thus resulting in the processive action of this enzyme. As a result of the processive hydrolysis of a single chitin chain in the crystalline β-chitin microfibrils, the ChiA molecule proceeds on the crystalline chitin surface toward the non-reducing end side of the microfibrils with the N-terminal domain at the head, releasing (GlcNAc)2 units from the reducing end of the chitin chain.

https://openalex.org/W2056695646,"AP-2 transcription factors are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins expressed in neural crest and other tissues during mammalian development. Three mammalian genes, <i>AP-2α</i>,<i>AP-2β</i>, and <i>AP-2γ</i>, have been reported previously. A partial predicted <i>AP-2</i> gene was identified in tandem with <i>AP-2β</i> on human chromosome 6p12-p21.1. The orthologous mouse gene, which we named <i>Ap-2δ</i>, was identified from a fetal mouse head cDNA library. Northern analysis revealed two transcripts in embryonic and newborn mouse brain, with markedly higher steady-state levels in the former. The predicted Ap-2δ protein comprised 452 amino acids and was highly similar to other AP-2 proteins across the DNA-binding and dimerization domains. Ap-2δ formed homodimers and heterodimers <i>in vitro</i>, bound an optimized AP-2 consensus DNA sequence, and transactivated gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Ap-2δ dimers bound poorly to an AP-2 binding sequence from the human metallothionein IIa promoter <i>in vitro</i>, revealing a sequence specificity not previously observed among other AP-2 proteins. The PY motif and critical residues in the transactivation domain, which are highly conserved in the AP-2 family and believed necessary for transactivation, were divergent in Ap-2δ. The unique protein sequence and functional features of Ap-2δ suggest mechanisms, besides tissue-specific AP-2 gene expression, for specific control of target gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2009852779,"Ca2+ influx via plasma membrane Trp3 channels is proposed to be regulated by a reversible interaction with inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Condensation of the cortical actin layer has been suggested to physically disrupt this interaction and inhibit Trp3-mediated Ca2+ influx. This study examines the effect of cytoskeletal reorganization on the localization and function of Trp3 and key Ca2+ signaling proteins. Calyculin-A treatment resulted in formation of condensed actin layer at the plasma membrane; internalization of Trp3, Gαq/11, phospholipase Cβ, and caveolin-1; and attenuation of 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol- and ATP-stimulated Sr2+ influx. Importantly, Trp3 and IP3R-3 remained co-localized inside the cell and were co-immunoprecipitated. Jasplakinolide also induced internalization of Trp3 and caveolin-1. Pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D or staurosporine did not affect Trp3 but prevented calyculin-A-induced effects. Based on these data, we suggest that Trp3 is assembled in a caveolar Ca2+signaling complex with IP3R, SERCA, Gαq/11, phospholipase Cβ, caveolin-1, and ezrin. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that conditions which stabilize cortical actin induce loss of Trp3 activity due to internalization of the Trp3-signaling complex, not disruption of IP3R-Trp3 interaction. This suggests that localization of the Trp3-associated signaling complex, rather than Trp3-IP3R coupling, depends on the status of the actin cytoskeleton.

Based on these data, we suggest that Trp3 is assembled in a caveolar Ca2+signaling complex with IP3R, SERCA, Gαq/11, phospholipase Cβ, caveolin-1, and ezrin. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that conditions which stabilize cortical actin induce loss of Trp3 activity due to internalization of the Trp3-signaling complex, not disruption of IP3R-Trp3 interaction. This suggests that localization of the Trp3-associated signaling complex, rather than Trp3-IP3R coupling, depends on the status of the actin cytoskeleton. phospholipase C transient receptor potential inositol trisphosphate receptor sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol octyl glucoside 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride store-operated Ca2+ entry endoplasmic reticulum hemagglutinin thapsigargin phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The Trp family of proteins has been proposed as molecular components of Ca2+ entry channels in non-excitable cells that are activated by hormonal stimuli coupled to G protein-dependent activation of phospholipase Cβ (PLC)1 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis (1Hofmann T.

Although the exact physiological function of the various Trp proteins has not been established, recent studies have demonstrated functional differences between them. For example, Trp1 can be activated solely by the depletion of internal stores of Ca2+, a process downstream from activation of PIP2 hydrolysis and IP3 generation (3Liu X. Wang W. Lockwich T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas Trp3 and Trp6 are activated by PIP2 hydrolysis per se (4Zhu X. Jiang J.M. Birnbaumer L. J.

Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Thus, these Trp proteins can be expected to be regulated by distinct mechanisms. However, presently, little is known regarding the molecular components which determine the functional specificity and regulation of the various Trps. The involvement of protein-protein interactions in the regulation of channel function has been most clearly demonstrated for Trp3. It was reported that an interaction between Trp3 and IP3R was required for channel activation by an agonist (6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Direct physical interaction between Trp3 and IP3R was also suggested by previous studies (9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Ma H. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showing that conditions (such as treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin-A, or with the actin stabilizing agent, jasplakanolide) that induced condensation of filamentous actin into a tight cortical layer in the subplasma membrane region of the cell, also resulted in loss of agonist-stimulated Trp3 activity and SOCE. The effect of calyculin-A on SOCE and on agonist stimulation of Trp3 activity appeared to be due to the condensation of the cortical actin layer since it was reversed, or prevented, by treatment with the actin depolymerizing reagent, cytochalasin D, or by the protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. It was concluded that the cortical actin layer acts as a physical barrier between the ER and plasma membrane and disrupts the interaction between IP3R and Trp3, thus leading to loss of Ca2+ influx. Based on these data, a “secretion-like” coupling model was proposed according to which reversible interaction(s) between the ER and the plasma membrane serves as the key regulatory event in store-operated Ca2+ entry (9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal reorganization was also reported to disrupt Trp1-IP3R interactions in platelets (12Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), an observation consistent with the secretion-coupling model. A key assumption in this model is that the localizations of Trp3, or Trp1, and IP3R in the plasma membrane and ER, respectively, are not altered (9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Only the movement of the ER toward or away from the plasma membrane determines Trp3-IP3R interactions. These studies implicate a role for cytoskeletal rearrangements in the movement of ER toward, or away from, the plasma membrane. However, important questions that remain presently unaddressed are whether Trp3 directly interacts with the cytoskeleton and whether its localization is altered under conditions used to remodel the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, nothing is known about other proteins that might interact with Trp3 and regulate its function. It is possible that the status of the actin cytoskeleton might affect the function of these potential regulatory proteins and thus lead to modulation of Trp3 activity. There is increasing evidence to suggest that components in a G-protein signaling cascade are tightly coupled (14Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the Drosophila Trp (dTrp), which is activated by a G-protein-mediated signaling mechanism, has been shown to be assembled in a supramolecular complex with a variety of signaling and accessory proteins, such as rhodopsin, protein kinase C, PLC, and NINAC. Localization of this signalplex to the rhabdomers is dependent on the PDZ domain-containing protein, INAD, which provides a scaffold for anchoring the proteins components of the dTrp-signaling complex (15Li H-S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 150: 1411-1421Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar,16Xu X.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and protein-protein interactions within this complex regulate the Drosophila visual cascade. Thus, the proteins associated with dTrp are intimately involved in the regulation of its function and targeting to the appropriate cellular locale. Similarly, there is some evidence that mammalian Trps might also be associated with other Ca2+ signaling and scaffolding proteins. We previously reported that Trp1, a strong candidate for the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) mechanism in salivary epithelial cells (HSG) (3Liu X. Wang W. Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Wellner R. Jadloweic J. O'Connell B. Zhu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), is assembled in a signaling complex that is localized in caveolar lipid raft domains (17Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J.J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We have also shown that disruption of the lipid raft domain induced loss of Trp1 activity, suggesting that Trp1 activity is determined by the status of its microenvironment. More recently, Trp4 and Trp5 have been shown to form a complex with the scaffolding protein NHERF and PLCβ (18Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that mammalian Trps, like dTrp, are assembled in macromolecular complexes and regulated by the proteins that are either already localized in, or are recruited into, the complex. Identification of the molecular components involved in the assembly and localization of the Trp-associated signaling complexes in the plasma membrane will be key to understanding their regulation and functional differences. To address the role of cytoskeleton in the regulation of Trp3 channel activity, we have examined the effects of cytoskeletal rearrangements on the localization and function of Trp3. We have also examined the localization of key Ca2+ signaling proteins and some cytoskeletal components under the same conditions as well as possible association between Trp3 and these proteins. Our data demonstrate that Trp3 is assembled in a caveolin-associated multimolecular complex containing key Ca2+ signaling proteins from the plasma membrane as well as from the endoplasmic reticulum. Importantly, we report that the calyculin-A-, and jasplakinolide-induced loss of calcium influx is due to internalization of this caveolin-associated Trp3-signaling complex rather than disruption of Trp3-IP3R interactions. The data suggest that localization of the Trp3-associated Ca2+ signaling complex, rather than Trp3-IP3R coupling, is determined by the status of the actin cytoskeleton. hTrp3-expressing and control (vasopressin receptor-expressing) HEK-293 cells were cultured as described (4Zhu X. Jiang J.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5 ml/plate) containing (in mm): 100 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 MgCl2, 0.5 AEBSF (ICN), 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen cells (3–5 ml) were thawed on ice, homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and diluted to 30 ml with a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Calbiochem Ultrol grade), 0.5 mm AEBSF, 0.167 mm pepstatin A (ICN), and 0.167 mm leupeptin (ICN), and centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min and the final pellet (crude membrane fraction) was suspended in a desired volume of the sucrose buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (microassay procedure). Unless otherwise noted all steps were carried out at 4 °C. 5 mg of crude membranes were washed by dilution into 5–6 ml of a buffer containing (in mm): 200 KCl, 50 K-MOPS (pH 7.5), 2.5 MgCl2, and 1 AEBSF followed by centrifugation, 50,000 × g for 30 min. The washed membranes were solubilized (19Lockwich T. Chauthaiwale J. Ambudkar S.V. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with 1.5% octyl glucoside (OG, Calbiochem) in 2.4 ml of a media containing 50 mm K-MOPS (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m KI, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmAEBSF, 0.167 mm pepstatin A, 0.167 mmleupeptin, and 10 mg of lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) from a 50 mg/ml aqueous stock suspension containing 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The lipid stock solution consisted of 60% Escherichia coli ether-washed bulk lipids, 17.5% phosphatidylcholine, 10% phosphatidylserine, and 12.5% cholesterol. The detergent-treated membranes were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 1 h at 145,000 × g. The supernatant (OG + KI solubilized fraction) was stored at −80 °C until used. 50 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed three times with distilled water and then once with solubilization buffer (described above) for 5 min and then resuspended in 150 μl of the solubilization buffer. 50 μl of the washed beads were added to 1 ml of OG + KI supernatant (preclearing), rotated for 30 min, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 1 min. The pre-cleared supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and the following antibodies were added (resulting in dilutions ranging from 1:20 to 1:200): anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, clone 12CA5), anti-ankyrin (Calbiochem, clone Ank016), anti-actin (Sigma, A2066), anti-ezrin (Santa Cruz, 6407), anti-PLCβ1 (Santa Cruz, sc-205), anti-caveolin 1 (Transduction Labs, C13630), anti-Gαq/11, 06-710), anti-SERCA2 (ABR, MA3–910), anti-IP3R-I (Santa Cruz, sc-6093), anti-IP3R-II (Santa Cruz, sc-7278), and anti-IP3R-III (Transduction Labs, 13122). The samples were rotated for 1 h and added to the remaining Sepharose CL-4B beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation for 1 min at 1,000 × g. The beads were washed 3 times with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmsodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The washed beads were then incubated with 200 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins (and co-immunoprecipitated proteins) were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting as previously reported (17Lockwich T.P.

Primary antibodies used for Western blotting were identical to those used for the initial immunoprecipitations except the anti-HA-Peroxidase High Affinty (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 3F10) antibody was used to visualize the HA-tagged Trp3 (dilution 1:500). Other dilutions used for Western blotting were: 1:200 (anti-ezrin, anti-ankyrin, and anti-PLCβ1), 1:500 (anti-actin, anti-caveolin 1, and anti-Gαq/11), 1:1000 (anti-IP3R’s), and 1:2500 (anti-SERCA2). For visualization of the low molecular weight proteins caveolin-1 and Gαq/11 after immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged Trp3, the initial immunoprecipitation was performed using 150 μl of anti-HA-linked affinity matrix beads (Covance, AFC-101P). Trp3-expressing HEK293 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 2 days and then treated with the following as required; calyculin-A, 100 nm for 20 min; staurosporine, 1 μm for 20 min; cytochalasin D, 2.5 μm 20 min; jasplakanolide, 5 μm for 60 min in growth medium at 37 °C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized (20Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and treated with the primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: anti-HA (1:100), anti-caveolin-1 (1:100), rhodamine-phalloidin (1:50), anti-IP3R-3 (1:25), anti-ezrin (1:100), anti-Gαq/11 (1:100), PLCβ (1:50), anti-SERCA (1:100) and either fluorescein isothiocyantate or rhodamine-linked secondary antibody as described before (20Wang W.

Confocal images were collected using an MRC 1024 krypton/argon laser scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Nikon Optiphot II photomicroscope (Melville, NY). Images of control and experimental samples were obtained using identical conditions (laser intensities, gain, iris aperature, black level, and scan speed). Images were collected in the x-y plane using a ×60 oil immersion PlanApo objective (Nikon, Japan; 1.4 N.A.) with a confocal aperture of 2 mm. Fura2 fluorescence in single cells was measured as described earlier (3Liu X. Wang W. Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Wellner R. Jadloweic J. O'Connell B. Zhu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, MTI) and the Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Analog plots of the fluorescence ratio (340/380) in single cells are shown. Calyculin-A induces condensation of actin into a tight layer in the subplasma membrane region (21Kreienbuhl P. Keller H. Niggli V. Blood. 1992; 80: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, this treatment has been proposed to inhibit activation of Trp3 by disrupting the interaction between Trp3 in the plasma membrane and IP3R in the ER. Fig. 1 shows the effect of calyculin-A treatment on the localization of Trp3, actin, and IP3R-3 (indicated by white arrows) in HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged hTrp3. Confocal images shown in the figure represent a section from approximately the middle of the cells. Trp3 and actin were detected in the plasma membrane region of the cells while IP3R was detected inside the cell in the ER region (No treatment, shows untreated cells). After treatment of the cells with calyculin-A, the cells appeared somewhat rounded in shape. Significantly, most of the Trp3 was internalized into the cell although some Trp3 signal was still detected in the plasma membrane region (compare no treatment panels with Caly-A panels). Actin appeared to be tightly condensed in a cortical layer at the plasma membrane in some cells (shown by light arrow). In other cells, actin appeared to be concentrated in a tightly condensed bundle inside the cell as has been shown before (heavy arrow; Refs. 22Shinoki N. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Ikeda M. Oiki E. Okuyama M. Fujitana K. Yano Y. Kawasaki T. Monden M. J. Cell Sci. Biochem. 1995; 59: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 23Toivola D.M. Goldman R.D. Garrod D.R. Eriksson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of IP3R-3 was not altered dramatically by calyculin-A, although some IP3R-3 appeared to be concentrated in bundles in the cell. The internalization of Trp3 induced by calyculin-A was blocked by preincubating the cells with staurosporine, a Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitor, or cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent (24Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). As shown in the figure, although cytochalasin D, by itself, altered the localization of actin in the cells, it did not alter the localization of Trp3 or IP3R-3. These results are consistent with previously reported data on the effects of calyculin-A, cytochalasin D, and staurosporine on actin localization (9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Ma H. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 647-1651Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Importantly, the present data suggest that Trp3 is not directly linked to actin since cytochalasin D which depolymerizes actin converting it into bundles, has no obvious effect on Trp3 localization. To determine whether internalization of Trp3 is accompanied by a disruption of Trp3-IP3R interaction, we examined the co-localization of Trp3 and IP3R in control and calyculin-A treated cells. Fig. 1 B shows the distribution of Trp3 (red) and IP3R-3 (green) in control and calyculin-A-treated cells. In control cells, Trp3 was localized in the plasma membrane while IP3R-3 was distributed in the ER region inside the cell. The last panels show the merged fluorescence signal. In untreated cells, overlap of the two signals was detected in the plasma membrane region (yellow signal, indicated by white arrow), indicating co-localization of Trp3 and IP3R-3 along the plasma membrane of these cells. In calyculin-A-treated cells, the yellow signal was detected in concentrated areas within the cell (indicated by white arrow). Some yellow signal is also seen in the plasma membrane region (indicated by the lighter white arrow). Thus, calyculin-A induces internalization of a substantial amount of Trp3 from the plasma membrane. However, and importantly, the internalized Trp3 remains co-localized with IP3R-3. To further demonstrate the interaction between Trp3 and IP3R in calyculin-A-treated cells, we examined co-immunoprecipitation of Trp3 and IP3R-3. Experiments were performed using membrane fractions isolated from control and calyculin-A-treated cells (note that calyculin-A was present in the medium during membrane isolation). The data in Fig. 1 Cclearly demonstrate that co-immunoprecipitation of IP3R-3 with Trp3 was not affected by calyculin-A treatment. Additionally, similar levels of Trp3 were detected when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the reverse order using anti-IP3R-3 antibody to pull down IP3R-3 (immunoprecipitated IP3R-3 was also detected by Western blotting, data not shown). These data are consistent with the co-localization of Trp3 and IP3R-3 in both control and calyculin-A-treated cells and demonstrate that only a small part of the total Trp3 and IP3R in the cells associate with each other. Thus, our data do not support the previous suggestion that calyculin-A treatment leads to the disruption of Trp3-IP3R interactions. Rather our data suggest that calyculin-A induced internalization of Trp3 results in a decrease in the number of channels in the plasma membrane. To demonstrate the effect of calyculin-A-induced internalization of Trp3 on Trp3 function, we examined OAG-induced Sr2+ influx in control and calyculin-A-treated cells. Sr2+ has been previously used to demonstrate Trp3 activity (10Ma H. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 647-1651Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As noted in this previous study, OAG-stimulated Sr2+influx was only seen in cells stably expressing Trp3 protein but not in control HEK293 cells that were stably transfected with the vasopressin receptor (Fig. 2 A, fluorescence in control cells is shown by dotted line). Furthermore, OAG did not stimulate any increase in fura2 fluorescence when cells were placed in a nominally Ca2+-free medium containing 100 μm EGTA (data not shown). Treatment with calyculin-A (100 nm, 20–30 min, Fig. 2 B) significantly reduced the OAG-stimulated increase in fura2 fluorescence in cells maintained in a medium containing 1 mmSr2+, but no Ca2+ (p = <0.05,n = >300 fields, each field represents 1–2 cells. The traces shown are average fluorescence values from 64 fields in each case). Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D (1 μm, 20 min) alone did not alter the OAG-induced increase in Sr2+influx (Fig. 2 C) while pretreatment with cytochalasin D prevented the calyculin-A-induced loss of Sr2+ influx (Fig. 2 D). These data demonstrate that calyculin-A treatment induces a significant loss of Trp3-mediated Sr2+ influx. These data are not consistent with an earlier report (10Ma H. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 647-1651Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar) showing that OAG-mediated Ca2+ influx was unchanged in calyculin-A-treated cells. While the reason for the discrepancy in the data is not presently clear, it is important to note that the calyculin-A-induced effects on Trp3 function shown in Fig. 2 are fully consistent with its effect on Trp3 localization shown above. We also examined agonist- (ATP) and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in control and calyculin-A-treated cells. Figs. 2, E and F, show that calyculin-A treatment attenuated ATP-stimulated internal Ca2+ release and Sr2+ influx. Fig. 2, G and H, show that Tg-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization was also decreased by calyculin-A. However, the Tg-stimulated increase in fura2 fluorescence in a Ca2+-free medium was not altered by calyculin-A and was similar to that seen in calyculin-A-treated cells in a Ca2+-containing medium (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous studies (25Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1996; 271: C284-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pflueg.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that calyculin-A (i) inhibits agonist-stimulated Ca2+ influx via inhibition of internal Ca2+ release, and (ii) inhibits store-operated Ca2+ influx via a more direct effect on the influx mechanism per se. It is widely recognized that proteins which are attached to the cytoskeleton are poorly solubilized by detergents (28Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Since Trp3 localization did not appear to be directly associated with actin (see Fig. 1), we examined the solubilization of Trp3 from HEK cell membranes by octyl glucoside (OG). Surprisingly, Trp3 was poorly solubilized by OG (Fig. 3 A, and C, control HEK-293 cells; T, Trp3-expressing HEK-293 cells). KI has been used to disrupt cytoskeletal interactions and increase detergent solubility of proteins linked to the cytoskeleton (29Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Notably, KI increased detergent solubility of Trp1 from HSG cell plasma membranes (17Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B.

Fig. 3 A reveals a similar effect of KI on the solubility of Trp3. Presence of 0.5 m KI substantially increased solubilization of Trp3 from the membrane (see Fig. 3 B to compare relative levels of Trp3 in crude membrane and the OG + KI-solubilized fraction from control and Trp3-expressing cells). To further examine possible association between Trp3 and actin, the OG + KI-solubilized fraction was used to immunoprecipitate the expressed Trp3 using an anti-HA antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2035028977,"We have recently shown that the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is activated by von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding to its platelet receptor, glycoprotein Ib-IX (GPIb-IX), via the protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway. Here we show that GPIb-IX-mediated activation of integrin αIIbβ3 is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Raf-1 and MEK1 in a reconstituted integrin activation model in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and that the integrin-dependent platelet aggregation induced by either vWF or low dose thrombin is inhibited by MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Thus, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is important in GPIb-IX-dependent activation of platelet integrin αIIbβ3. Furthermore, vWF binding to GPIb-IX induces phosphorylation of Thr-202/Tyr-204 of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). GPIb-IX-induced ERK2 phosphorylation is inhibited by PKG inhibitors and enhanced by overexpression of recombinant PKG. PKG activators also induce ERK phosphorylation, indicating that activation of MAPK pathway is downstream from PKG. Thus, our data delineate a novel integrin activation pathway in which ligand binding to GPIb-IX activates PKG that stimulates MAPK pathway, leading to integrin activation.

Du X. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In normal circulating platelets, the integrin αIIbβ3 is in a resting state with a low affinity for its ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF).1 At sites of vascular injury, exposure of platelets to soluble agonists (such as thrombin and ADP) or to matrix-bound adhesive proteins (such as collagen and vWF) induces platelet activation. A common consequence of platelet activation is the activation of the ligand binding function of the integrin αIIbβ3 (2Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M.

The importance of GPIb-IX pathway in platelet function is manifested in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, in which genetic deficiency in GPIb-IX resulted in defects in platelet adhesion and activation (10Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of GPIb-IX-mediated integrin activation is not fully understood. However, we have recently shown that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G (PKG)) is an important stimulatory mediator in the GPIb-IX-induced activation of integrin αIIbβ3. 2Z. Li, X.

Du, submitted for publication.Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine-threonine kinase activated by many extracellular stimuli including growth factors and hormones. Four distinct subgroups within the MAPK family have been described, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, ERK5/big MAP kinase (BMK1), and p38 group of protein kinases. At least three subgroups of these MAP kinases, ERK1/ERK2 (23Papkoff J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p38 (24Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (25Bugaud F. Nadal-Wollbold F. Levy-Toledano S. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified in platelets and shown to be activated when platelets are stimulated by different agonists such as thrombin and collagen. The prototype MAPK pathway, ERK pathway, consists of a cascade of protein kinases, Raf1, MEK1, and ERK1/ERK2, which sequentially activate a downstream kinase. Raf-1 activation involves Ras and 14-3-3 protein (26Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The functions of ERK MAPK pathway in platelets have not been fully understood. ERK has been shown to phosphorylate and activate cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (27Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). However, it was reported that ERK pathway is not required in the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 activation in platelets stimulated by thrombin, as MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 did not abolish thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release (28Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ERK pathway is not required for primary platelet response to high doses of collagen and thrombin (28Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 has been shown in other studies to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by low doses of collagen and ADP (29Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The interpretation of these data has been complicated by the report suggesting that PD98059 may directly inhibit cyclooxygenases in TXA2 synthesis pathway, which is important in platelet aggregation induced by low dose collagen and ADP (29Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).In this study, we have examined the roles of ERK pathway in GPIb-IX-dependent platelet activation using a combination of molecular biology and pharmacological approaches. We show that ERK pathway is important in GPIb-IX-dependent integrin activation signaling. We further show that activation of PKG is sufficient to activate ERK pathway and is necessary for GPIb-IX-mediated activation of ERK. These data, combined with our recent finding that PKG mediates GPIb-IX-dependent platelet activation,2 delineate a novel signaling pathway of platelet activation in which ligand binding to GPIb-IX sequentially activates PKG pathway and ERK MAP kinase pathway leading to integrin activation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we found that 1) ligand binding to GPIb-IX activates ERK pathway, which is important in mediating GPIb-IX-induced activation of integrin αIIbβ3, and 2) the ERK pathway is downstream from PKG in the GPIb-IX-induced integrin activation. Together with our recent finding that GPIb-IX-induced platelet activation requires the cGMP-PKG pathway, these data delineate a novel integrin activation signaling pathway in which ligand binding to GPIb-IX induces activation of PKG, which stimulates ERK pathway, leading to activation of integrin αIIbβ3(Fig. 7).The elements of ERK MAPK pathway are abundant in platelets. Previous studies indicate that ERK pathway is stimulated during platelet activation induced by platelet agonists such as ADP, collagen, and thrombin (23Papkoff J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, understanding the roles of MAPK in platelet activation has been complicated by the report that the commonly used inhibitor of ERK pathway, PD98059, also inhibits cyclooxygenases and, thus, TXA2 synthesis (29Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of our newly reconstituted integrin activation model in CHO cells (15Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and examined the effects of dominant negative mutants of Raf-1 and MEK1 on GPIb-IX-mediated integrin activation in this system. We conclude that ERK pathway is important in integrin activation via the GPIb-IX signaling pathway. This conclusion is supported by the following findings. 1) Dominant negative mutants of MAP kinase pathway, Raf301 and MEK1 M97K, inhibited GPIb-IX-mediated activation of integrin αIIbβ3 in a reconstituted CHO cell expression model; 2) MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 inhibited vWF and low dose thrombin-induced, integrin-dependent platelet aggregation in platelets in a cyclooxygenase-independent manner; and 3) vWF binding to GPIb-IX induced phosphorylation of ERK2 at the Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence, indicating that the ERK MAPK pathway is activated. The results obtained in the CHO cell model using recombinant DNA technology and results obtained in platelets using various MEK1 inhibitors and biochemical assays are highly consistent. Inhibition of integrin activation by the dominant negative mutants of MAPK pathway excludes the possible nonspecific effects of pharmacological agents, and results obtained in human platelets indicate that the reconstituted CHO cell model appropriately reflects the role of MAPK pathway in platelets. Furthermore, our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of MEK inhibitor PD98059 is not likely to result from its effects on cyclooxygenases because the inhibitory effect of PD98059 was seen when cyclooxygenases were already inhibited by high concentrations of aspirin (Fig. 4). Furthermore, aspirin had no inhibitory effect on vWF-induced integrin activation in CHO cells (not shown), vWF-induced the first wave of platelet aggregation (Fig. 4), or low-dose thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 5), all of which were inhibited by PD98059. Consistent with our results, it was previously shown that ristocetin-induced production of TXA2 was inhibited by anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that integrin activation precedes vWF-induced TXA2 production (35Ruan C.G. Du X.P. Xi X.D. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, MAPK pathway stimulates GPIb-IX-dependent integrin activation and platelet aggregation in a TXA2-independent manner.We have recently shown that the PKG pathway plays an important role in GPIb-IX-mediated activation of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3.2 Here we show that expression of recombinant PKG in the CHO cell model significantly enhances GPIb-IX-induced ERK pathway activation, and inhibition of PKG abolished GPIb-IX-induced ERK pathway activation. Furthermore, activation of PKG by cGMP analogs is sufficient to activate ERK pathway. Thus we conclude that the ERK pathway is downstream from PKG in the GPIb-IX-signaling pathway. Although the classic MAPK activation pathway is mediated by the receptor tyrosine kinases via Ras, it has been shown that the ERK pathway is also regulated by multiple cellular signals, including PKG (36Suhasini M. Li H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, there have been controversies about whether PKG activates or inhibits MAPK pathway. In one study, ERK activity was reportedly reduced after prolonged incubation (30 min) with cGMP analogs in baby hamster kidney cells (36Suhasini M. Li H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), However, others found that PKG activated MAPK pathway in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (37Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23504-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PKG directly phosphorylates and activates Raf-1, the upstream kinase in the ERK pathway (37Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23504-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the latter studies. One possible reason for the apparent contradicting results is the difference in the incubation time after the addition of cGMP analogs. Our data indicate that vWF or cGMP analogs induce a rapid increase in ERK2 phosphorylation in platelets that peaks at 30 s (1 min in some donors) and decreases after prolonged incubation (Fig. 6), suggesting that PKG-mediated ERK phosphorylation is a transient event. This is consistent with our observations that cGMP analogs promoted platelet activation only when added simultaneously or immediately after the addition of an agonist such as vWF or thrombin.2 Prolonged preincubation of cGMP analogs with platelets inhibits subsequent platelet response to platelet agonists in a protein kinase A-dependent manner and induces protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein.2 Thus, it is possible that after a prolonged incubation, cGMP-induced activation of a cAMP-protein kinase A pathway may diminish the function of PKG to induce ERK pathway activation. It is also possible that after the initial activation of MAPK pathway and the integrin, the outside-in signaling of integrin may cause MAPK dephosphorylation, since ligand binding to integrin has been shown to negatively regulate agonist-stimulated ERK activity in platelets (39Nadal F. Levy-Toledano S. Grelac F. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).There have been several interesting observations on the relationship between MAPK pathway and integrin signaling in recent years. Although Zhang et al. (40Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) reports that Ra-Ras enhanced integrin activity, Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) find that the activity of a constitutively active αIIb/α5β3/β1chimera integrin expressed in CHO cells was enhanced by the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras but was inhibited by the constitutively active Raf mutant or Ha-Ras. The results by Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) apparently contradict our data that dominant negative mutants of Raf and MEK inhibited αIIbβ3 activation induced by GPIb-IX. However, there is a major difference between the experiments of Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and ours. The integrin mutant used by Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was a chimera integrin with the cytoplasmic domain of the αIIb replaced by the cytoplasmic domain of α5 (or α subunits other than αIIb) and the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 replaced by the cytoplasmic domain of β1. Thus, in effect, the cytoplasmic regulatory domain of this integrin mutant was not an αIIbβ3 but a β1 integrin or a hybrid between β3 and one of the α subunits that are constitutively active in cells. This may explain why the chimera mutants, unlike wild type integrin αIIbβ3, are constitutively active. In contrast, we used wild type integrin αIIbβ3 coexpressed with platelet GPIb-IX. The wild type αIIbβ3 is normally in resting state but becomes activated only after agonist stimulation. Thus, the results from Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) may reflect a negative regulation of constitutively active integrins (such as β1integrins), but our results reflect stimulatory roles of MAPK pathway in the inside-out signaling of the integrin αIIbβ3. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the effects of integrin outside-in signaling on ERK pathway is also different between different integrins. Although β1 integrin stimulates activation of ERK pathway in several cell types (42Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ligand binding to αIIbβ3 has been shown to inhibit ERK pathway in platelets (39Nadal F. Levy-Toledano S. Grelac F. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms of the different interrelationships between MAPK pathway and different members of the integrin family.Although we have identified that the cGMP-PKG-MAPK pathway mediates GPIb-IX-dependent integrin activation signaling, it is important to note that activation of PKG-MAPK pathway by adding cGMP analogs alone in the absence of vWF or thrombin stimulation is not sufficient to activate integrin αIIbβ3.2 Thus, it appears that additional parallel signaling pathways induced by vWF or thrombin is required for integrin activation in addition to the cGMP-PKG-MAPK pathway. In this respect, it has been reported that vWF-induced platelet activation requires activation of the Fc receptor γII (or Fc receptor γ-chain)-protein-tyrosine kinase Syk-signaling pathway (Fig. 7) (43Sullam P.M.

In addition, GPIb-IX is associated with several intracellular signaling proteins including 14-3-3ζ (47Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol.

Blood. 2000; 96: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and calmodulin (50Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the roles of these proteins in GPIb-IX signaling are still unclear, it is possible that these proteins are also involved in GPIb-IX-mediated signaling. Thus, GPIb-IX-mediated integrin activation requires coordination of two or more signaling pathways (Fig. 7), one of which is the cGMP-PKG-MAPK-signaling pathway.The downstream signaling pathway of MAPK-mediated integrin activation is still unknown. Because ERK has been shown to phosphorylate and activate cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (27Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), it is a possibility that activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 may be a downstream link between ERK and integrin activation. However, previous studies suggest that the release of arachidonic acid during platelet activation is not affected by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (29Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and vWF-induced TXA2 production is preceded by integrin activation (35Ruan C.G. Du X.P. Xi X.D. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that vWF-induced integrin activation and low dose-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are not inhibited by aspirin. These data suggest that ERK-dependent activation of integrin does not require the TXA2 pathway. Although TXA2 is important in the irreversible second wave of platelet aggregation induced by certain agonists, the second wave of platelet aggregation not only requires integrin activation but also requires integrin-dependent outside-in signaling and release of granule contents. It would be interesting to further investigate the downstream mechanism of the MAP kinase-dependent integrin activation pathway. The integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet adhesion, spreading, and aggregation and thus plays a critical role in thrombosis and hemostasis (1Ginsberg M.H. Du X. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In normal circulating platelets, the integrin αIIbβ3 is in a resting state with a low affinity for its ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF).1 At sites of vascular injury, exposure of platelets to soluble agonists (such as thrombin and ADP) or to matrix-bound adhesive proteins (such as collagen and vWF) induces platelet activation. A common consequence of platelet activation is the activation of the ligand binding function of the integrin αIIbβ3 (2Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M.

Under high shear rate flow conditions, such as in stenotic atherosclerotic arteries, initial platelet adhesion and activation are dependent on the interaction between subendothelium-bound vWF and its receptor, the glycoprotein Ib-IX (GPIb-IX) complex (4Weiss H.J.

https://openalex.org/W2078995073,"There are several known routes for the metabolic detoxication of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, including conjugation to glutathione and reduction and oxidation of the aldehyde to an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, respectively. In this study, we describe a fourth class of detoxication that involves the reduction of the α,β-carbon=carbon double bond to a single bond. This reaction is catalyzed by NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AO), an enzyme heretofore known as leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase, 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase, and dithiolethione-inducible gene-1. AO is shown to effectively reduce cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) (kcat = 4.0 × 103 min−1;kcat/Km = 3.3 × 107 min−1m−1) and acrolein (kcat = 2.2 × 102min−1; kcat/Km= 1.5 × 106 min−1m−1) and common industrial compounds such as ethyl vinyl ketone (kcat = 9.6 × 103 min−1;kcat/Km = 8.8 × 107 min−1m−1) and 15-oxoprostaglandin E1 (kcat = 2.4 × 103 min−1;kcat/Km = 2.4 × 109 min−1m−1). Furthermore, transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with a rat liver AO expression vector protected these cells from challenge with HNE. The concentration of HNE at which 50% of the cells were killed after 24 h increased from ∼15 µm in control cells to ∼70 µm in AO-transfected cells. Overexpression of AO also completely abolished protein alkylation by HNE at all concentrations tested (up to 30 µm). Thus, we describe a novel antioxidative activity of a previously characterized bioactive lipid-metabolizing enzyme that could prove to be therapeutically or prophylactically useful due to its high catalytic rate and inducibility.

Additional protective enzymes were identified via a differential hybridization screen for 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione-inducible genes of rat liver (4Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One such gene, DIG-1, was found to be a homolog of an inactivator of leukotriene B4(LTB4) in porcine kidney and act via an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenation of the 12-hydroxy group of LTB4 (5Takehiko Y. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human homolog of this leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase was later cloned and found to have similar substrate specificity (6Takehiko Y. Ogawa Y. Uozumi N. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2844-2850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A contemporaneous study identified an enzyme from porcine lung that could reduce the 13,14-carbon=carbon double bond of 15-oxoprostaglandins via an NAD(P)H-dependent mechanism (7Ensor C.M. Zhang H. Tai H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following the determination of the sequence of this enzyme, a BLAST search revealed its virtual identity to porcine kidney and human leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase. Recently, the porcine homolog has been shown to also inactivate the autacoid lipoxin A4via an NAD(P)H-dependent reduction (8Clish C.B. Levy B.D. Chiang N. Tai H.H. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Treatment of LTB4 with DIG-1 purified from rat liver was shown to abolish the chemoattractant activity of LTB4 as well as its ability to induce the respiratory burst of neutrophils (9Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because of a significant sequence homology to quinone reductase (4Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a more vigorous NAD(P)H-dependent activity, we postulated a more prominent role in chemoprotection that extended beyond the metabolism of bioactive lipid messengers. Thus, in this study, the substrate specificity of DIG-1 was probed using various α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The process of lipid peroxidation involves the free radical-mediated conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to smaller aliphatic, straight chain α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and saturated ketones and aldehydes (10Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schaur R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Membrane Lipid Oxidation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 239-268Google Scholar). Of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes detected, 2-alkenals, 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, or 2,4-alkadienals are the most common (11Esterbauer H. McBrien D.C.H. Slater T.F. Free Radicals, Lipid Peroxidation and Cancer. Academic Press Limited, London1982: 101Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is an abundant and extensively studied product of lipid peroxidation. At physiological concentrations, HNE has been shown to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis, induce apoptosis, alter cell signaling pathways, covalently bind to proteins, and form exocyclic DNA adducts (12Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). It is mutagenic and considered carcinogenic. HNE is a major constituent of oxidized low density lipoproteins, and HNE–protein adducts are abundant in atherosclerotic plaques and senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (12Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 13Jurgens G. Chen Q. Esterbauer H. Mair S. Ledinski G. Dinges H.P. Arterioscler.

Thus, HNE has been implicated in the etiology of cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease (15Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar, 16Aviram M. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 2000; 33, (suppl.): S85-S97Google Scholar, 17Dianzani M.U. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 15: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). DIG-1 was found to be very effective in catalyzing the hydrogenation and thus detoxication of a wide variety of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, including lipid peroxidation products, and cytotoxic and mutagenic ketones that are environmental pollutants (18Eder E. Hoffman C. Deininger C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,19Eder E. Deininger C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 470: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For this reason, we propose to rename DIG-1 as NADPH-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AO). We previously demonstrated that AO is inducible in rat liver by dithiolethione administration and is thus regulated similarly to phase 2 and antioxidative enzymes (4Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that cells transfected with an AO expression plasmid are well protected from cytotoxic actions of HNE. Thus, we conclude that AO may play a prominent role in protecting cells from the cytotoxic and mutagenic products of lipid peroxidation. Coupled with its ability to inactivate the pro-inflammatory LTB4, AO appears to be an important attenuator of both the initiation and propagation of the detrimental effects of inflammation. Most α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds were purchased from Sigma. HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, and 15-oxoprostaglandin E1 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. EBNA-293 cells and the pCEP4 plasmid were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). AO cDNA from rat liver was isolated previously (4Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); cloned into the pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen), which inserts a 6-His tag into the N terminus of the protein; and sequenced. This plasmid, pTrcHisA/AO, was then used to transform chemically competent E. coli DH5α. AO was expressed as described previously (20Knight L.P. Primiano T. Groopman J.D. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recombinant AO was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (QIAGEN Inc.) as previously described (21QIAGEN Inc. The QIAexpressionist. QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA2001Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining. Those fractions with >95% purity were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (10 mm potassium Pi(pH 7.3), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and the AO solution was then diluted to 30% glycerol. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C for up to 8 months with no significant loss of activity. Recombinant rat AO was found to have identical leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase kinetic characteristics as reported for the native enzyme purified from rat liver (9Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TheKm and kcat for all α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds except for compound19 (chalcone) were determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm (ε = 6220m−1 cm−1) on a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer (22Kitamura S. Katsura H. Tatsumi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 839-847PubMed Google Scholar). A saturating amount of NADPH (0.1 mm final concentration) was added to 11.5 µg of recombinant AO in 2 ml of 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline at 30 °C. Substrates were dissolved initially in ethanol to a concentration of 50 mm and diluted or concentrated as necessary to keep the ethanol concentration below 1%. Initial velocities for each substrate concentration were calculated, and the HYPER program was used to calculate the Vmax andKm via hyperbolic regression analysis. Chalcone has a significant absorbance at 340 nm, so an HPLC assay was needed to measure its kinetic characteristics. 0.1 volume of the spectrophotometric assay mixture was used. A 30-s reaction time was found to be in the linear range of metabolism; so after 30 s, 300 µl of ethyl acetate containing 3 nmol of piperine (internal standard) were added, and the tubes were mixed and centrifuged. The ethyl acetate layer was removed and evaporated in a SpeedVac. The remaining chalcone, its metabolite, and piperine were then chromatographed on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 HPLC apparatus with an isocratic acetonitrile/water (60:40) mobile phase and a Luna C18column (Phenomenex Inc.) and monitored at 308, 245, and 333 nm using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 diode array detector. Inhibition constants (Ki) for quercetin, cyclovalone, and progesterone were calculated spectrophotometrically using benzylidene acetone as the substrate. Kinetic constants for NADPH and NADH were determined using the chalcone-based HPLC assay. Compounds were considered neither substrates nor inhibitors if they failed to produce a rate of NADPH oxidation greater than background when present at 50 µmor to significantly decrease the rate of benzylidene acetone reduction when both were present at 50 µm. EBNA-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, an additional 2 mm glutamine, and 250 µg/ml G418). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. They were passaged every 3–4 days. AO cDNA was subcloned from the pTrcHisA/AO plasmid into pGEM-5zf(+) (Promega) to add a Kozak sequence and then into pCEP4 to form the pCEP4/AO plasmid. This plasmid was sequenced and used, along with pCEP4, to transfect EBNA-293 cells with LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 15 nmol of benzylidene acetone were metabolized by AO using a reaction mixture identical to that used in the chalcone assay. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 35 min and then stopped by the addition of 300 µl of ethyl acetate. The samples were mixed and centrifuged, and the organic layer was removed and evaporated. Products were then analyzed by HPLC in the same manner as described for chalcone with the following changes. A 50:50 mixture of acetonitrile/water was used as a mobile phase, and detection occurred at 220, 250, and 285 nm. trans-4-Phenyl-3-buten-2-ol was synthesized according to a protocol used by Burczynski et al. (55Burczynski M.E. Sridhar G.R. Palackal N.T. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2890-2897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to synthesize 1,4-dihydroxynonene. The product was verified by 1H NMR. 4-Hydroxynonanal was synthesized as described previously (38Haynes R.L. Szweda L. Pickin K. Welker M.E. Townsend A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and verified by 1H NMR. HNE TLC studies were carried out with a 30% ethyl acetate and 70% hexane solvent system and stained with a phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Alltech Associates Inc.). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric studies were performed on a PE-Sciex API 150EX mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems) using positive ion detection. trans-2-Nonenal– and nonanal–2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) conjugates were synthesized by adding 200 µl of each chemical to 100 ml of DNPH-saturated 2m HCl (23Knapp D.R. Handbook of Analytical Derivation Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 340-341Google Scholar). The mixtures were stirred and incubated in the dark at room temperature overnight. Precipitates were then filtered and washed with 2 n HCl to remove unreacted DNPH. Filtrates were dissolved in 100 ml of ethyl acetate and sequentially washed three times with 100 ml of 2 m HCl, once with 100 ml of H2O, and once with 100 ml of brine. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated. Thetrans-2-nonenal conjugate was recrystallized from ethanol and water, whereas the nonanal conjugate was recrystallized fromN,N-dimethylformamide and water. The nonanal–DNPH conjugate was further purified using preparative TLC plates and a 9% ethyl acetate and 91% hexane solvent system. 10 mg of trans-2-nonenal were dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol and added dropwise to 200 ml of 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline. NADPH (115 mg) and 600 µg of AO were then added. The mixture was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 16 h. The solution was cooled to 4 °C, and 50 ml of concentrated HCl were added. DNPH was then added to saturation, and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 3 h. This aqueous mixture was extracted three times with 150 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were pooled and washed six times with 170 ml of 2n HCl, twice with 400 ml of distilled water, and once with 400 ml of brine. The organic extract was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated. The product was then purified using preparative TLC plates and a 9% ethyl acetate and 91% hexane solvent system. The product was eluted from the silica scrapings with dichloromethane, evaporated to dryness, and resuspended in Me2SO-d6. A Varian UNITY Plus 500-MHz NMR spectrometer was used to obtain the 1H NMR spectra of the standards and metabolite. Chemical shifts (δ) are in parts/million and are referenced to tetramethylsilane. Authentictrans-2-nonenal–2′,4′-dinitrophenylhydrazone gave the following spectral assignments: δ 0.87–0.89 (t, 3H, 9-CH3), 1.26–1.46 (m, 2H, and m, 6H, 5-CH2, 6-CH2, 7-CH2, and 8-CH2), 2.21–2.26 (q, 2H, 4-CH2), 6.25–6.36 (m, 2H, 2-CH and 3-CH, J2, 3 = 2), 7.84–7.87 (d, 1H, 6′-CH), 8.32–8.37 (m, 2H, 1-CH and 5′-CH), 8.85 (d, 1H, 3′-CH), and 11.43 (s, 1H, NH). 1H NMR analysis of the 2′,4′-dinitrophenylhydrazone conjugate of the AO metabolite and nonanal–2′,4′-dinitrophenylhydrazone gave identical spectra. Spectral assignments are as follow: δ 0.86–0.89 (t, 3H, 9-CH3), 1.26–1.58 (m, 2H, and m, 10H, 3-CH2, 4-CH2, 5-CH2, 6-CH2, 7-CH2, and 8-CH2), 2.31–2.38 (m, 2H, 2-CH2), 7.83–7.85 (d, 1H, 6′-CH), 8.00–8.03 (t, 1H, 1-CH), 8.32–8.35 (dd, 1H, 5′-CH), 8.83–8.84 (d, 1H, 3′-CH), and 11.34 (s, 1H, NH). pCEP4/AO- and pCEP4-transfected cells were plated in 96-well culture plates at a cell density of 3000 cells/well. They were grown in complete medium supplemented with 200 µg/ml hygromycin B for 24 h and then in serum-free medium containing 0–500 µm HNE. Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (24Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B.

Cells were scraped from the dish, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed using a freeze-thaw technique, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 5 µg of pCEP4/AO and 50 µg of pCEP4 supernatants were then used in a standard chalcone assay with the following modifications. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min, and NADPH was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. pCEP4/AO-transfected and control cells were grown to 90% confluency in 60-mm dishes in complete medium. The medium was then replaced by complete serum-free medium containing 0, 15, or 30 µm HNE. Cultures were incubated for 2 h and then harvested, lysed, and briefly sonicated. Whole cell sonicates were vortexed, and 20 µg of protein were loaded into each well of a slot-blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schüll). A 1:1000 dilution of anti-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal Michael adduct polyclonal rabbit serum (Calbiochem) was used as the primary antibody, and a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed using Eastman Kodak BIOMAX MS film and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Several α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones were found to be effective substrates for AO (Fig. 1A). These substrates included products of lipid peroxidation (trans-2-alkenals,trans-4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, and trans, trans-2,4-alkadienals); short chain aliphatic alkenones, which are commonly used industrial reagents (methyl and ethyl vinyl ketones); and aromatic compounds used in fragrances and flavorings (cinnamaldehyde and benzylidene acetone). A series of trans-2-alkenals (compounds 2-8) was used to investigate the effect of hydrophobicity on substrate kinetics. Increasing carbon chain length was inversely proportional to substrate Km, which saturated at 50 µm and a nine-carbon length (Fig.1B). Thus, increased hydrophobicity was generally associated with better substrate binding. The catalytic rate constant (kcat) for this series increased with hydrophobicity until the substrates reached a nine-carbon length and then began to decrease (Fig. 1C). This could be due to less than optimal alignment of catalytic residues of AO and the substrate α,β-double bond caused by the increased bulk of additional methylene groups. trans-2-Nonenal proved to be the best substrate of the series. Interestingly, acrolein (compound1) did not follow the Km trends of the other trans-2-alkenals (TableI).Table IKinetic constants for recombinant rat liver AO at pH 7.1 using NADPH as a cofactorCompoundKmkcatkcat/Kmmmmin−1min−1m−11Acrolein0.152231.5 × 1062 Crotonaldehyde3.94831.2 × 1053trans-2-Pentenal2.410104.2 × 1054trans-2-Hexenal1.017301.7 × 1065trans-2-Octenal0.3653801.5 × 1076trans-2-Nonenal0.04656701.2 × 1087trans-2-Decenal0.0442501.1 × 1088trans-2-Dodecenal0.0636106.0 × 1079 Methyl vinyl ketone0.5893701.6 × 10710 Ethyl vinyl ketone0.1196008.8 × 107113-Penten-2-one0.4911102.3 × 10612 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal0.218033.8 × 106134-Hydroxy-2-nonenal0.1240403.3 × 10714 3-Nonen-2-one0.01611907.3 × 10715trans,trans-2,4-Nonadienal0.4110302.5 × 10616Cinnamaldehyde0.0759401.2 × 10717 α-Methylcinnamaldehyde1.77864.7 × 10518 Benzylidene acetone0.03932808.4 × 10719Chalcone0.1819401.1 × 1072015-Oxoprostaglandin E10.00124002.4 × 109 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of reduction of several other substrates defined further trends in the substrate specificity of AO. 4-Hydroxylation decreased the catalytic efficiency of the unsaturated nonenals (compounds6 and 13), but increased the catalytic efficiency of the unsaturated hexenals (compounds 4 and 12). Methylation at the α-carbon markedly increased theKm, but did not affect thekcat significantly (compounds 16 and17). Methylation at the β-carbon also had drastic negative effects, as mesityl oxide was not a substrate for AO (compounds11 and 32). Ketones were generally better substrates than aldehydes (compounds 16 and 18,2 and 11, and 5 and 14). Attachment of a methyl group to methyl vinyl ketone (compound9) at C-1 to form ethyl vinyl ketone (compound10) decreased its Km 5-fold, but did not affect its extremely high kcat. If 15-oxoprostaglandin E1 (compound 20) could be considered an example of longer hydrophobic attachments to the carbonyl carbon, then increasing hydrophobicity at this position greatly augmented substrate binding. Unsaturation at the C-4–C-5 bond decreased both the catalytic rate and substrate binding (compounds6 and 15). A phenyl group attached to the β-carbon imparted a low Km to the molecule (compounds 16 and 18). This result could reflect π-bonding to an aromatic residue of the hydrophobic active site or simply increased substrate hydrophobicity. The increased affinity associated with this group was exploited to verify that α,β-unsaturated amides, esters, and carboxylic acids (compounds24-26) were not substrates for AO (Fig.2B). Several additional molecules of these classes were screened and produced no detectable AO-mediated NADPH oxidation or inhibition of AO. Malondialdehyde (compound 28), glycylglycine (compound 27), the dithiolethiones 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (compound29) and oltipraz (compound 30), and 2-cyclohexenone (compound 31) also did not interact with AO. On the other hand, a few molecules that were found to inhibit AO are shown in Fig. 2A. Progesterone (compound 21), like 2-cyclohexenone, is an α,β-unsaturated ketone and is constrained to a trans-configuration about the carbonyl carbon–α-carbon single bond. Adoption of thecis-configuration may be important for proper alignment of reactive moieties in the active site. Because progesterone was a good competitive inhibitor of AO, the additional hydrophobicity imparted to the molecule by its B-, C-, and D-rings and methyl groups must allow it to tightly bind in the active site of the enzyme. Cyclovalone (compound22) has previously been identified as a potent inducer of phase 2 enzymes (25Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Massiah M.A. Bozak R.E. Hicks R.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, in this study, it inhibited AO noncompetitively. Quercetin (compound 23) also inhibited AO noncompetitively. Quercetin has been reported to bind to both the nicotinamide dinucleotide- and aldehyde-binding sites of aldehyde dehydrogenase (26Kitson T.M. Kitson K.E. Moore S.A. Chem. Biol. Intact. 2001; 130–132: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and may do so with AO as well. To verify that AO utilized NADPH to catalyze the reduction of the α,β-double bond and not the carbonyl double bond, benzylidene acetone (compound18) was metabolized by AO to completion, extracted, and subjected to analysis by HPLC. The metabolite (Fig.3D) and benzyl acetone standard (Fig. 3B) both eluted at 11.8 min. A NADPH-minus control was performed, and the resulting compound (Fig. 3E) was found to have a retention time (10.3 min) identical to that of benzylidene acetone (Fig. 3A). Atrans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol standard was synthesized and found to have an 8.2-min retention time (Fig. 3C). Equimolar (15 nmol) amounts of standards and substrate were used for each HPLC run. No trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol peak was detected in the benzylidene acetone metabolite chromatogram. The UV-visible absorbance spectra of the metabolite and benzyl acetone were identical (Fig. 3G). The spectra of benzylidene acetone (Fig.3F) and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol (Fig.3H) were also obtained. Notice the absence of the 250 and 285 nm peaks present in the spectra oftrans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol and benzylidene acetone, respectively, in the metabolite spectrum. These absorbance peaks are associated with extensions of the π-structure of the phenyl ring through the α,β-double bond. Benzylidene acetone chromatographs (Fig. 3, A and E) were monitored at 285 nm; benzyl acetone chromatographs (Fig. 3, B and D) were monitored at 220 nm; and thetrans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol chromatograph (Fig.3C) was monitored at 250 nm. Together, these data demonstrate that AO catalyzes the NADPH-mediated reduction of the α,β-double bond rather than the carbonyl group. A similar experiment was performed using HNE as the substrate. First, to establish that only a hydrogen molecule (H2) is added to the substrate, HNE was metabolized to completion and analyzed on a mass spectrometer. Large peaks at m/z 181.0 and 213.0 were apparent when the metabolite was dissolved in methanol and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using positive ion detection. 2R. A. Dick and T. W. Kensler, unpublished data. These peaks undoubtedly correspond to the Na+ adducts of HNA and HNA-methanol hemiacetal, respectively. Second, to verify that 4-hydroxynonanal (HNA) is the metabolic product of AO reduction, HNA was synthesized and compared with the HNE metabolite by TLC. HNA and the metabolite were found to have identical RFvalues, not to stain with potassium permanganate, and not to be detectable by UV light. On the other hand, HNE had a slightly lowerRF value than the metabolite, stained with potassium permanganate, and was detectable by UV light. 1,4-Dihydroxy-2-nonenal has been reported to have a much lower RF value under similar TLC conditions (55Burczynski M.E. Sridhar G.R. Palackal N.T. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2890-2897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and was not detected in any of our studies. Aldehydes were coupled to DNPH to ease detection, to aid in recrystallization, and to decrease volatility. trans-2-Nonenal was added to a buffered solution containing AO and NADPH and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The solution was then acidified, and DNPH was added. The hydrazone of the enzymatic product was then purified and subjected to 1H NMR analysis. The spectrum of the product–2′,4′-dinitrophenylhydrazone conjugate (Fig. 4C) was found to be identical to the spectrum of nonanal–DNPH (Fig. 4B). A multiplet at δ 6.25–6.36 ppm, which is apparent in the spectrum oftrans-2-nonenal–DNPH (Fig. 4A) and corresponds to the two vinylic protons of the C-2–C-3 double bond, was absent in both the product–DNPH"
https://openalex.org/W2068084521,"Gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF or KLF4) is a zinc finger-containing, epithelial-specific transcription factor, that functions as a suppressor of cell proliferation. We previously showed that GKLF expression is decreased in intestinal and colonic adenomas, respectively, from multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. This study shows that GKLF is induced upon activation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. However, among several human colon cancer cell lines surveyed, expression of GKLF is lowest in RKO, a line with wild-type APC and beta-catenin. RKO contains a mutated allele that encodes the putative tumor suppressor homeodomain protein, CDX2. We show that wild-type CDX2 activates the GKLF promoter and that the mutated CDX2 has a dominant negative effect on wild-type function. Our results may help explain the exceedingly low levels of GKLF expression detected in this cell line, which may in turn contribute to the tumor phenotype."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). PG production is controlled by two cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) that mediate the initial conversion of arachidonic acid into PGH2, a precursor common to all prostanoids (2Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Whereas COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most cells and its activity is regulated mainly by the availability of arachidonic acid, COX-2 is expressed at undetectable levels under normal conditions and rapidly and strongly induced by specific stimuli in different cell types (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). In particular, macrophages are prominent producers of prostaglandins during inflammatory processes in response to signals that trigger macrophage activation such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Altered COX-2 levels and consequent abnormally high PGs secretion are thought to be involved in diverse pathological processes, and COX-2-specific inhibitors hold high hopes for the treatment of cancer as well as chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (4Everts B. Wahrborg P. Hedner T. Clin. Rheumatol. 2000; 19: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1511-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The regulation of COX-2 synthesis occurs mainly at the transcriptional level, although mRNA stabilization is also involved in response to specific signals. The stimuli, signal transduction pathways, and transcription factors involved in the induction of cox-2gene expression are extremely diversified and cell-specific. Thus,cox-2 transcription is activated by LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and endothelial cells, by growth factors, serum and phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) in fibroblasts, by growth factors and PMA in epithelial cells, by serotonin and interleukin (IL)-1β in mesangial cells, and by follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones in ovarian granulosa cells (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The promoter elements and transcription factors involved also vary according to the cell type, and their relative roles are often contradictory, probably reflecting the complexity of the pathways involved. Of the numerous cis-acting elements identified on thecox-2 mouse gene promoter, three have been proposed to play a fundamental role in most systems analyzed. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) site at position −402/−392 has been implicated incox-2 induction in different cell types (6Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol.

However, all these studies are based on transient transfection/overexpression experiments and do not take into account the endogenous and regulated ratio of C/EBP family members able to bind to the promoter under uninduced or induced conditions. Cells where specific transcription factors have been inactivated represent a precious tool to determine the physiological role played by a given factor in the transcriptional control of candidate target genes. Here we made use of immortalized cells that we have recently derived from C/EBPβ-deficient or wild type mice 2B. Gorgoni, P. Marthyn, M. Righi, and V. Poli, submitted for publication. to analyze the role played by this factor in regulating cox-2 expression. We found that COX-2 induction by LPS was profoundly defective in C/EBPβ−/− macrophages, essentially due to impaired transcriptional induction via the −138/−130 C/EBP promoter element. In contrast, in fibroblasts C/EBPβ was totally dispensable forcox-2 transcriptional induction in response to PMA treatment or v-Src transfection, thus unambiguously confirming the cell-specific nature of COX-2 regulation. The generation of C/EBPβ−/−- and C/EBPβ+/+-immortalized macrophages is described elsewhere.2 The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and containing 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (standard medium). Cells at ∼70% confluence were stimulated with 100 units/ml of interferon (IFN)γ (kindly provided by G. Garotta, Ares-Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) for 16 h and with 100 ng/ml of LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 026:B6; Sigma) for the indicated times. For the inhibition of transcription, after 4 h of LPS treatment cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma) for the indicated times. C/EBPβ−/− and C/EBPβ+/+ fibroblasts were immortalized from E13.5 C/EBPβ−/− or C/EBPβ+/+ embryos (24Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D.

Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and containing 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) for 4 h prior to RNA extraction. C/EBPβ−/− and C/EBPβ+/+mice were killed by asphyxiation with CO2, and bone marrow cells were collected as described previously (26Doyle A.G. Fraser I.P. Herzenberg D.M.W. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1996: 154.1-154.8Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were mechanically isolated from femurs and cultured on 9-cm diameter bacteriological plates in RPMI 1640 standard medium supplemented with 30–50% of L cell-conditioned medium as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (26Doyle A.G. Fraser I.P. Herzenberg D.M.W. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1996: 154.1-154.8Google Scholar). Bone marrow macrophages were treated with 100 units/ml IFNγ for 16 h, followed by 1 µg/ml of LPS for 4 h prior to RNA extraction. Total RNA was prepared from untreated or stimulated cultured cells using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 or 5 µg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot or slot blot, respectively, as described previously (27Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni F. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). cDNA probes were labeled by random priming. The relative abundance of cox-2 mRNA was measured by PhosphorImager analysis and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal control. Cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium o-vanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 2 µmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) 1 tablet per 50 ml). Samples were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, 30 µg of cell lysate were denatured in SDS, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with an anti-COX-2 polyclonal goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and detected by ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture), and mechanically lysed in 2 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 6.75%, and samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in Nuclear Resuspension buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture), sonicated in a 4 °C water bath, and rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 58,000 rpm in a TLA 120.2 rotor for 90 min and supernatants snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) probes were made by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides (MWG-Biotech) with 5′ GATC overhangs. 1 picomole of probe was radiolabeled by filling in with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow enzyme and purified on a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Sequences are as follows: C/EBP1, 5′-GATCCTGCCGCTGCGGTTCTTGCGCAACTCACT-3′; C/EBP2, 5′-GATCGTGGGGGTTGGGGAAAGCCTAAGCGG-3′; AlbD C/EBP site, 5′-TGGTATGATTTTGTAATGGGGTAGG-3′; HpxA C/EBP site, 5′-TATTTGCAGTGATGTAATCAGC-3′; NF-κB, 5′-GATCGAGAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTAGGA-3′; HIV-κB NF-κB site, 5′-GATCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGCG-3′; CRE/E box, 5′-GATCGTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAGTCCGCTT-3′; CRE consensus, 5′-GATCAGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′; E box consensus, 5′-GATCCACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTA- CACC-3′. EMSAs were performed with 4 µg of nuclear extract in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 2.5 mm DTT, containing 3 µg of poly(dI-dC). The complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% (C/EBP) or 5% (NF-κB and CRE/E box) polyacrylamide, 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA gel. For supershift experiments, 2 µl of polyclonal purified antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated with nuclear extracts and poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice, prior to probe addition. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were preincubated at a 50-fold molar excess 10 min prior to probe addition. 1 µg of a synthetic peptide carrying the C/EBP leucine zipper motif was used as described (28Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Culture media of cells treated with IFNγ and LPS were assayed with the Prostaglandin E2Enzyme Immunoassay System from Biotrak (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Values obtained (pg/well) were normalized to protein concentration of each sample. 60 × 106 cells per sample were harvested and lysed as for nuclear protein extraction (see above). Immediately after lysis, nuclei were prepared as follows: 1 ml of Sucrose buffer I (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmDTT) and 5.6 ml of Sucrose buffer II (2 m sucrose, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm DTT) were added to the lysate. Nuclei were collected by ultracentrifugation over a cushion of Sucrose buffer II, resuspended in 225 µl of Nuclear freezing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% v/v glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), and stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear run-on was performed essentially as described (29Carey M. Smale T.S. Cuddihy J. Woelker B. Dickerson M.M. Barker P. deBruin D. Schaefer S. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 65Google Scholar). Equal amounts of radioactivity (about 5 × 106 cpm/ml) were used to hybridize dot blots in 10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.6m NaCl at 65 °C for at least 36 h. Dot blots contained 10 µg of a linearized COX-2 or GAPDH cDNA plasmid or the empty Bluescript plasmid as a negative control. Membranes were washed as described (29Carey M. Smale T.S. Cuddihy J. Woelker B. Dickerson M.M. Barker P. deBruin D. Schaefer S. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 65Google Scholar) and treated with 10 µg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. Blots were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Normalized values were obtained as COX-2:GAPDH intensity ratio. The full-length cox-2promoter (−963 base pairs) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA as template and the Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used were −963, 5′-GGGCTAGCCCAACACAAACACAGTAGGA-3′; COX2rev, 5′-GGCTCGAGGCAGTGCTGAGATTCTTCGT-3′, positioned at +70 base pairs. The product was verified by sequence analysis and ligated into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL-3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The other constructs were amplified from the −963/luc construct, sequenced, and cloned in the same vector. Primers used were COX2rev, indicated above, and one of the following: −203, 5′-GGGCTAGCAAGGGCAGCTTCCCGGCTTC-3′; −119, 5′-GGGCTAGCAGAGAGGGGGAAAAGTTGGT-3′; −79, 5′-GGGCTAGCGCGGAAAGACAGAGTCACCA-3′; −45, 5′-GGGCTAGCGTCCGCTTTA- CAGACTTAAAAG-3′. CMV-C/EBPβ carried the rat cDNA (28Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) cloned into the pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). The pSGT-Src-527 expression plasmid (30Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by G. Superti-Furga (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). All plasmids were prepared using Endotoxin-free Plasmid Preparation Kits (Qiagen). For transient transfection of immortalized macrophages, 107cells were resuspended in 250 µl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, together with 5 µg of the indicated firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 µg of the internal control pRL-TK, encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega). 2 µg of CMV-C/EBPβ plasmid was used for co-transfection experiments. Cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm cuvettes in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 950 microfarads, and each sample was seeded on two 3.5-cm diameter Petri dishes in RPMI 1640 standard medium and cultured for 18 h. One dish was treated with 1 µg/ml of LPS for 4 h, and then cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the dish in 0.5 ml of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega). Immortalized fibroblasts were plated at ∼70% confluence onto 6-cm dishes 24 h prior to transfecting with 3 µg of cox-2reporter construct and 0.5 µg of pRL-TK using the calcium phosphate method. 1.5 µg of pSGT-Src-527 plasmid were used for co-transfection experiments. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and collected in Passive Lysis buffer. Firefly and Renilla luciferase values were obtained by analyzing 20 µl of cell extract using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega), according to manufacturer's instructions, in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as firefly luciferase value/Renillaluciferase value. Since C/EBPβ activated the control pRL-TK plasmid, luciferase activity was normalized to protein content as measured by Bradford assay when C/EBPβ was co-transfected. The generation and characterization of immortalized macrophages from the spleen of C/EBPβ−/− and C/EBPβ+/+ mice is described elsewhere.2 To evaluate the expression of COX-2 mRNA in the absence of C/EBPβ, total RNA from several independent C/EBPβ−/− (K1, K3, and K4) or C/EBPβ+/+(W2, W3B, and W3E) macrophage cell lines either untreated or treated with IFNγ and LPS was subjected to slot blot analysis using a COX-2 cDNA fragment as a probe. COX-2 mRNA was undetectable in both −/− and +/+ untreated cells but was strongly induced in the wild type cell lines after 4 h of LPS treatment (Fig.1, A and C, left panel). The induction was still appreciable at 8 h but had decreased considerably by 24 h after treatment (Fig.1B). In contrast, very little induction could be detected in all three mutant cell lines analyzed. COX-2 expression was partially rescued in the revertant cell line r(K4) that was obtained by stably transfecting C/EBPβ into the K4−/− cells (Fig.1C, left panel). Of note, both C/EBPβ mRNA2 and protein levels (data not shown) were about 3–4 times lower in the r(K4) cells than in wild type cell lines both before and after stimulation, in line with the partial rescue of COX-2 expression achieved. Taken together, these data establish a strong correlation between COX-2 mRNA induction and the presence of C/EBPβ. In agreement with this idea, COX-2 expression was also strongly defective in primary macrophages derived from the bone marrow of C/EBPβ-deficient mice (Fig. 1C, right panel). We next analyzed COX-2 protein levels in the W2, K4, and r(K4) cell lines by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, COX-2 was barely detectable in the mutant K4 cells both before and after stimulation, whereas it was strongly induced in the wild type W2 cells with levels comparable to the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264, used as a control. Expression of C/EBPβ in the revertant cells allowed ∼50% of COX-2 expression to be rescued. These differences were mirrored by the levels of prostaglandin E2 secreted in the culture medium, which were negligible in the K4 cells, extremely high in the W2 cells, and intermediate in the revertant r(K4) cells (Fig.2B). Nuclear run-on assays were performed using nuclei prepared from unstimulated or stimulated K4 and W2 cells. As shown in Fig.3A, transcriptional rates were strongly induced by IFNγ/LPS treatment in nuclei from the wild type but not from the mutant cells, indicating that the low expression of COX-2 mRNA observed in the absence of C/EBPβ was at least partly due to impaired transcription of its gene. To verify whether decreased mRNA stability could also play a role, cells were treated with actinomycin D after stimulation with IFNγ and LPS, and total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot with a COX-2 cDNA probe. As expected, COX-2 mRNA was much less abundant in the mutant K4 cells. However, no RNA degradation was detected for up to 90 min after actinomycin D addition in either wild type or mutant samples (Fig. 3B), suggesting that COX-2 mRNA stability is not altered in the C/EBPβ−/− cells. Altered transcription of specific genes in transcription factor-deficient cells could well represent a secondary event, resulting from the altered expression or activity of distinct sets of transcriptional activators. We therefore decided to analyze the DNA-protein interactions taking place at the level of the cox-2 promoter sites previously shown to be involved in transcriptional induction of the gene (Fig.4A) in order to assess whether the pattern of proteins binding to one or more of these sites was altered in the C/EBPβ−/− cells. Previous studies on the mouse cox-2 promoter have variably identified an NF-κB-binding site (NF-κB, position −402/−392), a C/EBP-binding site (C/EBP1, position −138/−130), and an overlapping CRE/E box element (CRE/E box, position −59/−48), as important in"

PP1G/RGL(GM) is a glycogen/sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated type 1 phosphatase that was originally postulated to mediate insulin control of glycogen metabolism. However, we recently showed (Suzuki, Y., Lanner, C., Kim, J.-H., Vilardo, P. G., Zhang, H., Jie Yang, J., Cooper, L. D., Steele, M., Kennedy, A., Bock, C., Scrimgeour, A., Lawrence, J. C. Jr., L., and DePaoli-Roach, A. A. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 2683–2694) that insulin activates GS in muscle of RGL(GM) knockout (KO) mice similarly to the wild type (WT). To determine whether PP1G is involved in glycogen metabolism during muscle contractions, RGL KO and overexpressors (OE) were subjected to two models of contraction,in vivo treadmill running and in situelectrical stimulation. Both procedures resulted in a 2-fold increase in the GS −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio in WT mice, but this response was completely absent in the KO mice. The KO mice, which also have a reduced GS activity associated with significantly reduced basal glycogen levels, exhibited impaired maximal exercise capacity, but contraction-induced activation of glucose transport was unaffected. The RGL OE mice are characterized by enhanced GS activity ratio and an ∼3–4-fold increase in glycogen content in skeletal muscle. These animals were able to tolerate exercise normally. Stimulation of GS and glucose uptake following muscle contraction was not significantly different as compared with WT littermates. These results indicate that although PP1G/RGL is not necessary for activation of GS by insulin, it is essential for regulation of glycogen metabolism under basal conditions and in response to contractile activity, and may explain the reduced muscle glycogen content in the RGL KO mice, despite the normal insulin activation of GS.

Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis, and postprandially, ∼80% of ingested glucose is taken up by skeletal muscle and converted to glycogen (1Jue T. Rothman D.L. Tavitian B.A. Shulman R.G. Proc.

Under these conditions, insulin activates glycogen synthase (GS),1 as well as glucose transport, via translocation of the GLUT4 transporter (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J.

Glycogen is a major fuel for the contractile activity of skeletal muscle. During contraction, glycogen is utilized as a source of energy, and it has been demonstrated that, perhaps paradoxically, glycogen resynthesis occurs while glycogen is being broken down (5Price T.B.

In contrast, the increased glucose uptake induced by exercise is wortmannin-insensitive, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (13Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goodyear L.J. Exercise Sport Sci. Rev. 2000; 28: 113-116PubMed Google Scholar) has been postulated to play an important role. The period following exercise is characterized by increased glucose uptake and net glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, a scenario similar to insulin stimulation of muscle. Despite the fact that the mechanism of GS activation in response to insulin has been extensively studied, the molecular details of both insulin and contraction-induced activation remain mostly unknown.Glycogen metabolism is controlled largely by the coordinated action of the two enzymes GS and glycogen phosphorylase (Ph). Both enzymes are controlled by covalent phosphorylation and by allosteric effectors (15Cohen P. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed.

GS undergoes a complex multisite phosphorylation at nine sites by several protein kinases (17Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Harris R.A. Jefferson L.S. Cherrington A.D.

Important regulatory phosphorylation sites are distributed between the NH2 (sites 2 and 2a) and the COOH termini (sites 3a and 3b) of the GS molecule (19Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F.

Full activity can be restored to phosphorylated enzyme by the presence of the allosteric activator glucose-6-P (G-6P). Ph is activated by phosphorylation of a single site by phosphorylase kinase (22Cohen P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 15: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The less active, dephosphorylated form (Ph b) acquires full activity in the presence of the allosteric effector AMP. Dephosphorylation of all three of these key regulatory proteins, GS, Ph, and phosphorylase kinase, is believed to be catalyzed primarily by glycogen-associated phosphatases (PP1Gs) (23Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The three forms of PP1G present in skeletal muscle consist of a catalytic subunit, PP1c, in association with a glycogen-targeting subunit, PTG, R6, or RGL (also called GM(24Newgard C.B.

However, the mechanism(s) of regulation of PTG and R6-associated phosphatases are completely unknown.The muscle-specific phosphatase PP1G/RGL, composed of PP1c associated with RGL (GM), dephosphorylates the regulatory sites on GS as well as on Ph and phosphorylase kinase (23Hubbard M.J.

Biochem. 1985; 149: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was thought to be regulated hormonally by phosphorylation of site 1 (Ser48) and site 2 (Ser67) on the RGL subunit (32Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P.

Phosphorylation of site 1 by the insulin-stimulated protein kinase p90Rsk would enhance association of PP1c to RGLand therefore activity toward GS and phosphorylase kinase (32Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).

These studies did not exclude the possibility that insulin could activate PP1G/RGL via other pathways. Our recent observations (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Jr., L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showed that RGL null mice have significant reductions in basal GS −/+ G-6P activity ratio and total activity and muscle glycogen content. However, RGL KO and wild type mice exhibited a similar 2-fold activation of GS in skeletal muscle in response to insulin stimulation. These studies clearly demonstrate that PP1G/RGL is not essential for the hormonal control. Instead a novel GS-specific insulin-stimulated type 1 phosphatase was detected (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Jr., L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that a distinct phosphatase form may be involved. A large body of evidence suggests that insulin activation of GS proceeds via the PI-3K/Akt pathway that leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3 (39Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

However, GSK-3 alone is not sufficient to account for GS dephosphorylation and activation by insulin (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mTOR, mammalian target for the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin, pathway is also activated by insulin. Rapamycin has been shown to block insulin-mediated activation of GS in muscle and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (35Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) without affecting insulin-induced inactivation of GSK-3 (42Cross D.A. Watt P.W. Shaw M. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Holder J.C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), opening the possibility that mTOR could control GS phosphorylation via a phosphatase. Therefore, insulin may promote glycogen synthesis both via inhibition of GSK-3 andstimulation of a type 1 phosphatase.Even though PP1G/RGL is not required for insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, it may be a component of the response to contractile activity. GS has been shown to be regulated differentially in skeletal muscle by insulin and contractions duringin vitro and in vivo studies (43Franch J. Aslesen R. Jensen J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44O'Gorman D.J. Del Aguila L.F. Williamson D.L. Krishnan R.K. Kirwan J.P. J. Appl.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24896-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with contractions and exercise resulting in a prolonged, substantially greater activation compared with maximal insulin treatment. This suggests that contractions may utilize a separate signaling pathway from insulin to activate GS in response to contractions. Changes in GS activity in human muscle biopsy samples obtained during isometric contractions are associated with changes in protein phosphatase activity (46Katz A. Raz I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 431: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but the identity of this enzyme has not been determined. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the low skeletal muscle glycogen content in RGL KO mice would lead to impaired exercise capacity and to investigate the role of PP1G/RGL in glycogen metabolism during muscle contraction. Our approach was to use two different models of exercise: in vivo treadmill running and in situ muscle contraction in mice that either overexpress or are deficient in the RGLsubunit. We demonstrate that GS activation is abolished in RGL KO mice during both in vivo and in situ models of exercise. This finding provides compelling evidence that PP1G/RGL is essential for activation of GS during exercise and may provide a mechanism to explain the reduced muscle glycogen content despite the normal insulin control of GS in the KO mice.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of the current investigation is that the marked increase in GS activity in skeletal muscle in response to both in vivo exercise and in situ electrically induced contraction is abolished in mice lacking the RGL, regulatory/glycogen-targeting subunit of PP1G. In exercised WT mice, the changes in GS activity state are accompanied by increased electrophoretic mobility of the protein, diagnostic of dephosphorylation. To date, the mechanism by which GS is activated during muscle contractions has not been elucidated. It is well known that the rate of glucose uptake is greatly increased in contracting skeletal muscle, which is associated with an accumulation of G-6P within the myoplasm (7Bloch G. Chase J.R. Meyer D.B. Avison M.J. Shulman G.I. Shulman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E85-E91PubMed Google Scholar). Increased G-6P concentration may provide a mechanism for regulating GS during exercise via its allosteric effect on activity and also by rendering GS more susceptible to dephosphorylation by phosphatases (55Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, GS was not activated in RGL KO mice despite the normal rates of basal and post-contraction glucose uptake compared with WT mice, suggesting that RGL mediates some other mechanism by which contraction induces GS activation. Decreased phosphorylation of GS could be due to decreased kinase activity, increased phosphatase activity, or both. Changes in GS activity in skeletal muscle biopsies from exercising humans have been associated with changes in the activity of a GS phosphatase (46Katz A. Raz I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 431: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, these studies were correlative, and the enzyme form was not identified. The results of the in vivoand in situ experiments with RGL KO mice provide the first direct evidence that PP1G/RGL is a phosphatase involved in the signaling cascade leading to activation of glycogen synthase during exercise and additionally demonstrate that it is an essential component of this control.PP1G/RGL was originally proposed to mediate insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle via the MAP kinase signaling pathway (32Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although subsequent studies using epidermal growth factor (35Azpiazu I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitors (36Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Goodyear L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) argued against an involvement of the MAP kinase signaling cascade, they did not exclude the possibility that PP1G/RGL mediated the insulin response. However, recent work (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Jr., L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrating normal activation of GS by insulin in RGL KO mice clearly showed that PP1G/RGL is not required. Furthermore, although insulin may increase phosphorylation of RGL at Ser48 and Ser67 in cultured cell systems (56Liu J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15940-15947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it does not affect phosphorylation at these sites in vivo either in rat (57Walker K.S. Watt P.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or mouse (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C.

Activation of GS by PP1G/RGLduring muscle contraction appears to be a mechanism that is not shared with the insulin signaling pathway, and insulin stimulation of GS appears to involve a distinct phosphatase specific for GS (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Jr., L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that insulin and exercise control glucose uptake by distinct mechanisms, mediated by IP-3K/Akt and AMPK, respectively. Therefore, in a similar way, insulin and contraction may stimulate GS through activation of different protein phosphatases. Whether RGL is a downstream effector of AMPK is an interesting question that is currently under investigation. However, other pathways, such as elevation of intracellular Ca2+concentration, cannot be excluded. It is unlikely that RGL is controlled by the MAP kinase pathway, since the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not alter contraction-induced increases in muscle glycogen synthase activity (58Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Dufresne S.D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C701-C707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although our data indicate that PP1G/RGL is an obligatory component of an exercise-activated signaling pathway that is not shared by insulin, we cannot exclude the involvement of other mechanisms to activate glycogen synthase during muscle contraction. Specific enzymes in such pathways could represent points of convergence between insulin and exercise signaling. For example, insulin activates a PI-3K/Akt-dependent pathway that inhibits GSK-3 (39Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar, 41Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (45Markuns J.F. Wojtaszewski J.F. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24896-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that both GSK-3α and -β isoforms are inhibited in rat skeletal muscle during treadmill exercise. However, as for insulin signaling, GSK-3 alone cannot account for GS activation, since modulation of activity requires changes in the phosphorylation of NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites that are not substrates for GSK-3 (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, GSK-3 expression is not altered in the RGL KO mice (38Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.-H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Jie Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Jr., L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is possible that exercise-induced inhibition of GSK-3 plays an ancillary role in activating GS, in a pathway shared with insulin. Further work is required to identify what upstream effectors regulate PP1G/RGL and GSK-3 during muscle contractions.Both the RGL-overexpressing and KO mice exhibit differences in basal muscle glycogen concentrations compared with their respective wild type littermates. The RGL-overexpressing animals have significantly increased glycogen, whereas glycogen is severely depleted in the KO mice. Analysis of GS and Ph activities in muscle extracts indicates that these differences are due to alterations in the rates of both synthesis and degradation. Overexpression of related phosphatase-targeting proteins, such as PTG, has been shown to promote glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes in culture (30Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39991-39995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), presumably by increasing phosphatase activity toward glycogen-bound substrates. Although a role for PTG in insulin control of glycogen metabolism has been proposed, our work indicates that PTG is not involved in regulation by contraction. Most importantly, the present study emphasizes the fact that the various forms of PP1G are not redundant since neither the PTG nor the R6 forms of PP1G complemented the inability of the RGL KO mice to activate GS in response to contraction. Also, the fact that RGL overexpression did not alter exercise performance or the ability to activate GS indicates that gene dosage is not a critical factor. Various reports (62Laurent D. Hundal R.S.

The myogenic helix loop helix (bHLH)1family of transcription factors (MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4) heterodimerize with ubiquitously expressed E proteins to bind a consensus E box found in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes (26Blackwell T.K.

MyoD and Myf5 are expressed in dividing myoblasts, which must exit the cell cycle for muscle-specific genes to be activated. Exit from the cell cycle is accomplished by the down-regulation of cyclins except for cyclin D3, which is up-regulated during muscle differentiation and contributes to cell cycle withdrawal (37Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 38Cenciarelli C. De Santa F. Puri P.L. Mattei E. Ricci L. Bucci F. Felsani A. Caruso M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5203-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MyoD activity can also promote cell cycle arrest by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21, which, along with the other members of the CIP1/KIP1 family, p57 and p27, inhibits a wide range of CDK enzymes (39Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 40Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The presence of p21 or p57 is essential for muscle differentiation during embryonic development in mice (42Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p21 can activate muscle gene expression even in high concentrations of serum (37Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The activity of cell cycle regulatory proteins is important for coordinating myogenesis with arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, however, muscle differentiation and cell cycle arrest are not concomitant events. Introduction of MyoD in transformed and tumor cell lines inhibits growth even when muscle-specific genes are not activated (43Crescenzi M. Fleming T.P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8442-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similarly, a MyoD construct in which the basic domain was substituted with the corresponding domain from the E12 transcription factor could inhibit growth but could not activate differentiation (44Sorrentino V. Pepperkok R. Davis R.L. Ansorge W. Philipson L. Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts is an ordered process such that expression of myogenin precedes expression of p21, which is then followed by activation of the muscle structural genes with the subsequent appearance of the contractile phenotype and lastly cell fusion. Induction of p21 correlates with the postmitotic state and failure to reinitiate DNA synthesis upon stimulation with growth factors (45Andrés V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Expression of Rb is also up-regulated by MyoD and is critical for both activation of muscle-specific gene expression and cell cycle withdrawal. Rb activates the MEF2 factors that are necessary for expression of the muscle-specific genes, and it prevents cell cycle progression by repressing the E2F family of transcription factors (46Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Kim P.S. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The activity of Rb in turn is modulated by the cyclins and their CDK partners. Recent work has demonstrated that the ATPase chromatin remodeling activity of SWI/SNF is required for Rb-mediated repression of cyclin A and possibly cyclin E and arrest in the G1phase of the cell cycle (47Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 48Strobeck M.W. Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. DeCristoforo M.F. Weissman B.E. Imbalzano A.N. Knudsen E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7748-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Activation of myogenesis also involves the reorganization of repressive chromatin structure on previously silent muscle-specific loci and requires SWI/SNF enzymes. Expression of dominant negative versions of the mammalian SWI/SNF ATPase subunits, BRG1 and BRM, abolished the ability of MyoD to activate transcription of two muscle-specific genes, myogenin and myosin heavy chain. Inhibition of myogenin gene expression was correlated with suppression of chromatin remodeling in the myogenin promoter region (22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes during muscle differentiation, we looked at the effects of dominant negative BRG1 and BRM on expression of a number of other skeletal muscle markers and cell cycle regulatory proteins. We found that, in the absence of functional SWI/SNF, MyoD can promote normal cell cycle regulation but not the expression of skeletal muscle markers. Although MyoD-mediated cell cycle arrest is coordinated with activation of muscle-specific genes, the two processes are temporally separable. We show here that at least one basis for the distinct mechanisms that regulate cessation of cell proliferation and muscle-specific gene expression is that SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling is required specifically for the induction of muscle-specific genes. Cells were grown as previously described (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Dominant negative BRG1 and BRM expression were induced by passing cells in media lacking tetracycline and differentiated as described (22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Isolation of proteins and Western blotting were as described previously (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J.

Antibodies against the FLAG epitope, p27, cyclin A, cyclin E (M20), Rb (C15), and rel B were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-cyclin D1 and D3 antibodies were from PharMingen/Signal Transduction Laboratories. Total cellular RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For Northern analysis, 10–20 µg of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred to Nytran Plus (Schleicher and Schuell). The membranes were baked for 2 h and prehybridized for at least 2 h at 42 °C in 6× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA (not boiled). The buffer was then changed to 6× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mmNaPO4, pH 6.8, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm (which was first boiled with a32P-labeled probe generated by random priming), and membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Probes for myogenin and myosin heavy chain were described previously (22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A 1.7-kbXhoI restriction fragment was used to detect p21, a 0.7-kbEcoRI restriction fragment was used to detect myosin light chain, a 0.9-kb PstI restriction fragment was used to detect troponin T, and a 700-bp EcoRI-HindIII restriction fragment was used to detect glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Blots were washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature then in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, and were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and analyzed with ImageQuaNT. Total RNA (1 µg) was reversed-transcribed with Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a random hexamer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (49Valdez M.R. Richardson J.A. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 2 µl of cDNA was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (Promega) (1 cycle: 95 °C for 5 min, 23 cycles: 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s). Primers for MyoD, α-skeletal actin, desmin, and MEF2C with the sizes of the corresponding PCR products were described (49Valdez M.R. Richardson J.A. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For p57, a 359-bp PCR product was amplified using 5′-ATCCAGACGCAGGAGCCGTCCATCA-3′ and 5′-CCGGCGGCCCAGAACGCGGGATGA-3′. A 500-bp HPRT PCR product was amplified with 5′-GTTCTTTGCTGACCTGCTGGAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGCCACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′. For Rb, a 410-bp PCR product was amplified with 5′-CTTGGCTAACTTGGGAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATCTTCCATCTGTAATACTT-3′. PCR conditions for Rb were slightly different (1 cycle: 95 °C for 5 min, 23 cycles: 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Cells were grown and differentiated as described (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and then fixed as described (50Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of propidium iodide was determined by flow cytometry. Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes contain either the Brm or Brg1 ATPase subunit. When overexpressed in cells, BRM or BRG1 with mutations in the ATPase domains act as dominant negatives and have been shown to inhibit gene activation events that normally require SWI/SNF function. Stable cell lines in which the genes encoding FLAG-tagged dominant negative BRM or BRG1 placed under control of the Tet-VP16 activator were previously described (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 96 h then infected with a retrovirus containing the MyoD gene and forced to differentiate in low serum conditions. In the presence of tetracycline, when dominant negative BRM or BRG1 is not expressed, the expression of two muscle-specific genes, myosin heavy chain and myogenin, was activated. However, when these cells were differentiated in the absence of tetracycline, dominant negative BRM and BRG1 inhibited activation of these muscle-specific markers (22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This indicated that SWI/SNF complexes play an important role in muscle differentiation. To determine how extensively SWI/SNF is required for muscle differentiation, we looked at the effect of dominant negative BRG1 and BRM expression on a number of muscle-specific genes. Fig.1A is a Northern analysis showing muscle-specific gene expression in H17 cells, which inducibly express dominant negative hBRM, and B22 cells, which inducibly express dominant negative BRG1. We observed that myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, and troponin T gene expression was induced by MyoD when cells were grown and differentiated in the presence of tetracycline. When cells were grown and differentiated in the absence of tetracycline, dominant negative protein expression inhibited activation of these genes. Activation of these muscle-specific markers was not inhibited when a control Tet-VP16 cell line, which expresses only the Tet-VP16 activator, was grown and differentiated in the absence of tetracycline. Interestingly, expression of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was up-regulated during myogenesis but was not affected by dominant negative BRM and BRG1. RT-PCR of two additional muscle-specific markers shows that α-skeletal actin and desmin expression is also inhibited by dominant negative BRM and BRG1 (Fig. 1B). The levels of FLAG-tagged dominant negative BRM and BRG1 expression in this experiment were detected by Western analysis (Fig. 1C). Muscle differentiation involves the activity of the myogenic bHLH family of transcription factors, which heterodimerize with E proteins to bind E boxes on the promoters of muscle-specific genes, and the MEF2 family of transcription factors, which bind AT-rich sequences on these promoters. We previously showed that myogenin expression is induced by MyoD and inhibited by expression of dominant negative BRM and BRG1 in H17 and B22 cell lines, respectively (Fig.2A and Ref. 22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Fig.2B shows the expression levels of the other bHLH factors and MEF2C. RT-PCR detected Myf5 and MRF4 in C2C12 myotubes but showed that they were not induced by MyoD in our NIH 3T3 fibroblast-derived cells. Introduction of MyoD into 10T1/2 fibroblasts also does not induce expression of Myf5 or MRF4 (51Montarras D. Chelly J. Bober E. Arnold H. Ott M.O. Gros F. Pinset C. New Biol. 1991; 3: 592-600PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of MyoD does not activate the endogenous MyoD gene in NIH 3T3 cells (52Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), therefore, MyoD levels were constant in the presence or absence of dominant negative BRM and BRG1. Although levels of MEF2C expression in our cell lines is much lower than in C2C12 myoblasts, MEF2C was up-regulated during myogenesis in the presence of tetracycline when dominant negative BRM or BRG1 was not expressed and was not activated in the presence of the dominant negative proteins (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that SWI/SNF plays an extensive role in MyoD-mediated myogenesis and is critical for the expression of muscle-specific regulatory and structural proteins. Terminal cell cycle arrest is closely coupled to muscle differentiation and is required for activation of muscle-specific gene expression. To determine if SWI/SNF plays a role in cell cycle withdrawal, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to test the ability of cells to cell cycle arrest when differentiated in the presence or absence of dominant negative BRM or BRG1. DNA content was measured by propidium iodide staining to determine the number of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Dominant negative BRM and BRG1 did not affect the ability of cells expressing MyoD to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig.3). Interestingly, even the mock differentiated cells, which received no MyoD, arrested regardless of whether functional SWI/SNF complexes were present. Under the in vitro differentiation protocol, both the differentiated and mock differentiated cells became confluent in growth medium and then were subjected to an additional 36 h in low serum conditions. The results indicate that cell cycle arrest under such conditions does not require functional SWI/SNF complexes. These data differ from other reports that have shown that SWI/SNF complexes were required for pRb-mediated cell cycle arrest (47Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 48Strobeck M.W. Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. DeCristoforo M.F. Weissman B.E. Imbalzano A.N. Knudsen E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7748-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In those studies, proliferating cells expressing alleles of pRb that could not be phosphorylated, and thus, are constitutively active, did not become arrested unless functional BRG1 was present. Similar results were obtained when the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p16/ink4a was expressed. In addition, proliferating cells expressing dominant negative BRG1 did not become arrested when treated with cisplatin, a DNA-damaging agent, whereas cisplatin treatment of proliferating cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (dominant negative off) did undergo cell cycle arrest. Clearly, the experiments presented in Fig. 3 differ methodologically from those described in earlier reports. We suggest that, although BRG1 and SWI/SNF complexes are required for cell cycle arrest under some conditions, they are not required universally. To further address the role of SWI/SNF complexes in MyoD-mediated cell cycle withdrawal and muscle differentiation, we looked more closely at whether dominant negative BRM and BRG1 affect the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins. One class of cell cycle regulators, the CDK inhibitors, is generally up-regulated during cell differentiation and may play a general role in promoting and maintaining the terminally differentiated phenotype by binding to and inactivating cyclin-CDK complexes (reviewed in Ref. 53Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The CIP1/KIP1 family includes p21, p57, and p27, all of which have been implicated in cell cycle withdrawal during muscle differentiation. p21 and p57 mRNAs are both induced during differentiation in C2C12 cells, and the presence of one of the two genes is required for myogenesis in mice (42Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 54Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 55Zabludoff S.D. Csete M. Wagner R., Yu, X. Wold B.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that MyoD strongly induced p21 expression and that dominant negative BRM or BRG1 had no effect on its expression (Fig.4A). RT-PCR showed that p57 mRNA was not expressed in our cells (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with previous reports that showed p57 is not activated by MyoD in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (54Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). p27 protein levels were similar in mock and MyoD-differentiated cells and also were unaffected by expression of dominant negative BRM or BRG1 (Fig. 4C). High levels of p27 have been associated with density arrest during adipocyte differentiation (56Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In our cell lines, both mock and MyoD-differentiated cells are confluent and so accumulate similar levels of p27. Cyclin levels are generally down-regulated during differentiation. One exception is cyclin D3, which was previously shown to be transcriptionally up-regulated during muscle differentiation and which contributes to irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle by forming inactive complexes with unphosphorylated Rb, cdk4, p21, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (38Cenciarelli C. De Santa F. Puri P.L. Mattei E. Ricci L. Bucci F. Felsani A. Caruso M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5203-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore looked at whether dominant negative BRM and BRG1 could inhibit induction of cyclin D3 during muscle differentiation by MyoD. Fig.5A shows that cyclin D3 protein levels were up-regulated by MyoD during differentiation in the presence or absence of tetracycline. Cyclin E levels during differentiation can vary depending on cell type and the presence of extracellular factors (reviewed in Ref. 57Gao C.Y. Zelenka P.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In differentiated C2C12 cells, cyclin E was reported both to remain constant and to decline and to associate with p21 to form inactive complexes during differentiation (39Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 58Mal A. Chattopadhyay D. Ghosh M.K. Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Harter M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 59Jahn L. Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In our experiments, cyclin E protein levels were higher in MyoD-differentiated cells than in mock differentiated or proliferating cells and were unaffected by expression of dominant negative BRM and BRG1 (Fig. 5A). The increase in cyclin E levels may reflect increased protein stability due to the increase in p21 levels. The hypophosphorylated state of Rb in these cells (Fig.5C) suggests the cyclin E is inactive. Our results indicate that SWI/SNF complexes are not required for the normal expression of the CIP1/KIP1 CDK inhibitors or cyclins D3 or E under these differentiation conditions. MyoD activates expression of muscle-specific markers and cell cycle regulators to coordinate differentiation with cell cycle arrest. However, dominant negative BRM and BRG1 only inhibit activation of the muscle-specific genes, suggesting that the induction of differentiation is distinct from the induction of cell cycle arrest. The MyoD-mediated induction of p21 and cyclin D3 may be an explanation for the ability of these cells to arrest when functional SWI/SNF enzymes are compromised. Cyclin D1, in association with cdk4, plays a key role in progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle; thus, the levels of cyclin D1are down-regulated during muscle differentiation. Forced expression of cyclin D1 is correlated with phosphorylation of MyoD and inhibition of muscle-specific gene activation (37, reviewed in Ref.57Gao C.Y. Zelenka P.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 was present at low to undetectable levels in both mock and MyoD-differentiated cells in the presence or absence of dominant negative BRM or BRG1 expression. The levels in these growth-arrested cells is contrasted to the higher levels present in proliferating cells (Fig. 5A). Cyclin A is also down-regulated when cells exit the cell cycle, and its forced expression results in phosphorylation of pRb and in inhibition of muscle differentiation (60Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig.5A shows that cyclin A levels were low during growth arrest, even in the presence of the dominant negative proteins. Rb-mediated down-regulation of cyclin A during cell cycle arrest requires BRG1 (47Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

However, our data demonstrate that in both the mock differentiated as well as the MyoD-differentiated cells, cyclin A is down-regulated even in the presence of non-functional SWI/SNF enzymes. As discussed above, this suggests that the requirement for SWI/SNF complexes during cell cycle arrest induced by different experimental conditions is not absolute. Instead, the multiple signals received by confluent cells placed under low serum conditions may overcome or bypass the need for SWI/SNF enzymes during exit from the cell cycle. In conclusion, it appears that there are likely to be multiple mechanisms for achieving cell cycle withdrawal, some of which do not require SWI/SNF-remodeling enzymes. Rb has been shown to interact with MyoD and to promote muscle gene activation and cell cycle arrest (61Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Rb has also been demonstrated to interact with BRM and BRG1 and has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and induction of gene expression by the glucocorticoid receptor (7Singh P. Coe J. Hong W.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In C2C12 cells, MyoD up-regulates Rb gene expression (64Martelli F. Cenciarelli C. Santarelli G. Polikar B. Felsani A. Caruso M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3579-3590PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of Rb is also regulated during the cell cycle and during differentiation. Cells in G1 contain mostly the hypophosphorylated form whereas cells approaching S phase accumulate the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. Cells lacking Rb are competent for induction of early differentiation markers and for cell cycle arrest but fail to induce late muscle-specific marker genes (65Novitch B.G. Mulligan G.J. Jacks T. Lassar A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We therefore examined Rb mRNA and protein levels in MyoD-differentiated cells. Fig. 5Bshows that Rb mRNA levels were induced in the MyoD-differentiated cells and that dominant negative BRM and BRG1 did not inhibit activation. Fig. 5C shows that the corresponding increase in pRb protein levels and the phosphorylation state of Rb in MyoD-differentiated cells also were not affected by dominant negative BRM or BRG1. Withdrawal from the cell cycle during myogenesis is intricately coordinated with activation of muscle-specific gene expression, yet the two events are separable. Here, we demonstrate that functional SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are required for the induction of muscle-specific regulators and structural genes but are not required to induce the expression of a number of cell cycle regulators associated with cell cycle arrest. Thus cells expressing non-functional SWI/SNF complexes can withdraw from the cell cycle upon MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation. Existing data suggests that muscle regulatory factors and cell cycle regulators cooperate to promote muscle differentiation. In most models, MyoD and/or Myf5 stimulate the expression of “early” differentiation markers such as myogenin, MEF2, and p21. This step in the differentiation process promotes cell cycle withdrawal and can occur in the absence of Rb (65Novitch B.G. Mulligan G.J. Jacks T. Lassar A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, additional functions mediated by Rb, including activating the transcriptional competence of the MEF2 activators, help promote the induction of “late” differentiation markers (46Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Kim P.S. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The involvement of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes during MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation does not appear specific for either the early or late differentiation events. Instead, we suggest that the requirement for SWI/SNF complexes is likely traced to its enzymatic properties that enable it to alter chromatin structure. Genes that are inactive or that require remodeling of chromatin at or near promoter sequences to be up-regulated will be dependent on SWI/SNF enzymes for expression during muscle differentiation. In contrast, genes that are up-regulated without requiring ATP-dependent structural changes in chromatin at or near promoter sequences will be independent of the function of SWI/SNF and related enzymes. According to this hypothesis, we would predict that genes that are inactive prior to muscle differentiation, such as myogenin, muscle heavy and light chains, troponin T, desmin, and α-actin, would require SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling to induce gene expression. In fact, we have previously shown that failure to induce myogenin expression in the absence of functional SWI/SNF complexes correlates with inhibition of chromatin remodeling at the endogenous myogenin promoter (22de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Additionally, we would predict that a gene such as MEF2C, which is on in undifferentiated and mock differentiated cells but is up-regulated in MyoD-differentiated cells, would also require SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling of its promoter structure for expression to be induced. In contrast, our hypothesis predicts that up-regulation of p21, cyclin D3, and Rb does not involve SWI/SNF-mediated changes in promoter structure. A schematic model indicating the SWI/SNF dependence of different steps leading to muscle differentiation is presented in Fig.6. Analysis of the endogenous promoter structure of these and other genes, before and after differentiation and in the presence and absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes, should permit us to directly test our hypothesis.

In contrast, the physiological function of Rap2, a close relative of Rap1, remains largely unknown. Diverse effectors for Rap1, almost all of which are common to Ras effectors, have been identified, although their roles in individual signaling pathways remain obscure. For activation of the effectors, the interaction of the effector region of Rap1 (amino acids 32–40) with the Ras/Rap1-binding or RA1 domain of the effectors is important (3Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, the second Ras/Rap1-binding site identified in several Ras/Rap1 effectors, including Raf-1, B-Raf, and yeast adenylyl cyclase, is required for proper effector activation (4Hu C.-D.

Suppression of Ki-Ras-induced transformation by overexpressed Rap1 is thought to be ascribed to tight binding to the second Ras/Rap1-binding sites of Ras effectors such as Raf-1 without stimulating their activities (5Hu C.-D.

Ras family GTPases cycle between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states, serving as a molecular switch of intracellular signaling (8Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

Conversion between GTP- and GDP-bound states is controlled by GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (8Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

Particularly, GEFs enhance the formation of the GTP-bound active conformation in response to upstream signals mediated by various cell surface receptors. To date, various GEFs for Rap1 have been identified in mammalian cells. C3G binds to the adaptor protein Crk, being involved in tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of Rap1(10). Epac/cAMP-GEF is activated through direct association with cAMP, thereby stimulating Rap-dependent signaling (11de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A.

Another Rap GEF, CalDAGGEF1, which contains calcium- and diacylglycerol-binding motifs, has a role in Rap activation in response to these second messengers (13Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S.

Additionally, we and other groups recently identified a novel type of the Rap GEF, RA-GEF-1 (also termed PDZ-GEF1, nRapGEP, or CNrasGEF), which exhibits GEF activity toward Rap1 and Rap2, but not Ha-Ras (14Liao Y.

The RA domain of RA-GEF-1 binds to Rap1·GTP, suggesting that RA-GEF-1 plays an important role downstream of Rap1 as well (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y.

Indeed, the RA domain is required for translocation of RA-GEF-1 to the perinuclear compartments including the Golgi complex and for the full activation of Rap1, as evidenced by our recent observation that an RA domain mutation that abolishes Rap1 binding compromised RA-GEF-1-dependent activation of Rap1 in vivo(18Liao Y.

Herein, we describe a novel member of the RA-GEF family, designated RA-GEF-2, whose structural features are intimately related to RA-GEF-1. Like RA-GEF-1, RA-GEF-2 exhibits GEF activity toward Rap1 and Rap2, but not Ha-Ras. However, unlike RA-GEF-1, the RA domain of RA-GEF-2 specifically binds to M-Ras·GTP, which causes the translocation of RA-GEF-2 to the plasma membrane, where M-Ras exists. Correspondingly, activation of Rap1 that localized in the plasma membrane was observed following coexpression of RA-GEF-2 and activated M-Ras. A genomic clone (AC004227) that encodes an open reading frame whose predicted amino acid sequence is highly homologous to RA-GEF-1 was identified through a search of the GenBank™ data base with the BLAST program. The predicted partial coding sequence inAC004227 was amplified from a cDNA library synthesized from human fetal brain mRNA (Invitrogen) using two gene-specific primers. Upstream and downstream sequences were obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE using the same library by a Marathon cDNA amplification procedure (CLONTECH). The complete nucleotide sequence was confirmed by isolating and sequencing multiple clones, and the encoded protein was designated RA-GEF-2. The full-length RA-GEF-2 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) and pcDNA3.1HisB (Invitrogen), generating pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-2 and pcDNA3.1HisB-RA-GEF-2, respectively. The cDNA for RA-GEF-2ΔRA, RA-GEF-2 lacking the N-terminal portion of the RA domain (amino acids 749–779), was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2, generating pFLAG-CMV2-GEF-2ΔRA. cDNAs for EGFP-tagged RA-GEF-2 and RA-GEF-2ΔRA were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV2, generating pCMV2-EGFP-GEF-2 and pCMV2-EGFP-RA-GEF-2ΔRA, respectively. cDNAs for wild-type and activated M-Ras were subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2, generating pFLAG-CMV2-M-Ras and pFLAG-CMV2-M-Ras71L, respectively. The cDNA for HA-tagged M-Ras71L was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (19Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), generating pEF-BOS-HA-M-Ras71L. The cDNA for R-Ras was kindly provided by Shintaro Iwashita (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expression plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells by using GenePORTER (Gene Therapy System) or Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A human adult multiple tissue blot membrane containing 2 μg each of poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues (CLONTECH) was probed with a32P-radiolabeled RNA probe (specific activity = 5 × 107 cpm/μg) corresponding to RA-GEF-1 (nucleotides 3450–4500) or RA-GEF-2 (nucleotides 3425–4384) under stringent conditions. A FLAG-tagged RA-GEF-2 fragment (amino acids 403–1276), designated FLAG-RA-GEF-2-(403–1276), was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells and affinity-purified with anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma). Ras family small GTPases except Ha-Ras and Rap1A were expressed in Escherichia coli as 6×His-tagged proteins and purified with TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH). Ha-Ras and Rap1A were purified from Sf9 cells as previously described (4Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

The reaction was terminated by adding ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The reaction mixture was subjected to the filter binding assay (14Liao Y. Kariya K.

For GTP-binding assays, small GTPases preloaded with GDP were incubated with FLAG-RA-GEF-2-(403–1276) in the presence of [35S]GTPγS (12,000 cpm/pmol), and [35S]GTPγS bound to the GTPases was quantitated as described above. Post-translationally modified FLAG-tagged M-Ras was purified from COS-7 cells as follows. COS-7 cells transfected with pFLAG-CMV2-M-Ras were sonicated in sonication buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended and incubated for 1 h on ice in sonication buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The 15,000 × gsupernatant was subjected to affinity purification of FLAG-M-Ras using anti-FLAG M2 resin. For examining the effect of M-Ras on GEF activity of RA-GEF-2 toward Rap1A in vitro, 6×His-M-Ras (purified from E. coli) or FLAG-M-Ras (purified from COS-7 cells) was preloaded with GTPγS and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with full-length FLAG-RA-GEF-2 purified from Sf9 cells. Subsequently, the mixture was added to 4 pmol of [3H]GDP-preloaded Rap1A at a total volume of 200 μl, and GEF assays were performed as described above. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-2 and either pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1A (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y.

After transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then serum-starved for another 16 h. After serum starvation, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 15 min) and subjected to pull-down assays by the use of GST-RalGDS-RID (for Rap1A) or GST-Raf-1-RBD (for Ha-Ras). GTP-bound forms of HA-Rap1A and HA-Ha-Ras were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting by using anti-HA antibody (12CA5,Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Rap1A- or Ha-Ras-bound GDP/GTP ratios were measured essentially as described (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T.

Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1HisB-RA-GEF-2 and either pFLAG-CMV2-Rap1A (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G.

After serum starvation, cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (7.4 MBq/ml of culture medium) for 4 h. FLAG-Rap1A and FLAG-Ha-Ras were immunoprecipitated from cleared cell lysates with anti-FLAG M2 resin and eluted with the FLAG peptide (Sigma). Guanine nucleotides bound to FLAG-Rap1A and FLAG-Ha-Ras were released by heating the eluate at 68 °C for 20 min in denaturing buffer (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T.

Radioactivities of GDP and GTP spots were quantified by using the BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). For analyzing the effect of M-Ras on GEF activity of RA-GEF-2 toward Rap1A in vivo, COS-7 cells were transfected with a combination of pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1A, pFLAG-CMV2-M-Ras71L, and either pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-2 or pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-2ΔRA by using the GenePORTER transfection reagent. In vivo GEF activity was detected by pull-down assays as described above. Polypeptides corresponding to the RA domains and their flanking regions of RA-GEF-2 (amino acids 683–853) and RA-GEF-2ΔRA (amino acids 683–822) were expressed as MBP fusion proteins (MBP-RAWT and MBP-RAMUT, respectively) in E. coli by using pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs). The interaction of the RA domain of RA-GEF-2 with Ras family small GTPases was assessed essentially as described previously (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y.

Small GTPases (6 pmol) preloaded with GTPγS or GDP were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with MBP-RAWT or MBP-RAMUT(50 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 100 μl of binding buffer (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

After extensive washing with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted from the resin with 10 mm maltose and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Ha-Ras and Rap1A were detected with anti-Ha-Ras antibody (F235, Oncogene Science Inc.) and anti-Rap1A antibody (sc-65, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Other GTPases were detected with anti-6×His antibody (CLONTECH). For quantitative in vitro association assays, 6×His-M-Ras was loaded with [35S]GTPγS (3, 500 cpm/pmol) or [3H]GDP (1, 100 cpm/pmol) and incubated with MBP-RAWT (25 pmol) as described above except that unlabeled GTPγS or GDP (0.1 mm), respectively, was included in the binding reaction. Radioactivities eluted from amylose resin with 10 mmmaltose were counted. COS-7 cells cultivated in 20 culture plates (100-mm diameter) were harvested by centrifugation (600 × g for 5 min) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of the plasma membrane fraction was performed essentially as described (21Hubbard A.L. Wall D.A. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25m STM (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized using a PotterElvehjem homogenizer, and centrifuged at 280 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m STM. 2m STM (2 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2) was added to adjust the sucrose concentration to 1.42 m. The suspension was transferred to a centrifugation tube and overlaid with 0.25m STM. After centrifugation (82,000 × gfor 1 h), the pellicle at the 0.25 m/1.42m interface was collected, resuspended in 0.25m STM, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The final pellet (the plasma membrane fraction) was resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer and subjected to the pull-down assay. Alkaline phosphodiesterase (a marker enzyme for the plasma membrane) and mannosidase II (a marker enzyme for the Golgi apparatus) activities were determined as described by Storrie and Madden (22Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) to estimate the purity of the fractions. COS-7 cells cultured in two-well slide chambers (Nalge Nunc) were transfected with expression plasmids by using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h and then serum-starved for another 18 h. Following fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were stained with mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (T2762, Molecular Probes) antibody. Localization of HA-M-Ras71L, HA-Ha-Ras12V, EGFP-Rap1A, EGFP-RA-GEF-2, and EGFP-RA-GEF-2ΔRA was examined under a confocal laser microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Through a BLAST search of the GenBank data base, we identified a genomic clone (AC004227) encoding an open reading frame closely related to RA-GEF-1, designated RA-GEF-2. Two gene-specific primers designed on the basis of the AC004227 sequence were employed to isolate a partial cDNA clone encoding RA-GEF-2. Subsequently, the full-length cDNA was reconstructed from 5′- and 3′-RACE products obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The putative start codon matched the Kozak consensus sequence and was preceded by in-frame stop codons. The full-length open reading frame was composed of 4,530 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1,509 amino acids, and was divided into four contiguous genomic clones (AC005218,AC005576, AC004227, and AC004622 from the N terminus to the C terminus) derived from chromosome 5. RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-2 were highly homologous in five domains identified by ISREC ProfileScan (76.2, 80.0, 71.4, 81.6, and 85.9% identity in cNMP-binding, REM, PDZ, RA, and GEF domains, respectively), whereas both N-terminal and C-terminal regions were rather divergent (Fig. 1). Three regions (named structurally conserved regions 1–3), which are highly conserved among diverse Ras/Rap GEFs, were also identified in the GEF domain of RA-GEF-2 (Fig. 1 C). Compared with RA-GEF-1, RA-GEF-2 has 145-amino acid extension at its N terminus, but lacks the C-terminal 102 amino acid residues. In particular, the C-terminal region was least homologous (47.5% identity). We next examined mRNA levels for RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-2 in various human tissues using a multiple tissue blot membrane (Fig. 2). Probes derived from divergent regions were used under stringent hybridization conditions to compare the distribution of the transcripts. A single band of ∼8 kilobases was detected for both probes. The RA-GEF-2 transcript was abundant in heart, brain, placenta, lung, and liver, but barely detectable in skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, whereas RA-GEF-1 was expressed in all tissues tested. A FLAG-tagged RA-GEF-2 fragment (amino acids 403–1276) containing the GEF domain was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to near homogeneity. By using this protein, in vitro GEF activities toward various Ras family proteins were examined. RA-GEF-2 showed GEF activity toward Rap1A and Rap2A, but not toward other Ras family members including Ha-Ras, N-Ras, M-Ras, R-Ras, RalA, Rin, Rit, and Rheb, as determined by [3H]GDP-releasing assays (Fig. 3 A). [35S]GTPγS-binding assays were also performed for Rap1A and Rap2A, revealing that GEF activity toward Rap2A was higher than that toward Rap1A (Fig. 3 B). Next, in vivo GEF activities of RA-GEF-2 toward Rap1A and Ha-Ras were examined by pull-down assays (Fig. 3 C). Rap1A·GTP and Ha-Ras·GTP were affinity-precipitated by GST-RalGDS-RID and GST-Raf-1-RBD, respectively, from COS-7 cells that expressed increasing amounts of RA-GEF-2 and either Rap1A or Ha-Ras, and then were detected by immunoblotting. In parallel with the in vitro activity, RA-GEF-2 caused the accumulation of Rap1A·GTP, but not Ha-Ras·GTP. RA-GEF-2-dependent increase in the level of Rap1A·GTP, but not Ha-Ras·GTP, was also shown by measuring the ratio of Rap1A- or Ha-Ras-bound GDP and GTP (Fig. 3 D). Collectively, RA-GEF-2, like RA-GEF-1, acts as a specific GEF for Rap1 and Rap2. The RA domain of RA-GEF-1 binds to Rap1A in a GTP-dependent manner (14Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37815-37820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RA domain of RA-GEF-2 may also bind to Rap1A·GTP. To test this possibility, we employed in vitroassociation assays using an MBP fusion construct, named MBP-RAWT, consisting of the RA domain and its flanking region of RA-GEF-2. Unexpectedly, MBP-RAWT bound to Rap1A only weakly compared with the binding of the RA-GEF-1 RA domain, and this binding was GTP-independent (Fig. 4 A). Thus, we next examined the binding activity of MBP-RAWT to a variety of Ras family proteins. Among Ras family members tested, only M-Ras associated with MBP-RAWT in a GTP-dependent manner, and virtually no binding was detected for other Ras family proteins, such as Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Rap2A, R-Ras, RalA, Rin, Rit, and Rheb (Fig. 4 A). Quantitative analyses further confirmed that the association between MBP-RAWT and M-Ras was dose- and GTP-dependent (Fig. 4 B). Additionally, the binding of M-Ras·GTP was abolished when a 31-amino acid deletion was introduced within the RA domain, suggesting that these highly conserved residues are crucial (Fig. 4 C). RA-GEF-1 is translocated to the perinuclear compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, upon interaction with Rap1A·GTP (18Liao Y. Satoh T. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Hu C.-D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28478-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thereafter, RA-GEF-1 serves as an amplifier of Rap1A signaling by yielding the GTP-bound form of Rap1A through the action of the GEF domain (18Liao Y. Satoh T. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Hu C.-D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28478-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In view of the observations that the RA domain of RA-GEF-2, unlike that of RA-GEF-1, specifically binds to M-Ras·GTP, it is feasible that RA-GEF-2 colocalizes with M-Ras in the cell and plays a role downstream of M-Ras. As an initial step to clarify this point, localization of Rap1A, M-Ras, and RA-GEF-2 was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Although Rap1A was localized mainly in the perinuclear region as reported previously (23Beranger F. Goud B. Tav"

Insertion of Lhcb1 into thylakoids requires nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), stromal SRP, FtsY, and a thylakoid translocase minimally composed of Albino3 (Alb3) (10Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K.

Post-translational formation of a SRP/Lhcb1 targeting complex requires a hydrophobic domain along with a novel SRP-binding element in Lhcb1, termed the L18 domain, which is found only in members of the LHC protein family (14DeLille J.

Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggest that SRP is again used primarily to direct membrane proteins to the thylakoid membrane.For many years it was believed that other membrane proteins, in both bacteria and chloroplasts, were targeted by unassisted or “spontaneous” insertion pathways, in which the protein inserted directly into the bilayer without the aid of other protein factors. The best characterized example was M13 phage coat protein, which inserts into the Escherichia coli plasma membrane. This protein is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide, which assists insertion into the bilayer after which it is cleaved by leader peptidase (reviewed in Ref. 17Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor (procoat) does not interact with either the Sec machinery or SRP. A second protein, Pf3 coat protein, was also shown to insert by an SRP/Sec-independent mechanism that was presumed to be another example of spontaneous integration (18Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although Pf3 coat, unlike M13 procoat, does not contain a cleavable signal peptide.More recently the critical role of a novel family of targeting factor has come to light. The first member characterized was yeast Oxa1p that is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and that is important for the insertion of a range of membrane proteins from the matrix side (19Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A related protein, Alb3, is essential for the insertion of the SRP-dependent Lhcb1 protein in thylakoids (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and theE. coli homologue YidC has been shown recently to be equally important for the biogenesis of SRP substrates in this organism (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, Samuelson et al. (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) made the important discovery that YidC is also essential for the insertion of M13 procoat, indicating a much wider role in membrane protein biogenesis. A possible model is that one population of SecYEG-bound YidC is used in the insertion of SRP substrates, whereas a separate pool acts as its own translocon for the insertion of SRP/Sec-independent substrates such as procoat.M13 procoat and Pf3 coat protein are some of the few known SRP/Sec-independent membrane proteins in E. coli, but studies on thylakoids have revealed a surprising number of such proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several of these proteins, such as CFoII, PsbW, and PsbX, are single-span proteins that are synthesized with cleavable signal peptides but are nevertheless inserted by SRP/Sec-independent mechanisms (23Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A.

Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PsbY is exceptional in containing two signal peptides that are cleaved several times after insertion to yield two single-span mature proteins (26Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other multispanning proteins (that are not synthesized with signal-type peptides) have also been shown to insert SRP/Sec independently despite being related to the strictly SRP-dependent Lhcb1 protein (27Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The lack of requirement for SRP, Sec apparatus, or any energy source raised the possibility of a spontaneous insertion mechanism for these proteins.Whereas SRP and the Sec apparatus are not involved in the insertion of most thylakoid proteins studied to date, the overall role of Alb3 has remained unclear because only Lhcb1 has been tested for Alb3 requirement (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because YidC is required for the efficient insertion of every E. coli membrane protein tested (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), we have sought to examine the global role of Alb3 in the insertion of distinct classes of thylakoid membrane protein, with particular emphasis on the PsbW-type proteins that so closely resemble M13 procoat. We have identified two further substrates for Alb3, both of which are LHC proteins, but we show that Alb3 is not required for the insertion of any SRP-independent protein analyzed to date, including several that are synthesized with cleavable signal peptides. These data indicate fundamental differences in the requirements for membrane protein insertion in E. coli and thylakoid membranes.DISCUSSIONThe depletion of YidC in E. coli is rapidly followed by dramatic adverse effects on the insertion of every membrane protein analyzed to date, including one considered for decades to insert spontaneously (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Disruption of the oxa1 gene in yeast likewise leads to a severe inhibition of membrane protein insertion from the matrix side (19Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the only chloroplast protein studied in terms of Alb3 dependence, Lhcb1, was found to be very reliant on this factor for insertion into thylakoids (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These findings point to a major role for Oxa1-type proteins in these membrane systems, but we have sought to analyze the global role of Alb3 in thylakoids by studying its role in the biogenesis of a variety of membrane protein types (including assisted and spontaneous substrates) under identical circumstances.We have first shown that Alb3 antibodies almost totally block the insertion of Lhcb4.1 and Lhcb5, indicating a central role for Alb3 in the integration of these LHC proteins. An involvement of Alb3 could not be taken for granted because these proteins differ very significantly from Lhcb1 in structural respects.Perhaps more surprising is the finding that the majority of thylakoid proteins tested in this study are completely unaffected by Alb3 antibodies and are able to insert in the complete absence of a functional Alb3 protein. One of these substrates, PsbS, is related to the above-mentioned LHC proteins yet inserts by a completely different pathway in which SRP, GTP, and FtsY are not required (27Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have now shown that Alb3 is not required for the insertion of PsbS, indicating a much simpler insertion pathway. Even more significantly, Alb3 plays no role in the insertion of a series of proteins (PsbW, PsbX, and PsbY) that bear signal peptides which are cleaved following insertion into thylakoids. These proteins are of particular interest because signal peptides almost invariably specify interaction with proteinaceous translocation apparatus, yet these proteins do not require the thylakoidal Sec or Tat machinery, and we have now ruled out an involvement of Alb3.PsbW and PsbX are also of interest for a second reason in that they closely resemble the well characterized M13 procoat in terms of overall structure. They likewise contain a single transmembrane span in the mature protein, are synthesized with apparently similar signal peptides, and even contain translocated loops of similar size (20–30 residues) and overall negative charge. However, we have found that these thylakoid proteins are completely unaffected by Alb3 antibodies or degradation, whereas procoat is almost totally dependent on YidC for insertion in E. coli (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These data indicate fundamental differences in insertion mechanisms for these simple proteins.The four Alb3-independent thylakoid proteins described in this study (PsbS, PsbX, PsbY, and PsbW) are the first substantial group of membrane proteins reported to insert independently of Oxa1-type proteins in bacteria or thylakoids. We have also found recently that a fifth protein, PsaK, inserts as a “horseshoe” conformation in a mechanism that does not require Alb3 (35Mant A. Woolhead C.A. Moore M. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36200-36206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data show that Alb3 is not required for the insertion of various types of thylakoid membrane protein, and it will be of particular interest to determine whether YidC-independent membrane proteins are identified in bacteria. If such proteins do not emerge, or if the bulk of bacterial membrane proteins do transpire to be highly YidC-dependent, a possible explanation may hinge on the very different chemical properties of the two membrane types. The E. coli plasma membrane is composed primarily of phospholipids, whereas galactolipids account for over 80% of thylakoid membrane lipid (reviewed in Refs. 36Douce R. Joyard J. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Advances in Photosynthesis, Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 69-101Google Scholar and 37Bruce B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 223-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major species is the relatively unsaturated monogalactosyl diacylglycerol, which has an intrinsic preference to form non-bilayer, hexagonal HII structures when it is isolated from native biological membranes. Thus, thylakoid lipids may provide a more fluid environment in which spontaneous (or at least, Alb3-independent) insertion is favored.It is notable that, among the seven membrane proteins studied here, Alb3 requirement correlates strictly with the assisted pathway (by which we mean that insertion requires stromal factors, NTPs, and protease-sensitive translocation machinery). If SRP is the stromal factor required for Lhcb4.1 and Lhcb5 insertion (but which has yet to be tested), this would suggest a mainstream pathway in which binding to SRP in the early stages is linked to Alb3-mediated integration at a later stage, with FtsY performing an important but so far poorly characterized function. A similar pathway operates in bacteria, but one important point to note is that the Sec apparatus is also required for some bacterial membrane proteins (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermayer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 2504-2512Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and a portion of YidC appears to be firmly bound to the E. coli Sec translocon (22Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is so far unclear whether the chloroplastic SRP/Alb3 pathway involves the Sec translocon at any stage. Antibodies to thylakoid SecY block the translocation of SecA-requiring proteins but do not inhibit Lhcb1 integration (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, anti-SecY antibodies may act by inhibiting SecA binding to SecY rather than inhibiting SecY functionper se. A second point is that M13 procoat and Pf3 coat require YidC but not SRP or the Sec machinery, and it will be of interest to determine whether any thylakoid membrane proteins similarly require Alb3 but not SRP and vice versa. The post-translational insertion of proteins into their target membranes has attracted a great deal of experimental attention in recent years in an effort to determine how hydrophobic regions are transferred from an aqueous environment into the membrane bilayer, and how the correct topology is achieved during this process. In bacteria, a complex “assisted” pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 2Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) has been characterized in which newly synthesized membrane proteins interact with signal recognition particle (SRP),1 FtsY and membrane-bound components of the secretory (Sec) apparatus (3Gebert J.F.

SRP appears to be involved in membrane protein biogenesis by virtue of its tendency to interact with particularly hydrophobic protein segments (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 399: 307-309Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A broadly similar assisted pathway operates in plant thylakoids for the targeting of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding (LHC) protein, Lhcb1, after import of this protein from the cytosol. Insertion of Lhcb1 into thylakoids requires nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), stromal SRP, FtsY, and a thylakoid translocase minimally composed of Albino3 (Alb3) (10Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Post-translational formation of a SRP/Lhcb1 targeting complex requires a hydrophobic domain along with a novel SRP-binding element in Lhcb1, termed the L18 domain, which is found only in members of the LHC protein family (14DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data along with studies on chloroplast-synthesized D1 (16Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggest that SRP is again used primarily to direct membrane proteins to the thylakoid membrane. For many years it was believed that other membrane proteins, in both bacteria and chloroplasts, were targeted by unassisted or “spontaneous” insertion pathways, in which the protein inserted directly into the bilayer without the aid of other protein factors. The best characterized example was M13 phage coat protein, which inserts into the Escherichia coli plasma membrane. This protein is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide, which assists insertion into the bilayer after which it is cleaved by leader peptidase (reviewed in Ref. 17Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor (procoat) does not interact with either the Sec machinery or SRP. A second protein, Pf3 coat protein, was also shown to insert by an SRP/Sec-independent mechanism that was presumed to be another example of spontaneous integration (18Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although Pf3 coat, unlike M13 procoat, does not contain a cleavable signal peptide. More recently the critical role of a novel family of targeting factor has come to light. The first member characterized was yeast Oxa1p that is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and that is important for the insertion of a range of membrane proteins from the matrix side (19Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A related protein, Alb3, is essential for the insertion of the SRP-dependent Lhcb1 protein in thylakoids (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and theE. coli homologue YidC has been shown recently to be equally important for the biogenesis of SRP substrates in this organism (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, Samuelson et al. (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) made the important discovery that YidC is also essential for the insertion of M13 procoat, indicating a much wider role in membrane protein biogenesis. A possible model is that one population of SecYEG-bound YidC is used in the insertion of SRP substrates, whereas a separate pool acts as its own translocon for the insertion of SRP/Sec-independent substrates such as procoat. M13 procoat and Pf3 coat protein are some of the few known SRP/Sec-independent membrane proteins in E. coli, but studies on thylakoids have revealed a surprising number of such proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several of these proteins, such as CFoII, PsbW, and PsbX, are single-span proteins that are synthesized with cleavable signal peptides but are nevertheless inserted by SRP/Sec-independent mechanisms (23Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PsbY is exceptional in containing two signal peptides that are cleaved several times after insertion to yield two single-span mature proteins (26Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other multispanning proteins (that are not synthesized with signal-type peptides) have also been shown to insert SRP/Sec independently despite being related to the strictly SRP-dependent Lhcb1 protein (27Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The lack of requirement for SRP, Sec apparatus, or any energy source raised the possibility of a spontaneous insertion mechanism for these proteins. Whereas SRP and the Sec apparatus are not involved in the insertion of most thylakoid proteins studied to date, the overall role of Alb3 has remained unclear because only Lhcb1 has been tested for Alb3 requirement (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because YidC is required for the efficient insertion of every E. coli membrane protein tested (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), we have sought to examine the global role of Alb3 in the insertion of distinct classes of thylakoid membrane protein, with particular emphasis on the PsbW-type proteins that so closely resemble M13 procoat. We have identified two further substrates for Alb3, both of which are LHC proteins, but we show that Alb3 is not required for the insertion of any SRP-independent protein analyzed to date, including several that are synthesized with cleavable signal peptides. These data indicate fundamental differences in the requirements for membrane protein insertion in E. coli and thylakoid membranes. DISCUSSIONThe depletion of YidC in E. coli is rapidly followed by dramatic adverse effects on the insertion of every membrane protein analyzed to date, including one considered for decades to insert spontaneously (21Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Disruption of the oxa1 gene in yeast likewise leads to a severe inhibition of membrane protein insertion from the matrix side (19Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the only chloroplast protein studied in terms of Alb3 dependence, Lhcb1, was found to be very reliant on this factor for insertion into thylakoids (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These findings point to a major role for Oxa1-type proteins in these membrane systems, but we have sought to analyze the global role of Alb3 in thylakoids by studying its role in the biogenesis of a variety of membrane protein types (including assisted and spontaneous substrates) under identical circumstances.We have first shown that Alb3 antibodies almost totally block the insertion of Lhcb4.1 and Lhcb5, indicating a central role for Alb3 in the integration of these LHC proteins.

It is so far unclear whether the chloroplastic SRP/Alb3 pathway involves the Sec translocon at any stage. Antibodies to thylakoid SecY block the translocation of SecA-requiring proteins but do not inhibit Lhcb1 integration (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol.

A similar pathway operates in bacteria, but one important point to note is that the Sec apparatus is also required for some bacterial membrane proteins (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermayer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 2504-2512Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and a portion of YidC appears to be firmly bound to the E. coli Sec translocon (22Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is so far unclear whether the chloroplastic SRP/Alb3 pathway involves the Sec translocon at any stage. Antibodies to thylakoid SecY block the translocation of SecA-requiring proteins but do not inhibit Lhcb1 integration (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, anti-SecY antibodies may act by inhibiting SecA binding to SecY rather than inhibiting SecY functionper se. A second point is that M13 procoat and Pf3 coat require YidC but not SRP or the Sec machinery, and it will be of interest to determine whether any thylakoid membrane proteins similarly require Alb3 but not SRP and vice versa. We thank Dr. Y. Zhu for kindly providing a pea Alb3 plasmid."

Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82–83: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), growing appreciation of the environmental damage caused by many agrochemicals, and increased public concern about the human health risks associated with prolonged insecticide exposure (2Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). One promising approach is to engineer plants to produce insect-specific toxins, as exemplified by the engineering of genes encoding insecticidal toxins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into a variety of agricultural cultivars (3Shelton A.M. Tang J.D. Roush R.T. Metz T.D. Earle E.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A potentially more selective method is to use insect-specific viruses as vectors to deliver toxins to a restricted number of target insects without harming non-target animals (4Cory J.S. Hirst M.L. Williams T. Hails R.S. Goulson D. Green B.M. Carty T.M. Possee R.D. Cayley P.J. Bishop D.H.L. Nature. 1994; 370: 138-140Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Bonning B.C. Hammock B.D. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1996; 41: 191-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there are few well characterized peptide/protein toxins that lend themselves to these genomic approaches. Spider venoms can be viewed as preoptimized combinatorial libraries of insecticidal peptides, and therefore we decided to exploit these venoms in the search for insect-specific toxins suitable for engineering into plants and insect viruses. Here we describe a new family of insecticidal neurotoxins isolated by screening the venom of the lethal Australian funnel-web spider Hadronyche versuta (Fig. 1,inset). These toxins are the most potent blockers of insect voltage-gated calcium channels reported to date, but they are virtually inactive on vertebrate ion channels, making them ideal biopesticide candidates. The structure of one of the toxins reveals a compact, disulfide-rich core and a structurally disordered lipophilic extension that is essential for channel blocking activity. Funnel-web spiders were collected from the Blue Mountains west of Sydney (H. versuta), from Fraser Island, Queensland (H. infensa), and from the Illawarra region of New South Wales (Atrax sp. Illawarra). Lyophilized crude venom was fractionated using a Vydac C18 analytical reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (rpHPLC)1column as described previously (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Semi-pure ω-ACTX-Hv2a obtained from this initial fractionation was further purified on the same column using a gradient of 30–48% acetonitrile over 35 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Once purified to >98% homogeneity, peptides were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until further use. Cysteine residues were alkylated before sequencing (7Wang X.-H. Smith R. Fletcher J.I. Wilson H. Wood C.J. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Insecticidal activity was tested by injecting peptides into house crickets (Acheta domesticus Linnaeus) as described previously (7Wang X.-H. Smith R. Fletcher J.I. Wilson H. Wood C.J. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Vertebrate activity was assayed as described previously (8Szeto T.H. Wang X.-H. Smith R. Connor M. Christie G.M. Nicholson G.M. King G.F. Toxicon. 1999; 38: 429-442Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using vertebrate smooth (vas deferens) and skeletal (biventer cervicis) nerve-muscle preparations; tissue contractions were recorded in the absence of additives or after injection of peptides directly into the bath buffer. ω-Atracotoxin-Hv1a (100 nm), a modulator of voltage-gated sodium channels (9Fletcher J.I. Chapman B.E. Mackay J.P. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 1525-1535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Vertebrate toxicity was determined by subcutaneous injection of ω-ACTX-Hv2a in 0.1 ml of saline into young BALB/c mice (3.1 ± 0.2 g;n = 3). Toxicity was monitored over 72 h. Venom glands were dissected from a single subdued specimen of H. infensa (mature female) and Atrax sp. Illawarra (mature male), and mRNA was immediately isolated using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For theH. infensa mRNA template, first-strand cDNA synthesis employed Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to extend a 3′ universal poly(dT) anchor primer (NotI-dT18; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Second-strand synthesis used DNA polymerase I. Marathon adapters (CLONTECH) were then ligated to the cDNA ends. For the Atrax template, full-length single-stranded cDNAs were obtained by including a 5′ SMART II oligonucleotide (CLONTECH) in addition to theNotI-dT18 primer. 5′-RACE of the H. infensa cDNA library employed a redundant primer based on the partial N-terminal sequence of mature toxin (5′-(AGTC)GT(AG)TT(AGTC)AC(AGTC)AC(AG)CA(AG)TC) and a 5′ universal adapter primer (CLONTECH). Cloning and sequencing of the derived leader sequence allowed a gene-specific 3′-RACE primer (5′- gtggacgccATGAAATTTTCAAAGC) to be designed based on the 5′-untranslated region, translation start site, and N-terminal signal sequence. This gene-specific primer was used in conjunction with a 3′ universal primer (Pacific Oligos) to amplify entire coding sequences from both the H. infensa andAtrax cDNA libraries. Final polymerase chain reaction products (450–470 base pairs) were purified, cloned, and sequenced. Neurons were dissociated from brains of adult European honeybees (Apis mellifera) as described previously (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Adult C57B16/J mice of either sex were anesthetized with halothane and then killed by cervical dislocation. Trigeminal ganglion neurons were isolated by gentle trituration of the minced ganglia after a 20-min treatment at 34 °C with papain (20 units/ml−1) in a HEPES-buffered saline solution of 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3 (HBS). Standard whole cell voltage clamp recordings (10Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) were made of bee brain calcium channel (I Ca), sodium channel (I Na), and potassium channel (I K) currents and mouse sensory neuronI Ca and I Na at ambient temperature (22 °C−24 °C). For bee neurons, recordings were made with fire-polished borosilicate pipettes of ∼6 megaohm resistance when filled with an intracellular solution of either of the following compositions: (a) 120 mm CsCl, 5 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm Na2GTP, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (for I Na andI Ca), or (b) 130 mm KF, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (for I K). For recordings of I Ca andI Na, the external solution consisted of 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CsCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3. For I K recording, the external solution consisted of 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3. The same internal solution was used for recordings of mouse sensory neuronI Ca and I Na; electrodes had a resistance of 1–2 megaohms. I Ca external solution contained 140 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3, whereas I Na was recorded in HBS. Neurons were voltage clamped at −90 mV, and currents were evoked by stepping the membrane potential from −60 to +60 mV. Toxin effects onI Ca and I Na were tested at the potential with the largest inward current, usually −10 or 0 mV. In bee neurons, the peak inward currents were usually abolished by 100 µm Cd2+, suggesting that the current was largely carried by Ca2+ channels. In a few bee neurons, there was a rapidly activating, transient, and Cd2+-insensitive current that was blocked completely by tetrodotoxin (1 µm). In mouse sensory neurons, the peak inward currents evoked in the presence of potassium and sodium channel blockers were abolished by 30 µm Cd2+. The inward currents recorded in HBS consisted of both tetrodotoxin-sensitive and tetrodotoxin-resistant components. Toxin effects on bee brain I K were determined over a range of membrane potentials (from −40 to +60 mV). Data were collected and analyzed as described previously (11Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (90% purity) encompassing residues 1–32 of ω-ACTX-Hv2a was purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). The reduced peptide (referred to hereafter as CT-Hv2a) was oxidized/folded at ambient temperature (22 °C) in a glutathione redox buffer that promotes disulfide oxidation/shuffling (12Fletcher J.I. Dingley A.J. Smith R. Connor M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with HCl and dialyzed against H2O using 1-kDa cutoff cellulose dialysis tubing (Membrane Filtration Products) to remove folding buffer components. The lyophilized dialysate was dissolved in H2O and then applied to a Vydac C18 analytical rpHPLC column; fully oxidized CT-Hv2a was eluted with a retention time of 19 min using a gradient of 22–47% acetonitrile over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 2.0 mg of ω-ACTX-Hv2a or 3.0 mg of synthetic CT-Hv2a in 260 µl of either 7.5% or 100% D2O in a susceptibility-matched microcell (Shigemi) and then adjusting the pH to 4.71. NMR spectra were recorded at 288 K and 296 K using either a Bruker AVANCE or Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer. The following two-dimensional spectra were recorded for both peptides in 7.5% D2O: TOCSY (τm = 70 ms) and NOESY with τm = 60 ms (ω-ACTX-Hv2a, 296 K), 250 ms (ω-ACTX-Hv2a, 288 K), or 300 ms (ω-ACTX-Hv2a and CT-Hv2a, 296 K). The following two-dimensional spectra were recorded for the 100% D2O samples: ECOSY (ω-ACTX-Hv2a only) and NOESY with τm = 300 ms. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) or Felix97 (Molecular Simulations, Inc). Chemical shift assignments were made using XEASY (13Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar) and have been deposited in BioMagResBank (BMRB accession code 4923). Hydrogen bonds were identified using hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). NOESY cross-peaks were integrated in XEASY and converted to distance restraints (with pseudoatoms where appropriate) using CALIBA (14Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). Dihedral-angle restraints were derived as described previously (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The intense intraresidue Hα−HN NOE for Arg-26, combined with a3JHNHα value of ∼7 Hz, allowed its φ angle to be restrained to 50 ± 40° for both peptides (15Ludvigsen S. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hβ stereospecific assignments and χ1restraints for ω-ACTX-Hv2a were obtained using ECOSY-derived3Jαβ coupling constants in combination with Hα−Hβ and HN−HβNOE intensities measured from the 60-ms NOESY spectrum. Proline Hβ protons were stereospecifically assigned as described previously (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All X-Pro peptide bonds were clearly identified astrans on the basis of characteristic NOEs (16Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The disulfide bonding pattern was determined unequivocally from preliminary structure calculations. The torsion angle dynamics program DYANA was used to calculate 5000 structures from random starting conformations. The best 100 structures (selected on the basis of final penalty-function values) were then refined in X-PLOR (17Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The 20 lowest-energy X-PLOR conformers were used to represent the solution structures of ω-ACTX-Hv2a and CT-Hv2a. MOLMOL (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) was used for molecular graphics. Fig.1 a shows a typical rpHPLC fractionation of crude venom from H. versuta. 50 fractions were individually assayed for insect and vertebrate toxicity. The late-eluting peak marked with an arrow caused immediate and sustained paralysis when injected into crickets (PD50 = 160 ± 9 pmol g−1; mean duration of paralysis at a dose of 250–500 pmol g−1 = 4–5 h). Injection of crickets with a second dose (250–500 pmol g−1) of toxin before reversal of paralysis was lethal. The toxin was inactive in vertebrate smooth and skeletal nerve-muscle preparations at a concentration of 1 µm (data not shown). These two neuromuscular preparations were chosen for the vertebrate toxicity screen because in combination they contain most of the potential neuropharmacological targets of spider toxins such as ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. As further evidence of its lack of vertebrate toxicity, the toxin did not cause any adverse effects when injected into newborn mice at doses of up to 800 pmol g−1, which is 5-fold higher than the PD50 in crickets. Proteolytic digestion combined with N- and C-terminal sequencing revealed the complete amino acid sequence of this 45-residue toxin (Fig. 1 b). Consistent with its long rpHPLC retention time, the toxin contains an unusually high proportion (55%) of apolar residues, including a highly hydrophobic C-terminal tail. We named the peptide ω-ACTX-Hv2a (Swiss-Prot accession number P82852) based on its molecular target (see below) and published nomenclature rules (11Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The toxin has no homologs in the protein/DNA sequence data bases. A peptide with a rpHPLC retention time similar to that of ω-ACTX-Hv2a was also evident in the venom of H. infensa. However, despite several attempts, N-terminal sequencing yielded only 12 residues (GVLDCVVNTLGC), and C-terminal sequencing indicated that the peptide had a blocked C terminus. Hence, we used RACE analysis (19Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) to extract the complete mRNA sequences corresponding to this toxin using cDNA libraries prepared from the venom glands of H. infensa andAtrax sp. Illawarra (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequencing of RACE-derived clones revealed two 306-base pair coding sequences from H. infensa (corresponding to two 102-residue translation products, ω-ACTX-Hi2a and ω-ACTX-Hi2b) and two 300-base pair coding sequences from the Atrax species (corresponding to two 100-residue translation products, ω-ACTX-As2a and ω-ACTX-As2b). The DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBankTM (GenBankTM accession numbersAF329442–329445). The derived amino acid sequences (Fig.1 b) indicate that these peptides are homologs of ω-ACTX-Hv2a and reveal that the mature toxins are obtained by processing of a much larger prepropeptide precursor. The propeptide cleavage site was readily discerned from the known N-terminal sequence of ω-ACTX-Hv2a and ω-ACTX-Hi2a, whereas the signal peptide cleavage site was predicted using SignalP (20Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). The prepropeptide architecture is similar to that determined for conotoxins (21Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Marsh M. Yoshikami D. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 422-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and provides the first circumstantial evidence that Australian funnel-web spiders have evolved a strategy similar to that of the cone snails for diversifying their toxin pool. The signal sequence is extremely well conserved (78% identity and 100% similarity if conservative substitutions are included; see Fig.1 b), whereas the mature peptide sequence is more diversified (53% identity). This finding is consistent with accelerated evolution (hypermutation) of the C-terminal region of the precursor to generate a library of functionally diverse toxins with identical cystine framework (21Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Marsh M. Yoshikami D. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 422-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It will be interesting in future studies to directly examine whether the venom contains families of functionally disparate toxins with the same signal sequence. Mass spectral analysis of ω-ACTX-Hi2a (predicted oxidized mass = 4408 Da; observed mass = 4009 Da) indicated that it undergoes posttranslational deletion of the C-terminal four residues. C-terminal “trimming” has been noted for several spider (23Diniz M.R. Paine M.J. Diniz C.R. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15340-15342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Leisy D.J. Mattson J.D. Quistad G.B. Kramer S.J. Van Beek N. Tsai L.W. Enderlin F.E. Woodworth A.R. Digan M.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and scorpion (25Bougis P.E. Rochat H. Smith L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19259-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) toxins. The scorpion toxin AaH II fromAndroctonus australis Hector undergoes posttranslational cleavage at a C-terminal Gly-Arg followed by an amidation process that eliminates the C-terminal glycine (25Bougis P.E. Rochat H. Smith L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19259-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar processing at the C-terminal Gly-Arg sequence in the H. infensa toxins would yield a toxin with the experimentally observed mass and would explain the block encountered during C-terminal sequencing of ω-ACTX-Hi2a. Mass analysis of the H. versuta and Atrax toxins indicated that their C termini are not trimmed, consistent with the absence of the C-terminal Gly-Arg sequence. Application of ω-ACTX-Hv2a (10 pm to 100 nm) to bee brain neurons inhibited calcium channel currents (I Ca) in all cells examined (n = 37; Fig. 2a), with maximum inhibition occurring at concentrations of >10 nm. The EC50 for ω-ACTX-Hv2a inhibition ofI Ca was ∼130 pm (Fig.2 c). Inhibition was rapid at high concentrations and was not significantly reversed by prolonged washing (Fig. 2 d). Application of ω-agatoxin (Aga)-IVA, the prototypic antagonist of vertebrate P-type voltage-gated calcium channels (26Mintz I.M. Venema V.J. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Bean B.P. Adams M.E. Nature. 1992; 355: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), also inhibitedI Ca in all bee neurons examined (n = 19), but the EC50 (10 nm) and the concentration required for maximum inhibition (>100 nm) were both significantly higher than those for ω-ACTX-Hv2a (Fig. 2 c). In striking contrast to its effect on invertebrate neurons, superfusion of high concentrations of ω-ACTX-Hv2a (1 µm;n = 10) for 5 min had little effect onI Ca in mouse sensory neurons, whereas application of ω-Aga-IVA inhibited a component of I Ca in all mouse sensory neurons with an EC50 of about 20 nm (maximumI Ca inhibition ∼40%; Fig. 2 c). ω-ACTX-Hv2a (100 nm) did not inhibit the tetrodotoxin-sensitive I Na of bee brain neurons (I Na was 98 ± 4% of control;n = 4), nor did it significantly affectI Na in mouse sensory neurons (I Na was 97 ± 3% of control with ω-ACTX-Hv2a = 1 µm; n = 5). ω-ACTX-Hv2a (100 nm; n = 5) had no effect on bee brain I K at any potential when neurons were stepped from −90 mV to between −40 and +60 mV. We conclude that ω-ACTX-Hv2a is a potent and extremely specific blocker of insect voltage-gated calcium channels. Based on the data in Fig. 2 c, we calculate that ω-ACTX-Hv2a has at least a 10,000-fold preference for insect versus vertebrate calcium channels. The solution structure of ω-ACTX-Hv2a purified from H. versuta venom was determined using standard homonuclear NMR methods (16Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The ensemble of structures (Fig. 3; TableI; Protein Data Bank accession code 1G9P) is highly precise with a backbone r.m.s. difference of 0.18 Å for the structured region (residues 3–32).

Open table in a new tab The disulfide-rich region of ω-ACTX-Hv2a (residues 3–32) is organized into a compact globular domain containing a small stretch of 310-helix (residues 13–17), a short β-hairpin (residues 23–30, comprising β-strands at residues 23–25 and 28–30), and well defined β-turns at residues 18–21 (type I) and 25–28 (type I′) (Fig. 3 b). This globular domain contains a small hydrophobic core formed by two buried disulfide bridges (17–29 and 11–24) and the side chain of Thr-21. In striking contrast to the highly ordered disulfide-rich core, the N-terminal two residues and the entire lipophilic C-terminal tail (residues 33–45) are disordered in solution (Fig. 3 a). The three disulfide bridges in ω-ACTX-Hv2a form an inhibitory cystine knot motif (28Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) in which the Cys-17-Cys-29 disulfide passes through a 15-residue ring formed by the other two disulfide bridges and the intervening sections of polypeptide backbone (Fig. 3 b). Although the N-terminal disulfide bridge of the inhibitory cystine knot motif does not generally contribute to the hydrophobic core of inhibitory cystine knot toxins and is not essential for formation of the basic inhibitory cystine knot fold (6Wang X.-H.

Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a complete cystine knot motif has been found in all four atracotoxin structures reported to date (this study and Refs. 6Wang X.-H.

Presumably, the additional stability and protease resistance conferred by the complete knot (28Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) are critical for effective delivery of these neurotoxins to their sites of action. A search of the protein structure database using DALI (30Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) revealed weak but functionally significant structural homology between ω-ACTX-Hv2a and ω-Aga-IVA from the unrelated American funnel-web spiderAgelenopsis aperta (Fig.4a). We previously noted close structural/functional homology between the sodium channel modifiers δ-ACTX from H. versuta and µ-Aga-I from A. aperta (6Wang X.-H. Connor M. Smith R. Maciejewski M.W. Howden M.E.H. Nicholson G.M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Fletcher J.I. Chapman B.E. Mackay J.P. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 1525-1535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Given the large evolutionary distance between these arachnids (Australian funnel-web spiders are primitive mygalomorphs, whereas American funnel-web spiders are modern araneomorphs), these results imply a remarkable case of convergent evolution. In addition to the significant structural homology between the disulfide-rich domains of ω-ACTX-Hv2a and ω-Aga-IVA, both toxins have an unstructured, lipophilic C-terminal extension that was demonstrated to be critical for the activity of ω-Aga-IVA (31Kim J.I. Konishi S. Iwai H. Kohno T. Gouda H. Shimada I. Sato K. Arata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of the unstructured C-terminal domain in ω-ACTX-Hv2a (i.e. residues 33–45), we produced a synthetic peptide comprising only residues 1–32 of the parent toxin and determined its solution structure using NMR spectroscopy (Table I; Protein Data Bank accession code 1HP3). As expected, the truncated toxin has the same fold as the corresponding region of the full-length parent toxin (Fig. 4 b). However, we found that the C-terminally truncated toxin did not inhibit insect calcium channels (Fig. 2 b), nor did it competitively inhibit the activity of the native toxin (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the lipophilic C-terminal extension is essential for interaction of ω-ACTX-Hv2a with insect calcium channels. Most commonly used insecticides target voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g. DDT, pyrethroids), GABA receptors (e.g. cyclodienes and fipronil), or acetylcholinesterase (e.g. organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides) (32French-Constant R.H. Pittendringh B. Vaughan A. Anthony N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This narrow target range has accelerated resistance development (1Feyereisen R. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82–83: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and stimulated interest in the elucidation of new insecticidal compounds that act on novel targets. We have shown in this study that ω-ACTX-Hv2a acts on a nonconventional target, namely, insect voltage-gated calcium channels. Furthermore, this toxin appears to be the most potent blocker of these channels reported to date; its EC50 on bee brain neurons (∼130 pm; this study) is significantly lower than that obtained for ω-Aga-IVA on bee (∼10 nm; this study) or cockroach (17 nm; Ref. 33Benquet P. Le Guen J. Dayanithi Y. Pichon Y. Tiaho F. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) brain neurons. The unprecedented phylogenetic specificity of ω-ACTX-Hv2a significantly augments its utility as a lead compound for insecticide development, with our studies indicating that the toxin has at least a 10,000-fold preference for insect over vertebrate calcium channels. Whereas the toxin was inactive in all vertebrates tested in this study (chicken, rat, and mouse), we have found that ω-ACTX-Hv2a is toxic to a wide range of insect orders, including Leptidoptera, Diptera, and Orthoptera. 2B. L. Sollod and G. F. King, unpublished results. PLTX-II appears to be the only peptide toxin with comparable potency on insect calcium channels (34Leung H.-T. Branton W.D. Phillips H.S. Jan L. Byerly L. Neuron. 1989; 3: 767-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but its ion channel and phylogenetic specificity remains to be determined. Surprisingly, despite a complete lack of sequence similarity, we found that ω-ACTX-Hv2a has weak but functionally significant structural homology with ω-Aga-IVA/B from the American funnel-web spider A. aperta. Both toxins contain a highly ordered disulfide-rich core and an unstructured lipophilic C-terminal region that protrudes from this globular domain. Both toxins have markedly reduced activity when the lipophilic C-terminal extension is deleted. Furthermore, we demonstrated that C-terminally truncated ω-ACTX-Hv2a does not competitively inhibit the activity of the full-length toxin, suggesting that the disulfide-rich core does not bind the channel in the absence of the C-terminal tail. These results lead us to propose a possible model for the mode of action of these toxins. It seems improbable that the structurally disordered C-terminal tails of ω-ACTX-Hv2a and ω-Aga-IVA make specific interactions with residues on the extracellular surface of voltage-gated calcium channels. First, it is difficult to envisage how these lipophilic tails could make extensive favorable contacts with the largely polar surface of the channel. Second, the C-terminal apolar tail of ω-ACTX-Hv2a is a low complexity sequence, comprising a triple (G/P)G(L/I)(L/V) repeat, which seems unlikely to make specific high-affinity contacts with the channel surface. Third, in this model, immobilization of the C-terminal tail upon channel binding would incur a huge loss of conformational entropy, which is difficult to reconcile with EC50 values in the picomolar range. Thus, we suggest that ω-ACTX-Hv2a and ω-Aga-IVA share a similar mechanism of action in which the lipophilic tail does not make specific high-affinity contacts with the extracellular surface of the targeted calcium channel but rather initiates toxin binding by penetrating the membrane either adjacent to the channel or by intercalation between transmembrane segments of the channel protein (Fig. 4 c). A similar model has been proposed for the mode of action of ω-Aga-IVB (35Yu H. Rosen M.K. Saccomano N.A. Phillips D. Volkmann R.A. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13123-13129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Limited motion of the tail region within the membrane might minimize the loss of conformational entropy suffered by the toxin upon channel binding. We propose that anchoring of the C-terminal tail in the membrane somehow facilitates direct interaction of the disulfide-rich core region with the extracellular surface of the channel (i.e. the tail “targets” the structured region to the channel). One possibility is that binding of the C-terminal tail alters the channel conformation sufficiently to reveal a cryptic high-affinity binding site for the disulfide-rich portion of the toxin. In this model, C-terminal truncates would not be expected to bind the channel or act as competitive inhibitors of the wild-type toxin, which is what we observed experimentally. While further experiments will clearly be required to test this hypothesis, it is salient to note that the insect calcium channel blocker PLTX-II from the spider Plectreurys tristis contains a C-terminal palmitoyl group that is essential for biological activity (36Branton W.D. Rudnick M.S. Zhou Y. Eccleston E.D. Fields G.B. Bowers L.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and therefore it may function similarly. Thus, it will be instructive in future experiments to examine whether the C-terminal tail of ω-ACTX-Hv2a can be replaced by nonspecific hydrophobic anchors such as a palmitoyl group. We thank Drs. Mark Maciejewski, Roger Drinkwater, and Benjamin Oldroyd for help with NMR data acquisition, RACE analysis, and bee collection, respectively."

The intracellular reaction of NO with reactive cysteine groups leads to the formation of S-nitrosothiols. To investigate the regulation of S-nitrosothiols in endothelial cells, we first analyzed the composition of the S-nitrosylated molecules in endothelial cells. Gel filtration revealed that more than 95% of the detected S-nitrosothiols had a molecular mass of more than 5000 Da.

Having demonstrated that most of the S-nitrosothiols are proteins, we determined the regulation of the S-nitrosylation by pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic factors, such as TNFα and mildly oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL). TNFα and oxLDL induced denitrosylation of various proteins as assessed by Saville-Griess assay, by immunostaining with an anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody, and by a Western blot approach.

In endothelial cells, nitric oxide is continuously synthesized by the endothelial NO synthase. NO is implicated in several physiological functions within the endothelium. Thus, NO regulates the vascular tone, provides anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis (2Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M.

NO can act via cGMP-dependent and independent pathways. During the last years, increasing evidence suggests that cGMP-independent processes are importantly contributing to the regulation of cellular signaling. Specifically, theS-nitrosylation of SH-groups by NO has been shown to contribute to cGMP-independent effects of NO (5Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J.

Furthermore, the small G-protein p21ras and the MAP-kinase JNK are regulated by S-nitrosylation (15Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Another example is the S-nitrosylation of transcription factors like NFκB, c-jun, and c-fos, which regulates gene expression underscoringS-nitrosylation as a widespread regulatory mechanism (for review see Ref. 17Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Beside the S-nitrosylation of high molecular weight proteins, the formation of S-nitrosylated glutathione, GSNO, has been proposed to be one of the important storage forms for NO in vivo (18Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19Ji Y. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although various S-nitrosylated proteins and molecules have been identified, the regulation of the S-nitrosylation is not clear. A first hint for the potential reversibility ofS-nitrosylation and thereby suggesting the process of denitrosylation as an important component of signal transduction cascades was reported by Mannick et al., who demonstrated that S-nitrosylation of caspase-3 is reversible (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Stimulation of human T and B cells with Fas, a known pro-apoptotic stimulus, led to denitrosylation of overexpressed caspase-3 (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, further studies revealed that the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is conserved from bacteria to humans, specifically metabolizes GSNO to glutathione (21Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the stability of GSNO and high molecular weight proteins in endothelial cells. The present study demonstrates that TNFα and mildly oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) reduceS-nitrosothiols in endothelial cells. The majority ofS-nitrosothiols (95%) was associated with high molecular weight proteins suggesting a minor contribution of GSNO. TNFα and oxLDL induced denitrosylation of many proteins including the p17 subunit of caspase-3 suggesting that the mechanism ofS-nitrosylation/denitrosylation plays an important regulatory role in endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in endothelial basal medium supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 µg/ml), bovine brain extract (12 µg/ml), gentamicin (50 µg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. After detachment with trypsin, cells were grown for at least 18 h. Cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml oxLDL or 100 ng/ml TNFα as described previously (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M.

The plasmid encoding the caspase-3 p17 wt subunit and the caspase-3 p17 mutant type (C163S) were cloned as previously described (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transfected with 3 µg of plasmid and 25 µl of Superfect as described previously with a transfection efficiency of 40% (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In brief, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were lysed in Griess lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, 1 mmdiethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide), and 80 µg of cell lysate was incubated with 1% sulfanilamide and 0.1%N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in the presence or absence of 3.75 mmp-chloromercuribenzosulfonic acid for 20 min, and S-NO content was measured photometrically at 540 nm. The amount was calculated using defined GSNO concentrations as a standard. Cells were incubated with or without TNFα for 18 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization and blocking (permeabilization solution: 3% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% horse serum in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)), cells were incubated with anti-nitrosocysteine antibody (1:50) over night at 4 °C. After incubation with a biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500), cells were labeled with streptavidin-fluorescein and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (magnification 1:40). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-phenylidole (DAPI; 0.2 µg/ml in 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) for 10 min, and the resulting figures were merged. For negative control fixed and permeabilized cells were preincubated with 0.8% HgCl2for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates (500 µg of total protein) were passed through G-25 Sephadex columns preequilibrated with Griess lysis buffer. ProteinS-NO was separated from low molecular mass S-NO by desalting with 150 mm NaCl. S-NO content was detected by using the Saville-Griess assay as described above. Data were calculated as percent of protein loaded on the column. After the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS. After addition of 1% sulfosalicyclic acid cells were immediately shock frozen at −80 °C for 2 min and the resulting lysate was centrifuged for 5 min 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with Tris-EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at room temperature for 10 min, and the optical density was determined with a photometer at 412 nm. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.32 msucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The total protein content of the probe was determined. Detection of S-nitrosylated caspase-3 p17 subunit was performed as described (16Park H.S. Huh S.H. Kim M.S. Lee S.H. Choi E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14022-14024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and two times with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of PBS. After addition of 100 µm HgCl2 and 100 µm2,3-diamino-naphthalene (DAN), samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, and 1 m NaOH was added. The generated fluorescent triazole from the reaction of 2,3-diamino-naphthalene with the NO released from caspase-3 p17 subunit was measured using an excitation wavelength of 375 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. As negative control the Myc antibody alone in lysis buffer was immunoprecipitated. The resulting background fluorescence intensity was subtracted from each experiment. Detection of S-nitrosylated proteins was performed as described with slight modifications (24Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in HENS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01 mm neocuproine and 1% SDS) for 20 min and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min. 800 µg of total protein was incubated with 20 mm methyl-methanthiosulfate (MMTS) for 20 min at 50 °C and vortexed every 2 min for 5 s. MMTS was removed by protein precipitation with acetone. After resuspending the pellet in HENS buffer, 0.4 mmN-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP) and 1 mm sodium ascorbate were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed in the dark. Biotinylated proteins were detected by using a horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance or student's t test (SPSS-Software; Excel software). To address whether TNFα or oxLDL reduce the overallS-nitrosothiol content, endothelial cells were incubated with TNFα and oxLDL for 12 and 18 h. As shown in Fig.1A, TNFα as well as oxLDL time dependently decreased S-nitrosothiols as measured by Saville-Griess assay. To confirm these findings, immunostainings were performed using an anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody. Endothelial cells treated with TNFα and oxLDL showed significantly less S-nitrosocysteine compared with control cells. The specificity of the immunostaining was demonstrated by preincubation with HgCl2 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To exclude a possible involvement of TNFα-induced degradation of the eNOS mRNA and protein (25Agnoletti L. Curello S. Bachetti T. Malacarne F. Gaia G. Comini L. Volterrani M. Bonetti P. Parrinello G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5719-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which might interfere with de novo S-nitrosylation, we incubated endothelial cells with NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), a competitive inhibitor of the eNOS, and measured the content of S-nitrosothiols. We could not detect any reduction of S-nitrosothiols after 18 h, but a significant decrease was determined after 48 h of incubation withl-NMMA (Fig. 1C) indicating a strong stability of the protein S-nitrosothiol adducts. Similar results were obtained using a different inhibitor of the eNOS,NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME), for 18 h (control: 20.3 ± 1.5 nmolS-NO/mg protein; l-NAME: 19.6 ± 1.6 nmolS-NO/mg protein). Moreover, coincubation of endothelial cells with TNFα and l-NMMA revealed similar results as for TNFα alone (9.9 ± 1.7 nmol S-NO/mg protein TNFα + l-NMMA versus 10.1 ± 1.4 nmolS-NO/mg protein TNFα, n = 4). To characterize the S-nitrosothiols involved in the S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation process in endothelial cells, we performed column chromatography using Sephadex G25 (cutoff: 5000 Da). As shown in Fig.2A, the amount of low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols including GSNO was less than 5% of the overall S-NO content. These data indicate that proteins and not GSNO were denitrosylated upon stimulation with TNFα and oxLDL. To further underscore that GSNO is not the predominant form of NO in endothelial cells, cells were incubated with butyl-N-sulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit the de novosynthesis of GSH. BSO incubation did not reduce the overallS-NO content in endothelial cells (Fig. 2B), although the GSH content was markedly decreased in the cells (Fig.2C). Having demonstrated that more than 95% of the S-nitrosothiols in endothelial cells are high molecular weight proteins, we characterized the pattern of S-nitrosylation using a Western blot approach. For this purpose, S-nitrosylated proteins were labeled with biotin using biotin-HPDP and detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin. Incubation with TNFα showed a significant reduction of S-nitrosylated proteins (Fig.3A). Quantification revealed that TNFα and oxLDL reduced S-nitrosylated proteins as shown in Fig. 3B. Equal loading of the blots was confirmed by reprobing the membranes with antibodies against the well establishedS-nitrosylated proteins, Ras and JNK (Fig.3A). Moreover, bands with the proposed molecular mass for Ras (21 kDa) and JNK (46 kDa) seemed to beS-nitrosylated (Fig. 3A). To get further insights into specific targets, which are denitrosylated by TNFα, we investigated the caspase-3 p17 subunit. We and others showed previously that TNFα and oxLDL induced apoptosis in endothelial cells via activation of the cysteine protease family, the caspases, and, moreover, that S-nitrosylation of caspase-3 leads to its inactivation (8Li J.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that TNFα induces denitrosylation of caspase-3 p17 subunit as an important mechanism for apoptosis induction in endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we transfected endothelial cells with Myc-tagged caspase-3 p17 wild type subunit (p17 wt) and the caspase 3 p17 mutant subunit, which contained a serine instead of a cysteine in its active center at position 163 (p17C163S). After stimulation with TNFα, the caspase-3 p17 subunit was immunoprecipitated, and S-nitrosylation was detected using the DAN reagent. Under control conditions, p17 wt wasS-nitrosylated in vivo, which was significantly reduced in cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 3C). The data obtained for p17 wt after TNFα treatment were similar as for p17C163S without TNFα (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that TNFα induced denitrosylation of proteins, importantly the caspase-3 p17 subunit. The present study demonstrates that TNFα and oxLDL can induce the denitrosylation of proteins in endothelial cells. The denitrosylation was demonstrated using different techniques including immunohistochemistry and the detection of S-NO with the Saville-Griess Assay. Furthermore, the recently developed method by Jaffrey et al. was used, which allows the detection ofS-nitrosylated proteins by Western blot (24Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Thereby, TNFα and oxLDL were shown to reduce the S-nitrosylation of various proteins. Furthermore, TNFα specifically denitrosylates the caspase-3 p17 subunit as demonstrated by the detection of theS-nitrosylation of p17 immunoprecipitates with the DAN assay. These data provide evidence for the denitrosylation as an important regulatory mechanism in endothelial cells. The characterization of the S-nitrosothiols in endothelial cells revealed that most of the S-nitrosothiols were high molecular weight proteins as demonstrated by gel filtration. Moreover, inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis did not significantly affect the overall S-NO levels, suggesting that GSNO quantitatively does play a minor role. This is in accordance with a study by Euet al., who also demonstrated a minor contribution of GSNO to the overall S-NO levels in macrophages (23Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A possible explanation of why GSNO did not accumulate in the cells could be a rapid metabolization. In support of this hypothesis, the thioredoxin system was shown to rapidly cleave NO out of GSNO in a cell-free system (29Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase was identified in eukaryotes, which specifically denitrosylates GSNO (21Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). We and others showed previously that apoptosis induction in endothelial cells was dependent on the caspase cascade, and that predominantly caspase-3 activity was inhibited by direct S-nitrosylation of the cysteine 163 in the active center of the caspase-3 p17 subunit (8Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). First evidence that this process is reversible came from Mannick et al., who reported a denitrosylation of the caspase-3 p17 subunit in iNOS-transfected B and T cells upon Fas-receptor stimulation (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, the data of the present study revealed that the stimulation of endothelial cells with pro-inflammatory or pro-atherogenic stimuli reduced theS-nitrosylation of distinct proteins in endothelial cells and specifically reduced the S-nitrosylation of the p17 subunit of caspase-3. The decline of S-nitrosylation could be due to an inhibition of eNOS expression and/or NO bioavailability induced by TNFα-mediated eNOS mRNA destabilization (27Alonso J. Sanchez de Miguel L. Monton M. Casado S. Lopez-Farre A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5719-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or increased oxidative stress (30Peterson T.E. Poppa V. Ueba H. Wu A. Yan C.

Quaschning T. Malinski T. Gygi D. Ullrich V. Luscher T.F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1731-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, pharmacological inhibition of NO synthesis for 18 h withl-arginine-l-NAME or l-NMMA did not decrease the S-NO levels, although control experiments confirmed the inhibition of eNOS (data not shown). These data indicate that the intracellular S-nitrosylation under basal conditions is very stable, which is in accordance with a recent study by Mannick et al. (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reduction ofS-nitrosylation by incubation with TNFα or oxLDL seems to be caused by an active denitrosylation process rather than a decline inde novo S-nitrosylation. The molecular mechanism underlying this denitrosylation requires further investigation. In bacteria, constitutive and inducible enzymes exist, which cleaveS-NO to NO (32Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 33Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. De Angelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a metabolic enzyme with GSNO reductase activity was identified in cytokine-stimulated macrophages, which also can reduce protein-S-NO (21Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). However, since GSNO is the preferred substrate (21Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether this reductase can mediate TNFα- or oxLDL-induced denitrosylation. The regulation of S-nitrosylation may importantly contribute to cellular signaling and endothelial function. Specifically, the inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis has at least in part been attributed to the blockade of caspase via S-nitrosylation. The reversal of the S-nitrosylation may allow for caspase-activation, which is required for apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, S-nitrosylation of various other proteins was detected under basal conditions. The identity of these proteins needs to be defined in future studies. Given that small GTP-binding proteins, kinases, proteases and transcription factors are known to beS-nitrosylated, one may speculate that the reversal of theS-nitrosylation by pro-inflammatory or pro-atherosclerotic factors may play a crucial role in cellular signaling.

Invest. 1994; 94: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,15Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Liang Y.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with digitonin-permeabilized insulin-producing RINm5F cells provide evidence that glucokinase interacts with an as yet unidentified protein factor capable of modulating the activity (15Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The existence of this protein is supported by morphological data that report changes in the spatial distribution of glucokinase immunostaining in response to the nutritional status (16Noma Y. Bonner Weir S. Latimer J.B. Davalli A.M. Weir G.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Jörns A. Tiedge M. Lenzen S. Virchows Arch. 1999; 434: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with glucokinase, we used a random peptide phage display library to select epitopes with high binding affinity. Through this strategy two glucokinase-binding peptide consensus sequences were identified that showed a high homology to (i) the GRP of the liver (27Detheux M. Vandekerckhove J. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and (ii) to the bifunctional regulatory enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) (28Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Okar D.A. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabate A. Riera L. Bartrons R. Lange A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 30-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In particular, the binding of glucokinase to PFK-2/FBPase-2 may help to explain recent observations of metabolic channeling of glycolysis in liver (30Cascante M. Centelles J.J. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 899-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of glucokinase with PFK-2/FBPase-2 might as well have a regulatory role in metabolic stimulus-secretion coupling in beta cells because the bifunctional enzyme is also expressed in pancreatic islets. Collagenase P, restriction enzymes, the SP6/T7 transcription kit and the DIG nucleic acid detection kit were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hybond N nylon membranes, the ECL detection system, and the autoradiography films were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Guanidine thiocyanate was from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany). Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes for the cloning procedures were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Fermentas (Fermentas, St. Leo-Rot, Germany). Custom oligonucleotide synthesis was done by Life Technologies, Inc. or MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Media and supplements for culture of yeast were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Columns for DNA purification were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). All other reagents of analytical grade were from Merck. Human beta cell glucokinase protein was expressed in M15 Escherichia coli bacteria and purified by Ni-NTA metal chelate chromatography as described (31Tiedge M. Krug U. Lenzen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was immobilized by His tag on Ni-NTA-HisSorbTM strips (Qiagen). 200 μl of the protein solution (50 μg/ml glucokinase protein in 0.1m NaHCO3) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation in the microplate wells. Thereafter the supernatant was removed, and the wells were blocked with 300 μl of blocking buffer (5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 0.1 mNaHCO3) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The selection of peptides able to bind to glucokinase was performed with the Ph.D.-12TM phage display peptide library (New England Biolabs). The combinatorial library of random 12-mer peptides was incubated in glucokinase-coated and blocked wells for 1 h at room temperature. A control experiment using only blocked wells was also performed to exclude unspecific binding. The following biopanning procedure was carried out according to the instructions in the manufacturer's manual. Specifically bound phages were eluted by disruption with glycine buffer or by incubation with 100 μl of the protein solution (200 μg/ml glucokinase protein in 0.1 m NaHCO3). The recovered phages were amplified in ER2537 E. coli bacteria, and the phage titer was expressed as plaque-forming units. The whole procedure was repeated three to four times, and individual phage clones of each panning were selected. Phage DNA of single colonies were prepared using the QIAprep Spin M13 kit (Qiagen) and characterized by dideoxy chain sequencing (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). The programs PeptideSearch (EMBL, Protein & Peptide Group, Heidelberg, Germany; www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de) and Bic2 (EBI, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK; www.ebi.ac.uk) were used for homology searches comparing amino acid sequences of glucokinase interacting peptides with sequences listed in the data bases Swall, Swissprot, and Trembl. The conditions in the ELISA experiments were essentially the same as those used in the panning procedure, and all washing steps were performed as described in the manufacturer's manual. Blocking buffer was prepared with 2.5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline. 2-fold serial dilution of consensus sequence displaying phages starting from 1015 phages/well were analyzed for binding to glucokinase. 200 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; diluted 1:5000 in blocking solution) was added to each well, and bound phages were visualized using 2′,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) in citrate buffer as substrate for the peroxidase. The A405 values were measured after 20 min of incubation using a htIII microplate reader (Anthos, Köln, Germany). 2 μg of total RNA from freshly isolated islets from Wistar rats were subjected to cDNA synthesis by LD PCR (18 cycles) according to the protocol of the SMART cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH). 1 or 5 μl from the spin column-purified islet cDNA (corresponding to 50 and 250 ng of cDNA) were used for the specific PFK-2/FBPase-2 RACE PCR reaction (3 min of initial denaturation at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C or 58 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C; 5 min of end extension at 72 °C in a total volume of 100 μl) with the SMART 5′ PCR forward primer (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′) and the rat PFK-2/FBPase-2 consensus reverse primer (5′-(G/C)AC(A/G)TGGAT(A/G)TTCAT-(G/C)AGGTA(A/G)TA-3′), which contained wobble bases according to the various isoforms. 10 μl of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 RACE PCR products were separated in a 1% Sea-Plaque GTG low melting gel. Specific bands were sliced from the gel (20–30 μl) and used for Taq polymerase-amplified cloning into the pTOPO vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 RACE PCR fragments were obtained by the dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using a LiCor 4200 automated sequencer (MWG Biotech). Homology plots were generated by Fasta3 and NCBI-Blast2 searches (EBI) on the basis of GenBankTM cDNA sequences of different PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoforms from the rat. A full-length rat islet PFK-2/FBPase-2 cDNA was amplified from LD islet cDNA with specific primers coding for the brain isoform of rat PFK-2/FBPase-2 (5′-TAGCAGGATCCATGTCTGAGAATAGTACATTTTCCA-3′; 5′-TAGTAGTCGACTCAGGAGAGCAAAGTGAGG-3′) and subcloned with BamHI and SalI restriction sites into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) followed by sequence analysis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with the Matchmaker GAL4 system 2 (CLONTECH) as described in the manufacturer's manual. Cloning procedures were performed as described previously (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The coding cDNA sequence of the human beta cell glucokinase was amplified by PCR from the pQE30-GK plasmid (31Tiedge M. Krug U. Lenzen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with primers containing NcoI and XhoI restriction sites and subcloned in frame to the activation domain (AD) into pACT2 (CLONTECH). PFK-2/FBPase-2 coding cDNAs for rat liver (35Darville M.I. Crepin K.M. Vandekerckhove J. Van Damme J. Octave J.N. Rider M.H. Marchand M.J. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number Y00702) and rat brain/islet (36Watanabe F. Sakai A. Furuya E. Uyeda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number S67900) were amplified by PCR from the corresponding pQE30 plasmid with composite rimers containing SmaI and BamHI restriction sites and subcloned in frame to the binding domain (BD) into pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). Additionally the kinase domain (amino acid residues 1–257) and the bisphosphatase domain (amino acid residues 258–470) of the liver PFK-2/FBPase-2 were subcloned separately into the pAS2-1 (BD) vector by the same method. All constructs were verified by sequence analyses of the inserts. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG1945 (CLONTECH) was simultaneously transformed with pACT2 or pACT2-GK and each of the pAS2-1-GRP wild type and mutant plasmids by using the lithium acetate procedure (37Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Activation of the HIS3 reporter construct was determined by growth on selection SD agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine after 5 days. For the quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase reporter gene activity, the host strain Y190 (CLONTECH) was transformed in the same way, and yeast was grown on SD agar plates without leucine and tryptophan. The resulting transformed yeast clones were grown in SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan overnight. The yeast protein was isolated from the cell pellet by vigorous vortexing with glass beads (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in phosphate buffer as described (38Ciriacy M. Breitenbach I. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 152-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble material was pelleted at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C for a period of 30 s. Protein content of the solution was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. For the quantitative chemiluminescent β-galactosidase reporter gene assay, the protein solution was added to Galacto Star reaction buffer (Tropix, Bedford, MA) as described by the manufacturer. The light emission was recorded as a 1-s integral in a microplate using a Victor2luminometer (Wallac, Freiburg, Germany), and the specific activity was calculated in relation to β-galactosidase standard values and protein content. Pancreatic islets from fed male Wistar rats (300–400 g of body weight) were isolated by collagenase digestion. When other tissues were used they were also taken from Wistar rats. Rat pancreatic islets were purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and were used immediately for isolation of RNA. Total RNA from rat tissues was isolated by a combined water saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction with an addition of ultrapure glycogen to achieve full precipitation of islet RNA (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA/lane was subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing formamide/formaldehyde 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization was performed as described before (15Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using 11-DIG-UTP-labeled antisense cRNA probes coding for rat liver PFK-2/FBPase-2 and rat islet/brain PFK-2/FBPase-2 (36Watanabe F. Sakai A. Furuya E. Uyeda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DIG-labeled hybrids were detected by an enzyme-linked immunoassay using an anti-DIG-alkaline-phosphatase antibody conjugate. The hybrids were visualized by chemiluminescence detection on a light-sensitive film for quantification by densitometry with the National Institutes of Health Image 1.58 program. Ribosomal bands were used as control markers for gel loading (not shown). The data are expressed as the mean values ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test for multiple comparison using the Prism analysis program (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). The sequence homologies between the islet and the liver PFK-2/FBPase-2 proteins were calculated by the DNASIS V2.1 program (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 12-mer random peptide M13 phage display library was used to screen immobilized human beta cell glucokinase for potential interaction partners. For this purpose recombinant glucokinase protein was fixed through the N-terminal His tag sequence to Ni-NTA-coated microplates. Aliquots of the phage library were allowed to interact with recombinant protein at room temperature for 1 h followed by wash procedures of increasing stringency (panning). Bound phages were recovered and reamplified for the next round of panning. Sequence analysis of enriched phages from the second to the fourth round of panning showed peptide inserts that matched to the consensus sequences SLKVWT (TableI, part A) and LSA XXVAG (TableI, part B). Of the 150 phage clones sequenced, 102 clones revealed the sequence motif LSAIVAG, indicating a strong interaction with the glucokinase protein (Table I). Through screening of the peptide data bases Swall, Swissprot, and Trembl by the PeptideSearch routine of the EMBL, the LSA XXVAG consensus motif showed a complete homology to the human (swissnew Q14397 GCKR human glucokinase regulatory protein) and rat (swissnew Q07071 GCKR rat glucokinase regulatory protein) GRP of the liver, which is a well characterized interaction partner of the glucokinase. The phage peptide sequence HGMKVWTLPATS, which was found in 10 clones by the panning procedure, could be aligned to the consensus motif SLKVWT (Table I, part A). Data base analysis revealed a complete match to the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, which is also known as phosphofructokinase type 2 (swissprot P0793 F261 rat 6PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase; swissprot P16118 F26L human 6PF-2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase). This bifunctional enzyme plays an important role for the metabolic and hormonal regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (or glucose-6-phosphate formation) in various tissues,e.g. liver, muscle, brain, and testis.Table ISequences of GK-binding peptides selected from a M13 phage display libraryThe sequences of peptides displayed by glucokinase-binding phage were isolated in three independent experiments each consisting of four rounds of high stringency panning from a 12-mer random peptide M13 phage display library. Two consensus peptide sequences A and B (shown with black background) were identified which were subjected to homology searches by the Peptide (EMBL) and Bic2 (EBI) program in the databases Swall, Swissprot, and Trembl. Amino acids 298–303 of the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2 correspond to consensus sequence A, and amino acids 181–188 of the rat liver GRP correspond to consensus sequence B. Open table in a new tab The sequences of peptides displayed by glucokinase-binding phage were isolated in three independent experiments each consisting of four rounds of high stringency panning from a 12-mer random peptide M13 phage display library. Two consensus peptide sequences A and B (shown with black background) were identified which were subjected to homology searches by the Peptide (EMBL) and Bic2 (EBI) program in the databases Swall, Swissprot, and Trembl. Amino acids 298–303 of the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2 correspond to consensus sequence A, and amino acids 181–188 of the rat liver GRP correspond to consensus sequence B. In the next step the interaction of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 and GRP consensus phage peptides were quantified by an ELISA binding assay (Fig. 1). The titration curves with the preferentially enriched phage clones HGMKVWTLPATS (corresponding to PFK-2/FBPase-2) and EYLSAIVAGPWP (corresponding to GRP) clearly show a significant binding affinity to immobilized glucokinase protein. The GRP motif exhibited a strong interaction with glucokinase that was significantly different from the background level at a concentration of 3.1 × 1013 phages/well (Fig. 1 B), whereas a significant binding of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 consensus motif was detectable at a concentration of 1.2 × 1014phages/well (Fig. 1 A). Control phages displaying 12-mer peptides with a random distribution of amino acids did not show any specific interaction with glucokinase protein (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the specific phages with the PFK-2/FBPase-2 and GRP consensus peptide sequences did not exhibit a specific binding to microplates that were blocked by skimmed milk. Recombinant glucokinase protein, which was eluted from the wells with 300 mm imidazoline, retained full catalytic activity, excluding nonspecific hydrophobic interaction with denatured glucokinase protein during the panning procedures (data not shown). To study the interaction of glucokinase with the novel interaction partner PFK-2/FBPase-2 and, for internal control, with the GRP of liver, the cDNAs were subcloned into the pAS2-1 (fusion to binding domain) or the pACT2 (fusion to activation domain) vector of the GAL4 system. Control experiments excluded nonspecific interactions of glucokinase, PFK-2/FBPase-2, and the GRP of liver with the truncated activation and binding domains of the vectors (data not shown). Furthermore, interactions of the proteins were not affected by the location within the binding domain or the activation domain. Quantitative analysis of the protein interactions by the β-galactosidase reporter enzyme clearly showed a strong binding of the GRP to glucokinase with a 12-fold increase of the reporter activity compared with background by the truncated activation domain and binding domain interaction (Fig. 2). The PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein exhibited a 4-fold increase of β-galactosidase activity above the background level (Fig. 2). The glucokinase protein did not bind to itself as shown by reporter activities that were not significantly different from the background level (Fig. 2). The PFK-2/FBPase-2 enzyme consists of two functional domains that confer the kinase and bisphosphatase activity. From the phage display peptide consensus motif the binding to glucokinase is conferred by the bisphosphatase domain. To verify this epitope for the separate domains of the bifunctional enzyme, yeast two-hybrid interaction studies were conducted with the kinase or the bisphosphatase domain fused to the binding domain of the pACT2 vector (Fig.3). These studies clearly indicated that the kinase domain of the PFK-2/ FBPase-2 enzyme did not interact with the glucokinase"

We have found that transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a mutant JAB (F59D-JAB) exhibited a more potent STAT3 activation and a more severe colitis than did wild-type littermates after treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. We now find that there is a prolonged activation of JAKs and STATs in response to a number of cytokines in T cells from Tg mice with lck promoter-driven F59D-JAB. Overexpression of F59D-JAB also sustained activation of JAK2 in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggested that F59D-JAB up-regulated STAT activity by sustaining JAK activation. To elucidate molecular mechanisms related to F59D-JAB, we analyzed the effects of F59D-JAB on the JAK/STAT pathway using the 293 cell transient expression system. We found that the C-terminal SOCS-box played an essential role in augmenting cytokine signaling by F59D-JAB. The SOCS-box interacted with the Elongin BC complex, and this interaction stabilized JAB. F59D-JAB induced destabilization of wild-type JAB, whereas overexpression of Elongin BC canceled this effect. Levels of endogenous JAB and CIS3 in T cells from F59D-JAB Tg-mouse were lower than in wild-type mice. We propose that F59D-JAB destabilizes wild-type, endogenous JAB and CIS3 by chelating the Elongin BC complex, thereby sustaining JAK activation.

To define the role of JAK/STAT signaling and their inhibitors, development of a dominant negative form of these inhibitors is quite important. Previously, we have shown that JAB specifically binds to the tyrosine residue (Tyr-1007) in the activation loop of JAK2, the phosphorylation of which is required for activation of kinase activity. An additional N-terminal 12-amino acid region (kinase inhibitory region) of JAB also contributes to high affinity binding to the JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain and is required to inhibit JAK2 signaling and kinase activity (5Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We also reported that a JAB mutant (F59D-JAB) containing a point mutation in the KIR region overcame the inhibitory effect of both JAB and CIS3 (14Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We developed transgenic (Tg) mice using β-actin promoter and showed that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced a more potent STAT3 activation and a more severe colitis in F59D-JAB-transgenic mice (Tg) than in their wild-type littermates (14Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the present work, we focused on how F59D-JAB modulates the JAK/STAT pathway in molecular mechanisms. F59D-JAB strongly augmented cytokine-induced JAK/STAT activation and proliferation when expressed in T cells. Using the 293 transient expression system, we found that wild-type JAB was destabilized by F59D-JAB overexpression, in a SOCS-box-dependent manner, and levels of endogenous JAB and CIS3 were reduced in T cells from Tg mice. These data suggest that the C-terminal SOCS-box plays an important role in stabilizing endogenous CIS proteins and that the SOCS-box will be a new target for regulating intensity of cytokine actions. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum (CS). A mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 ng/ml of murine IL-3. Stable Ba/F3 transformants were obtained by electroporation with pcDNA3 carrying Myc-tagged full-length F59D-JAB and were selected with 1.0 mg/ml G418, and three positive clones were maintained in 0.5 mg/ml G418. LIF- and EPO-dependent STAT3 and STAT5 reporter activity in 293 cells transfected with Myc- or FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant JAB cDNA was assayed as described previously (5Yasukawa H. Misawa H.

Ras-MAPK activity was measured in an Elk-1 reporter assay (PathDetect in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all reporter assays, 1 × 105 of 293 cells grown in 6-well dishes were used for transfection with the calcium phosphate method. Two substitution mutants of JAB, F59D (mutation in the kinase inhibitory region) and R105E (mutation in the SH2 domain), were derived from murine JAB and generated using standard polymerase chain reaction methods. cDNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA3-Myc or pCMV2-FLAG as described previously (16Endo T.A.

The supernatants were incubated with indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune-complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

The F59D cDNA subcloned in pMX-IRES-EGFP was transfected into the PLAT-E packaging cell line using the FUGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to obtain the viruses as described (17Sasaki A.

Then, after being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum containing various concentrations of IL-3 and incubated for a further 7 days. Infected cells expressing EGFP were analyzed with a fluorescence flow cytometer. To develop transgenic (Tg) mice, an lck proximal promoter- and Eµ enhancer-driven F59D-JAB expression vector was constructed by subcloning the F59D-JAB cDNA (5Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H.

After digestion withSalI and NotI, the fragment-containing promoter F59D-JAB cDNA as well as the 3′ non-coding region was used for microinjection into zygotes of C57BL6XC3H (B6C3-F1) parents. Eggs surviving microinjection were transferred into oviducts of recipient pseudo-pregnant females as described previously (4Matsumoto A. Seki Y. Kubo M. Ohtsuka S. Suzuki A. Hayashi I. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Okabe M. Yamada S. Yoshimura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6396-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail genomic DNA (5′-AGAGCTTGGGCGACCTCACC-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTAGTCACGGAGTACC-3′). Three independent lines of Tg mice were established, and B6C3XC57BL6-F2 mice were used for experiments. Protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. Thymocytes and splenic T cells were obtained as described previously (4Matsumoto A. Seki Y. Kubo M. Ohtsuka S. Suzuki A. Hayashi I. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Okabe M. Yamada S. Yoshimura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6396-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For IL-2 and IL-4 stimulation, thymocytes and splenic T cells were preincubated with 2.5 µg/ml ConA for 36 h (4Matsumoto A. Seki Y. Kubo M. Ohtsuka S. Suzuki A. Hayashi I. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Okabe M. Yamada S. Yoshimura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6396-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). F59D-JAB Transgenic mice and their littermates (10–12 weeks of age) were used for experiments. ConA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 200 µl of pyrogen-free saline and given intravenously through the tail vein of mice at a dose of 0.2 mg/mouse. Sera from individual mice were obtained by cardiac puncture 24 h after the ConA injection. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were measured by standard photometric methods, using an automatic analyzer (Hitachi type 7170, Tokyo). Data are expressed as the mean (±S.D.) of five animals per group. Statistical analysis was made using Student'st test, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. We earlier found STAT3 hyperactivation in the colon of β-actin promoter-driven F59D-JAB Tg mice treated with DSS. However, the transgene did not contain a tag for detection, and levels of F59D-JAB in T cells were not so high in these Tg mice. To facilitate further molecular analysis of F59D-JAB-mediated modulation of JAK/STAT pathway in vivo, we developed Tg mice using thelck proximal promoter with the intrinsic enhancer from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (Eµ) to express F59D-JAB in lymphocytes. We found that endogenous JAB was highly expressed in thymus and spleen (11Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, Myc-F59D-JAB expression was confirmed in the thymus and spleen of three independent lines by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibodies. Northern hybridization indicated that the expression levels of F59D-JAB were 10–50 times higher than that for endogenous JAB (data not shown). The number of thymic T cells and cellularity of the spleen were the same as wild-type littermates (data not shown). Gross and histological analyses of the thymus and spleen from F59D-JAB Tg mice revealed no abnormalities in normal conditions. However, the Tg mice were more sensitive to liver injury induced by concanavalin A (ConA) than were the wild-type littermates, which has been shown to be dependent on IFNγ and T cells (20Kusters S. Gantner F. Kunstle G. Tiegs G. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 462-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 21Tagawa Y. Sekikawa K. Iwakura Y. J.

Med. 2000; 191: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that F59D-JAB augments inflammatory responses of hepatic T cells to ConA/IFNγ. Next, we evaluated effects of F59D-JAB overexpression on the IL-2 or IL-4-induced proliferation of T cells. These cells isolated from the spleen were incubated with various amounts of IL-2 or IL-4. As shown in Fig. 2, proliferative responses of T cells from F59D-JAB mice to both IL-2 and IL-4 were much higher than those from non-Tg littermates. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced proliferation of T cells was not affected by F59D-JAB expression in T cells (data not shown). These data indicate that overexpression of F59D-JAB in T cells enhances responses to several cytokines. Similar results were obtained in other two Tg lines. To define effects of F59D-JAB on the JAK/STAT pathway, we examined STATs phosphorylation in response to several cytokines (Fig.3). Constitutive activation of STATs was not observed in F59D-JAB Tg mice. However, when thymocytes and splenic T cells were stimulated with several cytokines, phosphorylation of STATs in T cells from F59D-JAB Tg mice was sustained longer than seen with wild-type littermates. The results are listed in Fig.3A; tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to IFNγ, that of STAT3 in response to LIF, that of STAT5 in response to IL-2, that of STAT4 in response to IL-12, and that of STAT6 in response to IL-4. Similar results were obtained in other two transgenic lines. Because F59D-JAB augmented various cytokines and STATs, F59D-JAB probably up-regulates JAK kinase activity. Thus, we examined IL-2-induced JAK1 phosphorylation in T cells. As shown in Fig.3B, IL-2-induced JAK1 phosphorylation was more extensive and was sustained for a longer period in T cells from Tg mice than from wild-type littermates. However, F59D-JAB did not augment ERK activation in response to PMA, which activates the protein kinase C pathway (23Sharp L.L. Schwarz D.A. Bott C.M. Marshall C.J. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 1997; 7: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the effect of F59D-JAB is cytokine/JAK-specific. To determine molecular mechanisms of augmentation of cytokine signaling by F59D-JAB, F59D-JAB cDNA was introduced into IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with a bicistronic retrovirus vector pMX-IRES-EGFP (24Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because the infected cells expressed both EGFP and F59D-JAB, the percentage of infected cells was determined as the EGFP-positive rate using flow cytometry. As seen previously, WT-JAB induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells in the presence of IL-3, thus indicating that WT-JAB blocked IL-3/JAK2 signaling. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4A, the population of F59D-JAB-infected Ba/F3 cells increased with low concentrations of IL-3 (10 and 50 pg/ml IL3). At high levels of IL-3 (100 and 1000 pg/ml), the growth rate of F59D-JAB-infected cells was equal to that seen in non-infected cells, which is probably due to full activation of JAK2 in response to high concentrations of IL-3. To explore the possibility that the F59D-JAB mutant suppressed the down-regulation of JAK kinase activity, we prepared two lines of stable Ba/F3 transformants expressing F59D-JAB. These Ba/F3 transformants survived longer than did the parental Ba/F3 cells when IL-3 was depleted (data not shown). Then we examined the time course of dephosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5, and MAPK (Fig. 4B). Ba/F3-F59D-JAB transformants and parental Ba/F3 cells were stimulated with IL-3 for 30 min, then the cells were cultured without IL-3 for various periods. Dephosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5, and MAPK (ERK1/2) was slower in Ba/F3-F59D cells than in parental Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that F59D-JAB augmented IL-3 signaling by suppressing dephosphorylation or degradation of the activated JAK2. Because both STAT5 and MAPK are downstream of JAK2, prolonged activation of STAT5 and MAPK is probably due to the sustained activation of JAK2. As noted earlier, LIF-dependent STAT3 and EPO-dependent STAT5 reporter gene activation in 293 cells were completely inhibited by expression of wild-type (WT) JAB or CIS3 (7Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.5A, JAB mutants of F59D and R105E did not suppress STAT3 and STAT5 activity, rather enhanced their transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.1-µg plasmid transfection, LIF-dependent STAT3 activation was about 3-fold higher than without mutant JAB constructs. This effect was stimulation-dependent, because basal transcriptional activity without cytokines was marginally affected. To determine if this effect is cytokine-dependent, EGF- and v-src-induced STAT3 activation was measured. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, F59D-JAB did not affect the STAT3 activation induced by EGF and v-src. F59D-JAB also did not augment MAPK activation in response to EGF (Fig. 5D). Therefore, the effect of F59D-JAB is likely to be cytokine- and JAK-specific. Among the CIS family, both JAB and CIS3 can directly interact with JAKs (5Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 6Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A. Kamizono S. Syoda T. Kinjyo I. Sasaki M. Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 39-351Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We reported that F59D-JAB could overcome the negative effect of wild-type JAB and CIS3 (14Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, we proposed that F59D-JAB augmented cytokine-dependent STAT activation by suppressing the effect of endogenous wild-type JAB and CIS3. We hypothesized that F59D-JAB prevents the binding of endogenous JAB and CIS3 to the JAK catalytic pocket, because this mutant lacks one of the two JAK binding regions (SH2 domain and KIR). However, we found that the N-terminal truncation mutant (dN75), which lacks both functional KIR and SH2 domain could augment STAT3 activity (Fig.6A). This event could not be explained by the simple competition model. In contrast, the C-terminal SOCS-box deletion mutant (F59D-dC40) did not increase STAT3 activity (Fig. 6A). We also found that R105E-dC40 did not enhance STAT3 activity (data not shown). Therefore, the SOCS-box seems to be important for augmentation of STAT activation. It was reported that the SOCS-box interacts with the Elongin BC complex and that the binding of Elongin BC complex stabilizes wild-type JAB (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of Elongin BC overexpression. As shown in Fig. 6B, overexpression of Elongin B or Elongin C alone had little effect on F59D-JAB; however, overexpression of Elongin B and Elongin C together overcame the effects of F59D-JAB. Overexpression of the Elongin BC complex alone did not directly affect LIF-induced STAT3 activation. Therefore, the SOCS-box and Elongin BC complex are closely involved in the hyperactivation of JAK/STATs by F59D-JAB. Because it has been shown that the Elongin BC complex stabilizes wild-type JAB (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), we considered that F59D-JAB destabilizes endogenous, wild-type JAB and CIS3 by chelating the Elongin BC complex. Thus, we examined effects of F59D-JAB on the stability of wild-type JAB. F59D-JAB did not affect JAK2 and STAT5 stability (Fig.7A). However, as shown in Fig.7B, half-life of wild-type JAB shortened by co-expression of F59D-JAB. In contrast, the C-terminal SOCS-box deletion mutant (F59D-dC40) did not influence the stability of wild-type JAB. The acceleration of degradation of wild-type JAB by F59D-JAB was blocked by overexpression of Elongin BC as did treating the cells with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 7C). These data support our hypothesis. For verification in Tg mice, we detected the levels of endogenous JAB and CIS3 in F59D-JAB overexpressing T cells. As noted earlier (11Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), T cells expressed high levels of endogenous JAB prior to cytokine stimulation, and CIS3 was induced in response to LIF in wild-type littermates (WT in Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8 (right panels), the levels of endogenous JAB and CIS3 in thymocytes from F59D-JAB transgenic mice were significantly reduced compared with those in wild-type littermates. These data strongly supported our proposal that F59D-JAB induced degradation of endogenous JAB and CIS3 by occupying the Elongin BC complex, thereby sustaining the activation of JAKs. We demonstrated that F59D-JAB augmented cytokine-dependent signaling both in vivo andin vitro. The effect of F59D-JAB was selective to cytokine-induced STAT activation, because F59D-JAB did not affect EGF- or v-src-induced STAT activation in 293 cells. We also confirmed that PMA- and ConA-induced MAPK activation in T cells from mice were not affected by F59D-JAB (data not shown). We further demonstrated that F59D-JAB overexpression resulted in hyperactivation of JAK1 in response to IL-2 in T cells as well as sustained JAK2 activation in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that F59D-JAB hyperactivates JAKs, thereby augmenting STAT activity. However, the molecular mechanism of augmentation of JAKs by F59D-JAB was not clarified. We first hypothesized that F59D-JAB blocked binding of endogenous, wild-type JAB and CIS3, because F59D-JAB lacks functional kinase inhibitory region (KIR) but still interacts with JAK activation loop through the SH2 domain. However, this is not the case, because the N-terminal deletion mutant (dN75), which does not bind to JAKs at all, could augment LIF-induced STAT3 activation. In contrast, we found that C-terminal SOCS-box played an essential role in this augmentation. Kamura et al. (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) found that the Elongin BC complex interacts with the SOCS-box and stabilizes wild-type JAB. Therefore, we then considered that F59D-JAB up-regulates JAKs by destabilizing endogenous JAB and CIS3 by chelating endogenous Elongin BC complex. This hypothesis was supported by observations that 1) overexpression of the Elongin BC complex overcame effects of F59D-JAB; 2) the C-terminal SOCS-box-deleted F59D-JAB did not increase STAT3 activation; and 3) F59D-JAB destabilized wild-type JAB and CIS3 in a proteasome-dependent manner. The mechanism of chelating the Elongin BC by F59D-JAB is just simple overexpression (the levels of F59D-JAB was at least 50 times higher than the endogenous JAB in Tg mice). F59D-JAB can bind to Elongins with equal affinity as wild-type JAB, but F59D-JAB does not inhibit JAKs. Thus, overexpressed F59D-JAB occupies Elongins, which reduces the number of endogenous JAB and CIS3 molecules interacting with Elongins. This increases the degradation of endogenous JAB and CIS3, because JAB and CIS3 without Elongins are unstable. The Elongin BC complex was identified initially to be a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A (26Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and subsequently as a component of the multiprotein von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) tumor-suppressor complex (28Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 29Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The Elongin BC complex has also been shown to interact with SOCS-box-containing proteins, including CIS family proteins as well as a protein family containing either a Ras-like domain, WD40 domains, ankyrin-like repeats, or an SPRY domain at their N terminus (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A.

A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of F59D-JAB may result form proteins other than endogenous JAB and CIS3. F59D-JAB could potentially affect other Elongin BC complex-interacting proteins such as VHL and Elongin A as well as other SOCS proteins. However, we did not see any gross abnormality other than cytokine responses in the F59D-JAB Tg mice driven by either β-actin or lck promoter. This could be merely due to a low level of expression of F59D-JAB protein in Tg mice using the β-actin promoter or restricted expression of F59D-JAB in Tg mice using thelck promoter, because we could not obtain Tg mice with high levels of F59D-JAB expression using the β-actin promoter (14Suzuki A.

Med. 2001; 193: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The phenotypic effect of F59D-JAB in Tg mice was observed only when cytokine levels were conditionally changed. For example, we observed a more severe inflammation when the Tg mice were treated with DSS or ConA, which induce production of high levels of IL6 and IFNγ, respectively. Therefore, the apparent effect of F59D-JAB may be specific to cytokines in vivo. Moreover, the effect of F59D-JAB may be specific for a class of SOCS-box-containing proteins, such as JAB and CIS3, because we found no changes in the half-life of CIS1 and VHL protein with the overexpression of F59D-JAB in 293 cells (data not shown). The specific effect of F59D-JAB on JAB and CIS3 could be explained by requirement of other factors in addition to Elongin BC. Cullin-2 (Cul-2) and Rbx-1 have been shown to interact with the VHL-Elongin BC complex (31Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Five or more Cullin-like molecules have been reported in mammals (32Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The JAB-Elongin BC complex may interact with a specific Cullin molecule, and this may afford specificity to cytokine signaling. Further study is necessary to define the mechanism for the specificity of F59D-JAB to some SOCS-box proteins. The functional significance of interactions between the Elongin BC complex and the SOCS-box is complicated (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G.

The VHL product contains an SOCS-box-like sequence that mediates the formation of a multiprotein VHL complex containing Elongin BC, Cul-2, and Rbx1 (25Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This VHL complex is thought to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. From the analogy of VHL, the SOCS-box has been proposed to target proteins to proteasomal destruction (33Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we have found that JAB induced proteasomal degradation of TEL-JAK2 in a SOCS-box-dependent manner (34Kamizono S. Hanada T. Yasukawa H. Minoguchi S. Kato R. Minoguchi M. Hattori K. Morita S. Kitamura T. Kato H. Nakayama K. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12530-12538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, on the contrary, Kamura et al. reported that overexpression of Elongin BC stabilized JAB, and we confirmed this effect. Narazaki et al. (35Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Matsumoto T. Morita Y. Saito H. Kajita T. Yoshizaki K. Naka T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) also reported that the JAB-SOCS-box does serve to protect JAB from degradation by the proteasome. Concerning the mechanism of F59D-JAB-induced degradation of wild-type JAB and CIS3, our data support the protective role of Elongin BC complex from proteasomal degradation. Thus our data support the notion that the Elongin BC-SOCS-box interaction could function at least in part to fine tune the concentration of CIS3 and JAB, or other CIS family proteins in cells and thus indirectly regulate activity of the target protein. Tg mice expressing F59D-JAB are useful for investigating the role of CIS/SOCS proteins in diseases in which cytokines are involved. We thank H. Ohgusu and M. Sasaki for excellent technical assistance, Ohara for editing the manuscript, and Dr. T. Kamura for valuable discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2008408183,"Colorectal cancer has been described in terms of genetic instability selectively affecting either microsatellite sequences (MIN) or chromosome number and structure (CIN). A subgroup with apparently stable, near-diploid chromosomes and stable microsatellites (MACS) also exists. These distinctions are important, partly because of their value in highlighting different pathways of carcinogenesis, and partly because of their direct relevance to prognosis. Study of early-onset cancer has often proved a fruitful resource for the identification of the nature and function of cancer susceptibility genes. In a study of colorectal cancer with stable microsatellite DNA, we describe 22 early-onset tumours (mean age=33), compared with 16 late-onset tumours (mean age=68). Both groups contained carcinomas with the MACS phenotype, characterized by near diploid DNA content, as defined by flow cytometry, and minimal chromosome arm deletion or amplification (six or less events per genome), determined by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Minimal chromosome imbalance correlated strongly with diploid DNA content (P<0.001). The proportion of MACS cancers was significantly greater in early-onset as compared to late-onset tumours (64 vs 13%, P=0.005). Of the chromosome arm imbalances commonly observed in late-onset tumours, only 18q- was observed more than twice amongst the 14 early-onset MACS tumours. Seventy-nine per cent of these MACS tumours were located in the distal colon, and 69% were at advanced clinico-pathological stages (with lymph node or distant metastasis). A positive family history of colorectal or other cancers was elicited in seven patients in the MACS early-onset group, and one additional patient in this group had a metachronous ovarian cancer. The results suggest that MACS cancer may have a genetic basis different from either MIN or CIN, and further studies of these cancers may lead to discovery of new mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and cancer susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2160670580,"Recently we demonstrated that the ability of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) to stimulate the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity in myeloid progenitor-like cells decreases when these cells differentiate into promonocytic cells. In addition, TNFα stimulation in the progenitor-like cell line HL-60 was shown to be mediated by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation and its binding to the 18-base pair sequence motifs of the IE1/2 enhancer. We demonstrate here that the cell differentiation-dependent reduction of TNFα stimulation is not due to insufficient NF-κB activation but correlates with increased synthesis of the monocyte differentiation-associated factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α and β. Overexpression of C/EBPα/β in HL-60 cells, which normally produce only very small amounts of C/EBP, stimulated the basal activity of the promoter in the absence of NF-κB but suppressed the stimulatory effect of TNFα. A novel C/EBP-binding site was identified in the IE1/2 enhancer directly downstream of a NF-κB site. In order to understand the mechanisms of interaction, we used an IE1/2 promoter mutant that failed to bind C/EBP at this position and several constructs that contained exclusively NF-κB- and/or C/EBP-binding sites upstream of the minimal IE1/2 promoter. We could demonstrate that C/EBPα/β interacts with NF-κB p65 and displays inhibitory activity even in the absence of direct DNA binding by forming p65-C/EBP-containing protein complexes bound to the NF-κB site. Moreover, C/EBP binding to the DNA adjacent to NF-κB supports the down-regulatory effect of C/EBPs possibly due to stabilization of a multimeric NF-κB-C/EBP complex. Our results show that cell differentiation factors may interfere with TNFα-induced human cytomegalovirus gene (re)activation.

However, TNFα did not directly influence reactivation of the virus in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes induced by allogenic stimulation (12Söderberg-Naucler C. Fish K.N. Nelson J.A. J. Clin.

Recently, we observed that TNFα strongly activates in vitro HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter in the undifferentiated granulocyte/macrophage progenitor-like cell line HL-60 (5Prösch S. Volk H.D. Reinke P. Pioch K. Döcke W.D. Krüger D.H. Monogr. Virol. 1998; 21: 29-41Crossref Google Scholar, 14Stein J. Volk H.D. Liebenthal C. Krüger D.H. Prösch S. J. Gen.

Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of TNFα on the IE1/2 promoter decreased as myeloid progenitor cells differentiated into (pro-)monocytic cells. In U937 and THP-1 cells (representing the phenotype of promonocytes and mature monocytes, respectively), the stimulatory effect of TNFα was reduced by about 70% and was completely abrogated, respectively, compared with HL-60 cells (14Stein J. Volk H.D. Liebenthal C. Krüger D.H. Prösch S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Differentiation of HL-60 cells also diminished the TNFα effect on the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter (14Stein J. Volk H.D. Liebenthal C. Krüger D.H. Prösch S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of TNFα on the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter in undifferentiated HL-60 cells is mediated via binding to its p55 type I receptor and subsequent activation of NF-κB heterodimer p65/p50 that binds in the nucleus to the 18-bp repetitive sequence motifs in the IE1/2 enhancer (5Prösch S. Volk H.D. Reinke P. Pioch K. Döcke W.D. Krüger D.H. Monogr. Virol. 1998; 21: 29-41Crossref Google Scholar, 15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this TNFα-induced signal transduction pathway was also identified in U937 and THP-1 cells indicating that the observed differentiation-dependent changes in TNFα-mediated regulation of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter cannot be explained by decreased activation of NF-κB p65/p50. The C/EBP family of transcription factors together with AP-1 and CREB/ATF belongs to the bZIP-binding proteins. Its four members C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, C/EBPδ form homo- or heterodimersin vitro and bind to various C/EBP-binding sites with similar affinities (16Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L.

The expression of C/EBP was shown to be differentiation-dependent and is thought to be involved in the regulation of adipocytes and monocyte/macrophages differentiation.

On the other hand, STAT6 and C/EBP as well as SP-1 and C/EBP synergistically activated the IL-4 dependent transcription of the germ line ε promoter and theCD11c integrin gene promoter, respectively (35Lopez-Rodriguez C.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that C/EBPα and -β can suppress NF-κB-mediated up-regulation of the native HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity by interaction with NF-κB p65. A novel functionally active C/EBP-binding site directly adjacent to an NF-κB-binding site in the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter was identified as the molecular target. In the absence of NF-κB, both C/EBPα and -β stimulated the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter by binding to this site. In the presence of NF-κB the functional interaction between C/EBP and NF-κB p65 did not necessarily require binding of C/EBPs to DNA; however, DNA binding enhanced the inhibitory effect of C/EBPs. The cell lines HL-60, U937, and THP-1 (ATCC CCL 240, CRL 1593 and TIB 202) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both certified for low endotoxin). The cells were shown to be mycoplasma-free by the Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection of the cells by the DEAE-dextran method and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay were performed as described previously (14Stein J. Volk H.D. Liebenthal C. Krüger D.H. Prösch S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 2.5 µg of plasmid DNA, and for co-transfection experiments up to 6 µg of plasmid DNA per 5 × 106cells were used. After transfection cells were grown in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TNFα (R & D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) for 48 h. The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined with the Bradford protein assay kit (Sigma). Transfection efficacy of different plasmids was determined by dot blot hybridization of DNA isolated from comparable cell extracts (identical protein concentration) with a 32P-labeled BamHI-DNA fragment of plasmid pRR55 containing the CAT gene as described previously (15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The CAT reporter gene plasmid pRR55 contains the whole native IE1/2 enhancer/promoter between nucleotide positions −671 and +52 with respect to the IE1/2 transcription start site upstream of the CAT reporter gene (39Fickenscher H. Stamminger T. Rüger R. Fleckenstein B. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid p4-18PCAT carries the minimal IE1/2 promoter between positions −52 and +52 in combination with four in-tandem copies of the 18-bp repetitive sequence motif of the IE1/2 enhancer upstream of the CAT gene (40Stamminger T.

The plasmids p4-18/EBPCAT and p4-18/2EBPCAT were constructed by insertion of one or two copies of the oligonucleotide EBP carrying the HCMV C/EBP-binding motif of the IE1/2 enhancer between nucleotides −97 and −80 (TableI) in plasmid p4-18PCAT. Plasmid construction followed the rules described by Stamminger et al. (40Stamminger T. Fickenscher H. Fleckenstein B. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

The EBPcons oligonucleotide was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Mutant plasmids pEBPmut and pNF-κBmut of the native IE1/2 enhancer/promoter in pRR55 were constructed using the Takara in vitro mutagenesis kit (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). Forin vitro mutagenesis the HindIII-XbaI fragment of plasmid pRR55 containing the complete IE1/2 enhancer/promoter sequence was recloned in pUC18HindIII/XbaI. Nucleotide exchanges in the C/EBP-binding site and the adjacent NF-κB-binding site were introduced into pRR55 using the EBPmut oligonucleotide (5′-TTCCAAAAcGcCGTAACA-3′) and the NF-κBmut oligonucleotide (5′-ATCAACGcGATTTCCAA-3′), respectively. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and re-cloned into pRR55 upstream of the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1). Preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed basically as described elsewhere (15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µg of nuclear extracts from untreated or TNFα-treated (5 ng/ml for 2–5 h) cells were incubated with 0.1–1 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotides in a 20-µl reaction mixture for 20 min at room temperature. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. The reaction mixture for C/EBP binding contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmEDTA, 1.5 µg of poly(dI-dC) and 10% glycerin. Binding of NF-κB and CREB-1/ATF-1 was performed as described (15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Staak K. Prösch S. Stein J. Priemer C. Ewert R. Döcke W.D. Krüger D.H. Volk H.D. Reinke P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris glycine buffer. Rabbit antisera against NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, ATF-1, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclear proteins (50 µg) from untreated or TNFα-treated HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells were denatured for 3 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer, separated on a 10% denaturating SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) using a Mini Tank Electroblotter “OWL” (Cambridge, UK). To avoid unspecific binding, membranes were blocked for 24 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% neonatal calf serum, 0.2% Tween, and 0.04% NaN3. After washing five times in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% Tween for 10 min at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with the C/EBPα antisera (1:2.000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) or, as a control, with an actin-specific antiserum (1:1.000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature, repeatedly washed, and incubated for 2 h with anti-rabbit antibody Immunopure R Donkey (1:2.000; Pierce), and again washed repeatedly. To visualize the protein-antibody complexes, the membranes were treated with the chemiluminescent substrate “SupersignalR Ultra” (Pierce) and analyzed using a Bioblock scientific (Raytest, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed using the parameter-free Friedman test and Wilcoxson Signed Ranks Test for comparison of paired samples. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. A novel C/EBP-binding site was identified in the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer between nucleotides −83 and −90 with respect to the IE1/2 transcription start site, closely downstream to an NF-κB site that is localized between positions −93 and −104 (Fig.1). Specific binding of C/EBP to this sequence was demonstrated in EMSA with nuclear extracts from THP-1 (Fig. 2) and U937 (see below) cells. In the presence of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either the HCMV-specific or a consensus C/EBP-binding sequence, C/EBP binding could be competed very efficiently (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and4). In contrast to this, addition of oligonucleotides containing either a mutated C/EBP-binding site (“EBPm”) or the HCMV-specific 18-bp NF-κB-binding sequence (“18”) had no influence on formation of the C/EBP-DNA complex (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). By supershift experiments with antisera specific for C/EBPα or -β, generations of slower migrating protein-DNA complexes were observed indicating that the oligonucleotide-bound protein complex consists of both C/EBPα and -β (Fig. 2, lanes 6, 7, and 9). In control experiments no supershift was observed with antisera specific for ATF-1 (Fig. 2, lane 10), NF-κB protein p65 (Fig. 2, lane 11), or NF-κB protein p50 (data not shown). In addition to C/EBP three other proteins of lower molecular weights seem to bind to the EBP oligonucleotide of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer (marked by asterisks). These proteins did not react with the C/EBP-specific antibodies, and their binding to the DNA was not competed for by the C/EBP consensus oligonucleotide (but by the HCMV EBP oligonucleotide itself, Fig. 2, lanes 2 and4) indicating that these unknown proteins are different from C/EBPα/β. Low amounts of these proteins were also detectable in HL-60 cells; however, the nature of these proteins is still unknown. As recently demonstrated, TNFα causes a strong stimulation of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity in HL-60 cells. In the more differentiated premonocytic and monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1, TNFα only moderately stimulates and even reduces the promoter activity, respectively (Fig.3A, see also Ref. 14Stein J. Volk H.D. Liebenthal C. Krüger D.H. Prösch S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The lack of TNFα-mediated IE1/2 enhancer/promoter stimulation in U937 and THP-1 is not due to the absence of NF-κB activations in these cells. As shown by EMSA NF-κB binding activity after TNFα treatment was similar in all three cell lines (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Furthermore, NF-κB activation after TNFα treatment followed a comparable time course in all three cell lines (not shown). Interestingly, the expression of the transcription factors C/EBPα and β showed a cell- and differentiation-dependent pattern. In nuclear extracts from untreated and TNFα-treated HL-60 cells, no or only very low levels of C/EBPα and β were observed using both EMSA (Fig. 3B,lanes 7 and 8) and Western blot analysis (Fig.3C, I, lanes 1 and 2). Whereas the expression and binding activity of C/EBPα/β in nuclear extracts of premonocytic U937 cells showed intermediate levels, the monocytic THP-1 cells displayed the highest (EMSA: Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10 versus 11 and12; Western blot: Fig. 3C, I, lanes 5and 6 versus 3 and 4). In comparison, the CREB-1/ATF-1 binding activities to the 19-bp sequence motif of the IE1/2 enhancer and actin expression were similar in all three cell lines and were not influenced by TNFα (Fig. 3B,lanes 13–18; Fig. 3C, II, lanes 1–6), suggesting the specificity of C/EBP expression. The identity of the proteins bound to the 18- or 19-bp sequence motifs has been shown earlier (15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Staak K. Prösch S. Stein J. Priemer C. Ewert R. Döcke W.D. Krüger D.H. Volk H.D. Reinke P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the influence of C/EBPα and -β on the basal activity and the TNFα/NF-κB-dependent stimulation of the native IE1/2 enhancer/promoter in monocytic cells, HL-60 cells (not expressing significant levels of C/EBPs or NF-κB) were co-transfected with pRR55 and pMSV/EBPα or pMSV/EBPβ and cultivated in the absence or presence of TNFα. As a control for possible promoter interference, HL-60 cells were co-transfected with pRR55 and pMSV. The data show that the basal activity of the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter was significantly up-regulated in the presence of increasing amounts of C/EBPα (Fig.4A) or C/EBPβ (Fig.4B). In contrast, the powerful TNFα-mediated IE1/2 enhancer/promoter stimulation was significantly inhibited with increasing intracellular levels of C/EBPα or -β (Fig.5, A and B) (Friedman test, p < 0.05). Co-transfection with 2 µg of C/EBPα or -β expressing plasmid reduced the TNFα-dependent stimulation rate in HL-60 cells by about 60%, comparable with the level of TNFα-mediated stimulation observed in U937 cells that express C/EBPα/β constitutively (see Fig.3A). Co-transfection with either 1 or 2 µg of pMSV control vector neither increased basal activity of the promoter (0.9 ± 0.24- and 1.125 ± 0.55-fold, respectively, versuscontrol) nor inhibited the TNFα-dependent stimulation of CAT expression in pRR55-transfected HL-60 cells (7.88 ± 2.1- and 8.3 ± 2.43-fold, respectively, versus 6.13 ± 1.23-fold in cells transfected with pRR55 alone).Figure 5C/EBPα and -β suppress the stimulatory effect of TNFα on theHCMVIE1/2 enhancer/promoter in HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells co-transfected with pRR55 and pMSV/EBPα (A) or pMSV/EBPβ (B) were incubated in the absence or presence of TNFα (5 ng/ml). CAT activity was measured after 48 h of incubation. The graph represent mean value (± S.E.) of five independent experiments. For C/EBPα significant dose-dependent differences in TNFα-stimulation were demonstrated (p < 0.05, Friedman test). *,p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In further experiments HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells were transfected with pRR55 and increasing amounts of the plasmids p65 or p50, encoding the two NF-κB proteins found to be involved in TNFα-dependent regulation of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter (15Prösch S. Staak K. Stein J. Liebenthal C. Stamminger T. Volk H.D. Krüger D.H. Virology. 1995; 208: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whereas p50 alone had no effect on the promoter activity (not shown), NF-κB p65 induced a strong dose-dependent stimulation of the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter as observed for TNFα. As shown for TNFα (Fig. 3A), p65-mediated stimulation of the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity was also dependent on differentiation of the target cells (Fig.6A). In HL-60 cells the effect of p65 was much stronger compared with U937 and THP-1 cells. To investigate whether C/EBP functionally interacts with NF-κB p65, HL-60 cells were co-transfected with pRR55 and increasing amounts of plasmid p65 in the absence or presence of pMSV/EBPα. As demonstrated in Fig. 6B co-expression of C/EBPα resulted in a significant reduction of p65-induced promoter stimulation. Similarly, when HL-60 cells were"
https://openalex.org/W2043982988,"Two major signaling pathways, those triggered by estrogen (E(2)) and by the Wnt family, interact in the breast to cause growth and differentiation. The estrogen receptors ER(alpha) and ER(beta) are activated by binding E(2) and act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. The effector for the Wnt family is the Tcf family of transcription factors. Both sets of transcription factors recognize discrete but different nucleotide sequences in the promoters of their target genes. By using transient transfections of reporter constructs for the osteopontin and thymidine kinase promoters in rat mammary cells, we show that Tcf-4 antagonizes and Tcf-1 stimulates the effects of activated ER/E(2). For mutants of the former promoter, the stimulatory effects of ER(alpha)/E(2) can be made to be dependent on Tcf-1, and for the latter promoter the effects of the T cell factors (TCFs) are dependent on ER/E(2). Direct interaction between ERs and Tcfs either at the Tcf/ER(alpha)-binding site on the DNA or in the absence of DNA is established by gel retardation assays or by coimmunoprecipitation/biosensor methods, respectively. These results show that the two sets of transcription factors can interact directly, the interaction between ERs and Tcf-4 being antagonistic and that between ERs and Tcf-1 being synergistic on the activity of the promoters employed. Since Tcf-4 is the major Tcf family member in the breast, it is suggested that the antagonistic interaction is normally dominant in vivo in this tissue."

TLRs and CD14 possess repeats of the leucine-rich motif. To address the role of the extracellular domain of TLR2 in PGN signaling, we constructed CD14/TLR2 chimeras, in which residues 1–356 or 1–323 of CD14 were substituted for the extracellular domain of TLR2, and five deletion mutants of TLR2, in which the progressively longer regions of extracellular TLR2 regions were deleted. PGN induced NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 but not in cells expressing CD14/TLR2 chimeras.

In addition, NF-κB activity elicited by PGN was significantly attenuated in the presence of synthetic peptide corresponding to the TLR2 region Ser40-Ile64. From these results, we conclude that; 1) CD14 cannot functionally replace the extracellular domain of TLR2 in PGN signaling; 2) the TLR2 region Cys30-Ser39 is not required for PGN recognition; 3) the TLR2 region containing Ser40-Ile64 is critical for PGN recognition.

To address the role of the extracellular domain of TLR2 in PGN signaling, we constructed CD14/TLR2 chimeras, in which mCD14 (residues 1–356) or sCD14 (residues 1–323) was substituted for the extracellular domain of TLR2, and five deletion mutants of TLR2, in which the progressively longer regions of extracellular TLR2 regions were deleted. This study demonstrates the importance of the amino-terminal region of TLR2 containing Ser40-Ile64 in PGN signaling.

The mutant cDNAs were produced by PCR and the overlap extension method (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) using cDNAs for human CD14 and human TLR2 as templates. The two primers used at the sCD14/TLR2 chimera splicing junctions were 5′-CATGCCAGACACCAGGCCCTCGTGGGGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCACGAGGGCCTGGTGTCTGGCATG-3′. The primers used at the mCD14/TLR2 chimera splicing junctions were 5′-CGGGGCTTTGCCCTGGTGTCTGGCATG-3′ and 5′-CATGCCAGACACCAGGGCAAAGCCCCG-3′. The CD14 sense and TLR2 antisense primers used were 5′-GCCGCTGTGTAGGAAAGA-3′ and 5′-TCCTCAAATGACGGTACATCC-3′, respectively. The two primers at the splicing junctions of deletion mutants were 5′-GTTTAAAGATCCTGAAGACAGAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTCTGTCTTCAGGATCTTTAAAC-3′ for TLR2ΔCys30-Ser39, 5′-GCTAATGTAGGTGCTGCCCTTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAAGGGCAGCACCTACATTAGC-3′ for TLR2ΔSer40-Ile64, 5′-GCTAATGTAGGTAGACAGAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTCTGTCTACCTACATTAGC-3′ for TLR2ΔCys30-Ile64, 5′-CTTAGTGAAGGTAGACAGAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTCTGTCTACCTTCACTAAG-3′ for TLR2ΔCys30-Asp160, or 5′-CACTTTACCTGGAGACAGAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTCTGTCTCCAGGTAAAGTG-3′ for TLR2ΔCys30-Asp305. TLR sense and antisense primers used were 5′-ATTATAGCTAGCGGATCCAAAGGAGAC-3′ and 5′-GTAATATCTAGATCCTCAAATGACGGTAC-3′, respectively. The DNA constructs were inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmids constructed were confirmed by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The complete open reading frame was sequenced for each of the chimeric constructs, and the deletion mutants were created by PCR. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids by FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed to confirm mRNA expression in HEK293 cells transfected with the mutant cDNAs. Total RNA was isolated from the cells by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA pool was obtained from 5 µg of RNA using 200 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 µg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification was performed with Taq polymerase (Promega) for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR were 5′-GGATCCAAAGGAGACCTATAG-3′ and 5′-TCCTCAAATGACGGTACATCC-3′ for TLR2, and 5′-GCCGCTGTGTAGAAAGA-3′ and 5′-ATTATTCTGTCTTGGATC-3′ for CD14. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers were obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). PCR products were resolved by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA bands were visualized by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. The transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently washed once with lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm KCl). The cells were scraped with 1 ml of lysis buffer and were transferred into centrifuge tubes. After the centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, the pellet was suspended with 40 µl of lysis buffer containing 2.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The suspension was then incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the cytosolic and membrane proteins was finally collected. Protein concentration was estimated by the bicinchoninic assay (BCA, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 20 µg of the supernatant proteins was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis by the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membrane with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (blocking buffer) for 30 min. The membrane was then incubated with 10 µg/ml anti-CD14 polyclonal rabbit IgG (28Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or 2 µg/ml goat antibody against the TLR2 carboxyl terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 100 min. After washing the membranes with the blocking buffer three times, they were incubated for 1 h with HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for CD14 and HRP-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for TLR2. The membranes were finally washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The proteins that reacted with the antibodies were visualized by using a chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal, Pierce). Activation of NF-κB was measured as previously described (13Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 18Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates on the day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) with 30 ng of an NF-κB reporter construct (pNF-kB-Luc, Stratagene) and 3.5 ng of a construct-directing expression of Renillaluciferase under the control of the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK, Promega), together with 150 ng of each transfectant gene of CD14, TLR2, chimeras, and deletion mutants. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with PGN for 6 h in the absence of serum unless otherwise indicated and luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A peptide (peptide 40–64), SGSLNSIPSGLTEAVKSLDLSNNRI, corresponding to the amino acid residues Ser40-Ile64 of TLR2 and a control peptide, GTPVNYTNWYRG, were synthesized by Sigma Genosys Japan and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. PGN was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.1–10 µg/ml peptide 40–64 or control peptide in serum-free medium. After the preincubation, a mixture of the peptide and PGN was added to the wells in which HEK293 cells had been transfected with TLR2 cDNA in pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid vector. After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h under 5% CO2, NF-κB activity was measured by luciferase assay as described above. Stably transfected cell lines were established by retroviral vector system (31Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The pCX4bsr plasmid vector used, which was a kind gift from Dr. T. Akagi (Osaka BioScience Institute, Japan), is a modified version of pCXbsr (31Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) lacking the internal initiation codons within the gag region. Stably transfected HEK293 cell lines expressing CD14, mCD14/TLR2 chimera, or sCD14/TLR2 chimera had been grown on polylysine-coated coverglasses. The cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 5 µg/ml rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A (Molecular Probes) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 4 °C for 15 min. After the incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were fixed in methanol for 4 min at −20 °C. The cells were washed with 50 mm PIPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, and 10% (w/v) Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo) (buffer A) and then incubated with 5 µg/ml anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (MY4, Coulter) diluted with buffer A at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then washed with buffer A and further incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200) at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were finally washed three times with buffer A, sealed in the presence of Vectashield Antifade (Vector Laboratories) and examined using a laser microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) with a ×63 oil planapochromatic lens (NA1.4). Digital Images were acquired and processed using Adobe Photoshop, version 5.0 (Mountain View, CA) and CorelDRAW software (Corel Corp.). Recombinant CD14 (CD14T1-G323), consisting of the CD14 region Thr1-Gly323 and a six-histidine tag, was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the recombinant protein was purified from the culture medium by an affinity column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as described previously (28Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A PGN binding study was carried out by the method described previously for the binding of CD14 to LPS (28Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 5 and 20 µg of PGN in 20 µl of ethanol was added onto microtiter wells (Immulon 1B, Dynex), and the solvent was evaporated in ambient air. After nonspecific binding to the wells was blocked with 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (buffer B), 0–5 µg/ml CD14T1-G323 (50 µl/well) in the buffer B was added and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The wells were then washed with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-CD14 IgG, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The peroxidase reaction was finally performed using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate after washing the wells with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The binding of CD14T1-G323 to PGN was detected by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. Membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14, residues 1–356) and recombinant soluble CD14 (sCD14, residues 1–323) activate cells in response to bacterial components (5Pugin J. Heumann I.D. Tomasz A. Kravchenko V.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23157-23164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We constructed two chimeras in which the extracellular domain of TLR2 was replaced with mCD14 (residues 1–356) or sCD14 (residues 1–323) as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The mCD14/TLR2 chimera consists of the CD14 region Thr1-Ala356 and the TLR2 region Leu590-Ser784. The sCD14/TLR2 chimera consists of the CD14 region Thr1-Gly323 and the TLR2 region Leu590-Ser784. To determine whether CD14, TLR2, and the CD14/TLR2 chimeras were expressed in HEK293 cells after transient transfection, mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed by using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the PCR products exhibited the expected mobilities of bands at 1221 bp for CD14, 2600 bp for TLR2, 1799 bp for sCD14/TLR2 chimera, and 1898 bp for mCD14/TLR2 chimera (Fig.2A). The results indicate that mRNAs for these four proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells after transient transfection. The protein expression was also confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with the anti-carboxyl terminus of TLR2 antibody (Fig. 2B) and with anti-CD14 antibody (Fig.2C). CD14 and TLR2 exhibited mobilities at ∼55 and 90 kDa, respectively, as described previously (5Pugin J. Heumann I.D. Tomasz A. Kravchenko V.V. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. Glauser M.P. Tobias P.S.

The CD14/TLR2 chimeras reacted with both anti-TLR2 and anti-CD14 antibodies and exhibited bands at ∼70–75 kDa. These results clearly show that the proteins of CD14, TLR2, and CD14/TLR2 chimeras were expressed in transiently transfected-HEK293 cells. Both CD14 and TLR2, which possess leucine-rich repeats in the extracellular domains, have been proposed to be pattern recognition receptors for PGN (5Pugin J. Heumann I.D. Tomasz A. Kravchenko V.V.

CD14 binds PGN (7Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and TLR2 confers cell responsiveness to PGN (18Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The soluble form of CD14, consisting of the region Met1-Gly323, is biologically active and is capable of binding LPS (9Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23157-23164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of the extracellular domains of CD14 and TLR2 in PGN signaling, we constructed CD14/TLR2 chimeras containing the CD14 region of Met1-Ala356 or Met1-Gly323 and estimated NF-κB activation using luciferase reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. PGN stimulated NF-κB reporter activity in wt TLR2- but not CD14-transfected cells in a manner dependent upon PGN concentrations (Fig. 3). In addition, cotransfection of CD14 cDNA with TLR2 cDNA enhanced cellular responses by ∼43–200%. However, the cells transfected with sCD14/TLR2 chimera cDNA or mCD14/TLR2 chimera cDNA failed to respond to any doses of PGN (Fig. 3). We performed the control experiments in which the reporter plasmids were omitted or the reporter plasmids were transfected without the tested plasmids. In these cases none of the cells exhibited significant luciferase activities when stimulated with PGN, indicating that the responses in TLR2 and/or CD14-transfected cells are dependent on the presence of the NF-κB reporter plasmids. When the chimera-transfected cells were examined in the presence of serum, no cellular activation to PGN was observed. Cotransfection of mCD14 with the chimeras also failed to confer NF-κB activation to PGN. We also examined the effect of chimeras on PGN signaling in the cells expressing wt TLR2. When sCD14/TLR2 or mCD14/TLR2 chimera cDNA was cotransfected with wt TLR2 cDNA, the activities of measured NF-κB at 100 ng/ml PGN were enhanced to 34 or 274% greater (mean of three or four experiments), respectively, than those activities in cells transfected with wt TLR2 cDNA alone. These results confirmed that CD14 cannot directly transmit PGN signaling but enhances cellular responses through TLR2 and showed that these chimeras can enhance PGN signaling mediated by TLR2, although they cannot directly transmit PGN signaling, indicating that they possess the same biological activities as mCD14. The present data demonstrate that CD14 cannot functionally replace the extracellular domain of TLR2 in PGN signaling. Because cell surface localization of CD14/TLR2 chimeras is of critical importance for the interpretation of the results shown in Fig. 3, we attempted to define the cellular localization of the chimeras in stably transfected HEK293 cell lines. For this purpose the HEK293 cell line expressing CD14, mCD14/TLR2 chimera, or sCD14/TLR chimera was labeled with rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A and immunostained with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody, and it was examined by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fig. 4). Each protein expressed localized, mainly at the cell surface membrane, and colocalized with concanavalin A used as an established marker for cell surface glycoproteins. These results demonstrate the cell surface localization of the chimeric proteins. To confirm the results obtained from the transiently transfected cells, the stably transfected cell lines expressing the chimeras were also examined for NF-κB activation in response to PGN (Fig. 5). PGN stimulated NF-κB reporter activity in the cells expressing wt TLR2 but not in the cells expressing CD14 in a manner dependent upon PGN concentration. The cells expressing mCD14/TLR2 or sCD14/TLR2 chimera neither responded to PGN. Taken together, we conclude that the CD14/TLR2 chimeras cannot transmit PGN signaling. The data shown in Figs. 4 and 5 confirm that CD14 cannot functionally replace the extracellular domain of TLR2 in PGN signaling. To determine whether the extracellular domains of CD14/TLR2 chimeras bind to PGN, we constructed recombinant CD14 (CD14T1-G323) consisting of the CD14 region Thr1-Gly323, because the CD14/TLR2 chimeras contain this CD14 region as the extracellular domain. The recombinant CD14T1-G323 migrated as bands of 46–56 kDa when analyzed by electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions (Fig. 6A), as described previously (28Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We next performed the direct binding study using PGN coated onto microtiter wells (Fig. 6B). The CD14T1-G323 bound to PGN in manners dependent upon the CD14 concentrations and the amounts of PGN coated on the well. These results indicate that the CD14 region of Thr1-Gly323directly binds to PGN and confirm the previously demonstrated binding of CD14 to PGN (7Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The data also suggest that the extracellular CD14 region of"

Hormones and pharmacological agents that activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) are potent inhibitors of native and ectopically expressed NHE3 in epithelial and Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells, respectively. Previous studies have shown that acute inhibition is coupled to direct phosphorylation of the exchanger, but this only partly accounts for the observed effects. In this report, we show that inhibition of NHE3 activity by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, occurs without changes in surface expression of the exchanger but is associated with altered cytoskeletal structure. This effect resembles that obtained with cytochalasin D or latrunculin B, actin disrupting agents that also inhibit NHE3. Such similarities prompted us to further investigate the relationship between PKA-induced inhibition of the exchanger and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of NHE3 by cytochalasin D does not require PKA, because the inhibitory effect is preserved in a mutant NHE3 that is not phosphorylated by PKA and in cells pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H89. In contrast, involvement of actin in the effect of cAMP on the exchanger is supported by the following observations: (i) jasplakinolide, an F-actin stabilizer, prevents the inhibition caused by forskolin, and (ii) constitutively active forms of RhoA and Rho kinase interfere with actin disruption by forskolin and also decrease inhibition of the transporter.

Three of these are expressed ubiquitously, whereas the others show a more restricted pattern of expression. NHE1 is present in the plasma membrane of most cells, where it functions in the regulation of cytosolic pH and cellular volume. NHE6 and NHE7 are also ubiquitously expressed but accumulate preferentially in mitochondrial and trans-Golgi network/endosomal membranes, respectively, likely contributing to the ionic homeostasis of these organelles (4Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Of these isoforms, the most is known about NHE3, which is localized exclusively in the apical membrane of epithelial cells of the kidney and gastrointestinal tract (6Biemesderfer D. Pizzonia J.

Hormones that elevate intracellular cAMP levels are potent inhibitors of NHE3, an effect that is partly attributed to direct phosphorylation of the exchanger by protein kinase A (PKA). Mutation of Ser605, the prime target of PKA in NHE3, reduces the acute inhibitory effect of cAMP by only ≈50% (12Kurashima K. Frank H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This finding points to the existence of other modes of action of cAMP that indirectly regulate NHE3 activity. Recent evidence has shown that, in addition to being present at the surface membrane, NHE3 is also detectable in intracellular vesicles (14Chow C.W. Clin. Invest. Med. 1999; 22: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, where it is expressed endogenously, the presence of NHE3 in endomembrane vesicles has been documented by both electron microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (15Biemesderfer D.

In these cells, plasmalemmal transporters undergo constitutive uptake into clathrin-coated vesicles (18Chow C.W. Khurana S. Woodside M. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and are recycled back to the plasma membrane in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Inhibition of this kinase with wortmannin or LY294002 blocks the exocytosis of vesicles bearing NHE3, depleting the plasmalemmal pool of exchangers and causing a marked drop in the transport rate (19Kurashima K.S.E. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,20Janecki A.J. Janecki M. Akhter S. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8133-8142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, acute inhibition of NHE3 activity upon activation of protein kinase C in colonic epithelial cells was attributed to net internalization of exchangers from the brush border into a subapical cytoplasmic compartment (16Janecki A.J. Montrose M.H. Zimniak P. Zweibaum A. Tse C.M. Khurana S. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8790-8798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The preceding results indicate that modulation of the dynamic equilibrium between surface and endomembrane transporters can provide a rapid and effective means of controlling the rate of ion exchange. This mechanism could, in principle, also mediate the inhibitory effects of cAMP. Indeed, upon exposure of renal cells to parathyroid hormone, which elevates cAMP, the number of NHE3 transporters detectable at the cell surface decreased (21Collazo R. Fan L. Hu M.C. Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31601-31608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the acute inhibition of transport did not parallel the course of disappearance of the exchangers, which occurred over more prolonged treatment, implying that other processes must be involved in the effect of cAMP. Because neither direct phosphorylation nor modulation of traffic fully account for the acute cAMP-induced inhibition of NHE3, a role for ancillary proteins has also been invoked (22Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins containing PDZ domains, including NHERF1/EBP50 (23Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and NHERF2/TKA-1/E3KARP (24Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), were shown to bind directly to NHE3 and postulated to mediate the effect of PKA. NHERF1/EBP50 also binds to ezrin, which is thought to bridge membrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton. Because ezrin is a PKA-anchoring protein, it may function to recruit the kinase to the vicinity of the NHERF/NHE3 complex, promoting the phosphorylation of the exchanger and/or cytoskeletal proteins. The latter have also been implicated in the control of NHE3 (25Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of normal actin structure by pharmacological means or by an inactive RhoA construct impaired NHE3 function without altering the number of NHE3 molecules at the plasma membrane (26Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szaszi K. Ramjeesingh R. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Szaszi K. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. Kapus A. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The inhibition of NHE3 by cytoskeleton-disrupting agents bears some similarities with that induced by elevation of cAMP. Moreover, activation of PKA has been reported to alter the structure of the actin cytoskeleton (28Roger P.P. Rickaert F. Huez G. Authelet M. Hofmann F. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Lampugnani M.G. Giorgi M. Gaboli M. Dejana E. Marchisio P.C. Lab.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These similarities prompted us to consider the possibility that cAMP inhibits NHE3, at least in part, by modifying the cytoskeletal architecture. In this report, we analyzed the effects of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, on the control of actin structure via RhoA and assessed the relationship between these changes and the activity of NHE3. To facilitate the functional analysis of NHE3 activity, we used cells devoid of endogenous NHE activity that were stably transfected with an epitope-tagged form of NHE3. By placing the epitope tag in an extracellular loop of NHE3, we were able to monitor the distribution and traffic of the exchangers before and after elevation of cAMP. Nigericin, the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), jasplakinolide, Oregon green-labeled phalloidin, and rhodamine-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Isotonic K+ medium (Na+-free medium) contained 130 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (AP-1 cells) that was functionally selected for its lack of endogenous NHE activity following chemical mutagenesis (32Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with either wild type or mutant forms of NHE3 previously engineered to contain several unique restriction endonuclease sites (renamed NHE3′) to create a series of conveniently sized DNA cassettes for subsequent mutagenesis procedures (33Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To allow for immunological detection of the NHE3 protein, an extracellularly accessible epitope-tagged version was also created. Three tandem copies of the influenza virus HA epitope, YPYDVPDYAS, were inserted into the first extracellular loop of NHE3 between amino acids Arg38 and Phe39, as described previously (17D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukas G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The resulting construct is called NHE3′38HA3 hereafter. The functional properties of the HA-tagged NHE3 construct were indistinguishable from those of untagged NHE3 (19Kurashima K.S.E. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Substitution of serines in NHE3′38HA3 was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using the unique site elimination method as described in Ref. 12Kurashima K. Frank H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z.

NHE cDNA constructs were transfected into AP-1 cells by the calcium-phosphate-DNA coprecipitation technique of Chen and Okayama (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), and stable clones were selected for survival by imposing acute NH4Cl-induced acid loads (35Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin/penicillin in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The plasmids encoding the epitope-tagged constitutively active RhoA (RhoAQ63Lmyc) described in Ref. 36Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

The expression vector containing cDNA encoding the constitutively active p160 Rho-associated kinase I, ROK-CATmyc, was described in Ref. 37Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34663-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar. cDNA encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and eGFP-actin was from CLONTECH. For transient transfection, DNA was introduced into cells plated on coverslips by transfection using FuGENETM 6 as recommended by the manufacturer, using 1 µg of the construct of interest together with 0.2 µg of eGFP cDNA where indicated. The cells were analyzed 24 or 48 h after transfection, as indicated. NHE activity was assessed as the rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) following an acid load, imposed by prepulsing with NH4Cl, as described previously (9Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells grown on coverslips to ≈70% confluence were incubated with 2 µg/ml of the acetoxymethyl ester precursor of BCECF plus 50 mm NH4Cl at 37 °C. After 10 min, the cells were placed into Leiden coverslip holders and washed with isotonic Na+-free solution to remove excess dye and extracellular NH4Cl. Na+/H+ exchange was then initiated by reintroduction of extracellular Na+ and was estimated from the rate of recovery of pHi. Two methods were used to measure the fluorescence of BCECF. Population measurements were performed using a Nikon Diaphot TMD inverted microscope coupled to the M Series dual wavelength illumination and recording system from Photon Technologies, Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) in a dual excitation, single emission configuration, as detailed earlier (9Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence of transiently transfected single cells was measured using the ratio imaging system described in Ref. 38Szaszi K. Kurashima K. Kapus A. Paulsen A. Kaibuchi K. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28599-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar controlled by the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Transfected cells were identified by detecting eGFP fluorescence prior to loading with BCECF. A neutral density filter was then interposed in the excitation pathway to decrease the signal emanating from eGFP, and the cells were loaded with BCECF and ammonium while on the microscope stage. The fluorescence of BCECF greatly exceeded that of eGFP and was readily visible in the presence of the neutral density filter. Where specified, the cells were pretreated with 10 µm forskolin for 10 or 30 min. Similar results were obtained at both times. The excitation wavelengths were 440 and 490 nm, and the emission wavelength was 510 nm for both the population and single cell measurements. In both instances the pHi was calibrated by equilibrating the cells with K+-rich medium titrated to known pH values and containing 10 µg/ml nigericin, as described previously (39Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). AP-1 cells stably expressing NHE3′38HA3 were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to ≈70% confluence. To visualize the total cellular NHE3′38HA3, the cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody for 1 h. The coverslips were next washed four or five times with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. After incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed three to five times over 15 min with PBS and were mounted onto glass slides with DAKO fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Where specified, F-actin was labeled by incubating fixed and permeabilized cells with Oregon green-labeled phalloidin or rhodamine-phalloidin (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Two different methods were used to quantify surface NHE3 expression: (i) a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described earlier (19Kurashima K.S.E. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and (ii) a radioisotopic method. AP-1 cells stably expressing NHE3′38HA3 were plated onto 12-well plates and grown to ≈70% confluence. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis. After washing the cells six times with PBS/α-minimal essential medium (9:1 v/v) to remove excess unbound antibody, they were fixed for 10 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following fixation, the cells were washed three or four times with PBS and incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min. The cells were next blocked with 5% donkey serum for 20 min and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h followed by washing six more times with PBS/α-minimal essential medium and incubation with 1 ml ofo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 250 µl of 3m HCl. The supernatant was collected and absorbance measured at 492 nm using a U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). In the range studied, the absorbance varied linearly with the amount of peroxidase bound. For isotopic determinations, the cells were treated on the plates as specified in the text and then placed on ice. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C to prevent further traffic of NHE3. The cells were next washed three times with PBS and then incubated with125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (0.4 µCi/sample) in HPMI with 10% goat serum for 45 min. At the end of the incubation the cells were washed three more times with PBS to remove unbound radiolabel and detached from the plates using PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity was counted with a 1282 Compugamma LKB counter. The radioactivity bound to cells exposed only to 125I-IgG without prior incubation with anti-HA antibody was also determined and subtracted from all determinations. The data are expressed as percentages of surface labeling of untreated control cells (100%) and are the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated, each performed in duplicate or triplicate. The cells grown to ≈70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were treated as specified in the text. After rinsing with PBS, their proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. The precipitates were scraped from the plate and washed once with ice-cold acetone. The pellets were solubilized in sample buffer containing 9 m urea, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 22 mm glycine, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.8. Equal volumes of the lysates were fractionated by glycerol-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal sample loading was confirmed by staining with Ponceau S. The blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-myosin light chain antibody (clone MY-21, 1:200 dilution) followed by a peroxidase-coupled anti-IgM antibody. The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. NHE3 has been shown to undergo recycling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Increased endocytosis or reduced exocytosis would alter the number of exchangers at the surface and might account for the inhibition of transport induced by cAMP. To examine the effect of cAMP on the trafficking of exchangers between compartments, we used cells stably transfected with a modified form of NHE3 that includes three tandem copies of an influenza HA epitope (NHE3′38HA3cells) (17D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukas G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The epitope is exposed extracellularly, enabling us to quantify the number of exchangers at the cell surface. The construct was stably expressed in AP-1 cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell subline that lacks endogenous plasmalemmal NHE activity (32Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to facilitate the analysis of NHE3 activity without the contribution of other resident isoform(s). As shown earlier, when expressed in AP-1 cells, NHE3′38HA3shares many of the properties of the native epithelial NHE3, including regulation by cAMP (12Kurashima K. Frank H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2D) and distribution in two distinct subcellular pools (19Kurashima K.S.E. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Accordingly, immunostaining of permeabilized AP-1 cells with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody detected exchangers both on the plasma membrane and in a punctate endomembrane compartment that concentrated in the juxtanuclear region (Fig.1A). No obvious differences in the subcellular distribution of NHE3′38HA3 were apparent following treatment of the cells with 10 µm forskolin for 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B), even though the shapes of the cells were visibly altered (see below). Similar results were obtained after a longer (30 min) treatment with forskolin. To more directly estimate the fraction of NHE3 present at the plasmalemma, we quantified the amount of surface exposed epitope by incubating intact cells with anti-HA, followed by the addition of125I-labeled anti-IgG for isotopic detection of bound antibodies. Incubations with antibodies were performed at 4 °C to arrest possible internalization (see “Experimental Procedures”). As illustrated in Fig. 1C, the number of exchangers exposed at the cell surface was essentially identical before and after treatment with forskolin (112 ± 16% of the untreated control,n = 4). These results were validated using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method for detection of the secondary antibodies (19Kurashima K.S.E. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which also showed no difference between control and cAMP-treated cells (surface expression of NHE3 in forskolin-treated cells was 110 ± 5% of untreated cells (n = 4); data not shown). Therefore, the acute inhibitory effect of cAMP does not involve a reduction in the number of transporters present at the cell surface.Figure 1Effect of forskolin on the subcellular distribution of NHE3.A and B, AP-1 cells expressing NHE3′38HA3 grown on coverslips were incubated without (A) or with (B) 10 µmforskolin for 10 min at 37 °C.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that this highly regulated fusion process involves a cascade of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (1Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Among them, a ternary protein complex known as the solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE)1 complex is of fundamental importance for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (3Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). The SNARE complex is assembled by three neuronal SNAREs, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2, also called synaptobrevin), and presynaptic plasma membrane proteins syntaxin 1 and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). Structural studies have demonstrated that the SNARE complex consists of a parallel four-stranded helical bundle formed by two helices from SNAP-25 and one helix each from VAMP2 and syntaxin 1 (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Interference with the integrity of such a superhelical structure by various mutations in the SNAREs has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion (5Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. de Groot B. Riedel D. Keranen S. Ronne H. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6000-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, specific cleavage of each SNARE by the clostridial neurotoxins prevents the assembly of a stable SNARE complex and blocks neurotransmitter release without affecting the docking of synaptic vesicles (7Hunt J.M. Bommert K. Charlton M.P. Kistner A. Habermann E. Augustine G.J. Betz H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1269-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 8O'Connor V. Heuss C. De Bello W.M.

Although the functional importance of the SNARE complex in membrane fusion is well established, its precise role in the fusion process remains unclear. It has been proposed that the formation of the SNARE complex in a trans configuration pulls the apposing membranes into close contact and provides a driving force for membrane fusion (9Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, the assembly of SNARE complexes has been shown to serve as the minimal machinery for membrane fusion in reconstituted liposomes (10Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A.

Furthermore, the SNARE complex formation in permeabilized PC12 cells is triggered by Ca2+ and coupled directly to exocytosis (11Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

On the other hand, evidence from studies of yeast vacuole fusion suggests that the SNARE complex does not act at the fusion step (12Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Rather, the complex formation occurs at an upstream step to signal other proteins to execute fusion (13Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study using synaptosomes suggests that SNARE complexes assemble at the priming step prior to neurotransmitter release and may regulate the amount of synaptic vesicle to undergo exocytosis (14Lonart G. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whereas the SNAREs and the SNARE complex seem to be universally required for all fusion reactions, synaptic vesicle exocytosis is several orders of magnitude faster and more tightly regulated than any other form of membrane fusion (15Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To achieve the extraordinary speed, precision, and plasticity of neurotransmission, additional proteins have to be involved to regulate the function of these SNAREs and control temporal and spatial formation of SNARE complexes. In an effort to identify additional proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release, we have performed a search in rat brain for SNAP-25-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the isolation of a novel RING finger protein, termed Spring, that specifically interacts with SNAP-25 and modulates the SNARE complex formation and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Yeast two-hybrid screens to identify novel SNAP-25-interacting proteins were performed as described previously (16Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prey plasmids from positive clones were rescued and re-transformed into fresh yeast cells with the pPC97-SNAP-25 bait or various control baits to confirm the specificity of the interactions. For cloning of full-length Spring, a partial Spring cDNA probe from the prey clone was used to screen a rat hippocampal cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene), according to standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from positive Spring clones were sequenced multiple times on both strands by an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. A polyclonal anti-Spring antibody was raised in rabbit against amino acid residues 138–151 (DDRGLRGFPKNRVL) of Spring. The antibody was affinity-purified using the immunogen peptide coupled to an Aminolink Immobilization column (Pierce). Other antibodies used in this study are as follows: anti-SNAP-25 (SMI 81, Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.); anti-syntaxin 1 (HPC-1, Sigma); anti-VAMP2 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.); anti-synaptophysin (SVP-38, Sigma); and anti-HA (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Northern blot analysis of Spring mRNA expression was performed on a rat Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot and a human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTETM) Array (CLONTECH), using a 32P-labeled Spring cDNA fragment from the prey clone as probe (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, rat tissues were homogenized in 1% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-Spring and other antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence were used to visualize the results. Conventional molecular biological techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to generate the constructs in this study. DNA fragments encoding full-length and truncated forms of Spring were subcloned into the following vectors: the pPC97 and pPC86 vectors for yeast two-hybrid interaction studies; the prokaryotic expression vectors pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pET28c (Novagen) for the production of GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins; and the mammalian expression vectors pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and pCHA (16Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for transfection into CHO and PC12 cells. GST or His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells as described previously (16Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified by using the glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). His6-tagged proteins were purified using the His·Bind Resin and Buffer kit (Novagen). Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands following SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Rat brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the brains in a homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, plus protease inhibitors). Triton X-100 was added to the homogenates to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the Triton X-100 extract of rat brains. For binding experiments, brain extracts (100 µl) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with various GST-Spring fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-agarose beads. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For binding experiments (Figs.4A and 5A), 100 nm GST or various GST-SNARE fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with soluble His-Spring (50 nm) in the PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4 plus protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 3 h under gentle rocking. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For saturation experiments (Fig.4B), 100 nm immobilized GST-SNAP-25 were incubated with increasing amounts of soluble His-Spring or His-syntaxin 1 (residues 1–261) in the PBS buffer and processed as above. The EC50 was defined as the effective concentration of each soluble protein at half-maximal binding. For competition experiments (Fig. 6, A and B), 50 nm immobilized GST-SNAP-25 were incubated with a constant amount of His-Spring (50 nm) and increasing amounts of His-syntaxin 1 or His-VAMP2. To study the effects of the association of Spring with SNAP-25 on the ability of SNAP-25 to interact with other SNAREs (Fig. 7,A–C), immobilized Spring-SNAP-25 binary complexes were assembled by incubation of 100 nm immobilized GST-Spring with His-SNAP-25 (200 nm). After extensive washes to remove unbound SNAP-25, the immobilized Spring-SNAP-25 complexes were incubated with increasing amounts of His-Syntaxin 1, His-VAMP2 or both His-Syntaxin 1 and His-VAMP2 (1:1 molar ratio) in the PBS buffer and processed as above. Control binding experiments were performed by incubation of immobilized GST-SNAP-25 (100 nm) with His-Syntaxin 1, His-VAMP2 or both His-Syntaxin 1 and His-VAMP2 (500 nm each).Figure 5Identification of interacting domains ofSNAP-25and Spring.A, mapping of the Spring binding domain of SNAP-25.

Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were subjected to extraction by 4% Triton X-100, 4 m urea, 1.5 m NaCl, or 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5. For cytoskeleton association studies, rat brains were lysed in a cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer and separated into a low speed cytoskeleton fraction, a high speed cytoskeleton fraction, and a soluble fraction according to a standard procedure (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For synaptosomal localization studies, rat brain homogenates were fractionated into crude synaptosome fractions as described (19Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The washed crude synaptosome (P2′) pellet fraction was then fractionated on a three-step Percoll gradient into myelin, mitochondria, and purified synaptosome fractions (20Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The purified synaptosome fraction (PG3) was further fractionated into the synaptosomal membranes (LP1), synaptic vesicle (LP2), and cytosol (LS2) fractions (19Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). All protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Extracts were prepared from CHO cells transiently transfected with pCHA-Spring and pCDNA3.1-SNAP-25, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (22Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), using rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10) or control rat IgG. For detection of endogenous Spring-SNAP-25 complexes, the clarified supernatant of solubilized P2′ synaptosome fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-SNAP-25 antibody (SMI81) or control mouse IgG. The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes, the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Exponentially growing PC12 cells were harvested and then cotransfected with 5 µg of pXGH5 encoding human growth hormone and 30 µg of test plasmid as described previously (16Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Measurements of GH secretion were performed 48 h after transfection. PC12 cells were washed with a physiological salt solution (PSS (in mm): 145 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in PSS or PSS containing 56 mm KCl and 95 mm NaCl. The amounts of GH released into the medium and retained in the cells were determined by using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute). To identify novel proteins that regulate SNARE function in neuronal cells, we used the full-length mouse SNAP-25b as bait to screen a two-hybrid rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library. One of the positive clones was shown to encode part of a novel protein that we referred to as Spring because it is aSNAP-25-interacting RING finger protein. Re-transformation experiments confirmed that Spring interacts specifically with SNAP-25 but not with irrelevant baits such as synaptophysin nor with other neuronal SNAREs such as syntaxin 1 and VAMP2 (data not shown; see Fig. 4A). Moreover, our yeast two-hybrid interaction studies (not shown) and in vitrobinding data (Fig. 4A) reveal that, unlike several other known SNAP-25-interacting proteins such as syntaxins, SNIP, and intersectin, Spring does not interact with SNAP-23/syndet, a ubiquitously expressed SNAP-25 homologue (23Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the t-SNARE coiled-coil domains of SNAP-25 share significant homology with the t-SNARE domains in SNAP-23/syndet, syntaxin 1, and VAMP2 (24Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the inability of Spring to interact with these other SNARE proteins further confirms the specificity of observed Spring-SNAP-25 interaction. By screening a λZAPII rat hippocampal cDNA library, we isolated three full-length and nine independent overlapping partial Spring cDNA clones. The full-length Spring cDNA contains an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiator ATG codon with a Kozak consensus sequence and a single open reading frame encoding 710 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 79.2 kDa (Fig. 1A). Spring is a hydrophilic protein with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 6.54 and a high percentage (22%) of charged amino acids over the entire length. It contains neither a signal sequence nor a potential transmembrane domain. Analysis of Spring protein sequence reveals the presence of a RING finger domain followed by two B box motifs and a coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1), indicating that Spring is a new member of the RING-B box coiled-coil (RBCC) subfamily of RING finger proteins (25Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 26Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The RING finger and the B box motifs are cysteine/histidine-rich Zn2+-binding domains that are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (27Borden K.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although the function of the RBCC motif is unclear, this tripartite motif is found in a growing number of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes, from gene transcription and signal transduction to organelle transport (25Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 26Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar,28El-Husseini A.E. Vincent S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19771-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the RBCC motifs may act as molecular building blocks in formation of large macromolecular scaffolds for these complex biological processes (26Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In addition to the RBCC motif, Spring contains a fibronectin type III domain, an autonomously folded protein module that is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions in both intracellular and extracellular compartments (29Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the C terminus, Spring has an SPRY domain, a putative protein-protein interaction module that was originally identified in thespla kinase and the ryanodine receptor (30Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The SPRY domain has been found at the C terminus of several RBCC proteins with a conserved spacing between these two domains (31Seto M.H. Liu H.L. Zajchowski D.A. Whitlow M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although the significance of such a domain organization is not understood. Data base searches revealed the presence of Spring homologues as uncharacterized cDNAs or open reading frames obtained from genome projects in a number of organisms, including human, mouse,Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and zebrafish. The amino acid sequence of rat Spring is 98% identical to a recently published human sequence TRIM9, one of the 37 RBCCtripartite motif-containing proteins identified by dbEST data base searches with a consensus of the B box domain (32Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overall sequence of Spring protein shares 41 and 47% identity with C. elegans hypothetical protein C39F7.2 (GenBankTM accession number T33778 and AC006906) and a putative protein deduced from the genomic sequence ofDrosophila (a splice product of CG13145 and CG6256 genes, GenBankTM accession number AE003629), respectively (Fig. 1B). The conspicuous homology and conserved domain structure among Spring homologues from different species indicate that Spring is an evolutionarily conserved protein. Northern blot analysis of Spring mRNA expression revealed the presence of a major Spring transcript of 5.6 kilobase pairs and a minor form of 4.8 kilobase pairs, which may represent the products of alternative splicing or differential polyadenylation (Fig.2A). Spring mRNAs were prominently expressed in rat brain but were undetectable in the other tissues examined. Consistent with this result, analysis of human Spring mRNA expression using a Multiple Tissue Expression Array showed that Spring mRNA(s) was exclusively expressed in fetal and adult human brain where it was widely distributed in all brain regions tested (Fig. 2B). To characterize Spring protein, a rabbit anti-Spring antibody was generated against a 14-amino acid peptide of Spring. The anti-Spring antibody, but not preimmune serum, specifically recognized an 80-kDa protein in cells transfected with HA-tagged, full-length Spring cDNA, whereas no immunoreactivity was detected in vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 2C). The same 80-kDa band was also detected using the anti-HA antibody (data not shown). In rat brain, the anti-Spring antibody recognized a major 80-kDa band of endogenous Spring (Fig. 2, C and D). Occasionally, some minor bands of lower molecular weights were observed in brain homogenates as well as in cells expressing recombinant Spring protein (Fig. 2, C and D). These minor bands are likely to be the degradation products of the Spring protein because their relative intensity as compared with the 80-kDa band varied from preparation to preparation. Pre-absorption of the anti-Spring antibody with recombinant Spring protein completely eliminated its immunoreactivity to both recombinant and endogenous Spring protein (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the antibody. Western blot analysis of multiple rat tissues showed that Spring was expressed exclusively in brain (Fig. 2D), which is consistent with the pattern of Spring mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). To determine the intracellular distribution of Spring, rat brain postnuclear supernatant was separated into cytosol and membrane particulate fractions and then subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-Spring antibody (Fig.3A). Although the primary structure of Spring does not contain any transmembrane domain, a large pool of Spring was found in the membrane fraction. The membrane-associated Spring could be extracted by 1.5 mNaCl, 8 m urea, or a pH 11.5 solution, suggesting that it is peripherally associated with membranes. Surprisingly, the membrane-associated Spring was resistant to solubilization by 4% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that it may be associated with cytoskeleton. To examine this possibility, we used a well established protocol to isolate directly the cytoskeleton fractions from brain (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The integrity of these fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies against actin, synaptophysin, and SNAP-25 (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis of these fractions with the anti-Spring antibody revealed the presence of a substantial amount of Spring in the cytoskeleton fractions, indicating that a significant percentage of Spring is associated with brain cytoskeleton. To examine the subcellular distribution of Spring in more detail, synaptosome fractions were isolated and furt"

Decarboxylation of uro-III leads to the biosynthesis of hemes, chlorophylls or bacteriochlorophylls, whereas its C-methylation initiates the synthesis of vitamin B12, sirohemes, and the nickel-chelating cofactor F430. The correct assembly of the tetrapyrrole molecules with their respective apoproteins is essential for various biological cell functions including light harvesting, respiration, signaling, and detoxification. Thus, there is need for a tight synchronization between the tetrapyrrole metabolism and other physiologic processes to ensure an adequate supply of those molecules (1Grimm B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In plants, chlorophyll synthesis is localized exclusively in plastids, whereas heme formation takes place in both plastids and mitochondria (last two enzymatic steps) (2Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Being at the first branching point of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway makes UROD potentially involved in controlling the flux of precursors through it. Its regulation must guarantee a continuous flow of porphyrin precursors to prevent accumulation of these highly photoreactive molecules, and the consequent photodynamic cell damage (3Mock H.-P.

This obligatory displacement of the first reaction intermediate within the catalytic cleft constitutes probably the most challenging aspect of the UROD catalytic mechanism. Additionally, UROD has been the object of considerable attention as its deficient activity is associated with porphyria cutanea tarda, the most prevalent of human porphyrias, and with hemochromatosis (10Elder G.H. Worwood M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The necrotic phenotype of transgenic tobacco plants expressing UROD antisense RNA is analogous to human porphyria cutanea tarda (3Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Hu G. Yalpani N. Briggs S.P. Johal G.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and indicates that UROD deficiency generally leads to cellular photosensitization by accumulating uroporphyrin. The cellular responses upon porphyric stress interfere with the signal transduction pathway triggered by pathogen infection. Their study may help to develop crop plants exhibiting a broad pathogen resistance spectrum. Moreover, the phenotype of reduced UROD activity resembles accumulation of protoporphyrin-IX by inhibition of protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase (12Lehnen Jr., L.P. Sherman T.D. Becerril J.M. Duke S.O. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 37: 239-248Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a target protein in herbicide treatment. Yearly, 2.4 × 108 tons of biomass are produced alone by chlorophyll biogenesis, and its natural degradation has strong economic implications in several sectors including crop productivity, food industry, and tourism. Apart from the economic interest because of potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology, the study of plants may contribute to the development of effective treatments for human porphyria diseases. Albeit extensive biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies allowed the identification of several residues critical for substrate binding and/or catalysis (5de Verneuil H. Sassa S. Kappas A.

Acta. 1996; 1298: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the number of catalytic sites per enzyme molecule remained controversial. Only recently, with the determination of the crystal structure from the human UROD (16Whitby F.G. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2463-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was it possible to identify the putative substrate binding cleft, thus confirming the presence of one single catalytic site per molecule (17Elder G.H. Roberts A.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the sequence of protein-substrate interactions during catalysis remains unknown. To further understand how plant UROD works and its physiologic relevance for chlorophyll biogenesis, photosynthesis, and antioxidative stress defense, we have determined the crystal structure of UROD from Nicotiana tabacum and modeled the substrate enzyme complexes for tobacco and human enzymes. The recombinant mature uroporphyrinogen-III decarboxylase from N. tabacum (tobacco UROD) (Val1–Tyr352) was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (18Mock H.-P. Trainotti L. Kruse E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein was diluted to 2–3 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, prior to crystallization trials at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The droplets were made from 6 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of precipitant solution (1.2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 9.6) and equilibrated against 1000 μl of precipitant solution. Crystals appeared after 1 week and continued to grow for 18 months, reaching a final size of ∼400 × 250 × 50 μm3. The crystals belong to space group P622, with unit cell constants of a =b = 158.44 Å and c = 67.68 Å. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit of the unit cell, and the Matthews coefficient of Vm = 3.14 Å3/Da corresponds to a solvent content of 61%. This high solvent content may account for the crystal instability when exposed directly to the x-ray beam. Upon cooling to 100 K, the crystals diffracted to 2.3 Å. For data collection, crystals were immersed in a cryoprotectant buffer containing 10% (v/v) (2 R,3 R)-butanediol and cooled to 100 K in the nitrogen stream of an Oxford cryosystem. A complete data set was collected from a single crystal on a MarCCD detector on wiggler beamline BW6 at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) using synchrotron radiation with a wavelength of 1.05 Å. Data were evaluated using DENZO and SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The search model consisted of a truncated protein with residues Gly10–Thr31, Ala251–Pro257, and Ile341–Asn366 removed and nonconserved residues replaced by alanine. The best solution calculated with the program AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Solvent molecules were built in (Fobs − Fcal) maps with a 2.5–3.0 ς contouring level, and five sulfate ions were added in the final stages of refinement. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement using overall anisotropic B-factor correction for Fobs, torsion angle molecular dynamics, bulk solvent correction, and maximum likelihood targets for positional and individual temperature-factors refinement using CNS, resulted in a final Rcryst-factor of 20.94% (Rfree-factor of 25.57%) with good stereochemistry. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The final model comprises the amino acid residues Thr10–Tyr352, 250 water molecules, and 5 sulfate ions. The complete polypeptide chain could be traced with the exception of the first nine amino acid residues. Residues Gln33–Leu60 were fixed through the refinement steps because of their discontinuous (2 Fobs −Fcal) electron density map. Poorly defined side chain for residues at the protein's surface were modeled with half-occupancy. One solvent molecule and two sulfate ions are located at 2-fold symmetry axis and were modeled with half-occupancy and fixed during the refinement cycles. Secondary structure assignment and quality assessments were done with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Hutchinson E. Thorton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The intermolecular interactions at the crystallographic dimer interface were analyzed using the Protein-Protein Interaction Server (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server). Accessibility calculations were done with GRASP (27Nicholls A. Bharadwaj R. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A166Google Scholar) and NACCESS (28Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Superposition of tobacco and human monomers and dimers was performed with the program Swiss PDB Viewer (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. PDB Quart. Newslett. 1996; 77: 7-10Google Scholar). Molecular modeling was done using the modules Viewer, Builder, Docking, and Discover3 of the program package InsightII (version 98.0; MSI, Los Angeles, CA). The monomers of the refined crystal structures of human and tobacco UROD were chosen as starting point for the docking and energy minimization of the substrate enzyme complexes. The crystal structure of uroporphyrinogen-octanitrile (type I) tetrahydrofuran solvate (30Lehmann C. Schweizer B. Leumann C. Eschenmoser A. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1997; 80: 1421-1442Crossref Google Scholar) was modified to uro-III in module Builder. The substrate molecule was positioned in the active site using modules Builder and Docking with the acetate side chains of pyrrole rings D and A in hydrogen bonding distances to the carboxylic group of Asp86(human) or Asp82 (tobacco) and the hydroxyl group of Tyr164 (human) or Tyr159 (tobacco), respectively. The consistent valence force field was used for energy minimization with Discover3, and 1000 minimization steps were run. Protein and substrate molecules were simultaneously minimized. The tobacco UROD molecule comprises a single domain with approximate dimensions of 58 × 40 × 43 Å3. The protein displays a broken (βα)8-barrel fold with seven parallel β-strands forming a circular β-barrel that is surrounded by seven α-helices and one 310-helix linking the seven neighboring β-strands. Residues Pro27–Trp29, approximating β-conformation and the helix 310-III, would allow the closure of a complete (βα)8-barrel motif. The amino acid composition of a (βα)8-barrel protein has an essential role in the formation of its β-barrel core which could be particularly disrupted by proline residues (31Nagano N. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2072-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The presence of Pro26 preceding residues Pro27–Trp29 explains the disruption of the β-barrel by impairing their β-strand conformation. Particular sets of residues lying perpendicular to the β-barrel axis pack in two to five layers building its core (31Nagano N. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2072-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In tobacco UROD, four stacked layers build up the β-barrel core with a diameter of ∼15 Å (distance between the amino acids Cα) and almost circular cross-section. The (βα)7-barrel comprises β-strands β1 and β4 to β9, and α-helices αC, αE, and αH to αM. All the helix-sheet turns at the N-terminal end of the barrel are constituted by only a few residues, whereas larger segments can be observed at its C-terminal end (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, compared with a “minimal” (βα)8-barrel architecture, tobacco UROD contains additional secondary structural elements restricting the access to the interior of the β-barrel. The N-terminal end is capped by helix αA, anchored to the protein through hydrophobic interactions with the β-barrel layers, whereas several extended loops surround the wider C-terminal end. The additional secondary structure elements may play an extra role in intermolecular interactions within the hypothetical physiologic dimer, discussed below. The amino acid sequence alignment for UROD from tobacco (plant), human (mammal), Escherichia coli (bacterium), and Aquifex aeolicus (archea), together with the location of the secondary structure elements for the tobacco model, is depicted in Fig.1 C. The sequence of UROD has been considerably conserved throughout evolution with overall 33% similarity (18Mock H.-P. Trainotti L. Kruse E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with two unique signature patterns (Prosite documentation access no. PDOC00705) (32Garey J.R. Labbe-Bois R. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Harrison L. Kushner J. Labbe P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The highest homologous pattern, located near the N terminus, contains a perfectly conserved hexapeptide (Pro27–Arg36in tobacco UROD), whereas the second is based on a well conserved region located in the central part of the protein (Gly148–Gly163 in tobacco UROD). Tobacco UROD was crystallized in space group P622 with one molecule per asymmetric unit of the crystal unit cell. Using a two-fold crystallographic symmetry axis, this monomer forms a dimer similar to the homologous human enzyme (16Whitby F.G. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2463-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Superposition of tobacco and human dimers has a root mean square displacement of 1.67 Å for all Cα atoms. This value is higher than the calculated one for the individual monomers' superimposition (1.12 Å) (Fig.2 B) and can be explained by a slightly different arrangement of the protein subunits in the dimers. The dimer displays a head-to-head arrangement with overall dimensions of ∼70 × 40 × 43 Å3 (Fig. 2 A). The flat dimer interface is extensive and largely hydrophilic, involving 11 direct hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Part of these interactions involve residues from secondary structure elements extra to the (βα)7-barrel motif, namely helices αG, 310-II, and 310-IV. In addition, 19 of the 30 solvent molecules buried upon dimerization form hydrogen bonds with residues in both monomers, thus contributing to the hydrogen-bonding network at the dimer interface. Solvent-mediated polar interactions are more numerous than direct hydrogen bonds with one interface water per 92 Å2 ASA compared with one direct hydrogen bond per 250 Å2 ASA. These values are in good agreement with results obtained from structural analysis on protein-protein interaction (33Conte L.L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Although protein crystal contacts are tenuous and generally form only under conditions designed to limit protein solubility and maximize protein-protein interactions, the oligomeric state observed in crystals can reflect a biological function (34Dasgupta S. Iyer G.H. Bryant S.H. Lawrence C.E. Bell J.A. Proteins. 1997; 28: 494-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In tobacco UROD, more than 1380 Å2/monomer's solvent accessible surface area (ASA) are buried at the dimer interface. This value is well above the ASA mean value of 280 Å2/monomer, typical for random packing interactions in protein crystals (35Janin J. Rodier F. Proteins. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium and dynamic light scattering analysis with the protein sample producing diffracting crystals clearly shows a dimeric state for tobacco UROD in solution (36Martins B.M. Grimm B. Mock H.-P. Richter G. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; D57: 1709-1711Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As a similar dimer has been observed in the human UROD crystal structure, it is presumed to display the protein dimer under physiologic conditions. In common with other (βα)8-barrel proteins, different regions of the tobacco UROD sequence contribute with residues to the catalytic cleft located at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel core. The extended loops L1, L2, L3, and L4, together with loops L5, L6, and L8, build up an funnel-like cleft with approximated dimensions of 14 × 12 × 12 Å3 (Fig. 3 A). The β-hairpin in loop L2 forms a lid partially covering its top entrance. A striking feature of the funnel is its incomplete enclosure. Whereas loops L1 to L4 span from bottom to top of the cleft accounting for most of the funnel walls, the short loops L5, L6, and L8 contribute with residues mainly to the bottom part, thus leaving the top edge of the funnel exposed to solvent. This structural feature is difficult to conceive with shielding the substrate from solvent contact inside a closed catalytic cleft, but might be essential for catalysis. Interestingly, the same exposed flanking region is involved in the dimer interface. The mechanistic implications from this structural feature will be discussed later. Several strictly and well conserved side chains line the walls of the catalytic cleft. For a simple enumeration, they were grouped into three regions: base, bottom, and top edge. The top stacked layer of the β-barrel core forms the base of the cleft. Residues Phe149, Phe212, Ser214, and His329 build the bottom part, whereas Arg32, Arg36, Tyr41, Phe80, Asp82, Tyr159, and Trp215 line the top edge (Fig. 3 B). A superimposition of the catalytic clefts from tobacco and human URODs shows the general structural conservation of these side chains (Fig. 3 C). Three other polar side chains strictly conserved among the known plant URODs are positioned at the top edge, namely Arg54, Ser55, and Ser253. Analysis of x-ray crystallographic data from protein-ligand complexes including enzymes from the tetrapyrrole metabolism (37Louie G.V. Brownlie P.D. Lambert R. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Wood S.P.

Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4266-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) indicates that carboxylate groups not removed during catalysis are usually stabilized through salt bridges with positively charged residues. Consistently, in addition to Arg32 and Arg36, we find several other positive side chains wrapping the top edge, namely Lys39, Lys47, Arg54, Lys98, Lys100, and Lys167. In contrast to the positively charged flanking regions, the cleft's surface is hydrophobic except for two polar patches, and displays one protrusion and two grooves (Fig. 3 B). Asp82, responsible for one of those polar patches, sticks out of the surface producing the protrusion. The second patch coincides with the positively charged groove in the top edge formed by Arg32, Arg36, and Arg54. Residues Phe212, Ser214, Trp215, Ser253, and His329 line the groove in the bottom part. Inside this groove, additional clear electron density was observed and modeled as a sulfate ion, with all the oxygen atoms involved in a dense hydrogen bond network with those residues. The catalytic mechanism of UROD has been studied in great detail. One important result is that, in the conversion of uro-III into copro-III, the acetate side chains of rings D, A, B, and C are decarboxylated in a clockwise fashion starting at ring D (7Jackson A.H. Sancovich H.A. Ferramola A.M. Evans N. Games D.E. Matlin S.A. Elder G.H. Smith S.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 273: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other fundamental aspects were revealed by stereochemical studies (37Louie G.V. Brownlie P.D. Lambert R. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Woodcock S.C. Jordan P.M. Nature. 1992; 359: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38Erskine P.T. Norton E. Cooper J.B. Lambert R. Coker A. Lewis G. Spencer P. Sarwar M. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4266-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two methylene hydrogen atoms of the acetate side chain remain undisturbed, and a new C-H bond replaces the carboxylate group with retention of configuration. Based on these results, a mechanism was proposed involving protonation of one α-position of the pyrrole ring moiety. This tautomerization promotes electron withdrawal from the acetate side chain resulting in CO2 liberation. At physiological pH uro-III will be ionized and may be linked to a conjugate acid by a hydrogen bond. All of the 24 possible decarboxylation reaction sequences for uro-III can generate the reaction product, copro-III. However, UROD sequentially removes the carboxylate groups starting at ring D, indicating specific protein-ligand interactions within the catalytic cleft. It is believed that certain residues in close proximity function both in the decarboxylation of the acetate side chain and the stabilization of the neighboring propionate side chain. In addition, in close proximity to these residues, a recognition site for the pyrrole nitrogens is required (9Akhtar M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 180: 131-152PubMed Google Scholar). No specific catalytic acid/base group has been proposed to perform the protonation of the pyrrole ring moiety. Apart from Arg32 and Arg36, the only other invariant polar residues present within the cleft are Asp82, Tyr159, and His329, being therefore the prime candidate residues for catalysis. The presence of a patch of a negative charge (Asp82) in the cleft's hydrophobic environment is conspicuous. Under physiological conditions, aspartate residues are usually ionized but an apolar surround can greatly increase their p Ka values. Thus, when protonated Asp82 would be the ideal residue to involve the acetate side chains of the substrate in a hydrogen-bonded structure, and to protonate the intermediate methylene side chain. Tyr159 is located in close proximity to Asp82, and its side chain is relatively exposed within the cleft, making it a candidate for the protonation of one α-position in the pyrrole ring moieties. The third invariant residue is His329, located opposite to Asp82 and Tyr159. The nearby groove buries a sulfate ion, indicating a possible anchoring site for the substrate side chains. This residue was shown not to be essential for catalysis, being most likely involved in isomer recognition a"

This potency results from the formation of a strong electrostatic interaction between a protonated endocyclic nitrogen at the “anomeric” center of the inhibitor and the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme. Although the majority of retaining β-glycosidases use a mechanism involving a carboxylate residue as a nucleophile, Streptomyces plicatusβ-N-acetylhexos-aminidase (SpHEX) and related family 20 glycosidases lack such a catalytic residue and use instead the carbonyl oxygen of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate as a nucleophile to “attack” the anomeric center.

A crystallographic complex of GalNAc-isofagomine bound to SpHEX was solved and refined to 1.75 Å and revealed that the lack of a strong electrostatic interaction between the “anomeric” center of GalNAc-isofagomine and SpHEX is compensated for by a novel 2.8-Å hydrogen bond formed between the equatorial proton of the endocyclic nitrogen of the azasugar ring and the carboxylate of the general acid-base residue Glu-314 of SpHEX.

Indeed, glycosidases have been implicated in numerous carbohydrate-mediated processes related to disease, and much effort has been devoted to selectively controlling such glycosidase activity. Prominent examples include the use of sialidase inhibitors such as zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and the experimental compound BCX-1812 for the treatment of influenza (2Gubareva L.V. Kaiser L. Hayden F.G. Lancet. 2000; 355: 827-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and intestinal α-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose and miglitol) for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (4Martin A.E. Montgomery P.A. Am. J. Health Syst. Pharm. 1996; 53: 2277-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Welborn T.A. Med. J. Aust. 1998; 168: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The recent successes of sugar-based therapeutics has encouraged the continuing effort to develop a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism of glycosidases through the synthesis and subsequent kinetic and structural analysis of novel inhibitors. Glycosidases catalyze glycosidic bond hydrolysis via a nucleophilic substitution reaction that can result in two possible stereochemical outcomes: net retention or inversion of anomeric configuration (6Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This distinction divides glycosidases into two broad families: the retaining and the inverting glycosidases. Interestingly, when glycosidases are grouped into families based on primary amino acid sequence similarity (8Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar), this distinction holds; all enzymes within a family appear to catalyze reactions with the same stereochemical outcome (9Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). There are currently more than 70 families of which at least 30 contain members whose three-dimensional structure has been determined (visit afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/db.html on the Web) (10Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Although glycosidases are a structurally diverse group of enzymes, two key active site carboxyl groups are conserved throughout the majority of glycosidase families and are intimately involved in glycosidic bond hydrolysis (7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Inverting glycosidases are understood to use a single-displacement mechanism in which the two carboxyl groups, acting as general base and general acid catalysts, are spaced ∼10.5 Å apart, a distance large enough to allow the substrate and a water molecule to bind between them (6Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 11Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the glycosidic linkage involves protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by the general acid-catalyst in concert with general base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of a water at the anomeric center. The net result is a hemiacetal product with an anomeric configuration that is inverted relative to that of the substrate. In contrast, the analogous carboxyl groups in retaining glycosidases are typically spaced 5.5 Å apart and are involved in a double-displacement mechanism (6Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 11Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The first carboxyl group promotes general acid-catalyzed cleavage of the glycosidic bond followed by nucleophilic attack at the anomeric center by the second carboxylate to form a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (see Fig. 1, lower pathway). General base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of an incoming water molecule at the anomeric center of the intermediate yields a hemiacetal with the same anomeric configuration as the substrate. Alternatively, the configuration-retaining β-N-acetylhexosaminidases from families 18 and 20, which lack an apparent enzymic nucleophile, distort the substrate such that the carbonyl oxygen atom of the adjacent 2-acetamido group becomes appropriately positioned to act in place of the missing nucleophilic carboxylate (see Fig. 1, upper pathway) (12Tews I.

Indeed, it has been shown that the enzymic nucleophile of the family 7 β-retaining endoglucanase I from Fusarium oxysporumoverlaps the position of the 2-acetamido carbonyl oxygen of chitobiose bound to the family 20 chitobiase from Serratia marcescens when the two structures are superimposed (16Sulzenbacher G. Driguez H. Henrissat B. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15280-15287Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Anchimeric assistance by the neighboring 2-acetamido group of the substrate replaces the need for a second enzymic carboxylate and results in the formation of an enzyme-stabilized oxazolinium ion intermediate (17Knapp S.

The cyclic intermediate is hydrolyzed by general base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of water at the anomeric center in a manner analogous to the “normal” double-displacement mechanism described above (18Mark B.L.

Transition state structures occurring along the reaction coordinates of both inverting and retaining glycosidases are known to have substantial oxocarbenium ion character (7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 19McCarter J.D. Adam M.J. Withers S.G. Biochem.

The reversible azasugar inhibitors of the deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine classes are believed to mimic charge distributions found within oxocarbenium ion transition state structures (1Heightman T.D. Vasella A.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 750-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bols M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 1-8Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Ichikawa Y. Igarashi Y. Ichikawa M. Suhara Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5854Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Assumed to be protonated and positively charged when bound in the enzyme active site, the endocyclic nitrogen atoms of azasugar inhibitors interact favorably with enzyme carboxylates (23Notenboom V. Williams S.J. Hoos R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11553-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, depending on whether the nitrogen is located at the position corresponding to endocyclic oxygen O5, as in the deoxynojirimycin class, or located at the anomeric center, as for the isofagomine inhibitors, there appears to be distinct selectivity for α- and β-retaining glycosidases, respectively (21Bols M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 1-8Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This selectivity was suggested to result from the position of the enzyme nucleophile within the active sites of these enzymes. Indeed, it was demonstrated that, in cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, a retaining α-glycosyltransferase/α-glycosidase, the nucleophile is positioned such that its carboxyl oxygens form a syn interaction with the anomeric center and endocyclic oxygen of the substrate (24Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that this interaction would favor binding of the deoxynojirimycin class of azasugar inhibitors, because the protonated nitrogen (which replaces the endocyclic oxygen) could donate a stabilizing hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the enzyme nucleophile (1Heightman T.D. Vasella A.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 750-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ichikawa Y. Igarashi Y. Ichikawa M. Suhara Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5854Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For β-retaining glycosidases, however, the carboxyl oxygens of the nucleophile interact with the substrate from the opposite side and form instead a syn interaction with the anomeric center and 2-hydroxyl substituent of the substrate (24Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Having no interactions with the endocyclic oxygen, the enzyme nucleophile of retaining β-glycosidases will preferentially interact with the isofagomine class of azasugars whose protonated nitrogen is located at the anomeric center and is poised to donate a hydrogen bond to the enzyme nucleophile (21Bols M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 1-8Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal is the recent crystallographic complex of a potent xylobiose-derived isofagomine inhibitor bound to a retaining family 10 xylanase. It showed a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction between the presumably protonated nitrogen of the inhibitor and the enzyme nucleophile (23Notenboom V. Williams S.J. Hoos R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11553-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent results, however, with the noeuromycin class of isofagomines, which contain a hydroxyl adjacent to the ring nitrogen at the position normally occupied by the 2-hydroxyl, cast some doubts on this conjecture. This class of inhibitor bound more tightly than the isofagomines and with approximately equal affinities to both α- and β-glycosidases (25Liu H. Liang X. Shoel H. Blow A. Bols M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5116-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether the isofagomine class of azasugars could inhibit a β-retaining glycosidase that uses anchimeric assistance and lacks an apparent enzymic nucleophile. The 1-N-azasugar inhibitor (2 R,3 R,4 S,5 R)-2- acetamido-3,4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-piperidinium hydrochloride (GalNAc-isofagomine·HCl) (3, Fig. 1) was synthesized and assayed for its ability to competitively inhibit Streptomyces plicatusβ-N-acetylhexosaminidase (SpHEX).1 SpHEX is a β-retaining family 20 exoglycosidase lacking an enzymic nucleophile (14Mark B.L. Wasney G.A. Salo T.J. Khan A.R. Cao Z. Robbins P.W. James M.N. Triggs-Raine B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19618-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Mark B.L.

It uses instead 2-acetamido group participation in a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism as described above. The crystallographic structure of the complex of GalNAc-isofagomine bound to SpHEX demonstrated a novel binding mode for the inhibitor and provided insight into its unexpectedly potent inhibitory activity toward this family 20 glycosidase. The N-Boc acetonide (26Knapp S. Zhao D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 4037-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (2, Fig. 2) (26 mg, 0.075 mmol) was dissolved in 1.2 ml of trifluoroacetic acid at 0 °C. After 30 min, 0.2 ml of water was added dropwise, and the solution, still at 0 °C, was stirred for 20 min and then allowed to warm to room temperature over a 20-min period. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a residue, cooled to about 5 °C, dissolved in 1 ml of cold ethanol, and then treated with 0.1 ml of 12n hydrochloric acid. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature over a 10-min period then was concentrated and azeotropically dried with toluene (3 × 2 ml). The residue was stirred with 0.5 ml of hexanes, whereupon a solid gradually formed. The solid was separated, washed with diethyl ether (2 × 1 ml), and then dried under vacuum to give 18 mg (98%) of GalNAc-isofagomine (3, Fig. 2) as a white solid, m.p. 140–145 °C (dec):1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD) δ 4.99 (d,J = 9.9 Hz, H-2), 4.08 (br s, H-4), 3.78 (dd,J = 10.2, 2.4 Hz, H-3), 3.69 (dd, J = 10.8, 6.3 Hz, H-7), 3.57 (dd, J = 10.8, 7.5 Hz, H-7), 3.05–3.21 (m, two H-6), 1.98–2.18 (m, H-5), 2.06 (s, NHCOC H3); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CD3OD) δ 175.2, 70.5, 68.9, 62.7, 61.9, 41.9, 41.8, 22.7; fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy 205 (M+H)+ for pyridinium ion of GalNAc-isofagomine (3, Fig. 2). SpHEX was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as an N-terminal His7-tagged fusion protein and affinity-purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) as described previously (18Mark B.L.

Purified SpHEX protein was stored at 4 °C in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and was stable for several weeks. All inhibition constants for GalNAc-isofagomine were measured at 25 °C using p-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside as substrate in a reaction buffer composed of 15 mm sodium phosphate/15 mm sodium citrate buffer, 100 mmsodium chloride, pH 4.00, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Measurements were initiated by addition of SpHEX previously dialyzed against the reaction buffer. Rates were determined by following the increase in absorption at 360 nm arising from the release of p-nitrophenolate in a continuous assay.Ki values were determined by a direct fit of the experimental data using the program GraFit (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, version 4.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Horley Surrey, UK1998Google Scholar). Prior to use in crystallization trials, SpHEX was dialyzed against 50 mm trisodium citrate, pH 5.0, and 300 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml with a Millipore concentrator. Hexagonal bipyramidal crystals (P6122) of the SpHEX·GalNAc-isofagomine complex were obtained by vapor diffusion at room temperature: The concentrated enzyme was incubated with 2 mm GalNAc-isofagomine for 30 min and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with mother liquor (2.1 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0, and 20% glycerol) to create several 8-μl hanging drops from which diffraction quality crystals were obtained within 2 weeks. High resolution diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 9-1 from a single crystal of the complex flash-cooled to 100 K within a cryostatic N2(g) stream. Immediately prior to data collection, the N2(g) stream was diverted away from the flash-cooled crystal for ∼3 s to re-anneal the crystal, thereby reducing its mosaic spread. All diffraction data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38520) Google Scholar). The 1.75-Å resolution 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖, αc and ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖, αc electron density maps (where αc are the calculated phases and ‖Fo‖ and ‖Fc‖ are the measured and calculated structure factors, respectively), used to visualize GalNAc-isofagomine in the SpHEX active site, were obtained using structure factor phases calculated from a model of native SpHEX (Protein Data Bank code 1HP4) (18Mark B.L.

Solvent molecules were removed from the native enzyme model prior to placing it into the unit cell of the GalNAc-isofagomine complex and were relocated during later rounds of refinement. The initial ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖, αc map, computed prior to solvent modeling (Rwork = 25.9%, Rfree = 28.3%), unambiguously defined the conformation of the bound GalNAc-isofagomine, and a model of the inhibitor was manually fit into the electron density using the program O (30Jones T.A.

Open table in a new tab Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (code 1JAK). The potency of isofagomine inhibitors for retaining β-glycosidases has been attributed to the formation of a strong electrostatic interaction between a protonated endocyclic nitrogen at the “anomeric” center of the inhibitor and the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme (23Notenboom V. Williams S.J. Hoos R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11553-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because family 20 glycosidases lack the enzymic nucleophile required to form this strong enzyme·inhibitor interaction, it was hypothesized that isofagomines would be poor inhibitors of family 20 glycosidases. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, GalNAc-isofagomine (3, Fig. 2) was found to act as a potent competitive inhibitor of the family 20 glycosidase SpHEX, exhibiting a Ki of 2.7 μm when using pNPGlcNAc as substrate (Fig. 3). Insight into the mechanism by which GalNAc-isofagomine inhibited SpHEX has been provided by the x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme·inhibitor complex (Fig. 4 A). Crystals of the complex diffracted to 1.75-Å resolution, and the structure refined to an Rwork of 17.6% and Rfreeof 19.2% (Table I). The excellent crystallographic data allowed for the calculation of an easily interpretable ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖, αc electron density map for GalNAc-isofagomine (Fig. 4 B). The inhibitor was located in the −1 subsite of the SpHEX active site pocket (Fig. 4). The azasugar ring of the inhibitor adopts a conformation approaching that of a half-chair, where the endocyclic nitrogen N1 is displaced 0.4 Å from a least-squares plane formed by atoms C2, C3, C5, and C9 (atom C9 replaces the atom O5 found in pyranose rings); whereas atom C4 is displaced 0.7 Å on the opposite side of this plane. Torsion angle measurements within the azasugar ring also demonstrate the flattened nature of the ring about N1 as compared with the x-ray structure of N-acetyl-galactosamine (32Gilardi R.D. Flippen J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1974; 30: 2931-2933Crossref Google Scholar) (TableII). The flattened ring conformation of GalNAc-isofagomine differs from the relaxed4 C1 chair conformation observed for the proximal azasugar ring of xylobiose-derived isofagomine bound to the family 10 glycosidase Cex from Cellulomonas fimi (23Notenboom V. Williams S.J. Hoos R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11553-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that the enzyme-bound conformation of GalNAc-isofagomine better approximates the planar conformation believed to occur for atoms C1, C2, O5, and C5 during the oxocarbenium ion transition state of the natural substrate. The oxocarbenium ion transition state is thought to be a half-chair or skew-boat with atoms C1, C2, O5, and C5 forming a plane (6Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). The co-planarity of these atoms during the transition state is required for effective overlap of the non-bonding lone pair electrons of O5 and the anti-bonding orbital at the electron-deficient anomeric center of the oxocarbenium ion (however, the conformation of GalNAc-isofagomine is not truly planar about atoms C1, C2, C9, and C5). Taken together with the observations for xylobiose-derived isofagomine bound to Cex, it appears that, although the charge distribution in the isofagomine class of azasugars may mimic the oxocarbenium ion transition state, the enzyme-bound conformation of the azasugar ring better reflects that of the pyranose ring of the enzyme-bound intermediate that occurs during reactions catalyzed by β-retaining glycosidases (18Mark B.L.

They are involved in the regulation of photoreceptor membrane-associated guanylyl cyclases that produce cGMP, a second messenger of vertebrate vision. Here, we investigated changes in GCAP1 structure using mutagenesis, chemical modifications, and spectroscopic methods. Two Cys residues of GCAP1 situated in spatially distinct regions of the N-terminal domain (positions 18 and 29) and two Cys residues located within the C-terminal lobe (positions 106 and 125) were employed to detect conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding. GCAP1 mutants with only a single Cys residue at each of these positions, modified withN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine, an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, and with (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate, a spin label reagent, were studied using fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy, respectively. Only minor structural changes around Cys18, Cys29, Cys106, and Cys125 were observed as a function of Ca2+concentration. No Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of GCAP1 was observed at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations, in contrast to the observation reported by others for GCAP2. Based on these results and previous studies, we propose a photoreceptor activation model that assumes changes within the flexible central helix upon Ca2+dissociation, causing relative reorientation of two structural domains containing a pair of EF-hand motifs and thus switching its partner, guanylyl cyclase, from an inactive (or low activity) to an active conformation.

Several hundred distinct Ca2+-binding proteins have been identified, an observation consistent with unique and diverse roles of Ca2+ in various cell types.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NCBPs are 19–25-kDa proteins with four EF-hand motifs and are slightly larger than CaM (∼17 kDa). NCBPs and CaM have a similar two-dimensional structure built around the EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs, of which only two or three of four structural EF-hand elements are functional in various NCBPs. The extensions of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions provide additional structural elements distinct from CaM, and frequently these proteins are myristoylated at the N terminus. The function of these proteins has been intensely scrutinized by several laboratories, with the most detailed insights being gained from studies on the regulation of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases (GCs) by GCAPs. In the dark (at high [Ca2+]), GC activity in the complex with GCAPs is low. Upon illumination when [Ca2+] declines, GCAPs in the Ca2+-free form stimulate GC activity up to 10-fold. This low [Ca2+] stimulation of GCs is one of the key events in the restoration of the dark state of photoreceptor cells (2Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Pugh Jr., E.N. Duda T. Sitaramayya A. Sharma R.K. Biosci.

The structure of recoverin was the first to be determined in Ca2+-bound (9Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-free forms (10Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to the two lobes of CaM and a central α-helix, recoverin contains a short U-shaped inter-domain linker that positions the two domains in close contact with one another. This domain organization in recoverin produces a bi-lobed globular-shaped protein with pseudo C2 symmetry that is significantly different from CaM. Consequently, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the polypeptide chains of recoverin and CaM is ∼10 Å. Although the binding of Ca2+to recoverin produces a large rotation of the two lobes (RMSD = 9.6 Å), the C-terminal domain remains mostly unchanged. By contrast, binding of Ca2+ to the EF2- and EF3-hand motifs causes a prominent rearrangement of the N terminus and the extrusion of the N-terminal myristoyl group, termed the Ca2+-myristoyl switch, enabling recoverin to bind to membranes at high [Ca2+]. In contrast to recoverin, which binds only two Ca2+ ions, frequenin binds three Ca2+ ions at the EF2-, EF3-, and EF4-hand motifs (20Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structural arrangements of this protein are similar to those of neurocalcin and recoverin (RMSD = 1.3–1.7 Å). Because of some changes in the orientation of one of the helices, frequenin contains a large hydrophobic crevice formed by 46 amino acids in the C-terminal lobe of unknown function (21Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This protein has its myristoyl group exposed in both the Ca2+-bound and -free forms (20Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Neurocalcin is a closely related homolog of frequenin with three functional EF-hand motifs (17Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but is a more distantly related cousin to recoverin (RMSD = ∼3.2 Å) and undergoes a conformational change similar to the “Ca2+-myristoyl switch” (17Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The structure of GCAP2 reveals that the four EF-hand motifs are arranged similarly to recoverin (RMSD 2.2 Å). GCAP1 and GCAP3, however, have not been amenable to structural studies, but based on computer predictions and biochemical studies, the EF-hand motifs can be assembled in three-dimensional configurations similar to GCAP2 but different from CaM and with the unique inhibitory role for the myristoyl group on GC at high [Ca2+] (2Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly to recoverin, the structure of GCAP1 is significantly altered in response to Ca2+ binding as determined using fluorescence methods (30Sokal I. Otto-Bruc A.E. Surgucheva I. Verlinde C.L.

Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ converts GCAP1 from an activator to an inhibitor of photoreceptor GC1 (32Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with concomitant major conformational changes during this transition. GCAP1 is associated with membranes or with the particulate photoreceptor GCs at low and high [Ca2+] (31Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I.G. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The region around the EF3-hand motif, specifically Tyr99, becomes significantly more exposed to solvent in the Ca2+-free form of GCAP1. Limited proteolysis studies also indicate that the N terminus is exposed in Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms (32Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a point mutation in Tyr99 (Y99C) leads to the constitutive stimulation of GC even at high [Ca2+]. This phenotype is thought to be associated with elevated levels of cGMP in cones and autosomal dominant cone dystrophy in one British family (33Sokal I. Li N. Surgucheva I. Warren M.J. Payne A.M.

GCAP1 has four endogenous Cys residues at positions 18, 29, 106, and 125 suitable for specific chemical modifications. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in combination with chemical modifications (Scheme FS1) to examine the effect of Ca2+ binding on the stimulation of photoreceptor GC by GCAP1. We also used fluorescence and EPR spectroscopies to examine the nature of the conformational changes in GCAP1 and its mutants. We provide evidence that Ca2+binding induces minor local changes around two C-terminal and N-terminal lobes, each containing two EF-hand motifs. In agreement with previous studies, we propose a photoreceptor GC activation model that assumes changes within the flexible central helix of GCAP1, causing relative reorientation of two structural domains and switching GCAP1 from the active to the inactive state. The bovine GCAP1 coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers, which inserted a His6 tag before the stop codon. The resulting fragment bGCAP1-His6 was cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene). The transfer vector pVLGCAP1His was constructed by subcloning a NotI-BamHI fragment into corresponding sites of the pVL1392 insect cell vector (BD Pharmingen). The GCAP1 mutants were generated with the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The single mutants were generated with pVLGCAP1His as the template. The primers used are listed in Table I: C18S-s/C18S-a for GCAP1(C18S), C29G-s/C29G-a for GCAP1(C29G), C29N/D-s and C29N/D-a for GCAP1(C29D) and GCAP1(C29N), C29Y-s/C29Y-a for GCAP1(C29Y), C1096-s/C106S-a for GCAP1(C106S), and C125S-s/C125S-a for GCAP1(C125S). Double mutants were generated by using DNA of GCAP1(C18S) or GCAP1(C106S) as templates, and triple mutants were generated by using DNAs of double mutants as template. The Cys-less GCAP1 2GCAP1 has four Cys residues in positions 18, 29, 106 and 125. GCAP1 with mutation of Cys18 to Ser, Cys29 to Asn, Cys106 to Ser, and Cys125 to Ser is denoted as GCAP1(c−). For simplicity, the triple mutants with the Cys that is preserved as in wild-type GCAP1 are denoted as C18-GCAP1(c−), C29-GCAP1(c−), C106-GCAP1(c−), or C125-GCAP1(c−). mutant GCAP1(C18S,C29N,C106S,C125S) (GCAP1(c−)) was created using C29-GCAP1(c−) DNA as the template. The Ca2+-insensitive bGCAP1(E75Q,E111Q,E155Q)-His6was created with a similar approach, the primers used were E75Q-s/E75Q-a, E111Q-s/E111Q-a, and E155Q-s/E155Q-a. The clones and DNA samples were isolated by standard procedures, and the entire coding frames of GCAP1 and its mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.Table IThe list of GCAP1 mutagenesis primersNameSenseAntisenseC18S5′-CAGCACCGAGTCCCACCAGTGGTAC5′-GTACCACTGGTGGGACTCGGTGCTGC29S5′-CATGACAGAGTCCCCCTCCGGCC5′-GGCCGGAGGGGGACTCTGTCATGC29G5′-CATGACAGAGGGCCCCTCCGGCC5′-GGCCGGAGGGGCCCTCTGTCATGC29N & C29D5′-CATGACAGAG(A/G)ACCCCTCCGG CC5′-GGCCGGAGGGGT(T/C)CTCTGTCATGC29Y5′-CATGACAGAGTACCCCTCCGGCC5′-GGCCGGAGGGGTACTCTGTCATGC106S5′-CGGCAACGGATCCATCGACCGCG AC5′-GTCGCGGTCGATGGATCCGTTGCCGC125S5′-GCCATTAACCCCTCCAGCGACTCGACC5′-GGTCGAGTCGCTGGAGGGGTTAATGGCE75Q5′-CATTGATTTCATGCAGTACGTGGC GG5′-CCGCCACGTACTGCATGAAATCAATGE111Q5′-CGACCGCGACCAGCTGCTCACCA TC5′-GATGGTGAGCAGCTGGTCGCGGTCGE155Q5′-CTCCCTAGAGCAGTTCATGGAGGG5′-CCCTCCATGAACTGCTCTAGGGAG Open table in a new tab The baculovirus transfer vectors carrying GCAP1 and its mutants were purified by Qiagen plasmid kits. High Five insect cells from cabbage looper were cotransfected with 0.25 μg of BaculoGold (BD Pharmingen) DNA and 5 μg of transfer vector in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. After 4 days, the cells were harvested, pelleted, homogenized (in water containing protease inhibitor mixture - Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and centrifuged (10 min at 4000 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant containing GCAP1-His6 or its mutants was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography in nondenaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In some experiments, GCAP1 and its mutants were further purified by gel filtration as described below. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Schenk Packing Company, Stanwood, WA). Washed ROS membranes were prepared as described previously (36Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), reconstituted with recombinant GCAPs, and assayed as described by Otto-Bruc et al. (37Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). [Ca2+] was calculated using the computer program Chelator 1.00 (38Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-874PubMed Google Scholar), and all assays were repeated at least twice. Although some data are shown without standard deviations, they are the averages of two determinations. Similar results were obtained from at least three different sets of experiments performed in duplicate. As a consequence of the high sensitivity of the GC system, the absolute values of one series occasionally varied from another by 10–20%, but with preservation of the ratio between the activity of two different preparations (for example, mutants of GCAP1). Typically, 0.5 ml of protein (0.2 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and then treated with a modifying reagent, MTSEA, MTSET, or MTSES (Anatrace) (stock solution was 50 mm in H2O; the final concentration in the sample was 100 μm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. Labeled protein was separated from nonreacted modifying reagents by dialysis or by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Ellman's reagent, 5,5′-dithio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; Sigma), reacts with sulfhydryl groups under slightly alkaline conditions to release the chromogenic compound 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate, which absorbs at 412 nm with an absorption coefficient of 13,600 m−1cm−1. The reaction of DTNB with native and modified forms of GCAP1 and its mutants was carried out either in 900 μl of guanidine hydrochloride (final concentration, 4 m), pH 8.0, or in 900 μl of 10 mm BTP, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 156.25 μm to 390.6 μm CaCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of DTNB solution (final concentration, 1.8 mm). After spectrum stabilization, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of GCAP1. The increase in absorbance was directly proportional to the concentration of free sulfhydryl groups in solution. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Purified protein (0.6 mg/ml, 1 mg) was mixed with 2 μl (100 mm) of IANBD (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the sample was ultracentrifuged (10 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C) and loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl. Excess dye was removed by washing the column with the same buffer. Labeled protein was eluted from the column by 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl, and protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 60 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mmMgCl2. In similar experiments, GCAP1 mutants modified by IANBD were repurified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described above. Fluorescent measurement of modified mutants was carried out on a PerkinElmer LS 50 B spectrofluorimeter using a 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette. Emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 650 nm with excitation wavelength at 480 nm and 7.5-nm slit width. Spectra were determined in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 60 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, and 156.25 or 390.6 μmCaCl2. [Ca2+]free was calculated as noted previously. For IANBD, an extinction coefficient of 21,000m−1 cm−1 at 481 nm was used to determine the concentration and stoichiometry of modification. Purified GCAP1 mutants containing single Cys residues (typically ∼100 μm) were incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of the sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide spin label (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (Scheme FS1; gift from Prof. K. Hideg) overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 20 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mm EGTA buffer. Unreacted spin label was removed by repeated washing with the same buffer in Microcon centrifugal filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). EPR spectroscopy was carried out on a Varian E109 X-band spectrometer fitted with a loop-gap resonator (40Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar, 41Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein samples of 6 μl were contained in Pyrex capillaries. Spectra were recorded using a 2 mW incident microwave power and 100 kHz field modulation. Collision rates of spin labels with oxygen in air were estimated using the power saturation technique as described previously (42Altenbach C. Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7806-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GCAP1 or its mutants (∼0.3 mg/ml, 250 μl) was loaded on Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, and 150 mmNaCl, 50 μm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. In additional experiments, the CaCl2 concentration was 1 mm or substituted by 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were detected at 280 nm, 0.4-ml fractions were collected by SDS-PAGE, and an aliquot from each fraction was examined for the GC stimulatory (inhibitory) activity. To obtain additional insight into the conformational changes of GCAP1 upon Ca2+ binding, we employed highly specific chemical modifications of Cys residues in combination with mutagenesis, fluorescence, and EPR spectroscopy. Bovine GCAP1 has four Cys residues. The first two, Cys18 and Cys29, are located at the N-terminal region. The last two are Cys106, which is a part of EF3-hand motif, and Cys125, which is located in the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 1, A andB). In the three-dimensional model of GCAP1, based on the x-ray structure of Ca2+-bound form of recoverin and the NMR structure of GCAP2 (Fig. 1 B), these four Cys are located in different regions of the protein and thus are ideally suited for reporting local changes upon Ca2+ binding. Two residues, Cys29 and Cys106 are present in the acidic part of GCAP1 containing EF-hand loops, whereas Cys18 and Cys125 are projecting toward the opposite ends of GCAP1 (Fig. 1 B). GCAP1 does not contain disulfide groups. Only Cys29 is highly conserved among NCBPs, with the exception of GCAP3 (Fig. 1 C). This suggests a special functional or structural role of Cys29 in GCAP1 and in corresponding positions of other NCBPs. Our experience with bacterially expressed GCAP1 was that the protein is marginally active or not active at all; therefore more time-consuming insect cell expression was required. Several complementary techniques were used to assess the properties and folding of GCAP1 and its mutants. First, recombinant bovine GCAP1 and all mutants with His6 tag were purified to apparent homogeneity, employing metal affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). All purification procedures and preparation of ROS membranes were previously reported (1Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K.

https://openalex.org/W2139279934,"Abstract SRCAP (SNF2-related CPB activator protein) belongs to the SNF2 family of proteins whose members participate in various aspects of transcriptional regulation, including chromatin remodeling. It was identified by its ability to bind to cAMP-responsive-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), and it increases the transactivation function of CBP. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter was used as a model system to explore the role of SRCAP in the regulation of transcription mediated by factors that utilize CBP as a coactivator. We show that transcription of a PEPCK chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene activated by protein kinase A (PKA) is enhanced 7-fold by SRCAP. In the absence of PKA this SRCAP-mediated enhancement does not occur, suggesting that SRCAP functions as a coactivator for PKA-activated factors such as CREB. Replacing the PEPCK promoter binding site for CREB with a binding site for Gal4 (ΔCRE (cAMP-responsive element) Gal4 PEPCK-CAT reporter gene) blocks the ability of SRCAP to activate transcription despite the presence of PKA. Expression of a Gal-CREB chimera restores the ability of PKA to regulate transcription of the ΔCRE Gal4 PEPCK gene and restored the ability of SRCAP to stimulate PKA-activated transcription. In addition, SRCAP in the presence of PKA enhances the ability of the Gal-CREB chimera to activate transcription of a Gal-CAT reporter gene that contains only binding sites for Gal4. SRCAP binds to CBP amino acids 280–460, a region that is important for CBP to function as a coactivator for CREB. Overexpression of a SRCAP peptide corresponding to this CBP binding domain acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of CREB-mediated transcription. Structure-function studies were done to explore the mechanism(s) by which SRCAP regulates transcription. These studies indicate that the N-terminal region of SRCAP, which contains five of the seven regions that comprise the ATPase domain, is not needed for activation of CREB-mediated transcription. SRCAP apparently has several domains that participate in the activation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2054656938,"Multiple subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D) of α1-adrenoreceptors (α1ARs) co-exist in the heart and mediate a variety of cellular functions. We studied α1AR modulation of inward rectifier (IK1) and transient outward (Ito) K+ currents in canine ventricular myocytes. Phenylephrine at 10 µm depressed only Ito without affectingIK1 and at 100 µm inhibited bothIto and IK1. The effect of phenylephrine on Ito was abolished by (+)niguldipine (10 nm) to inhibit α1AARs but not by chloroethyclonidine (10 µm) to inactivate α1BARs nor by BMY-7378 to antagonize α1DARs. In contrast, phenylephrine inhibition ofIK1 was reversed only by BMY-7378 (1 nm). PDD (100 nm, phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C (PKC)) simulates and bisindolylmaleimide (50 nm, PKC inhibitor) weakens phenylephrine modulation ofIto but not IK1. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93 and inhibitor peptides abolished the effects of phenylephrine on IK1. Enhancement of PKC or CaMKII activities was seen in α1aAR- or α1dAR-transfected HEK293 cells and in myocytes pretreated with 10 or 100 µm phenylephrine, respectively. Our data suggest that different subtypes of α1ARs selectively modulate different cardiac K+ currents via different signal transduction mechanisms; α1AARs mediateIto regulation via PKC, and α1DARs mediate IK1 regulation via CaMKII.

Many cellular responses to α1ARs are mediated by multiple subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D) (1Fedida D. Braun A.P. Giles W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Minneman K.P. Theroux T.L. Hollinger S. Han C. Esbenshade T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 929-936PubMed Google Scholar, 3Endoh M.

In the heart, whereas the α1A and α1B subtypes have been well characterized, the presence of α1DAdR was indicated only recently (5Han C.D., Yu, G. Zhang Y. Xu K. Qu P. Dong E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 294: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Deng X.F. Chemtob S. Varma D.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Yang H.T. Endoh M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the pathophysiological roles of α1Aand α1B receptors have been well appreciated, those of α1D subtype in the heart remain to be determined. Enhanced α1AR activity has been implicated in various types of arrhythmias, particularly those in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning, cardiac hypertrophy, etc. (1Fedida D. Braun A.P. Giles W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Endoh M. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Drug intervention with α1ARs has thus become an attractive issue for developing new compounds for potential therapy. A significant mechanism underlying α1AR-induced alteration of cardiac electrical activity is attributable to the ability of α1ARs to modulate ion channels. To date, no less than seven cardiac ionic currents are on the list of α1AR modulation, including inward rectifier K+ current (IK1), transient outward K+ current (Ito), delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), ultrarapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKur), acetylcholine-induced K+ current (IKACh), calcium current (ICa), and chloride current (1Fedida D.

However, it is not known whether the effects are the results from participation of all three different subtypes of α1ARs or of a particular individual subtype, although evidence is accumulating that different subtypes may have different roles in regulating cardiac contraction and electrical activities (12Billman G.E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Anyukhovsky E.P. Rosen M.R.

Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies also demonstrated subtype differences in the signal transduction (17Taguchi K. Yang M. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Naunyn Schmiedbergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Ohmi K. Shinoura H. Nakayama Y. Goda N. Tsujimoto G. Br. J.

In light of these studies, we speculated that different subtypes of α1ARs may have distinct effects on ion channels. Understanding subtype specificity of α1ARs in ion channel regulation is of theoretical and practical importance. K+ currents play critical roles in determining cardiac electrical activities. Besides stabilizing resting potential,IK1 in cardiac cells also plays an important role in modulating cellular excitability and regulating membrane repolarization, therefore an important determinant of action potential initiation. Another important cardiac K+ current is transient outward K+ current (Ito), which is known to be critical for initiating cardiac repolarization in the early phase of action potentials. Both of these currents have been implicated in the pathology of cardiac electrophysiological disorders and heart failure (20Beaumont J. Michaels D.C. Delmar M. Davidenko J. Jalife J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1181-H1194PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, we explored the potential subtype selectivity and signal transduction mechanisms of α1ARs in regulating Ito andIK1 in isolated canine ventricular myocytes using whole cell patch clamp techniques. Single canine myocytes were isolated from the epicardium of left ventricles with techniques as described previously (21Shi H. Wang H. Wang Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H295-H299PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophysiological experiments, the dispersed cells were stored in KB medium (20 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmglucose, 70 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmβ-hydroxybutyric acid, 20 mm taurine, 10 mmEGTA, 0.1% albumin, and 40 mm mannitol, pH 7.4). Patch clamp recording techniques used have been described in detail elsewhere (22Wang Z. Yue L. White M. Pelletier G. Nattel S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Wang Z. Feng J. Shi H. Pond A. Nerbonne J.M. Nattel S. Circ.

Junction potentials were zeroed before formation of the membrane-pipette seal in Tyrode's solution. The capacitance and series resistance was electrically compensated to minimize the duration of the capacitive surge on the current recording and the voltage drop across the clamped cell membrane. Ito was defined as the peak current amplitude, and IK1 was measured as the amplitude at the end of 400-ms pulses. The experiments were conducted at 36 °C. The bath solution for whole cell patch clamp recording had the following composition 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mm CaCl2; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Unless otherwise specified, the pipette solution contained 0.1 mm GTP, 110 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mmphosphocreatine, pH 7.3. Sodium current was prevented by holding the cells at −20 or −50 mV, and calcium current was blocked by inclusion of Cd2+ (200 µm) in the bathing solution. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Phenylephrine (Phen; used as a non-subtype-selective α1AR agonist), prazosin (a non-subtype-selective α1AR antagonist), (+)niguldipine (Nig; a specific inhibitor of α1AARs), chloroethyclonidine (CEC; an alkylating agent for α1BARs), BMY-7378 (a specific antagonist of α1DARs), and propranolol were from Sigma (Oakville, Canada). Phen, Nig, CEC, and BMY-7378 were prepared as 100 mm, 10 µm, 10 mm, and 1 µm stock solutions in distilled water, respectively. Phen was always administered along with 1 µm propranolol to prevent any collateral effects mediated by β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Prazosin was dissolved in Me2SO. The protein kinase C (PKC)-stimulating phorbol ester 12,13-didecanoate (PDD) and its inactive congener 4α-PDD were obtained from Calbiochem-Novobiochem International (La Jolla, CA) and prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO. Bisindolylmaleimide (Bis; PKC inhibitor; Sigma) was dissolved as a 50 µm stock solution in Me2SO. KN-93 (a specific inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)), KN-92 (inactive analog of KN-93), synthetic CaMKII inhibitor peptides (peptide 281–309 (P281–309), a potent calmodulin antagonist containing the calmodulin-binding site amino acids 290–309 and the autophosphorylation site Thr286 of CaMKII)), and autocamtide-2-related peptide (ACP) were all purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma. KN-93 and KN-92 were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the bathing solution to the desired concentrations. P281–309 and ACP were dissolved in the pipette solution. The HEK293 cells stably transfected with α1aARs and α1dARs were a kind gift from Dr. Kenneth P. Minneman (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were passaged regularly and subcultured to ∼90% confluence before experimental procedures. For drug treatment, the cells were incubated with Phen at 10 or 100 µm or vehicle for 20 min before being collected for protein preparation. Similarly, isolated canine ventricular myocytes were also treated with Phen or vehicle in KB solution for 20 min. The proteins were prepared following the same procedures as described previously (25Han H. Wang H. Long H. Nattel S. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26357-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Wang H. Han H. Zhang L. Shi H. Schram G. Nattel S. Wang Z. Mol.

PKC activity was assayed with the PKC enzyme assay system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the assay procedures were performed according to the system instructions. The Anti-ACTIVE® CaM KII polyclonal antibody system from Promega was used to assess CaMKII activity, containing the rabbit polyclonal antibody, which recognizes autophosphorylation of Thr286 of all isoforms of CaMKII. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturers' protocol. Bound antibodies were detected with Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometry, as detailed previously (25Han H. Wang H. Long H. Nattel S. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26357-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Wang H. Han H. Zhang L. Shi H. Schram G. Nattel S. Wang Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Coomassie staining was performed to verify the amount of protein inputs, as described previously (25Han H. Wang H. Long H. Nattel S. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26357-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Wang H. Han H. Zhang L. Shi H. Schram G. Nattel S. Wang Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The group data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made with Student's nonpaired t test. All enzyme activity and Western blot determinations were performed in parallel with cells from each group for each experiment to minimize contamination by inter-day and inter-lot reagent variation, and the results for each experiment are expressed as the values normalized to control group determinations. Application of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing voltage steps (voltage protocols shown in thenon-graphical parts of Fig. 1) elicited outward Ito with transient properties (rapid activation and inactivation) or IK1 with strongly inward rectification. Bath application of Phen at 10 µm produced marked reduction ofIto amplitude without apparent alterations in its activation and inactivation kinetics but did not affectIK1 (Fig. 1). When Phen concentration was elevated to 100 µm, IK1 was significantly decreased, Ito was further reduced, and the inactivation kinetics was slightly decelerated. Co-application with prazosin (1 µm) completely converted the depressed Ito andIK1 caused by Phen back to predrug base-line values, indicating the role of α1ARs in mediating the effects of Phen. To determine which receptor subtypes, α1A, α1B, or α1D, mediate the effect of α1AR modulation of Ito and IK1, we performed experiments using subtype-selective antagonists. Current recordings made under control conditions were repeated 10 min after exposure of the cells to Phen (10 µm). Subsequently, Nig (10 nm) was concurrently applied with Phen to the bath solution. As illustrated in Fig. 2, Nig reversed Phen-induced Ito depression. Nig also reduced the further reduction of Ito caused by raising Phen concentration to 100 µm. On the other hand, Nig failed to change the depressed IK1 caused by Phen (100 µm). We then turned to study the effects of CEC (10 µm), an alkylating agent selective toward α1BARs over other subtypes. Following a 30-min incubation with CEC to inactivate the α1BARs, the cells were superfused with drug-free Tyrode's solution for 20 min, and then measurements ofIto and IK1 were made as base-line values. Then Phen was added to the superfusate. The same degrees of Ito and IK1diminishment as in cells without pretreatment with CEC were consistently seen in a total of six cells (Fig. 2). BMY-7378 (1 nm), a specific antagonist of α1DARs (3Endoh M. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Hieble J.P. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Prog. Drug Res. 1996; 47: 81-129PubMed Google Scholar, 27Goetz A.S. King H.K. Ward S.D.C. True T.A. Rimele T.J. Saussy Jr., D.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 272: R5-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), when co-applied with Phen, nearly fully reversed the inhibitory effects of Phen (100 µm) onIK1 but not Ito (Fig.3). BMY-7378 alone did not exert any detectable effects on IK1 (n = 5). α1ARs are known to stimulate activation of PKC (17Taguchi K. Yang M. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Naunyn Schmiedbergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Varma D.R. Deng X.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2000; 78: 267-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn can phosphorylate the channel proteins. To investigate whether PKC can account for the α1AR modulation ofIto and IK1, the effects of PKC inhibitor Bis and activator PDD were assessed (10Yue L. Feng J. Wang Z. Nattel S. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Li G.R. Feng J.L. Wang Z. Fermini B. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 10 min after superfusion with Phen (10 µm) to verify the effect on Ito, Bis (50 nm) was co-applied. As illustrated in Fig. 3, Bis nearly abolished the depressing effects of Phen on Ito. By comparison, Bis failed to affect the reduction of IK1 by 100 µm Phen, even with elevated Bis concentrations up to 200 nm. External application of PDD (100 nm), mimicking the effect of Phen on Ito, caused marked suppression of Ito amplitude. Moreover, no significant effect of 4α-PDD (100 nm, the inactive stereoisomer of PDD) on Ito was seen, and when in the presence of Bis, PDD had little effect onIto. Slight reduction of canineIK1 (about 7%) was observed when treated with PDD (100 nm). CaMKII has recently been reported to be involved in regulating ion currents (29Don Koh S. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Kenyon J.L. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Roeper J. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tessier S. Karczewski P. Krause E.-G. Pansard Y. Acar C. Lang-Lazdunski M. Mercadier J.-J. Hatem S.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also studied the potential participation of CaMKII in α1ARs or Phen modulation ofIto and IK1. As illustrated in Fig. 4, Phen at 10 µm produced the similar effects onIto with and without KN-93 (3 µm, a potent CaMKII inhibitor) present in the bath solution. However, with 100 µm Phen, Ito reduction was slightly smaller in the presence of KN-93 than in the absence of the compound (Fig. 4B). The CaMKII inhibitor peptides P281–309 or ACP dialyzed into the cells did not affectIto neither the ability of Phen to inhibitIto (Fig. 4, A and C). By comparison, the reduction of IK1 caused by Phen (100 µm) alone was completely prevented by KN-93 (Fig.5). We then examined whether the effects of KN-93 on IK1 were related to the inhibition of CaMKII activity or to a direct effect on K+ channels. KN-92 (10 µm), the inactive analog of KN-93, failed to affect IK1 reduction caused by Phen (Fig.5B). Further evidence that IK1 is regulated by CaMKII was obtained by dialyzing cells with the inhibitor peptides P281–309 or ACP. The cells were bathed in the solution containing Phen (100 µm) for at least 10 min before the formation of whole cell configuration. The currents recorded immediately after membrane rupture with minimal dialysis were considered the base-line data, and the data acquired 15 min after membrane rupture with complete dialysis were taken as the effects of CaMKII inhibition by ACP or P281–309 (Fig. 5). In addition, addition of EGTA (10 mm) to the pipette solution also substantially weakened the ability of Phen to suppress IK1(data not shown). The effects of KN-93 on Phen-induced decrease inIK1 were also assessed in myocytes pretreated with the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium. Similar to KN-93, calmidazolium converted the depressed IK1 to the base-line amplitude (Fig. 5B). External application of KN-93 (3 µm) when the steady-state effect of calmidazolium had been achieved failed to cause further changes onIK1 (data not shown).Figure 5Roles ofCaMKIIin α1AR modulation ofIK1. For experiments involving KN-93 or calmidazolium, the currents were measured in control conditions, 10 min after Phen (100 µm), and 15 min after co-administration of Phen and KN-93 (3 µm) or KN-92 (10 µm) or calmidazolium (50 µm). For experiments involving inhibitor peptides on IK1, the cells were superfused with the solution containing Phen (100 µm) throughout the experiments. The currents recorded right after patch formation and 15 min after rupture were taken as base-line and inhibitor peptide data, respectively. As a negative control, experiments were also conducted in the absence of Phen. The averaged values were the data obtained at a potential of −120 mV.

To test this point, we performed analyses for PKC and CaMKII activities. Fig. 6shows the results from PKC activity assay. A pronounced increase in PKC activity was seen in HEK293 cells stably transfected with α1aARs and pretreated with Phen, relative to nontransfected and untreated cells. Only a minor increase in PKC activation was observed in α1dAR-transfected cells, even with elevated Phen concentration to 100 µm. Coincidentally, canine ventricular myocytes pretreated with 10 µm (or higher) Phen also resulted in a significant increase in PKC activity relative to untreated cells. The antibody to the autophosphorylation site Thr286 of CaMKII recognized a band of 51 kDa in both HEK and a band of 48 kDa in canine ventricular cells, which is in agreement with the size of CaMKII reported by other laboratories (29Don Koh S. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Kenyon J.L. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Roeper J. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tessier S. Karczewski P. Krause E.-G. Pansard Y. Acar C. Lang-Lazdunski M. Mercadier J.-J. Hatem S.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, a more prominent band was seen only in α1dAR-transfected cells pretreated with 100 µm Phen. There are slight increases in the phosphorylated CaMKII in α1aAR-transfected cells or in α1dAR-transfected cells treated with 10 µmPhen. For canine ventricular myocytes, only samples from cells pretreated with 100 µm Phen showed an enhanced phosphorylation of CaMKII, and the immunoreactive band was nearly invisible in control and 10 µm Phen-treated cells. We have shown in this study that α1AR stimulation by phenylephrine produces important suppression ofIto and IK1 in dog ventricular myocytes. The effects on Ito andIK1 can be separated by the strength of α1AR stimulation (Phen concentrations), and the use of subtype-selective antagonists suggests a possibility of differential modulation of Ito and IK1by activation of different subtypes of α1ARs: α1AAR for Ito and α1DAR for IK1. Moreover, our data also suggest that the differential modulation ofIto and IK1 by α1ARs is mediated by different signaling systems:Ito primarily by PKC andIK1 mainly by CaMKII. Our data therefore provide evidence that different subtypes of α1ARs modulate different cardiac K+ currents via different signal transduction mechanisms. Our results also represent, to our knowledge, the first to define the functional role of α1DARs in modulating cardiac ion channels and the role of CaMKII in modulating inward rectifier K+ current. With the development of pharmacological tools and molecular cloning, it is now possible to study α1AR subtypes separately. The α1AARs show a high affinity to (+)niguldipine that has been demonstrated to be 100∼4000-fold more selective toward α1AAR over the other two subtypes (4Hieble J.P. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Prog. Drug Res. 1996; 47: 81-129PubMed Google Scholar, 32Han C. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 531-538PubMed Google Scholar). The α1BARs are readily and irreversibly inactivated by the alkylating agent CEC (4Hieble J.P. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Prog. Drug Res. 1996; 47: 81-129PubMed Google Scholar, 33Han C. Abel P.W. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 505-510PubMed Google Scholar). BMY-7378 distinguishes α1DAR from the other two subtypes (α1A and α1B) with a binding affinity at least 2 orders of magnitude higher for the former over the latter (4Hieble J.P. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Prog. Drug Res. 1996; 47: 81-129PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang H.T. Endoh M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Goetz A.S. King H.K. Ward S.D.C. True T.A. Rimele T.J. Saussy Jr., D.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 272: R5-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We show here that neither Nig nor CEC produced any appreciable influences on the inhibitory effects of Phen on IK1. In sharp contrast, BMY-7378, at a concentration of as low as 1 nm, readily reversed Phen actions on IK1. These data strongly suggest that α1DARs mediate α1AR/Phen modulation of IK1 in canine ventricular myocytes. α1AR modulation ofIK1 in rabbit (34Braun A.P. Fedida D. Giles W.R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and human (9Sato R. Koumi S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) atria has also been previously studied, and consistent with the present study α1AR stimulation was found to decrease atrialIK1. However, the involvement of particular subtypes of α1ARs was not investigated in these studies. Although our study probably is the first to establish the functions of α1DARs in the heart, its roles may not be restricted to the modulation of IK1. The present study appears to favor the notion that modulation ofIto in canine ventricular cells by α1AR stimulation is primarily mediated by a subclass of α1ARs, that is, α1AARs. A similar decrease in Ito upon α1AR stimulation was also previously documented in other species such as rabbits (36Braun A.P. Fedida D. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. 1990; 431: 689-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and rats (37Apkon M. Nerbonne J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8756-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 38Van Wagoner D.R. Kirian M. Lamorgese M. Am. J. Phsyiol. 1996; 271: H937-H946PubMed Google Scholar), but no information regarding involvement of particular subtypes of α1ARs was provided. In another study reported by Wang et al. (39Wang X.L. Wettwer E. Gross G. Ravens U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar) in rat ventricular cells, phenylephrine at 30 µm was shown to reduce peakIto, and both of the α1AAR-selective antagonists 5-methylurapidil and (+)niguldipine (0.1 µm each) and the irreversible α1BAR-subtype antagonist CEC (100 µm) blocked the phenylephrine effect on Ito. They concluded that stimulation of both α1AR subtypes contributes to the phenylephrine-induced reduction inIto of rat myocytes. However, it should be noted that CEC concentration used in this study was 100 µm, high enough to inactivate subtypes (e.g. α1Aand α1D) other than α1BARs. For the signal transduction mechanisms underlying α1AR modulation of Ito, studies on cloned channels that generate Ito-like K+ currents in heterologous expression systems demonstrated that activation of PKC reduces Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (40Nakamura T.Y. Coetzee W.A. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Artman M. Rudy B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1775-H1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result is in good agreement with ours, which points to an important role of PKC activation mediated by α1AR stimulation in regulatingIto, particularly when considering that Kv4.3 is the major molecular component of native Ito in dogs (41Dixon J. Shi W. Wang H. McDinald C., Yu, H. Wymore R. Cohen I. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The results from previous studies on PKC modulation of inward rectifier K+ channels (Kir) have been controversial. For the cloned Kirs, the study from Henry et al. (42Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) convincingly demonstrated that PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or phorbol 12,13-dibytyrate significantly inhibited Kir2.3 but did not alter Kir1.1 and Kir2.1. In light of our previous finding that Kir2.1 is the most abundantly expressed Kir subunit in human hearts (22Wang Z. Yue L. White M. Pelletier G. Nattel S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), our present data are in line with the results from the study by Henry et al. Yet Fakler et al. (43Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1413-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that stimulation of PKC by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate suppressed Kir2.1. It is unclear whether this is due to the use of different PKC activators by the two laboratories. Similarly, in native cells no consistent data have been reported. In the study performed by Braun et al.(34Braun A.P. Fedida D. Giles W.R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) it was shown that α1AR inhibition ofIK1 in rabbit atrial cells did not depend on PKC activation, and direct PKC activation or inhibition did not affectIK1 either. In contrast, one study conducted in human atrial myocytes suggested that α1AR inhibition ofIK1 is mediated by PKC activation (9Sato R. Koumi S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that different species might have distinct molecular compositions ofIK1 because to date no less than 10 different Kir cDNAs have been cloned (44Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence from the present study suggest that suppression of IK1 by α1AR stimulation in canine ventricular myocytes is mediated by CaMKII activation. To date, no other studies have published regarding CaMKII modulation of IK1. However, CaMKII modulation ofIto or the cloned channels expressingIto-like currents has been documented in several studies. Consistent in all these studies is the reduction of current amplitude. In the present study, we show that Phen at a concentration of 10 µm mainly activates PKC pathway, as indicated by inhibitor experiments, PKC assay, and CaMKII immunoblotting analysis. We therefore speculate that Ito modulation by 10 µm Phen is mainly mediated by PKC phosphorylation, whereas Ito reduction by 100 µmPhen might be the consequence of combined PKC and CaMKII activation. This is supported by our data showing that inhibition of CaMKII partially reversed Ito reduction caused by Phen at 100 µm but not at 10 µm. In addition, 100 µm Phen slightly slowed the inactivation kinetics of canine Ito (Fig. 1A), which was not seen with 10 µm Phen. The α1AAR is generally far more efficient in stimulating PKC activation than the α1DAR (19Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For example, Taguchiet al. (17Taguchi K. Yang M. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Naunyn Schmiedbergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that Phen significantly stimulated PKC in rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing α1AARs and α1BARs but not α1DARs. Our data are consistent with this notion. Intriguingly, a study performed in a vascular smooth muscle cell line (AC01) (18Ohmi K. Shinoura H. Nakayama Y. Goda N. Tsujimoto G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the α1DARs, although representing the minor population compared with the α1BARs in this cell, are the main mediators of phosphoinositide/Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, based on their experimental data from isolated hepatocytes, Buttaet al. (45Butta N. Martin-Requero A. Urcelay E. Parrilla R. Ayuso M.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1797-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) concluded that there are at least two major α1AR signaling pathways; one is PKC-dependent and independent of variations in free cytosolic Ca2+, and the other one is dependent on variations in free cytosolic Ca2+ but is PKC-independent. Actually, the ability of α1AR to activate CaMK has been previously realized. The study reported by Guo et al. (46) found that CaMK contributed to the α1AR-mediated decrease in Kv1.5 K+ channel expression in cultured newborn rat ventricular cells. However, it was not characterized which subtype of α1ARs is responsible for the effect in these studies. Our data suggest that α1AARs are mainly associated with PKC activation, whereas α1DARs are primarily coupled to CaMKII activation. Yet it should be noted that our data do not allow us to reach a conclusion on how α1AARs are coupled to PKC and how α1DARs are coupled to CaMKII. More detailed studies are necessary for verifying this notion and for delineating the subtype-specific signaling coupling mechanisms. We thank XiaoFan Yang for excellent technical support."

In the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae and several other bacteria, the pentapeptide chain is composed of l-alanine, d-isoglutamine,l-lysine, d-alanine, d-alanine, with the latter representing the C-terminal residue. The second stage of synthesis occurs in the plasma membrane where the peptidoglycan building block is linked to a bactoprenol residue and may undergo a “maturation process” by several as yet not well understood enzymatic reactions. These may include addition of short peptides to the lysine epsilon amino group in some or all of the stem peptides; and amidation of the second stem peptide residue, usually a glutamate, to glutamine. After addition of an N-acetyl glucosamine residue, the bactoprenol-linked and structurally completed disaccharide pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursor is transferred to the outer side of the plasma membrane for presentation to proteins (monofunctional transglycosylases, penicillin binding proteins) that take part in the assembly of the macromolecular peptidoglycan. The pneumococcal peptidoglycan is composed of both linear and branched muropeptides, the latter of which carry short dipeptide branches. The chemical nature of the branched peptides, seryl “alanine or alanyl” alanine, i.e. the type of muropeptide they are attached to and the proportion of muropeptides carrying branches vary from strain to strain (1Garcia-Bustos J. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5415-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Severin A. Tomasz A. J.

The identification of the murMN operon opened up new experimental approaches for the study of the mechanism of synthesis and physiological role of branched peptides. Most interestingly, inactivation of the murMN was shown to cause not only the production of cell wall peptidoglycan composed exclusively of linear muropeptides but also a complete loss of the resistant phenotype in penicillin-resistant strains (4Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several penicillin-resistant isolates were shown to carry murM genes with unique polymorphic regions, which seem to correlate with the preponderance of seryl-alanine or alanyl-alanine branches in the peptidoglycan (5Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6798-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Selective inactivation of murM andmurN showed that the protein products of these genes act in sequence: murM being involved with the addition of the first amino acid (serine or alanine) and murN involved with the addition of second amino acid of the bridge (alanine) (6Filipe S.R.

All routine DNA manipulations were performed using standard methods (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar, 12Sambrook J. Fritsch I. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from S. pneumoniae was isolated as described previously (13Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8945) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using the Wizard Plus Minipreps or Midipreps DNA purification system (Promega), and PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA sequencing was done at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing method and either the 3700 DNA analyzer for capillary electrophoresis or the ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer for slab-gel electrophoresis. Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences were analyzed using DNASTAR software. To isolate a mutant of the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6 lacking murMgene, we transformed Pen6 with a PCR fragment that included the 2-kb fragment from pJDC9, containing the erm marker, flanked by the regions upstream and downstream of murM. To obtain this PCR fragment the upstream and downstream segments ofmurM were amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain Pen6 by PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). First, the 0.46-kb PCR fragment containing the upstream region of murMwas amplified with primers ZOO45EC (5′-AGCGAATTCGGTTTTGACTACTACACGGC-3′) and ZOO46BM (5′-ATAGGATCCTTTCCCAGTAGTACCACTCG-3′), digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into plasmid pGEM-3Z generating plasmid pZ009. The EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined in the primers. Next theHindIII/PstI-digested 0.54-kb PCR fragment containing the downstream region of murM was amplified with primers ZOO47PS (5′-GCGCTGCAGAGTCGGCAGCGACTCATAGAAT-3′) and ZOO2BM (5′-TATGGATCCAGTCTCGCGCTTCTGCTTTTC-3′), and was cloned into pZ009 yielding pZ0010. The underlined sequence indicates thePstI restriction site. Finally the 2-kbBamHI/ClaI fragment from pJDC9 containing theerm marker was cloned into theBamHI/AccI-digested plasmid pZOO10 generating pZ0011. Plasmid pZ0011 contains the erm marker flanked by the upstream and downstream regions of murM. The transforming DNA used to prepare the murM null mutant of strain Pen6 was a PCR fragment of plasmid pZOO11 amplified with primers ZOO30 (5′-ATATTCTCTACGTTCAGAGG-3′) and ZOO45EC (5′-AGCGAATTCGGTTTTGACTACTACACGGC-3′). The conditions used for the PCR reactions were: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; and one final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. This PCR program was used for all amplifications except the extension time at 72 °C, which was different depending on the size of the PCR fragment to be amplified. The deletion of murM in the erythromycin-resistant Pen6ΔmurM mutant was confirmed by PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing. Transformation of S. pneumoniae R36A strain was carried out similarly to the already described procedure (14Pozzi G. Masala L. Iannelli F. Manganelli R. Havarstein L.S. Piccoli L. Simon D. Morrison D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6087-6090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the concentration of peptide pheromone was 500 ng/ml and the transforming reaction was held at 37 °C for 4 h before plating in selective plates of TSA+3% (v/v) sheep blood and 1 µg/ml tetracycline. The differentmurM alleles cloned in pLS578 and transformed into R36A strain were specifically amplified with primers that hybridize in the plasmid: TETDPLS (5′-CCTATGGAAGTTGATCAGTC-3′) and CATR (5′-CATGRTAACCATCACAWACAG-3′). Several murM constructs were prepared, each in the S. pneumoniae plasmid pLS578, a plasmid with a strong promoter that can replicate in S. pneumoniae (10Lacks S.A. Ayalew S. de la Campa A.G. Greenberg B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ThreeS. pneumoniae strains were used as sources ofmurM alleles: the penicillin-susceptible laboratory strain R36A, the penicillin-resistant strain DE1 producing alanine-rich branches in the cell wall, and the penicillin-resistant strain KY17 producing serine-rich branches. The first one of such plasmid constructs carried the murMallele from strain R36A. The murM gene was amplified as a PCR fragment from the chromosomal DNA using primers ZOO48HI (5′-CCCAAGCTTAAAATACTGGAGGAAAGAGAG-3′) and ZOO49NC (5′-CATGCCATGGGCCATATACTTACTTTCTATG-3′) with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) (theHindIII and NcoI restriction sites are underlined and the stop codon is double-underlined) and was cloned into the 4.5-kbHindIII/NcoI-digested fragment of pLS578, yielding plasmid pM1. The second and third plasmids were constructed by the same procedure using chromosomal DNA either from penicillin-resistant strain DE1 (plasmid pM2) or from the penicillin-resistant strain of KY17 (plasmid pM3). Another set of plasmids was constructed in such a way that segments of the 406-amino acid long MurM would be derived from various murM alleles carried by the penicillin-susceptible strain R36A or the penicillin-resistant strains DE1 or KY17. The first one of these plasmids, pM9, contained a cloned chimeric MurM that was composed of residues 1–240 with equal sequence to the MurM of the penicillin-susceptible strain R36A fused the remaining 166 amino acids residues of the penicillin-resistant strain DE1. Plasmid pM9 was constructed in several steps. A PCR fragment encoding for the C terminus 166 amino acid residues (from 241 to 406) of strain DE1 was amplified with the primers MMUT4 (5′-CCCAAGCTTGCTCTAGATGTTTCTAAGCGTTTAAG-5′, where the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites are underlined) and ZOO49NC (see above) from chromosomal DNA and cloned into the HindIII/NcoI-digested E. coliplasmid pSF22 (pGEM-3Z carrying a promoterless murN and anNcoI restriction site (see Table I below), yielding plasmid pSF24. Next, the full murM gene was reconstructed by cloning in this plasmid (digested with HindIII and XbaI) the PCR product obtained from the chromosomal DNA of strain R36A with the primers ZOO48HI (see above) and MMUT3 (5′-GCATCTAGAGTTGCCAAGGTGATGTAG-3′, where theXbaI restriction site is underlined), generating a plasmid named pSF25. Finally, the chimeric murM gene was transferred from pSF25 to the pneumococcal plasmid pLS578 by the following operations. The chimeric mutant murM was amplified from plasmid pSF25 using primers ZOO48HI and ZOO49NC (see above) and cloned into the HindIII/NcoI-digested pLS578 plasmid. This pneumococcal plasmid, carrying the murM chimera mutant gene from the penicillin-resistant strain R36A and DE1 was named pM9. The second chimeric plasmid pM10 included a PCR fragment that encoded for the 240 amino acid residues from the N terminus of the penicillin-resistant strain KY17 (from 1 to 240) fused with the remaining 166 amino acid residues from another penicillin-resistant strain DE1 (from 241 to 406). Plasmid pM10 was constructed in a way similar to that used in the construction of pM9. A PCR fragment encoding for the 240 amino acid residues from the position 1–240 was amplified with the primers ZOO48HI and MMUT3 (see above) from the KY17 chromosomal DNA and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI-digested pSF24 plasmid, generating the plasmid pSF26. Procedures similar to the ones used in the construction of pM9 were employed for the transfer of themurM chimera from the E. coli plasmid pSF26 to the pneumococcal plasmid pLS578 generating the plasmid pM10. An additional set of plasmids carrying chimeric murM mutants were constructed to more precisely define the region controlling the specificity of the reaction catalyzed by the MurM protein. Plasmid pM11 carried a murM allele that was identical to that from strain KY17 (the MurM of which mainly adds serine residues to the muropeptide cross-bridges) except for the position between residues 244 and 298, which was replaced by the corresponding sequence from themurM of strain DE1 (the MurM of which mainly adds alanine residues to the muropeptide cross-bridges). Plasmid pM11 was constructed in several steps. A PCR fragment comprising the sequence that encodes for the residues from position 300 to the end of the MurM protein (the 106 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of strain KY17 was amplified with primers ZOO49NC (see above) and MMUT18 (5′-CGCAAGCTTCTCGAGTTTGGTACTACCTCTGTCAATC-3′ from plasmid pSF27, where the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites are underlined). This PCR fragment was cloned into the HindIII/NcoI-digested plasmid pSF22, yielding plasmid pSF28. Next, the full gene was reconstructed by cloning in pSF28 (digested with HindIII and XhoI) the PCR product that encoded the amino acid residues from position 1 to 300, obtained with the primers ZOO48HI (see above) and MMUT19 (5′-TTCCTCGAGACTCAAAGTAGCCGCTAAG-3′) from pSF26 (theXhoI restriction site is underlined). The resulting plasmid, pSF29, carried a chimeric MurM protein that was equal to the KY17 MurM except between residues 244 and 298, which were the same as those found in the DE1 MurM. Finally, the chimeric murM gene was amplified from plasmid pSF29 using primers ZOO48HI and ZOO49NC (see above) and cloned into the HindIII/NcoI-digested pLS578 plasmid, yielding the plasmid pM11. An additional murM chimera mutant, pM12, was constructed in a similar way as described for pM11, but this time only the segment between residues 244 and 274 was derived from the MurM of strain DE1. As in the case of pM11, here too, the chimera mutant was initially constructed in an E. coli plasmid. The PCR product obtained from plasmid pSF27 with primers ZOO49NC and MMUT16 (5′-CGCAAGCTTCTCGAGGAATTGACTTTCCTGCAGG-3′, where theHindIII and XhoI restriction sites are underlined), was first cloned into theHindIII/NcoI-digested pSF22 plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pSF30, carried a DNA fragment that encoded the residues from 276 to the end of the protein (the last 131 residues from the C terminus) of the murM of strain KY17. The DNA fragment coding for the remaining 275 amino acids was amplified with primers ZOO48HI (see above) and MMUT17 (5′-TTCCTCGAGTAAACGTTCTTTTTCTTTTATATTTTCCTG-3′) from pSF26 and cloned to the HindIII/XhoI-digested pSF30 plasmid, yielding the plasmid pSF31. This plasmid carried a chimeric MurM protein that was equal to the KY17 MurM except for the position between residues 244 and 274, which came from the murM of strain DE1. After amplification from plasmid pSF31 with primers ZOO48HI and ZOO49NC (see above), the murM chimera was cloned into the HindIII/NcoI-digested pLS578 plasmid, yielding the plasmid pM12. Several simple variants of plasmid pM3, each carrying incomplete murM genes from strain KY17, were also constructed. In plasmid pM13, 50 residues of the C terminus of MurM were deleted by cloning into the pLS578 plasmid a PCR fragment amplified by the following pair of primers: ZOO48HI (see above) and MDC355N (5′-AATGCCATGGTTATTAGTTTTCAACACCACC-3′) that includes a NcoI restriction site (underlined) and a premature stop codon (double-underlined). In plasmid pM14, 50 residues of the N-terminal of MurM were deleted by cloning into the pLS578 plasmid a PCR fragment amplified by the following pair of primers, ZOO49NC (see above) and MDNM68 (5′-ATCAAGCTTAAGGAGGCTATAAAATGTTTTACATCCCA-3′), which includes an HindIII restriction site (underlined) and an initiation codon (double-underlined). In plasmid pM15, 10 residues were deleted from the C terminus by cloning into the pLS578 plasmid the PCR product from the KY17 chromosomal DNA using primers ZOO48HI AND MDC396F (5′-CATGCCATGGTTAGAAATCAAGAGCAAGTCTTAACAG-3′), which includes an NcoI restriction site (underlined) and a premature stop codon (double-underlined). In plasmid pM16, the segment between residues 240 and 275 was deleted. To construct this murM deletion mutant we cloned into theE. coli HindIII/XhoI-digested plasmid pSF30 (that carries a DNA fragment encoding the last 131 residues of the C-terminal from KY17 MurM) the PCR product obtained with primers ZOO48HI and MMUT3 from the KY17 chromosomal DNA. This PCR product encodes the first 240 amino acid residues from the N terminus. The resulting plasmid, pSF32, carried a murM gene that coded for a protein equal to KY17 except for the deletion between residues 240 and 275. ThemurM with the deletion was then amplified with primers ZOO48HI and ZOO49NC (see above) and cloned into the pneumococcal plasmid pLS578, yielding the plasmid pM16. The murM allele from KY17 was also mutated to test the possible importance of some amino acid residues for the specificity of the MurM-catalyzed reaction. The particular residues tested were threonine in position 260 and glutamine in position 27 of the MurM protein. In plasmid pM17 the threonine residue at position 260 of the KY17 murM was mutated to lysine, whereas in plasmids pM18 and pM19 the glutamine residues at position 27 were mutated to either glutamate (pM18) or to threonine (pM19). The following procedures were used. First, the murM gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain KY17 using primers ZOO48HI and ZOO49NC (see above) and cloned into theHindIII/NcoI site of pSF22, yielding the plasmid pSF23. Then the threonine in the position 260 of the clonedmurM was mutated to a lysine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primer PDT260K (5′-GAGCCTTGGAAGAGAAGTTTACTGAGTCGACTCGC-3′) and its reverse PRT260K, yielding the plasmid pSF33 (the mutated codon is in boldface). The glutamine residue in position 27 was also mutated by the same procedure to a glutamate with the primer PDQ27E (5′-GAATTAGCCAATGTATTAGAAAGTAGTGCTTGGGAAG-3′) and its reverse PRQ27E, and to a threonine with the primer PDQ27T (5′-GAATTAGCCAATGTATTAACCAGTAGTGCTTGGGAAG-3′) and its reverse, yielding the plasmids pSF34 and pSF35, respectively (the mutated codons are in boldface). Both mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Eventually the mutant murM genes were then transferred to the pneumococcal plasmid pLS578. Pneumococcal cell walls were prepared by a previously published method (2Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2143-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except for the process of breaking the cells that was done by shaking with acid-washed glass beads with the help of FastPrep FP120 (BIO 101 Inc.). Cell wall material (2 mg) was suspended in 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and treated with affinity-purified pneumococcal amidase (5–10 µg) at 37 °C for 12–18 h with constant stirring. The products were dried, the precipitate was washed with acetone, and the peptides were extracted with acetonitrile-isopropanol-water (25:25:50, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as already described (2Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J.

After removal of the solvents by evaporation in a SpeedVac, the peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated with a Shimadzu LC-10AVP HPLC system, as described previously (2Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The column used was a Vydac model 218TP54 (The Separations Group). Peptides were eluted with an 80-min linear gradient from 0 to 15% acetonitrile (Fisher) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) pumped at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted fractions were detected and quantified by determination of their UV absorption at 210 nm (A 210). For analysis of cytoplasmic (UDP-linked) peptidoglycan precursors of S. pneumoniae cultures were grown in C+Y medium to an A 590 nm of 0.3 at which time vancomycin was added at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml (10× MIC). The cultures were incubated for 60 min, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The UDP-linked cell wall precursors were extracted by cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. The extract containing the pool of precursors was separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with water. The precursor compounds were then applied to a 3.9- × 30-mm reversed-phase column (µBondapack C18, Waters) as previously described (17Ornelas-Soares A. de Lencastre H. de Jonge B.L. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27246-27250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the UDP-linked precursors were eluted with an 80-min linear gradient from 0 to 15% of acetonitrile (Fisher) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) pumped at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted fractions were detected and quantified by determination of their UV absorption at 254 nm. Lipid-linked cell wall precursors were prepared essentially as described by Kohlrausch and Holtje (18Kohlrausch U. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3425-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in C+Y medium to an A 590 nm of 0.3 at which time vancomycin at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml (10× MIC) was added. The cultures were incubated for one additional generation period, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The lipid-linked precursors were extracted with ice-cold n-butanol/6 m pyridinium acetate (pH 4) (4:1) by shaking with glass beads with the help of FastPrep FP120 (BIO 101 Inc.). The organic phase was collected, washed twice with 1 volume of water, and dried in a SpeedVac. The lipid precursors in the organic extraction phase were hydrolyzed with 0.1 m HCl for 15 min in a boi"
https://openalex.org/W2058712934,"DAPP-1 (dual-adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides-1) is a broadly distributed pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src homology 2 domain containing protein that can bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and can be phosphorylated on tyrosine 139 and internalised in response to activation of type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). Tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 appears important for appropriate intracellular targeting and creates a potential binding site for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. In endothelial cells overexpressing wild-type platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFβ) receptors, which express Bmx and Src as their major Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) family and Src family tyrosine kinases, respectively, PDGF can stimulate PI3K-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1. Transient overexpression of Src most effectively, compared with Bmx and Syk, augments basal and PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative Src, but not dominant-negative Bmx, inhibits PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of DAPP-1. Cells expressing mutant PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptors (which fail to bind and activate Src-type kinases) fail to tyrosine phosphorylate DAPP-1 in response to PDGF. We show that in DT40 chicken B cell lines, antibody stimulation leads to PI3K-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 that is lost in Lyn- or Syk-deficient cell lines but not Btk-deficient cell lines. PI3K-dependent activation of PKB is only lost in Syk-deficient lines. Finally, in vitro we find lipid-modified Src to be the most effective DAPP-1 tyrosine kinase (versus Syk, Lyn, Btk, and Bmx); phosphorylation of DAPP-1 but not Src autophosphorylation is stimulated ∼10-fold by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (IC50 = 150 nm) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate but not by their nonbiological diastereoisomers and depends on PH domain mediated binding of DAPP-1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing membranes. We conclude that Src family kinases are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 in vivo and that PI3K regulation is at the level of PH domain-mediated translocation of DAPP-1 to PI3K products in the membrane.

PH domains form a large and diverse family that are capable of binding a variety of ligands; a subfamily that can be recognized by their possession of characteristically distributed basic residues can bind to the most polar 3-phosphorylated lipids: phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (5Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

DAPP-1 translocation is dependent on its PH domain, and the PH domain alone will translocate. Interestingly, DAPP-1 also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated on residue Tyr139 in a PI3K- and translocation-dependent manner (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z.-Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr.

This phosphorylation can be only partially mimicked by membrane targeting of DAPP-1, with a dual myristoylation/palmitoylation consensus from the Src-type kinase Yes, or by expression of constitutively active type I PI3Ks that also cause membrane translocation of DAPP-1 (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z.-Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr.

The implication of these results is that other events, possibly, for example, PI3K-independent activation of the relevant tyrosine kinase, are required to deliver a full tyrosine phosphorylation response. Thus, although PI3K-dependent translocation is essential for this event, it is only sufficient to drive partial tyrosine phosphorylation. The Src family selective protein kinase inhibitor PP2 and transient overexpression of Src-type kinases have been used to implicate Src-type kinases in phosphorylation of Tyr139 in vivo (13Dowler S. Montalvo L. Cantrell D. Morrice N. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although, importantly, the identity of the Src family member(s) responsible for this response in any particular receptor-stimulated context remains to be defined. Subsequent to the translocation of DAPP-1 to the plasma membrane, it becomes internalized via a dynamin-dependent mechanism, like that used to internalize cell surface receptors and is delivered to the endosomal membrane system (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z.-Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear how DAPP-1 exits the endosomal system. Internalization is not absolutely dependent on phosphorylation of Tyr139; however, in endothelial cells expressing PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptors, which fail to activate Src-type kinases, PDGF fails to direct normal targeting of DAPP-1 and DAPP-1-containing endosomes are fewer and remain nearer to their site of formation at the cell surface (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z.-Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The specific failure in Src signaling that underlies this event is not clear; however, the fact that DAPP-1 (Y139F) constructs display a similar pattern of behavior to wild-type DAPP-1 in PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptor-expressing endothelial cells suggests this is a specific result of failing to phosphorylate DAPP-1 rather than a general deficiency in Src signaling. The clear potential importance of a tyrosine phosphate residue on DAPP-1 for forming SH2 domain-mediated interactions with other molecules and the increasing appreciation of the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in receptor endocytosis and vesicle targeting lead us to attempt to define the cellular kinases responsible for phosphorylation of tyrosine 139 in DAPP-1 in endothelial and B cell lines. DAPP-1 constructs were inserted into pCMV3 vectors for mammalian expression, pGEX 4Ti vectors for bacterial expression, and pAcOG1 vectors for SF9 expression, as described previously (14Stephens L.R.

Baculoviruses encoding GST-Lyn, GST-Syk, and GST-Btk were generously provided by Dr. Chan (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Saint Louis, MO). Hs-cSrc was inserted into pCMV3 without NH2 tagging; Hs-cSrc and Hs-Lyn were inserted into pAcOG1 without NH2-terminal tagging but incorporating a COOH-terminal EE tag (EEFMPME) via a polymerase chain reaction primer; Hs-cSrc was also inserted into pAcOG1 incorporating an NH2-terminal EE tag that prevents correct post-translational lipid modification. Bmx was obtained from Dr. Ekman (Heartman Institute, Helsinki, Finland) and inserted into pCMV3 in frame with a NH2-terminal EE tag. Site-directed mutants of Bmx and Src were created by standard polymerase chain reaction-based procedures; all constructs were sequenced prior to use. GST-DAPP-1 and its R184A, R61M, and Y139F point mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli BL-21 s, purified via their GST tags, cleaved with thrombin while still bound to the glutathione beads or eluted with glutathione, concentrated, and buffer exchanged by gel filtration into 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide by standard procedures. GST-Lyn, GST-Syk, and GST-Btk were purified from Sf9 cells as described above except 1 mm orthovanadate was included in all the buffers. EE-DAPP-1 and (EE, NH2-terminal)-Src were purified from Sf9 cells and EE-Bmx from transiently transfected Cos-7 cells utilizing their EE tags as described previously (14Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A.

(EE, COOH-terminal)-Src and -Lyn were purified via a Triton X-114 phase partition procedure (15Gutierrez L. Magee A. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), ensuring they were post-translationally lipid-modified (this was associated with a 4–5-kDa increase in apparent size on SDS-PAGE) and subsequent EE purification into 1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% sodium azide, and 1 mm orthovanadate. PAE cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6% CO2. We obtained PAE cells expressing various PDGFβ receptor (PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) or (Y1021F)) constructs from Lars Rönnstrand (Ludwig Institute, Uppsala, Sweden); in contrast to some published work (16Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström H. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the former construct in these cells has full tyrosine kinase activity. Transfections were by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarads, 0.4-cm cuvettes; Bio-Rad) as described previously (14Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cook F.T. Coadwell J.

Each cuvette contained 1 × 107 cells in 0.5 ml. At the end of the transfection, one cuvette was split onto three 9-cm dishes. After 6 h the media were aspirated to remove any detached and/or dead cells and replaced with fresh media. After a further 6 h the medium was removed and replaced with serum-free Ham's F-12 containing 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1 unit ml−1 penicillin and 0.1 mg ml−1 streptomycin, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH7.3, 37 °C; diluted from an isotonic, sterile 0.19 mHEPES/NaOH stock). After 8.5–9 h the cells were stimulated with PDGF (B-B), typically for 5 min. 10 ng ml−1 PDGF gave a maximal DAPP-1 phosphorylation response, 0.8 ng ml−1 gave about 15% of a maximal response (data not shown). The media were rapidly decanted, replaced with 25 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8), decanted, and drained, and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer was added to the dish containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.4% sodium cholate, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA/NaOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm EGTA/NaOH (pH 7.5), 4 mm orthovanadate (pH 10.0, clear solution), 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and aprotinin. The cells were immediately scraped and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and then the supernatants were sampled for whole cell lysates, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads covalently cross-linked to anti-EE monoclonal (typically 10 μl of packed beads carrying 50 μg of antibody). After 75 min of mixing at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times in cold lysis buffer then one time with lysis buffer except with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and no sodium cholate and eluted in 40 μl of this buffer containing 0.2 mg ml−1 EE-eluting peptide (14Stephens L.R.

The eluted proteins were mixed with SDS sample buffer as processed for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, mouse, monoclonal), anti-DAPP-1 (Babraham Technix, sheep polyclonal), anti-Src (Santa Cruz, rabbit polyclonal), and anti-Bmx (Transduction Laboratories, mouse monoclonal) by standard procedures using ECL or ECL Plus detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DT40 chicken B cell lines were cultured daily as described (17Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and transfected by electroporation essentially as described for PAE cells except 0.5 ml of 5 × 107 cells ml−1 with 40 μg of pCMV3EE DAPP-1 were used per electroporation at 300 V, 960 microfarads. After transfection, the cells recovered in full growth medium for 16 h (0.5 × 106 ml−1), and then they were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 1500 rpm bench-top centrifuge) and resuspended in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.3, as above) at 0.5 × 106 ml−1. After 8 h of serum starvation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in the starvation medium at 1 × 107 ml−1; 1-ml aliquots were warmed to 37 °C in 2-ml vials and stimulated with antibody (final concentration, 10 μg ml−1; mouse anti-chicken IgM, Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc). After 5 min the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5 s in a microcentrifuge), the medium was aspirated, and the pellet was solubilized into lysis buffer (as for PAE cells). The samples were then processed as described above. The phosphorylation status of serine 473 in PKB in the whole cell lysates was determined according to the supplier's guidelines (Cell Signaling Technology). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in Sf9 cells were quantitated essentially as described previously (18Harak Yonezawak K. Sakane H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamwure T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R.

Protein kinase assays were conducted in vitro as follows. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin were dried down together from chloroform under vacuum. Phosphoinositides (prepared in their dipalmitoyl form as described previously (19Painter G.F. Grove S.J.A. Gilbert I.H. Holmes A.B. Raithby P.R. Hill M.L. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1999; 1: 923-935Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) were added in water, and the mixture bath was sonicated. Once dispersed the lipids were dried under vacuum before being bath sonicated into assay buffer (0.2 m KCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4, 20 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% sodium azide) to yield a 5× stock for addition to the assays (final 1× concentrations of the lipids in the assays of 125 μm, 125 μm, 60 μm, 40 μm, 125 μg/ml, and 20 μm, respectively). 2 μl of diluted liposomes were mixed with 2 μl of protein kinase stock (in above assay buffer supplemented with 1 mg ml−1 fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate (and peptides where relevant) and then 1 μl of assay buffer supplemented with 12 mm MgCl2, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the relevant DAPP-1 construct. The assays were terminated after 3 min at 18 °C by the addition of SDS sample buffer. After heating and SDS-PAGE, the gels were Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. We have utilized DT40 chicken B cell lines that express only three of the classical, nonreceptor, ligand-regulated tyrosine kinases: Lyn, Btk, and Syk. Clonal cell lines in which each of these kinases have been deleted genetically have been isolated (17Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T.

We have shown that antibody stimulation of wild-type DT40 cells leads to translocation and internalization of DAPP-1 (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L.

Fig.1 shows that in response to antibody stimulation, transiently expressed EE-DAPP-1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated, and PKB becomes phosphorylated on serine 473 in parallel. Both antibody-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB and DAPP-1 were inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (data not shown). This antibody-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 was lost in B cell lines that lacked Syk and Lyn, whereas antibody-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 473 in PKB was only lost in Syk-deficient cells (Fig. 1). To compare the ability of Syk, Lyn, and Btk to directly phosphorylate DAPP-1 in vivo, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding GST fusions of one of the three kinases and/or EE-DAPP-1 in the presence or absence of PI3K components and Gβγ subunits that stimulate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation in Sf9 cells (data not shown). After 1.5 days of infection the cells were lysed, and relative expression of DAPP-1 and the three kinases and the extents of tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 were determined (Fig. 2). Lyn kinase tyrosine phosphorylated DAPP-1 approximately six times more effectively than similarly expressed Syk kinase. Elevation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels significantly stimulated Btk and Lyn but not Syk-mediated phosphorylation of DAPP-1 by relatively small extents. In the context of other work showing, firstly, that PI3K activity is sufficient and necessary for receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 473 in PKB (21Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B.

Sf9 cells in 5-cm dishes were infected with baculovirus encoding EE-DAPP-1 (0.25% v/v of high titer stock); after 20 h plates were further infected with baculoviruses encoding GST-Syk, GST-Lyn, or GST-Btk (0.1% (v/v) high titer stocks) with or without a combination of baculovirus for (hexa-histidine)-p110γ, EE-p101, Gγ2, GEEβ1 (0.25% v/v high titer stocks for each component) (together referred to as PI3K + Gβγ). After a further 1.5 days, the cells were serum-starved for 3 h then lysed, and expression of kinases (as percentages of GST-Btk in the absence of PI3K + Gβγ) and DAPP-1 (as percentages of DAPP-1 in no kinase controls; see below) and tyrosine phosphorylation of kinases and DAPP-1 were determined (by immunoblotting or, to quantitate kinase expression, Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels of GST pull-downs). The data shown are from one experiment that is typical of three similar experiments and are presented as the means ± S.D.

We have demonstrated that PAE cells expressing these receptors show substantially altered PDGF-induced DAPP-1 accumulation in the endosome compartment (12Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Rönnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z.-Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr.

We have assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 in response to PDGF in clonal cell lines expressing similar numbers of wild-type PDGFβ receptors, PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptors, and PDGFβ (Y1021F) receptors (Y1021 is the phospholipase Cγ-binding site; Fig.3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 was reduced to less than 5% of control in the PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptor-expressing cell line. This result suggests that the substantial reduction in DAPP-1-endosome targeting we have observed in PDGFβ (Y579F/Y581F) receptor-expressing cells could be due to the fact DAPP-1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated and also that a Src family kinase-dependent pathway controls phosphorylation of DAPP-1. The PAE cells we have used to demonstrate translocation and internalization of DAPP-1 do not express detectable Lyn, Yes, Fyn, Btk, or Syk kinases; rather they express Src and Bmx (a more broadly expressed Btk family kinase; data not shown). This means the Src family kinase that binds to the PDGFβ receptor in PAE cells is probably Src. We transiently expressed Src, Syk, and Bmx kinases in endothelial cells expressing the wild-type PDGFβ receptor. We found co-expression of Src but not Bmx or Syk with DAPP-1 dramatically inhibited our ability to recover DAPP-1 from cell lysates. This occurred even when cells were lysed into solutions containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium cholate, and 0.1% SDS or hot SDS sample buffer, and we assume that this reflects a reduction in DAPP-1 expression (data not shown). To allow us to determine whether we could compare the tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 in cells with substantially different levels of DAPP-1, we transfected PAE cells with different amounts of DAPP-1 and estimated their extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF by immunoblotting. We found that the amount of phosphotyrosine on DAPP-1 was apparently a linear function of the amount of DAPP-1 expressed even when less than 25%, as estimated by band shift, of the total DAPP-1 was being phosphorylated (data not shown). This observation enabled us to compare the relative phosphorylation of"
https://openalex.org/W2170585870,"ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is a key regulatory enzyme of bacterial glycogen and plant starch synthesis as it controls carbon flux via its allosteric regulatory behavior. Unlike the bacterial enzyme that is composed of a single subunit type, the plant AGPase is a heterotetrameric enzyme (α2β2) with distinct roles for each subunit type. The large subunit (LS) is involved mainly in allosteric regulation through its interaction with the catalytic small subunit (SS). The LS modulates the catalytic activity of the SS by increasing the allosteric regulatory response of the hetero-oligomeric enzyme. To identify regions of the LS involved in binding of effector molecules, a reverse genetics approach was employed. A potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) AGPase LS down-regulatory mutant (E38A) was subjected to random mutagenesis using error-prone polymerase chain reaction and screened for the capacity to form an enzyme capable of restoring glycogen production in glgC−Escherichia coli. Dominant mutations were identified by their capacity to restore glycogen production when the LS containing only the second site mutations was co-expressed with the wild-type SS. Sequence analysis showed that most of the mutations were decidedly nonrandom and were clustered at conserved N- and C-terminal regions. Kinetic analysis of the dominant mutant enzymes indicated that theKm values for cofactor and substrates were comparable with the wild-type AGPase, whereas the affinities for activator and inhibitor were altered appreciably. These AGPase variants displayed increased resistance to Pi inhibition and/or greater sensitivity toward 3-phosphoglyceric acid activation. Further studies of Lys-197, Pro-261, and Lys-420, residues conserved in AGPase sequences, by site-directed mutagenesis suggested that the effectors 3-phosphoglyceric acid and Pi interact at two closely located binding sites. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is a key regulatory enzyme of bacterial glycogen and plant starch synthesis as it controls carbon flux via its allosteric regulatory behavior. Unlike the bacterial enzyme that is composed of a single subunit type, the plant AGPase is a heterotetrameric enzyme (α2β2) with distinct roles for each subunit type. The large subunit (LS) is involved mainly in allosteric regulation through its interaction with the catalytic small subunit (SS). The LS modulates the catalytic activity of the SS by increasing the allosteric regulatory response of the hetero-oligomeric enzyme. To identify regions of the LS involved in binding of effector molecules, a reverse genetics approach was employed. A potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) AGPase LS down-regulatory mutant (E38A) was subjected to random mutagenesis using error-prone polymerase chain reaction and screened for the capacity to form an enzyme capable of restoring glycogen production in glgC−Escherichia coli. Dominant mutations were identified by their capacity to restore glycogen production when the LS containing only the second site mutations was co-expressed with the wild-type SS. Sequence analysis showed that most of the mutations were decidedly nonrandom and were clustered at conserved N- and C-terminal regions. Kinetic analysis of the dominant mutant enzymes indicated that theKm values for cofactor and substrates were comparable with the wild-type AGPase, whereas the affinities for activator and inhibitor were altered appreciably. These AGPase variants displayed increased resistance to Pi inhibition and/or greater sensitivity toward 3-phosphoglyceric acid activation. Further studies of Lys-197, Pro-261, and Lys-420, residues conserved in AGPase sequences, by site-directed mutagenesis suggested that the effectors 3-phosphoglyceric acid and Pi interact at two closely located binding sites. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 3-phosphoglyceric acid large subunit small subunit polymerase chain reaction ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase)1 controls the synthesis of glycogen and starch in bacteria and plants, respectively. It catalyzes the formation of ADP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) and ATP with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate (PPi) (1Kavakli I.H. Slattery C.J. Hiroyuki I. Okita T.W. Aust. J.

The product ADP-glucose then serves as the glucosyl donor for the formation of α-1,4-glucosyl chains by glycogen/starch synthase. Both bacterial and plant AGPases are allosterically regulated by small effector molecules whose nature reflects the primary carbon assimilatory pathway present in these organisms. Despite sharing sequence homology and similar catalytic and regulatory properties, the bacterial and plant AGPases have different quaternary structures. The bacterial AGPases are composed of four identical subunits with an approximate subunit molecular mass of 48 kDa (4Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 419-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, the heterotetrameric plant enzyme is composed of a pair of large (LS) and small subunits (SS), encoded by different genes. The molecular mass of the plant LSs range from 51 to 60 kDa, whereas the SSs are from 50 to 54 kDa (5Nakata P.A. Greene T.W. Anderson J.M. Smith-White B.J. Okita T.W. Preiss J. Plant Mol.

Different approaches have been utilized in attempts to decipher the role of the two subunit types in higher plant AGPase function. Pyridoxal phosphate, a structural analogue of the activator 3-PGA, labels both the LS and SS of the spinach leaf isoform, suggesting that both subunits bind the activator (7Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis showed that pyridoxal phosphate only labeled a single residue in the spinach leaf SS (which aligns with Lys-429 in the potato SS, see Fig.2), whereas three Lys residues (which align with Lys-124, Lys-414, and Lys-452 in the potato LS, Fig. 2) were labeled in the spinach leaf LS (8Ball K.L.

Ronalds J.A. Proceedings of the Improvement of Cereal Quality by Genetic Engineering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 115-127Google Scholar). The multiple labeling patterns of the LS suggest that this subunit type plays a more dominant role in allosteric regulation than the small subunit, a view supported by genetic studies (10Preiss J. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 59-114Google Scholar, 11Preiss J. Ball K. Smithwhite B. Iglesias A. Kakefuda G. Li L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A missense mutation in the LS gene of Arabidopsis caused only a partial reduction of AGPase activity and starch levels in leaves (12Lin T.-P. Caspar T. Somerville C.R. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated enzyme, which was found to be composed of only the SS, required much higher levels of 3-PGA for activation as compared with the wild-type (wild type) Arabidopsis leaf AGPase (13Li L. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 227: 227-239Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, bacterial expression of the SS and LS inglgC− Escherichia coli AC70R1-504 (an AGPase deficient strain) indicated that the SS alone is able to form an active homotetrameric enzyme, although requiring much higher levels of 3-PGA for activation and lower levels of Pi for inhibition, as compared with the heterotetrameric wild-type enzyme (14Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Wu M.-X. Sheng J. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Nakamura Y. The 5th NIAR/COE International Symposium on the Regulation and Manipulation of Starch and Sucrose Metabolism in Plants.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the SS is involved in both catalytic and regulatory functions, whereas the LS is involved primarily in regulation. The ability to produce an active plant enzyme in bacteria, capable of complementing a glgC (structural gene for AGPase) mutation and restoring glycogen production, enabled a biochemical-genetic approach to understand the role of the AGPase subunits in enzyme function. For example, the LS or SS cDNA of the potato AGPase was subjected to chemical mutagenesis with hydroxylamine and co-expressed with the wild-type counterpart subunit in aglgC−E. coli. With this technique, both substrate and effector binding mutants have been identified. Laughlin et al. (16Laughlin M.J. Chantler S.E. Okita T.W. Plant J. 1998; 14: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Laughlin M.J. Payne J.W. Okita T.W. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) isolated several potato SS mutants, which had defective substrate (ATP or Glc-1-P) binding properties. Additionally, random mutagenesis using the LS as a template yielded several up-regulated and down-regulated potato AGPase mutants (18Greene T.W. Chantler S.E. Kahn M.L. Barry G.F. Preiss J.

A. 1998; 95: 10322-10327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overall, results from these biochemical and genetic studies indicate that the two subunit types play different roles in enzyme function. The SS contains both regulatory and catalytic sites, whereas the LS contributes a regulatory function by modulating the catalytic activity of the SS by increasing the allosteric regulatory response. Because of the lack of structural information, the study of mutant enzymes generated by random mutagenesis is a plausible approach to understand enzyme function. However, this approach requires the ability to generate numerous mutations. Although hydroxylamine treatment has been employed to mutagenize LS, it is limited by the narrow spectrum (GC to AT transitions) of mutations generated. To map amino acids involved in effector binding in the potato LS, a reverse genetics approach was employed where a “loss of function” LS (E38A) was subjected to error-prone PCR and co-expressed with the wild-type SS. Revertants that stained darkly by iodine vapor were selected and further studied for the presence of dominant second-site mutations that conferred elevated glycogen accumulation than the wild-type condition. Sixteen dominant LS mutants, which fell into 11 classes, were identified with most of the second-site mutations clustered in two regions of the primary sequence. Kinetic analysis of these 11 AGPase classes showed that the dominant LS mutations conferred an up-regulatory phenotype, i.e. increased sensitivity to the activator 3-PGA and/or increased resistance to the inhibitor Pi. Random mutagenesis of the E38A LS cDNA was performed according to Cadwell and Joyce (21Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) with modifications. 30 fmol of E38A LS in pML7 plasmid was amplified using the primers LSUampS and PLS-2 (Table I). The PCR mixture contained 1× mutagenic buffer (7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.1% (w/v) gelatin), 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 30 pmol of each primer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. PCR was performed using a Promega Robo Cycler for 14 cycles at the following conditions: 40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 61 °C, and 1.5 min 72 °C. PCR products were purified using a Qiagen PCR clean-up kit. The amplified products were digested with NcoI and HindIII, cloned into the corresponding sites of pML7 vector (22Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and transformed intoglgC−E. coli, carrying the SS expression plasmid pML10. Revertants were identified by their ability to complement the glgC− phenotype thereby restoring glycogen production, which is readily scored by iodine staining of the bacterial colonies.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the LS cDNA and generation of site-directed mutationsLSU ampS5′-GGGCCATGGCTTACTCTGTGATCACTA-3′PLS25′-GCTTATCATCGATAAGCTTCCTTCGG-3′A38E S5′-CTGGGAGGAGGAGAAGGGACCAAGTTATTC-3′A38E AS5′-GAATAACTTGGTCCCTTCTCCTCCTCCTCCCAG-3′K420A S5′-CGCAAAGATAGGAGCGAATGTTTCAATCATAAATAAAG-3′K420A AS5′-CTTTATTTATGATTGAAACATTCGCTCCTATCTTTGCG-3′K420E S5′-CGCAAAGATAGGAGAGAATGTTTCAATCATAAATAAAG-3′K420E AS5′-CTTTATTTATGATTGAAACATTCTCTCCTATCTTTGCG-3′M197I S5′-GATTTTGGGCTGGTCATAATTGACAGCAG-3′M197I AS5′-CTGCTGTCAATTATGACCAGCCCAAAATC-3′K197E S5′-GATTTTGGGCTGGTCGAGATTGACAGCAG-3′K197E AS5′-CTGCTGTCAATCTCGACCAGCCCAAAATC-3′P264E S5′-TTGAAATGGAGCTATGAAACTTCTAATGATTTTG-3′P264E AS5′-CAAAATCATTAGAAGTTTCATAGCTCCATTTCAA-3′P264G S5′-TTGAAATGGAGCTATGGGACTTCTAATGATTTTG-3′P264G AS5′-CAAAATCATTAGAAGTCCCATAGCTCCATTTCAA-3′P264K5′-TTGAAATGGAGCTATAAGACTTCTAATGATTTTG-3′P264K AS5′-CAAAATCATTAGAAGTTTCATAGCTCCATTTCAA-3′Underlined and bold nucleotides indicate the nucleotides used to replace the wild-type amino acid.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Stratagene Quick-change Mutagenesis kit. The PCR reaction contained 30 fmol of DNA, 20 pmol of primers (Table I), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The PCR was carried out for 12 cycles under the following conditions: 40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, and 11 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were digested with DpnI to remove template plasmid DNA and transformed into E. coli DH5α. The presence of the site-directed mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing through the Washington State University DNA sequencing facility. Glycogen was quantified using a glucose oxidase assay kit (Sigma). Cells were grown in 2% Kornberg's media (23Govons S. Vinopal R. Ingraham J. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 970-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the appropriate antibiotics for selection. Cells (500 mg) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in water, and then lysed by incubating at 100 °C. The samples were solubilized in 2 ml of Me2SO and 0.5 ml of HCl at 60 °C for 30 min, and then the pH was adjusted to 4.5 using NaOH in sodium citrate buffer. The samples were then treated with 3 units of amyloglucosidase at 55 °C for 40 min to hydrolyze glycogen into d-glucose. The amount of d-glucose was measured spectrophotometrically by measuring the formation of the quinoneimine dye using a coupled enzyme assay containing glucose oxidase and peroxidase. The activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was determined in both the reverse (pyrophosphorylase: Assay A) and the forward (synthesis: Assay B) directions. Pyrophosphorylase assays were used to monitor purification of the enzyme. [32P]ATP formation was measured from [32P]PPi and ADP-glucose. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 × 106 cpm/ml [32P]Pi, 1.5 mm NaPPi, 5 mm 3-PGA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ADP-glucose, 10 mm NaF, and 50–100 mg/ml protein in a final volume of 0.25 ml. Kinetic parameters were defined by the synthesis assay, which measured [14C]Glc-1-P incorporation into ADP-glucose. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 3-PGA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Glc-1-P, 0.2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.5 µCi of [14C]Glc-1-P in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (2 units/reaction in 1× CIAP buffer) was added to each reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A reaction sample volume of 0.055 ml was blotted onto DEAE-81 paper and washed 3 times with distilled water. The filter was dried and product formation quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were grown in 1 liter of modified LB medium (23Govons S. Vinopal R. Ingraham J. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 970-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to anA600 of 1.2. AGPase expression was induced by the addition of 10 µg/ml nalidixic acid and 200 µm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentrations) and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 500 µg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sample was sonicated 3 times for 45 s and centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.2-µm filter, loaded onto an HQ-POROS anion exchange column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and eluted from the column by a 200-ml linear gradient of buffer B (buffer A, pH 7.0, containing 1 m KCl). Active fractions were combined, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 m. Samples were then loaded onto a C-4 hydrophobic interaction chromatography column, which was equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m(NH4)2SO4, and 10% glycerol). Enzyme elution was carried out using a linear 200-ml linear gradient with buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A overnight. Aliquots of concentrated enzyme were stored at −80 °C. Protein levels were determined by Bradford analysis (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent. Purity and integrity of partially purified enzymes were determined by analysis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the potato AGPase LS and SS. Km and A0.5 values, corresponding to levels required for 50% maximal activity, were calculated using Lineweaver-Burk plots generated by the computer program Enzyme Kinetics 4.0 (Trinity software). Kmvalues for Mg2+ were determined using nonlinear regression plots in Excel (Microsoft). Inhibition kinetics (I0.5) corresponding to the inhibitor level required for 50% inhibition were calculated from the inhibition curve at specified allosteric activator levels using Cricket graph. Previous mutagenesis studies resulted in the identification of an LS mutant, which contained a single amino acid replacement, E38A. When co-expressed with the wild-type SS, the resulting AGPase required several hundred-fold higher levels of 3-PGA for activation than the wild-type enzyme (20Greene T.W. Kavakli I.H. Kahn M.L. Okita T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10322-10327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells expressing this mutant LS with wild-type SS were null for glycogen accumulation when analyzed by iodine staining. To map the peptide regions that participate in allosteric effector binding, a second site genetic reversion approach was utilized. The LS E38A was subjected to a modified error-prone PCR protocol and co-expressed with the wild-type SS. Primary screening of putative allosteric mutants was achieved by iodine staining. Because cells co-expressing E38A LS and the wild-type SS are unable to accumulate glycogen and hence lack iodine staining, any colonies stained by iodine vapor were assumed to contain a second site mutation(s) in the LS that restored AGPase activity and, in turn, substantial quantities of glycogen. Approximately 12,000 colonies were examined by iodine staining, and of these, 30 colonies that accumulate high amounts of glycogen were identified. The various mutant LS cDNAs were then purified and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to convert the primary mutation Ala-38 back to the corresponding wild-type residue (Glu) using the primers A38G sense and A38E antisense (Table I). The LS cDNAs containing only the secondary mutations were then co-expressed with the wild-type SS, and their activity was assessed by iodine staining. Iodine staining results indicated that 16 revertants contained dominant second-site mutations and accumulated more glycogen with respect to the wild-type LS based on increased iodine staining. Ten revertants stained as dark as wild type, whereas four revertants lost their iodine staining phenotype (data not shown). Glycogen amounts were measured enzymatically. Co-expression of the 16 LS dominant mutants with the wild-type SS in glgC−E. coli resulted in these bacterial cells accumulating more glycogen than cells co-expressing the wild-type LS and SS. DNA sequence analysis of the 16 dominant LS mutants indicated that they fell into 11 mutation classes (Table II). Some lines for example, 18, 20, and 23, have the same multiple amino acid changes, yet they are different independent mutant isolates because of the presence of different silent mutations in their coding regions (data not shown).Table IIAmino acid replacements in the 16 dominant mutantsCloneWild-type residuePositionReplacement residue2Lys420Arg11/30Lys197Met12Asp367AsnIle412Val13/22Asn175HisSer390ProGlu403Val14Pro261Leu15/16Asn145HisIle424Val17Phe193Tyr18/20/23Ser386Pro24Thr11SerSer73Cys25Ser390Pro26Ser188CysMet377ThrSeveral of the individually isolated mutants shared identical amino acid changes (e.g. 11 and 30). Open table in a new tab Several of the individually isolated mutants shared identical amino acid changes (e.g. 11 and 30). As shown in Fig. 1, the mutations were not randomly distributed, but instead 9 of the 11 mutations were clustered at two specific regions of the primary sequence, one located within the N-terminal half of the primary sequence and the other near the C terminus. The two exceptions were T11S, which contained one of the two mutations near the N terminus, and P261L, which is located near the middle (residue 261) of the polypeptide. Five of the mutations were clustered between residues 145 and 197. Even within this N-terminal region, three of the mutations occurred within 10 nucleotides that coded a region strongly conserved in the various plant AGPases. Interestingly, when mutations were mapped in the predicted secondary structure, almost all mutations were located in putative loop regions with the exception of K197M, which is located in a region having a β-sheet (Fig. 1). Likewise, mutations in the C-terminal half of the primary sequence were clustered between residues 367 and 425, with three changes occurring between residues 412 and 424 (Fig. 1). Overall, these data indicate that several loops contained within two regions of AGPase are important for the binding of allosteric effectors. The catalytic and allosteric regulatory properties of the 11 mutants AGPases were determined. Mutants were co-expressed with the wild-type SS in glgC−E. coli and partially purified using HQ POROS (anion exchange) and C-4 (hydrophobic interaction) chromatography with a final purity of ∼20%. Because degraded AGPase exhibits altered kinetic behavior (15Salamone P.R. Greene T.W. Kavakli I.H. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Plaxton W.C.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), all mutant enzymes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent analysis by immunoblot using potato anti-LS and anti-SS antibodies. No apparent degradation was evident for any of the mutants analyzed (results not shown). Km values for the substrates (ATP and Glc-1-P) and co-factor (Mg2+) of the various mutants were comparable with wild-type values (Table III). In contrast, changes in the affinity toward the allosteric activator 3-PGA and inhibitor Pi were apparent and varied depending on the mutant types. Two general classes of allosteric regulatory response mutants were evident. One class (mutants K420R, N145H/I424V, and S390P) showed similar 3-PGA activation responses (A0.5values) equivalent to the wild-type value (Table III) but required more than 3.3-fold Pi, respectively, to achieve 50% inhibition in the presence of 0.1 mm 3-PGA (Table III). The second class consisting of the remaining mutants showed alterations in both 3-PGA activation and Pi inhibition. They required ∼2-fold less 3-PGA to reach 50% maximal activation, and their I0.5values were 3.5-fold higher than the wild-type AGPase (TableIV). Among the second class, mutants D367N/I412V, F193Y, and N175H/S390P/E403V were the most sensitive to 3-PGA activation and the most resistant to Pi inhibition, requiring at least 5-fold less 3-PGA to achieve 50% activation and more than 6.5-fold greater levels of Pi for 50% inhibition than the wild-type enzyme (Table III).Table IIIKinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant AGPasesWild-typeK420RK197MD367N/I412VN175H/S390P/E403VP261LN145H/I424VF193YS386PT11S/S73CS390PS188C/M377TATP (Km)0.30.350.30.250.290.190.310.190.280.180.180.3Glc-1-P (Km)0.260.250.230.180.350.240.250.170.260.230.230.27Mg2+(Km)2.53.13.32.12.22.52.52.12.51.92.43.23-PGA (A0.5)0.10.10.040.020.020.050.070.010.030.040.090.03Pi (0.1 mm3-PGA)0.090.70.190.50.60.20.60.60.20.30.30.24Pi (0.25 mm3-PGA)0.251.8ND3-aND, not determined.NDND0.85NDNDND0.8NDNDPi (1.0 mm3-PGA)NDNDND3.22.9ND3.55.92.9ND2.53.3The kinetic and regulatory properties of the mutants and wild-type are determined in this study.

For example, clone 24 has two amino acid changes, T11S and S73C. To describe the effects of these two mutations independently, the wild-type pML7 and mutant 24 LS plasmid DNAs were digested with PstI/HindIII, and the 1.3-kilobase pair DNA fragments were exchanged between the two plasmids. Isolation of the T11S and S73C mutations on separate vectors (24A and 24B, respectively) were verified by DNA sequencing. Iodine staining results show that cells containing T11S (mutant 24A) LS accumulated higher amounts of glycogen than wild-type, whereas cells containing S73C (24B) LS did not accumulate glycogen, indicating that this mutation resulted in a defective enzyme. Kinetic analysis of 24A indicated that this single amino acid change conferred sensitivity to allosteric effectors, by requiring less 3-PGA for activation and more Pi for inhibition when compared with mutant 24 and wild-type AGPase (Table IV).

In this report, the structure and backbone dynamics of a fragment containing the unusual C-terminal fingers F4–F6 has been investigated. 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled hMTF-zf46 show that Zn(II) induces the folding of hMTF-zf46. Analysis of the secondary structure of Zn3 hMTF-zf46 determined by13Cα chemical shift indexing and the magnitude of3 JHα-HN clearly reveal that zinc fingers F4 and F6 adopt typical ββα structures. An analysis of the heteronuclear backbone 15N relaxation dynamics behavior is consistent with this picture and further reveals independent tumbling of the finger domains in solution. Titration of apo-MTF-zf46 with Zn(II) reveals that the F4 domain binds Zn(II) significantly more tightly than do the other two finger domains. In contrast to fingers F4 and F6, the ββα fold of finger F5 is unstable and only partially populated at substoichiometric Zn(II); a slight molar excess of zinc results in severe conformational exchange broadening of all F5 NH cross-peaks. Finally, although Cd(II) binds to apo-hMTF-zf46 as revealed by intense S−→Cd(II) absorption, a non-native structure results; addition of stoichiometric Zn(II) to the Cd(II) complex results in quantitative refolding of the ββα structure in F4 and F6. The functional implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2070750863,"Recent evidence suggests that endocytosis in neuroendocrine cells and neurons can be tightly coupled to exocytosis, allowing rapid retrieval from the plasma membrane of fused vesicles for future use. This can be a much faster mechanism for membrane recycling than classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis. During a fast exo-endocytotic cycle, the vesicle membrane does not fully collapse into the plasma membrane; nevertheless, it releases the vesicular contents through the fusion pore. Once the vesicle is depleted of transmitter, its membrane is recovered without renouncing its identity. In this report, we show that chromaffin cells contain catecholamine-free granules that retain their ability to fuse with the plasma membrane. These catecholamine-free granules represent 7% of the total population of fused vesicles, but they contributed to 47% of the fusion events when the cells were treated with reserpine for several hours.

After exocytosis, the membrane excess at the cell surface is internalized by endocytosis, a function required to maintain a constant cell membrane area and allow the reutilization of vesicle components. Traditionally, endocytosis has been considered to be clathrin-mediated, and it occurs with a much slower time course than exocytosis (1Henkel A.W. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the internalized membrane is thought to mix with endosomal compartments from which new vesicles emerge to maintain a functional pool of secretory vesicles (2Heuser J.E. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 3Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This cycle is well established, and many details have been elucidated in the last few years (4Cremona O. Decamilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Betz W.J. Angleson J.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Neher E.

However, several studies indicate that endocytosis may also be more tightly coupled to exocytosis, giving rise to a faster exo-endocytosis sequence. Patch clamp capacitance measurements directly measure changes in the membrane area associated with exo- and endocytosis. With this method, a rapid form of endocytosis was observed in which the same amount of previously exocytosed membrane is retrieved rapidly in response to physiological stimuli (9Smith C. Neher E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In synaptic vesicles, using FM1–43 fluorescent membrane marker, it has been shown that the amount of membrane taken up by endocytosis equals the amount of membrane added by exocytosis. This result suggested that at least some internalized vesicles directly enter the pool of releasable vesicles, bypassing intermediate endosomal compartments during the recycling process (10Murthy V.N. Stevens C. Nature. 1998; 392: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, measurements of single fusion events and the simultaneous recording of CA1 release by patch amperometry have demonstrated that a granule may reversibly fuse with the plasma membrane and release its CA content with a time course indistinguishable from that of irreversible fusion events. The frequency of reversible events (also termed “kiss-and-run” events) increases gradually as the Ca2+ concentration is elevated (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We are now able to show that chromaffin granules that have lost their CA content are able to undergo exocytosis. The percentage of these CA-free granules increased in reserpine-treated cells. The CA-free granules are slightly smaller in size and show a delayed fusion pore expansion as compared with CA-containing granules. Our results show the existence of CA-free granules in chromaffin cells and the ability of such granules to fuse with the plasma membrane. These results point to the possibility that part of the vesicle pool is rapidly recovered, allowing a faster availability of vesicles for future use. Chromaffin cells were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (200–400 g) and cultured as described previously (12Parsons T.D. Coorssen J.R. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recordings were made on days 1–3 in culture. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, and 5–10 mm glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.3, and the osmolarity was, on average, around 300 mmol/kg. The pipette solution contained either (a) 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm TEA-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, (b) 90 mm CaCl2, 40 mm TEA-Cl, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, or (c) 90 mmBaCl2, 40 mm TEA-Cl, and 10 mmHEPES/NaOH. All experiments were done at room temperature. For reserpine experiments, cells were incubated for 1–6 h in 1 µm reserpine and subsequently washed in reserpine-free medium for at least 20 min before recording. Changes in membrane capacitance and catecholamine release were recorded simultaneously by patch amperometry (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-attached patch clamp was achieved with a carbon fiber electrode (CFE) introduced into the patch pipette. A special holder with two Ag/AgCl electrodes was used. The CFE was prepared from 5-µm-diameter carbon fibers as described previously (14Chow R.H. Rüden L.V. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York/London1995: 245-272Crossref Google Scholar). The CFE was positioned at a distance 1–5 µm from the tip opening under the microscope. The pipette electrode was connected to ground, whereas the CFE was connected to the I/V converter of a homemade amperometric amplifier via a 3 mKCl solution. The CFE was continuously held at +800 mV. Amperometric currents were filtered with an 8-pole Bessel filter set at 3 KHz. Patch pipettes were pulled in three stages with a programmable puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments) and coated with a silicone compound (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning). Pipettes were fire-polished and had a typical resistance in the bath of around 2 megohms. Pipette resistance typically increased up to 3–4 megohms when the carbon fiber approached the tip opening. To calculate the time integral of the amperometric signal, we subtracted the constant direct current level in the CFE. For cell-attached capacitance measurements, we used a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; HEKA-Elektronik). Command voltage was applied to the bath. Changes of patch admittance were measured as described previously (15Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 16Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with a lock-in amplifier (SR830; Stanford Research Systems) using a sine wave amplitude of 25 mV (root mean square) at a frequency of 20 KHz. The output filter was set to a 1- or 3-ms time constant, 24 db. Data acquisition and analysis were done with a 15 A/D converter (IDA 15125; Indec Systems Inc.) with locally written software. Fusion pore openings were analyzed as described previously (16Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Pore conductance (Gp) was calculated from the real (Re) and imaginary (Im) parts of the admittance after baseline subtraction: Gp = (Re2 + Im2)/Re. Pore diameter was estimated from Gp as described previously (17Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Nature. 1987; 328: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 18Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 43 (suppl.): 333-344Google Scholar), assuming a cylindrical pore 15-nm long and a conductivity of the pipette solution of 15 mS/cm−1 (see Eq. 11.1 in Ref. 19Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 296Google Scholar). Patch amperometry allows resolution of exocytosis of single secretory vesicles approaching the size of synaptic vesicles and, in addition to this, detects the associated release of oxidizable vesicle contents (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Measurements are performed by combining high-resolution cell-attached membrane capacitance (15Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 16Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and electrochemical detection of CA inside the patch pipette. One advantage of patch amperometry is that it only detects fusion and the release of CA within the membrane patch under the pipette (∼1% of the cell surface) (Fig. 1A). Cell-attached capacitance measurements have an excellent signal:noise ratio for chromaffin granule exocytosis, and the amperometric transients recorded under these conditions are detected with minimal loss of molecules due to the restricted space at the pipette tip (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar,13Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows a patch amperometry recording from a chromaffin cell immediately after seal formation. The top trace illustrates step increments in patch membrane capacitance due to the irreversible fusion of single chromaffin granules with the plasma membrane. The bottom trace shows amperometric spikes representing CA detection with a CFE placed inside the patch pipette. The first three capacitance steps were accompanied by amperometric spikes. However, all but one of the remaining irreversible fusion events showed no detectable release of CA (blank events). In this patch, we recorded 19 capacitance steps but only 6 amperometric spikes,i.e. only 32% of the fused granules released CA. Fig.1 C shows a step increment in capacitance followed by release (top panel) and two steps not accompanied by amperometric transients (bottom panel) in more detail. This suggests that the properties of the step increases in capacitance were similar in both types of events. To better check whether there is release of any oxidizable compound during the fusion of blank events, we assessed the time integral of the amperometric signal (Fig.1 D). It is clear that an increase in the charge (2.5 ± 1.0 picocoulomb/fusion event in this cell, mean ± S.D.;n = 4) only occurred when there was an amperometric spike. The fusion of blank events occurred in 7% (28 of 400) of the membrane patches recorded, 64% (18 patches) of which showed at least one fusion event accompanied by CA release. Within the recording from one particular patch, the time courses of the amperometric transients were similar regardless of the presence of blank events. Fig.2A shows a superposition of 10 amperometric spikes from a patch in which 6 blank events were recorded. Because all events in patch amperometry are detected from the same very limited area on the cell surface (the membrane patch), and the distance between the release sites and the electrochemical detector is similar for all events, all amperometric transients displayed similar kinetics. Fig. 2 B, which shows normalized amperometric spike amplitudes, better illustrates this point. Only a slight increase in the spike half-height width of 4 ms (from 26 to 30 ms) was observed during the recording in this cell (Fig. 2 C, ●). The reason for the broadening of this spike was not determined, but it was typically observed in all recordings regardless of the presence of blanks. The observations that most amperometric spikes have similar half-height widths and that blank events are detected in between spikes (Fig. 2 C, ○) are good indications that blank events are not due to a change in the sensitivity of the carbon fiber electrode. To determine whether the size of the CA-free granules was within the range of chromaffin granules, we compared blank events with those accompanied by amperometric spikes. Fig. 3, Aand D, shows frequency histograms of capacitance step sizes. Distributions for both types of events were similar, although the mean capacitance value for blank events was 0.86 ± 0.46 fF (±S.D.;n = 53; 18 cells), which was 31% less than that of CA-containing granules (1.25 ± 0.7 fF; ±S.D.; n= 142; 8 cells). The transformation of granule capacitance to granule radius predicts an average (±S.D.) radius of 96 ± 25 nm for CA-containing granules (Fig. 3 B) and 80 ± 21 nm for non-CA-containing granules (Fig. 3 E). The average volume difference between these two populations of granules is about 58%. Fig. 3 C shows a frequency histogram of the charge under the amperometric spike (assuming 2 charge electrons/CA molecule) for CA-containing granules. The mean charge ± S.E. was 1.56 ± 0.2 picocoulombs, a value similar to that obtained in cells in which no blank events were recorded. To further explore the origin of CA-free granules, we did experiments in cells incubated with reserpine, which blocks the vesicular CA transporter. With reserpine, 47% of the fusion events recorded were CA-free (25 of 53 steps recorded; 12 cells). The step size distribution of fusion events in reserpine-treated cells had an average value ± S.D. of 0.94 ± 0.6 fF (n = 53) (Fig.3 G), corresponding to a mean ± S.D. granule radius of 84 ± 22 nm (Fig. 3 H). These values are in between the granule radius measured for CA-containing and CA-free granules. In reserpine-treated cells, the amount of CA in CA-containing granules was greatly reduced, giving an average ± S.E. value of 0.38 ± 0.07 picocoulomb (28 spikes). These results indicate that the granule size distribution in reserpine-treated cells is similar to the size distribution of CA-free granules. Regardless of the presence or absence of blank events in the recordings, the amount of CA released from individual chromaffin granules was usually proportional to granule size in nontreated cells. Granule volumes were calculated from the size of the capacitance steps, assuming that the granules are perfect spheres and that the membrane has a specific membrane capacitance of 10 fF/µm2. Mean granule CA concentration was estimated from the slope of the line correlating moles of CA (estimated from the integral of the spike amperometric currents) and granule volumes. Fig.4shows this relationship in four cells. Although the estimated mean CA concentration varied greatly from cell to cell, granules of one particular cell generally had either a homogenous CA concentration or did not release any detectable CA at all. Granules containing a very small amount of CA were recorded only as exceptions (Fig. 4, arrows). The average ± S.E. of granular CA concentration measured in reserpine-treated cells was 0.64 ± 0.07 m (28 events), a significantly smaller amount of CA than that contained in typical chromaffin granules (range, 1–4 m). Fig.5shows the time sequence of fusion for CA-free and CA-containing granules in two representative recordings. Blank events are illustrated as points with CA concentration = 0. There appears to be no preferred time distribution of blank events along the recordings. Blank events seem to occur randomly between the exocytosis of CA-containing vesicles, indicating that both CA-free and CA-containing granules were ready for fusion. These data suggest that these two populations of granules are within the same pool of releasable vesicles. To study the effect of CA content on fusion pore opening, the time courses of fusion pore conductance were compared in CA-containing and CA-free vesicles. Pore conductance was calculated for those events in which the increase in the imaginary part of the admittance (capacitance trace) was accompanied by a detectable transient increase in the real part of the admittance (conductance trace). Fig. 6compares, in the same cell, the time course of two fusion pores in which an amperometric spike was present (Fig. 6 B) or absent (Fig. 6 A). The panels show the imaginary part of the admittance (proportional to the patch membrane capacitance, trace labeled Im/Ω), the real part of the admittance (proportional to the patch conductance, trace labeled Re), the calculated pore conductance (Gp) (16Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the amperometric current (Am). In Fig. 6 A, the pore conductance developed in at least two phases. A phase of small fusion pore conductance (circa 100 pS) lasting 300 ms was followed by a fast rise of fusion pore conductance to values of >1 nS. In Fig.6 B, only the fast phase is observed. In this membrane patch, no current projection onto the real part of the admittance could be detected during the fusion of all of the CA-containing granules (n = 5), indicating that a possible phase of low fusion pore conductance was shorter than our time resolution (sampling rate, 2.5 ms/point). On the contrary, in all CA-free granules, the time course of the pore expansion could be measured. This trend was observed in four different cells. The average duration ± S.E. for low fusion pore conductance was almost five times shorter in CA-containing granules (12 ± 1.8 ms; n = 50) than in CA-free granules (58 ± 21 ms; n = 20). Fig. 6,C and D, shows normalized time distributions of fusion pore conductance values for CA-free and CA-containing chromaffin granules, respectively. CA-free granules spent >80% of their expansion time with a conductance of <200 pS (Fig. 6 C), and the average pore conductance was 195 pS (n = 234). On the contrary, CA-containing granules had an average conductance of 560 pS (n = 86), spending <20% of their expansion time with a conductance of <200 pS (Fig. 6 D). In both cases, events in which the fusion pore could not be measured were considered fusion events with pore duration < 2.5 ms. These results indicate that although chromaffin granules fuse with the membrane regardless of the CA contents in the granule, CA-free granules tend to enlarge their fusion pores slowly, continuing at smaller conductance values for longer time periods. This work describes the exocytosis of CA-containing and CA-free granules in chromaffin cells in rats. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CA-free granules result from chromaffin granules that have previously fused with the plasma membrane, released their CA contents, and once emptied, internalized. However, there are other possibilities that could explain the existence of stepwise capacitance blank events in chromaffin cells. One possibility is that these blank events represent the fusion of acetylcholine (ACh)-containing vesicles. Such vesicles have been described in chromaffin cells (20Schubbert D. Klier F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5184-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Bauerfeind R. Regniervigouroux A. Flatmark T. Huttner W.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 105-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and would appear as blank events in our amperometric recordings because ACh cannot be measured electrochemically by a carbon fiber electrode as used here. This possibility is unlikely for two reasons: (a) ACh is stored in synaptic-like microvesicles with diameters ranging from 30–90 nm (22Cliftogrady L. Desnos C. Lichtenstein Y. Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 16: 150-159Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), corresponding to step changes in capacitance between 0.02 and 0.25 fF, and these values do not overlap with the step size distribution obtained for the capacitance blank events measured in our experiments (Fig. 3, D and E); and (b) during blank fusion events, we do not observe a transient conductance increase, as expected if the released ACh activates the nicotinic receptors of chromaffin cells. Another possibility is that blank events are indeed chromaffin granules that release CA, but the released molecules escape electrochemical detection. A possible source of detection failure of CA in patch amperometry could be that fused granules release their contents into a compartmentalized space within the patch pipette. This could happen in situations where part of the membrane patch is tightly attached to the pipette wall, forming a pocket of membrane that could slow down diffusion of molecules toward the carbon fiber detector. For example, if this pocket has a volume 100 times larger than the volume of a chromaffin granule, and it is connected to the pipette interior through a leak pathway with a conductance similar to a fusion pore, we should expect that when a chromaffin granule releases its CA content, CA would accumulate at a 100 times lower concentration into this pocket and would leak to the carbon fiber detector 100 times more slowly. This will give rise to a very small but very prolonged amperometric signal that should appear in the time integral of the amperometric recording. As shown in Fig.1 D, we did not observed any increase in the amperometric charge during and many seconds after the fusion of blank events. To further explore the origin of blank events, we performed experiments in cells incubated with reserpine (1 µm). This treatment depletes chromaffin granules of CA without affecting the contents of other granule components such as dopamine β-hydroxylase (23Dixon W.R. Garcı́a A.G. Kirpekar S.M. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the amount of blank events recorded increased from 7% in nontreated cells to 47% in cells incubated with reserpine. In reserpine-treated cells, the CA content in the remaining granules was significantly smaller than that in non-reserpine-treated CA-containing granules, suggesting that reserpine effectively depleted chromaffin granules of CA before fusing with the plasma membrane. The step size distribution of reserpine-treated cells was more like that observed for blank events than that observed for CA-containing granules. This strongly suggests that CA-free granules in fact arise from depleted chromaffin granules and not from a different type of granule or through constitutive exocytosis. The CA-free granules apparently have a smaller mean diameter than CA-containing ones. This could be due to the inclusion of some constitutive exocytotic events on the CA-free granule size distribution, which the great majority is < 0.4 fF (24Henkel A.W. Meiri H. Horstmann H. Lindau M. Almers W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, smaller-sized granules could result from the loss of some membrane during the preceding fusion event in which catecholamine was released. Membrane transfer from the plasma membrane to secretory granules during reversible fusion events has been reported in mast cells (25Monck J. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the electric organ of the marine ray Torpedo,two populations of vesicles can be distinguished after stimulation (26Zimmermann H. Denston D.R. Neuroscience. 1977; 2: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,27Zimmermann H. Denston D.R. Neuroscience. 1977; 2: 695-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One has the same size as synaptic vesicles found at rest, whereas the other has a smaller diameter (25%). These two populations were attributed to preformed and recycling vesicles, respectively (28Van der Kloot W. Molgo J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 899-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Williams J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 683-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Large-sized vesicles were full of ACh, whereas smaller-sized vesicles were partially filled with ACh. We do not usually find partially filled granules in cells non-treated with reserpine; we usually find granules with high or no CA content. Partially loaded granules were recorded only occasionally (Fig. 4, arrows). The absence of partially filled granules in our recordings may be due to several possibilities. CA granules might not be refilled because the reloading machinery in the granule membrane was not ready, either because the proton gradient necessary for the transport of CA was not reestablished or because the CA transporter was no longer operative. Another possibility is that depleted granules did not have enough time to reload. The CA refilling time for a single chromaffin granule is currently unknown. In our experiments, irreversible blank events appeared to be randomly intermixed with CA-releasing events along the recording, without a clear distribution preference (Fig. 5). Similar results have been reported in the electric organ of the Torpedo (30Searl T. Prior C. Marshall I.G. J. Physiol. 1991; 444: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This result suggests that CA-free and CA-full granules in chromaffin cells are within the same pool of releasable vesicles, at the same stage in the sequence of events leading to fusion-competent vesicles. It should be noted that during our recordings, no external stimulus was applied, and most fusion events occur spontaneously or after spontaneous action potential firing. The expansion of exocytotic fusion pores has been studied previously in mast cells (31Spruce A.E. Breckenridge L.J. Lee A.K. Almers W. Neuron. 1990; 4: 643-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Monck J. Oberhauser A. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 39-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Fernandez-Chacon R. Alvarez de Toledo G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and horse eosinophils (34Hartmann J. Lindau M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was found that fusion pore expansion is accelerated by increased cytosolic calcium concentrations (33Fernandez-Chacon R. Alvarez de Toledo G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Hartmann J. Lindau M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by protein kinase C activation with phorbol ester (35Scepek S. Coorssen J.R. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4340-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accelerated fusion pore expansion leads to a more rapid release; in particular, it leads to a shortened time between the initial opening of the fusion pore and the initiation of rapid release (33Fernandez-Chacon R. Alvarez de Toledo G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, we find a marked increase in the delay between fusion pore formation and rapid expansion for CA-free vesicles. The initial fusion pore formation, however, does not appear to be markedly affected, indicating that fusion pores formed independently of the granule contents. However, fusion pore expansion was delayed. CA-free granules remain in a low conductance state for longer periods than do CA-containing granules, although CA-free granules could eventually fully expand the fusion pore. This suggests that the release of CA or the process associated with it,i.e. expansion of the granule matrix during exocytosis, could have an important role in hastening fusion pore expansion. This result is in contrast to that reported previously in beige mouse peritoneal mast cells (32Monck J. Oberhauser A. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 39-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in which inhibition of the granule matrix swelling apparently did not affect the kinetics of fusion pore expansion during exocytosis. However, it should be mentioned that in those experiments, only 90% of granule matrix swelling could be inhibited by a high concentration of histamine chloride (140 mm) in the bath. Additional experiments with complete inhibition of matrix swelling in beige mouse mast cells will be required to clarify the importance of matrix swelling in the kinetics of fusion pore expansion. Cell membrane capacitance increments not accompanied by a detectable amperometric signal have been described in bovine chromaffin cells (36Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and in mast cells (37Oberhauser A.F. Robinson I.M. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These increases in capacitance have been attributed either to the fusion of intracellular vesicles (or organelles) distinct from the specific chromaffin granules or to the fusion of mast cell granules with the plasma membrane. Supporting the hypothesis of nonspecific membrane fusion, changes in capacitance have also been described in cells whose main function is thought to be nonsecretory, such as fibroblasts or Chinese hamster ovary cells (38Coorssen J.R. Schmitt H. Almers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3787-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, stepwise membrane capacitance increments unaccompanied by serotonin release could be resolved and unambiguously attributed to the fusion of single secretory granules in peritoneal mast cells from ruby-eye mice (39Oberhauser A. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14349-14354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These fusion events in mast cells appeared at the beginning of the secretory response. They were attributed to the fusion of granules that had previously discharged their contents into the extracellular medium during transient fusion events (39Oberhauser A. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14349-14354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the high incidence of capacitance flickers in mast cells from ruby-eye mice. Flickering of the fusion pore between an open and closed state has been demonstrated with electrophysiological techniques in mast cells (31Spruce A.E. Breckenridge L.J. Lee A.K. Almers W. Neuron. 1990; 4: 643-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 40Fernandez J.M. Neher E. Gomperts B.D.

Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and chromaffin cells (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Such transient fusion events may also occur in synaptic vesicles. Using optical methods, it has been proven that exocytosed vesicles can be directly reformed from the plasma membrane without passing through the early endosome (10Murthy V.N. Stevens C. Nature. 1998; 392: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). During transient fusion events, rapid and complete CA release can occur in rat chromaffin cells (11Alés E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The existence of exocytosis-coupled endocytosis with full discharge of the granule contents implies the presence of neurotransmitter-depleted vesicles inside the cell. One intriguing possibility is that CA-free granule exocytosis arises from granules that have been depleted of CA through a preceding transient fusion with the plasma membrane and lacked the time or capability to reload the transmitter. In summary, we have found a population of CA-free granules, with a size that is compatible with that of chromaffin granules, that is competent for fusion. These CA-free granules presumably arise from chromaffin granules that have previously released their contents via a kiss-and-run event and directly return into the pool of releasable vesicles. The fusion pore expansion in these vesicles is significantly slower than that in CA-containing vesicles, thus suggesting that the ion exchange processes with the granular matrix may play a role in the mechanism of fusion pore expansion in chromaffin granules.

In this report, we show that Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregating in vitro and therefore acts as a molecular chaperone. The chaperone action of Atp11p is mediated by hydrophobic interactions. An accessible hydrophobic surface in Atp11p was identified with the environment-sensitive fluorescent probe 1,1′-bis(4-anilino-5-napththalenesulfonic acid (bis-ANS). The spectral changes of bis-ANS in the presence of Atp11p indicate that the probe binds to a nonpolar region of the protein. Furthermore, the dye quenches the fluorescence of Atp11p tryptophan residues in a concentration-dependent manner. Although up to three molecules of bis-ANS can bind cooperatively to Atp11p, the binding of only one dye molecule is sufficient to virtually eliminate the chaperone activity of the protein.

In normal cells, F1 assembly proceeds with the incorporation of five different protein subunits to form the oligomer α3β3γδε (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondria from atp11 oratp12 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae show the accumulation of the F1 α subunits and β subunits in an aggregated form (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Notably, the “sticky” character of unassembled F1 α and β subunits is also apparent from the phenotype of yeast atp1 (α subunit) andatp2 (β subunit) null mutants; the β subunits aggregate in the mitochondria of cells lacking the α subunit, and the α subunits aggregate when there are no β subunits to combine with (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The phenotypic similarity among atp1, atp2,atp11, and atp12 null strains suggests that Atp11p and Atp12p are important elements in determining the solubility status of the aggregation-prone, unassembled F1 α and β subunits. In line with this hypothesis are the findings that Atp11p interacts directly with the F1 β subunit (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that Atp12p interacts directly with the F1 α subunit (4Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The present work focuses on the molecular mechanism of Atp11p. Based on experiments with the yeast two-hybrid system (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we have proposed that the substrate for Atp11p is the folded form of the F1 β subunit. Previous work also identified the middle third of Atp11p as its functional domain and showed that this region is characterized by two stretches of hydrophobic amino acids (5Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the more distal of which is coincident with the PXFXXXLPR consensus sequence common to Atp11p proteins from diverse sources (6Wang Z.-G. Schmid K.J. Ackerman S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.-G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The reason why folded β subunits aggregate in the absence of Atp11p probably lies in the fact that the unassembled protein exposes hydrophobic groups at the surface that are not meant to be in contact with solvent because they will ultimately be sequestered at contact points with adjacent α subunits in the F1αβαβαβ hexamer (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 9Bianchet M.A. Hulihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, Atp11p may function by providing a hydrophobic surface that is the steric complement of a nonpolar region of the unassembled F1 β subunit. An example of a chaperone that temporarily transmits structural information to its substrate is PapD; in the complex formed between PapD and the pilus subunit, PapK, the chaperone inserts a β-strand in the PapK structure to fill a groove in the protein and shield its hydrophobic core from the solvent (10Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S. Waksman G. Frieden C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7709-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).The studies reported here provide evidence that a hydrophobic surface in Atp11p is indeed an important element of its mechanism. Because attempts to use the recombinant form of the mitochondrial F1 β subunit have not been successful, 1D. Sheluho, unpublished observations.1D. Sheluho, unpublished observations. we have employed insulin as a model substrate. After reduction of the disulfide bonds in insulin, the A chain remains in solution, whereas the B chain aggregates (11Sanger F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to that observed for other molecular chaperones including α-crystallin (12Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.-J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Hsp902 (13Scheibel T. Weiki T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and SecB (14Panse V.G. Vogel P. Trommer W.E. Varadarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18698-18703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregation in vitro. In other work, we show that upon binding the fluorescent probe bis-ANS to a hydrophobic region of Atp11p, the protein loses the capacity to prevent the aggregation of the insulin B chain.DISCUSSIONUntil now, the proposal that Atp11p is a molecular chaperone has been based on plausible yet indirect evidence, including the phenotype of yeast atp11 mutants, which accumulate subunits of the F1-ATPase in an aggregated form (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the demonstration by two-hybrid screens and co-precipitation of interactions between Atp11p and the F1 β subunit (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the fact that purified mitochondrial F1 β subunits fail to remain monodispersed in solution1 has hampered studies of the direct interaction of Atp11p with its natural substrate in vitro. Insulin, on the other hand, has proven to be an exceptionally good model substrate for in vitrostudies with Atp11p. In particular, Atp11p is not affected by the conditions used to induce aggregation of the insulin B chain. The aggregation of the B chain, which accompanies reduction of the insulin disulfide bonds (11Sanger F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), is likely to occur because amino acid side chains of the B chain, which are buried in the native structure, are exposed when the two insulin chains are separated. In this respect, an unassembled F1 β subunit is not dissimilar from the free insulin B chain because a free β subunit exposes at its surface hydrophobic residues that will be sequestered in the F1oligomer. Our demonstration that Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregation (Fig. 1) provides, for the first time,direct evidence of the molecular chaperone activity of this protein.The fluorescent dye bis-ANS has been instrumental in providing information about hydrophobic surfaces in many proteins, including those belonging to the superfamilies of molecular chaperones such as DnaK (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Hsp70 class), GroEL (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Hsp60 class), and α-crystallin (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) (small heat shock protein class). In some cases, such work has been geared toward the detection of conformational changes in the chaperone proteins (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas others have used this tool as a probe for hydrophobic domains with the intent of linking the findings to the chaperone action of the protein (23Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Our current work with bis-ANS follows the latter strategy. The spectral characteristics of the dye in an aqueous buffer containing Atp11p (Fig.2) indicate that bis-ANS binds to an accessible hydrophobic surface of the protein. Further evidence for the existence of an Atp11p-bis-ANS complex is provided by the demonstration of energy transfer from tryptophan to the dye (Fig. 3). The recombinant yeast Atp11p used in this work contains three tryptophan residues at positions 144, 148, and 205 in the primary sequence (26Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids collectively emit maximal fluorescence at 328 nm after excitation at 295 nm (Fig. 3), in contrast with free tryptophan, which emits at 350 nm (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 446-454Google Scholar). Thus, although we do not know whether all three tryptophans of Atp11p contribute to the observed fluorescence, maximal emission at 328versus 350 nm is taken to be diagnostic of the fact that the fluorescing amino acid(s) is (are) buried in a nonpolar region of the protein (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 446-454Google Scholar).Titration studies indicate that ∼3 moles of bis-ANS bind per mole of Atp11p at saturation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the binding data are indicative of positive cooperativity, which suggests that Atp11p may undergo a change in conformation upon binding bis-ANS in a manner similar to that observed when bis-ANS binds to DnaK (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and to the apical domain of GroEL (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although we do not know the nature of the putative conformational change induced by bis-ANS, the spectral and solubility properties of Atp11p in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of the dye do not reveal a gross perturbation of the proteinstructure. However, it is clear that the proteinfunction is greatly compromised by bis-ANS because at an equimolar dye:protein concentration, the chaperone action of the Atp11p is virtually eliminated (Fig. 5). The inability of an Atp11p:bis-ANS complex to provide significant protection against aggregation of the reduced insulin B chain (Fig. 5) provides evidence that the hydrophobic surface in Atp11p to which the dye binds is important for the chaperone activity of the protein.Native mitochondrial Atp11p and the purified recombinant protein both sediment in linear sucrose gradients as a 31-kDa monomer (15White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments performed as part of this study confirm that Atp11p remains a monomer under the conditions of the insulin aggregation assay (data not shown). In accord with the proposal that Atp11p is active as a monomer is the fact that the hydrophobic surface required for its function is highly accessible to bis-ANS under physiological conditions (pH 7.5, 30 °C) (see Fig. 2). In this respect, Atp11p is distinctly different from oligomeric chaperone proteins such as GroEL/Hsp60 (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and α-crystallin/small heat shock protein (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K.

Although our studies do not address the possibility that ATP is required for Atp11p action with its natural substrate in vivo, our results are in accord with the fact that there is no indication from the primary sequence (26Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from equilibrium binding experiments 3Z.-G. Wang and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished observations. to suggest that Atp11p binds ATP. In a similar vein, there is no evidence that ATP hydrolysis is involved in the chaperone actions of PapD (10Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S. Waksman G. Frieden C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7709-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or small heat shock proteins such as α-crystallin (12Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.-J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). There are other properties of the latter two chaperones that share common ground with Atp11p. For example, PapD, which binds unassembled pilus subunits, and Atp11p, which binds unassembled F1 β subunits, are much more specific in their chaperone activities versus members of the Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 superfamilies (27Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Also noteworthy is that just as small heat shock proteins (including α-crystallin) are characterized in part by a short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids (XGVLXLXXPX) (25Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 28Tuite M.F. Bentley N.J. Bossier P. Fitch I.T. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Atp11p proteins from yeast on up to humans are characterized by a hydrophobic consensus sequence, PXFXXXLPR (7Wang Z.-G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Future studies will be aimed at determining whether this Atp11p sequence is coincident with the bis-ANS binding site. Atp11p is one of two proteins (the other is Atp12p) required for assembly of the catalytic (F1) component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. In normal cells, F1 assembly proceeds with the incorporation of five different protein subunits to form the oligomer α3β3γδε (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondria from atp11 oratp12 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae show the accumulation of the F1 α subunits and β subunits in an aggregated form (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Notably, the “sticky” character of unassembled F1 α and β subunits is also apparent from the phenotype of yeast atp1 (α subunit) andatp2 (β subunit) null mutants; the β subunits aggregate in the mitochondria of cells lacking the α subunit, and the α subunits aggregate when there are no β subunits to combine with (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The phenotypic similarity among atp1, atp2,atp11, and atp12 null strains suggests that Atp11p and Atp12p are important elements in determining the solubility status of the aggregation-prone, unassembled F1 α and β subunits. In line with this hypothesis are the findings that Atp11p interacts directly with the F1 β subunit (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that Atp12p interacts directly with the F1 α subunit (4Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present work focuses on the molecular mechanism of Atp11p. Based on experiments with the yeast two-hybrid system (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we have proposed that the substrate for Atp11p is the folded form of the F1 β subunit. Previous work also identified the middle third of Atp11p as its functional domain and showed that this region is characterized by two stretches of hydrophobic amino acids (5Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the more distal of which is coincident with the PXFXXXLPR consensus sequence common to Atp11p proteins from diverse sources (6Wang Z.-G. Schmid K.J. Ackerman S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.-G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The reason why folded β subunits aggregate in the absence of Atp11p probably lies in the fact that the unassembled protein exposes hydrophobic groups at the surface that are not meant to be in contact with solvent because they will ultimately be sequestered at contact points with adjacent α subunits in the F1αβαβαβ hexamer (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 9Bianchet M.A. Hulihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, Atp11p may function by providing a hydrophobic surface that is the steric complement of a nonpolar region of the unassembled F1 β subunit. An example of a chaperone that temporarily transmits structural information to its substrate is PapD; in the complex formed between PapD and the pilus subunit, PapK, the chaperone inserts a β-strand in the PapK structure to fill a groove in the protein and shield its hydrophobic core from the solvent (10Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S. Waksman G. Frieden C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7709-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The studies reported here provide evidence that a hydrophobic surface in Atp11p is indeed an important element of its mechanism. Because attempts to use the recombinant form of the mitochondrial F1 β subunit have not been successful, 1D. Sheluho, unpublished observations.1D. Sheluho, unpublished observations. we have employed insulin as a model substrate. After reduction of the disulfide bonds in insulin, the A chain remains in solution, whereas the B chain aggregates (11Sanger F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to that observed for other molecular chaperones including α-crystallin (12Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.-J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Hsp902 (13Scheibel T. Weiki T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and SecB (14Panse V.G. Vogel P. Trommer W.E. Varadarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18698-18703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregation in vitro. In other work, we show that upon binding the fluorescent probe bis-ANS to a hydrophobic region of Atp11p, the protein loses the capacity to prevent the aggregation of the insulin B chain. DISCUSSIONUntil now, the proposal that Atp11p is a molecular chaperone has been based on plausible yet indirect evidence, including the phenotype of yeast atp11 mutants, which accumulate subunits of the F1-ATPase in an aggregated form (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the demonstration by two-hybrid screens and co-precipitation of interactions between Atp11p and the F1 β subunit (3Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the fact that purified mitochondrial F1 β subunits fail to remain monodispersed in solution1 has hampered studies of the direct interaction of Atp11p with its natural substrate in vitro. Insulin, on the other hand, has proven to be an exceptionally good model substrate for in vitrostudies with Atp11p. In particular, Atp11p is not affected by the conditions used to induce aggregation of the insulin B chain. The aggregation of the B chain, which accompanies reduction of the insulin disulfide bonds (11Sanger F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), is likely to occur because amino acid side chains of the B chain, which are buried in the native structure, are exposed when the two insulin chains are separated. In this respect, an unassembled F1 β subunit is not dissimilar from the free insulin B chain because a free β subunit exposes at its surface hydrophobic residues that will be sequestered in the F1oligomer. Our demonstration that Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregation (Fig. 1) provides, for the first time,direct evidence of the molecular chaperone activity of this protein.The fluorescent dye bis-ANS has been instrumental in providing information about hydrophobic surfaces in many proteins, including those belonging to the superfamilies of molecular chaperones such as DnaK (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Hsp70 class), GroEL (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Hsp60 class), and α-crystallin (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) (small heat shock protein class). In some cases, such work has been geared toward the detection of conformational changes in the chaperone proteins (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas others have used this tool as a probe for hydrophobic domains with the intent of linking the findings to the chaperone action of the protein (23Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Our current work with bis-ANS follows the latter strategy. The spectral characteristics of the dye in an aqueous buffer containing Atp11p (Fig.2) indicate that bis-ANS binds to an accessible hydrophobic surface of the protein. Further evidence for the existence of an Atp11p-bis-ANS complex is provided by the demonstration of energy transfer from tryptophan to the dye (Fig. 3). The recombinant yeast Atp11p used in this work contains three tryptophan residues at positions 144, 148, and 205 in the primary sequence (26Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids collectively emit maximal fluorescence at 328 nm after excitation at 295 nm (Fig. 3), in contrast with free tryptophan, which emits at 350 nm (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 446-454Google Scholar). Thus, although we do not know whether all three tryptophans of Atp11p contribute to the observed fluorescence, maximal emission at 328versus 350 nm is taken to be diagnostic of the fact that the fluorescing amino acid(s) is (are) buried in a nonpolar region of the protein (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 446-454Google Scholar).Titration studies indicate that ∼3 moles of bis-ANS bind per mole of Atp11p at saturation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the binding data are indicative of positive cooperativity, which suggests that Atp11p may undergo a change in conformation upon binding bis-ANS in a manner similar to that observed when bis-ANS binds to DnaK (20Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and to the apical domain of GroEL (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although we do not know the nature of the putative conformational change induced by bis-ANS, the spectral and solubility properties of Atp11p in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of the dye do not reveal a gross perturbation of the proteinstructure. However, it is clear that the proteinfunction is greatly compromised by bis-ANS because at an equimolar dye:protein concentration, the chaperone action of the Atp11p is virtually eliminated (Fig. 5). The inability of an Atp11p:bis-ANS complex to provide significant protection against aggregation of the reduced insulin B chain (Fig. 5) provides evidence that the hydrophobic surface in Atp11p to which the dye binds is important for the chaperone activity of the protein.Native mitochondrial Atp11p and the purified recombinant protein both sediment in linear sucrose gradients as a 31-kDa monomer (15White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments performed as part of this study confirm that Atp11p remains a monomer under the conditions of the insulin aggregation assay (data not shown). In accord with the proposal that Atp11p is active as a monomer is the fact that the hydrophobic surface required for its function is highly accessible to bis-ANS under physiological conditions (pH 7.5, 30 °C) (see Fig. 2). In this respect, Atp11p is distinctly different from oligomeric chaperone proteins such as GroEL/Hsp60 (24Smoot A.L. Markandeswar P. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and α-crystallin/small heat shock protein (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which show low accessibility of the hydrophobic surface in the native state relative to perturbed forms of the proteins.The ability of Atp11p to prevent aggregation of the insulin B chain occurs in the absence of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1).

For example, PapD, which binds unassembled pilus subunits, and Atp11p, which binds unassembled F1 β subunits, are much more specific in their chaperone activities versus members of the Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 superfamilies (27Hendrick J.P.

The connecting segment harbors a putative tyrosine activation motif in which tyrosines 1422 and 1440 are phosphorylated in response to α6β4 binding to laminin-5.

Hemidesmosome assembly was evaluated on organotypic skin cultures. β4-corrected keratinocytes were indistinguishable from normal cells in terms of α6β4expression, the localization of hemidesmosome components, and hemidesmosome structure and density, suggesting full genetic and functional correction of β4-null keratinocytes.

Keratinocytes forming the basal layer firmly adhere to the basement membrane by means of hemidesmosomes (HDs),1 multiprotein complexes linking the epithelial intermediate filament network to the dermal anchoring fibrils (see Refs. 1Christiano A.M.

Krieg T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for review). Laminin-5 binds to the basal keratinocyte cell surface through the α6β4integrin and tightens the dermal-epidermal junction by binding also to the N-terminal NC-1 domain of type VII collagen (9Rousselle P.

The crucial importance of the interaction between laminin-5 and its α6β4 receptor in maintaining the integrity of the integument has been unambiguously proven by the generation of α6- and β4-null mice (10Dowling J.

Mutations in ITGA6 and ITGB4 are usually associated to pyloric atresia (PA)-JEB (16Vidal F. Aberdam D. Miquel C. Christiano A.M. Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Nat.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).The cytoplasmic domain of α6β4 contains two pairs of type III fibronectin (FN)-like repeats separated by a 142-amino acid connecting segment (CS). This CS is the target of multiple regulatory mechanisms, including tyrosine phosphorylation (18Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and proteolytic processing (19Giancotti F.G. Stepp M.A. Suzuki S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, CS harbors tandem tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-1422 and Tyr-1440), which resemble the tyrosine activation motif (TAM) of immune receptors and are phosphorylated in response to the binding of α6β4 to laminin-5 (18Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The potential TAM resides within a 303-amino acid segment of the β4cytoplasmic domain that includes the first pair of type III FN-like repeats and the CS. Mutational studies have indicated that this segment of β4 is sufficient to mediate the incorporation of recombinant β4 into the existing HD-like adhesion of 804G cells (20Spinardi L. Ren Y.L. Sanders R. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We initially observed that phenylalanine substitutions at either one of the two tyrosines in the potential TAM decreased the incorporation of recombinant β4 in HD-like adhesions (18Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although subsequent studies have yielded a contrasting result, they have provided evidence that the integrity of the TAM is required for efficient recruitment of BP180 by recombinant β4 in HD-like adhesions of PA-JEB keratinocytes (21Niessen C.-M. Hulsman E.H. Oomen L.C. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1705-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schaapveld R.Q. Borradori L. Geerts D. van Leusden M.R. Kuikman I. Nievers M.G. Niessen C.M. Steenbergen R.D. Snijders P.J. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have recently obtained evidence that the original TAM mutant used by Mainieroet al. (18Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was generated starting from a version of β4 that differs from the canonical form A because it lacks amino acids 941–948 (QDHTIVDT) in the membrane proximal portion of the cytoplasmic domain. The origin and nature of this variant form remain to be established. We have observed that this variant form of β4 and a canonical form carrying phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr-1422 or Tyr-1440 are both normally incorporated in the HD-like adhesions of 804G cells (23Dans M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Blaikie P. Klein S. Mariotti A. Giancotti F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1494-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, a mutant β4 carrying both modifications is not, as shown previously (18Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).In addition to resolving the prior controversy, these results reveal a functional synergy between amino acid stretches located relatively far apart in the linear sequence of the β4 cytoplasmic domain and highlight the necessity to further examine the potential role of the β4 TAM in HD assembly. Moreover, the potential role of specific portions of the β4 cytoplasmic domain, and in particular of the TAM, in interaction with other HD components and in HD assembly is based solely on the results obtained using immortalized cell lines cultured on plastic. Under these conditions, both keratinocytes and 804G cells do not form HDs. Instead, HD components (such as α6β4, BP180, and HD1/plectin) are organized in typical patches in which spots correspond to microfilament-free areas (“leopard skin” pattern, as described in Ref. 24Marchisio P.C. Bondanza S. Cremona O. Cancedda R. De Luca M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), often referred to as HD-like adhesions (22Schaapveld R.Q. Borradori L.

Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3850) Google Scholar, 27Green H. Harvey Lect., Series. 1980; 74: 101-139PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pellegrini G. Golisano O.

De Luca M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes can generate cohesive sheets of stratified epithelium that maintains virtually the same differentiation features and gene expression pattern of its in vivo counterpart so that it can be routinely transplanted in patients suffering from large skin or mucosal defects (31Gallico G.G.

Schweizer J. Michel S. Bailly C. Prunieras M. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 165: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), mature HDs are formed in vitro (30Dellambra E. Vailly J. Pellegrini G. Bondanza S. Golisano O. Macchia C. Zambruno G. Meneguzzi G. De Luca M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the availability of human β4-deficient primary keratinocytes (see “Results”), the possibility of stably transducing primary keratinocytes with high efficiency (34Mathor M.B. Ferrari G.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) provide a unique opportunity to clarify the above uncertainties and to investigate the role of β4 and of its potential TAM in the formation of mature HDs.RESULTSKeratinocytes were cultivated from a 1-cm2 skin biopsy taken from a newborn patient presenting with the clinical hallmarks of PA-JEB. The proband was a compound heterozygote for a 3-base pair deletion (ΔN318) in exon 8 of the maternal allele of theITGB4 gene and an as yet unidentified paternal genetic defect. Allele-specific amplification of transcripts did not show any mRNA deriving from the paternal mutant allele, even in cycloheximide-treated cells. 2Zambruno, G., unpublished data. Immunohistochemical analysis showed absence of the β4integrin in the skin of the proband (not shown). The keratinocytes of the proband are hereafter referred to as β4-null keratinocytes.Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1) andin situ hybridization performed on cultured epidermal sheets (Fig. 2) showed similar levels of β4 transcripts in β4-null keratinocytes (Fig. 1A, lane 2, arrowhead, and Fig.2C) as compared with normal control cells (Fig.1A, lane 1, arrowhead, and Fig.2A). Absence of the β4 polypeptide in β4-null cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, B andC, lanes 2), immunofluorescence performed on β4-null colonies (not shown), and immunohistochemistry performed on cultured epidermal sheets generated by β4-null keratinocytes (Fig. 2D). Thus, although transcription of mutated β4 can occur in β4-null cells, the β4 polypeptide is either not translated or is rapidly degraded. The α6 subunit (Fig. 1C, lane 2) was expressed at levels comparable with those observed in control cells (Fig. 1C,lane 1).Figure 2In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Cultured epidermal sheets were prepared from primary cultures of control (A andB), β4-null (C and D), and β4-corrected keratinocytes (E andF). Sections of cultured epidermal sheets were either hybridized with a β4 integrin antisense riboprobe (A, C, and E) or immunostained with a rabbit antiserum raised against β4 (B,D, and F) (19Giancotti F.G.

Infections with replication-defective retroviruses carrying a full-length human β4 cDNA (Fig. 1D) were performed by co-culturing β4-null keratinocytes with lethally irradiated 3T3-J2 cells and producer GP+envAm12 cells (30Dellambra E. Vailly J. Pellegrini G. Bondanza S. Golisano O. Macchia C. Zambruno G. Meneguzzi G. De Luca M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,38Dellambra E. Golisano O. Bondanza S. Siviero E. Lacal P. Molinari M. D'Atri S. De Luca M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were then transferred onto a regular 3T3-J2 feeder layer both at regular density (5 × 103/cm2) and at clonal density (100–1,000 cells/dish) so that each colony was formed by a single cell and could be scored as β 4+ and β 4−.Southern analysis showed multiple bands resulting from numerous proviral integrations in a heterogeneous transduced cell population (not shown, see also Ref. 34Mathor M.B. Ferrari G. Dellambra E. Cilli M. Mavilio F. Cancedda R. De Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Northern analysis showed abundant levels of exogenous β4 transcripts (Fig.1A, lane 3, arrow). Immunofluorescence (performed on coverslips seeded with keratinocytes plated at clonal density) demonstrated that clonogenic β4-null keratinocytes were transduced with an efficiency of virtually 100% and that the exogenous β4 polypeptide was localized at the cell membrane (not shown). The proper assembly of the α6β4 heterodimer was evidenced by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using mAbs to either β4 or α6 (3E1 and G0H3, respectively) followed by immunoblot using antisera raised against either α6 or β4 (T20 and N20, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1 (panels B and C), α6β4, which was absent in β4-null cells (lane 2), was readily detected in β4-transduced keratinocytes (lanes 3) at levels comparable with those detected in normal control cells (lane 1). In situ hybridization (performed on epithelial sheets generated by β4-transduced keratinocytes) showed abundant levels of exogenous β4transcripts both in basal and suprabasal β4-corrected cells (Fig. 2E). The suprabasal expression of exogenous β4 transcripts is expected because expression of the transgene is driven by the retroviral long terminal repeat. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both in normal control cells (Fig. 2B) and in β4-corrected keratinocytes (Fig. 2F), the expression of the β4polypeptide was restricted to the basal layer of cultured epidermal sheets. It is possible that, in the absence of its natural α6 partner, exogenous β4 is rapidly degraded in the ER of suprabasal layers.The localization of α6β4 and of other HD components was then investigated in organotypic cultures, namely in conditions allowing the formation of mature HDs. In normal control cultures, α6β4 was clearly concentrated at the basal pole of basal keratinocytes (Fig.3A). As described previously (40Cavani A. Zambruno G. Marconi A. Manca V. Marchetti M. Giannetti A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 600-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in wound healing and in organotypic cultures, a faint labeling of the lateral and apical surfaces of the basal and first suprabasal cell layer was observed (Fig. 3A). The dermal-epidermal junction was also blotted by anti-HD1/plectin (Fig. 3B) and anti-BP180 (not shown) mAbs. In β4-null organotypic cultures, β4 was virtually undetectable (Fig.3C), whereas the α6 subunit was not polarized and was diffusely distributed in the basal keratinocyte cytoplasm (not shown). Similarly, HD1/plectin (Fig. 3D) and BP180 (not shown) were not concentrated at the dermal-epidermal junction but were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of basal keratinocytes. Gene correction of β4-null keratinocytes restored the normal expression pattern of β4 (Fig. 3E), HD1/plectin (Fig. 3F), and BP180 (not shown). Indeed, the level of expression and the localization at the dermal-epidermal junction of the polypeptides were very similar to those observed in normal control cells (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 3Immunofluorescence analysis ofHDcomponents in organotypic skin cultures.A and B, normal control keratinocytes. C and D, β4-null keratinocytes. E and F, β4-corrected cells. Sections of organotypic cultures were stained with an anti-β4 mAb (A, C, and E) and with an anti-HD1/plectin mAb (B,D, and F). Note that in control cells and in β4-corrected keratinocytes, β4 and HD1/plectin were concentrated at the basal pole of basal keratinocytes, clearly delimiting the dermal-epidermal junction. In contrast, in β4-null cells, β4 was undetectable and HD1/plectin staining was mostly pericellular.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The formation of mature HDs was investigated by transmission electron microscopy performed on ultrathin sections of organotypic skin cultures. As shown in Fig. 4, normal control keratinocytes (A) and β4-corrected keratinocytes (B) assembled mature HDs (stars), displaying clearly recognizable sub-basal dense plates and cytoplasmic outer and inner plaques associated with keratin intermediate filaments (arrows) distributed along their basal plasma membrane. In contrast, very few rudimentary HDs, which appeared as small, moderately electron-dense spots almost completely lacking a tripartite structure and association with keratin filaments, could be identified in β4-null keratinocytes (F). Thus, β4-corrected keratinocytes were almost indistinguishable from normal control cells in terms of α6β4 expression, the localization of HD components, and HD structure and density, suggesting that the adhesive properties of β4-null keratinocytes were fully restored.Figure 4Transmission electron microscopy.Ultrastructural examination of the dermal-epidermal junction of organotypic skin cultures showed that, similarly to normal control keratinocytes (A), β4-corrected keratinocytes (B) assemble mature HDs displaying sub-basal dense plates (stars) and outer and inner cytoplasmic plaques associated with bundles of keratin intermediate filaments (arrows). (Anchoring filaments transversing the lamina lucida are also visible, more frequently below the HD.) β 4Y1422F (C) and β 4Y1440F (D) keratinocytes also display HDs (stars), which appear, however, less numerous and smaller with reduction in keratin filament association. More severe HD alterations typify β 4Y1422F/Y1440F keratinocytes (E, at arrow), in which sub-basal dense plates appear greatly attenuated and cytoplasmic inner plaques and keratin filament insertion are almost undetectable. A marked decrease in anchoring filament density is also evident in β4-null and β 4Y1422F/Y1440F keratinocytes.Bar, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of β4 Mutants in Primary β4-null KeratinocytesTo investigate the role of β4 TAM in HD formation and maturation, subconfluent primary cultures of β4-null keratinocytes were stably transduced with replication-defective retroviruses carrying cDNA(s) encoding: (i) β4 with a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-1422 (β 4Y1422F), (ii) β4 with a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-1440 (β 4Y1440F), and (iii) β4with a combined replacement of Tyr-1422 and Tyr-1440 (β 4Y1422F/Y1440F) (Fig.5A). Proviral integration was demonstrated by Southern hybridization (not shown). As shown in Fig.5B, variable levels of the different β4transcripts were detected in transduced β4-null keratinocytes (arrow).Figure 5A, schematic map of the different β4 isoforms used to transduce β4-null keratinocytes.

Equal amounts of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-β4 3E1 mAbs (IP:β4). Eluates were then fractionated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunostained with antisera raised against α6 and β4 (T20 and N20, respectively).

As shown in Fig. 5C, all mutants were able to associate to the α6 subunit (lanes 2–4). It is worth noting that comparable amounts of the α6β4heterodimer were expressed in all transduced keratinocytes (Fig.5C).The exposure of β4 on the keratinocyte plasma membrane was evaluated by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates prepared from surface-radioiodinated cells, using the anti-β4 3E1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 5D, equal amounts of β4 were exposed on the cell surface in normal control cells (lane 1), β4-corrected cells (lane 2), and β4-null cells transduced with different TAM mutants (β 4Y1422F, β 4Y1440F, β 4Y1422F/Y1440F, lanes 3,4, and 5, respectively). These data suggest that the β4 TAM is not essential for the localization of the α6β4 integrin at the keratinocyte plasma membrane.The Role of β4 TAM Domains in HD Formation and MaturationThe localization of β4 mutants and of other HD components as well as the formation of mature HDs were investigated by immunofluorescence and transmission electron-microscopy performed on ultrathin sections of organotypic skin cultures. Immunofluorescence analysis performed on organotypic cultures prepared from β 4Y1422F (Fig.6, A and B), β 4Y1440F (Fig. 6, C andD), and β 4Y1422F/Y1440F(Fig. 6, E and F) keratinocytes showed that β4 mutants (Fig. 6, A, C, andE) and HD1/plectin (Fig. 6, B, D, andF) as well as α6 integrin and BP180 (not shown) were not properly concentrated at the dermal-epidermal junction. Indeed, β4 and HD1/plectin (as well as α6and BP180) staining was clearly pericellular and of variable intensity in most areas. This is in sharp contrast with normal control ce"

The humoral immune response in insects shares some fundamental characteristics with innate immune response of vertebrates in the sense that it apparently lacks specificity and memory, and nevertheless functions with great efficiency against microbial pathogens. This arm of the insect immune response manifests itself by instantaneous overexpression of an array of potent antibacterial proteins and peptides at the time of bacterial infection. These proteins and peptides provide the first line of defense against pathogens. A large number of these peptides and proteins have been isolated, identified, and characterized biochemically (1Mackintosh J.A. Gooley A.A. Karuso P.H. Beattie A.J. Jardine D.R. Veal D.A. Dev. Comp.

Structural studies on the proteins and peptides of the insect immune system are therefore being increasingly addressed. Elaborate spectroscopic studies have been carried out on cecropins and sapecins (14Maget-Dana R. Bonmatin J.M. Hetru C. Ptak M. Maurizot J.C.

The NMR structures of the insect immune peptides such as thanatin, drosomycin, and insect defensin have been elucidated (17Cornet B. Bonmatin J.M. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Ptak M. Vovelle F.

In addition, the crystal structure of hemolin, a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and involved in insect immunity, has been recently determined (20Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of an antibacterial protein from tasar silkworm (Antheraea mylitta) (TSWAB). The expression of TSWAB was induced after Escherichia coli infection of the larvae, leading to the secretion of large quantities of the protein in the hemolymph. Structural fold of this protein resembles c-type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins, and it belongs to the functional class of chicken lysozymes. The comparison of TSWAB structure with respect to the other c-type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins provides structural implications of rapid versus slow molecular evolution.DISCUSSIONThe TSWAB is an E. coli-induced immune protein expressed as a part of humoral immune response in tasar silkworm from the order Lepidoptera. It is truly a protein among those designed for insect immune defense. The chicken lysozyme, on the other hand, is a constitutive antibacterial protein. However, TSWAB has antibacterial activity comparable with that of the chicken lysozyme against Gram-positive bacteria (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of the action of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are expected to be similar. On the other hand, α-lactalbumins are involved in the regulation of lactose synthase activity. As also observed in many other cases, a common molecular scaffold is used for these three apparently different physiological roles (36Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Wang C Xi J Begley T.P. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins with similar fold could also be related phylogenetically. α-Lactalbumins, c-type lysozymes, and insect lysozymes have been implicated to have a common evolutionary precursor (38Katsutoshi N. Shintaro S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).The physiological roles of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are different, considering that one is instantaneously induced on bacterial infection and the other acts constitutively. Because the catalytic residues are structurally conserved between the two proteins and their antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria were comparable (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar), it is likely that TSWAB employs a similar catalytic mechanism as that of chicken lysozyme to cleave its substrate. Correspondingly, the electrostatic potential surfaces in the active site region are also similar. However, a substantial number of other residues that may be important in stabilizing the substrate in the active site are different from those seen at analogous positions in chicken lysozyme. Therefore, there might be differences in levels of specificity between the two enzymes. On the other hand, the surface electrostatic potential in the regions corresponding to the active site defined in chicken lysozyme is remarkably different in human α-lactalbumin. Thus, the correlation of physiological activities of these three proteins sharing common fold can be seen in their surface properties as well, which show obvious gradation in the negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 5).The TSWAB is a lysozyme recruited for immune function. In the case of lepidopteran lysozymes (of which TSWAB is an example), the expression is induced only on infection. Considering the high sequence homology, the structures of other insect lysozymes of induced origin will also be very similar to that of TSWAB. As seen in Fig. 6, the homology of other lysozymes with A. aegypti is relatively less, perhaps because of the fact that the others belong to same order, Lepidoptera, as opposed to A. aegypti, which belongs to Diptera, although it is also of induced immune origin. On the other hand, there are other insect lysozymes, e.g. lysozyme of fruit fly, the expression of which is constitutive. The structure of TSWAB may not represent those members of insect lysozyme family that have different physiological origins and have much lower (40%) sequence identity. Among the residues defining the active site, four are conserved between insect lysozymes of induced origin, which are not conserved with respect to c-lysozymes (Fig. 6). Perhaps these residues may relate to the specific character of the proteins of this group. Measurement of the molecular volumes showed that TSWAB (10570 Å3) is smaller and more compact than the other c-type lysozymes (11,800–12,200 Å3). The primary reason for this is that the loops are shorter in the case of TSWAB. This compactness might impart greater thermal stability to insect lysozymes, as has been seen for other proteins (39Thompson M.J Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Greater stability would also ensure that the protein is physiologically present for a longer duration, which would be important, considering that TSWAB expression is induced and not constitutive.Comparison of the TSWAB structure with those of other c-type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins led to interesting observations concerning molecular evolution that may be of general significance. It has been suggested that α-lactalbumins have evolved from mammalian lysozyme after divergence of the avian and mammalian lineages and have undergone a rapid evolution, leading to acquisition of a new function and loss of lysozyme activity (38Katsutoshi N. Shintaro S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the insect lysozymes diverged earliest from the lineage that led to vertebrate lysozyme and α-lactalbumins. Thus, although the differences in sequences of human α-lactalbumin and TSWAB with respect to chicken lysozyme are comparable, the differences in the corresponding structures are not. Unlike human α-lactalbumin, the structure of TSWAB is significantly different from chicken lysozyme. This is an interesting observation considering the fact that chicken lysozyme shares mechanism of action with TSWAB and not with α-lactalbumin. Apparently, during evolution, TSWAB has undergone structural changes in those parts of the protein that were not involved in the function. Thus, the catalytic residues were selectively conserved and the function was retained. The conservation of function with significant differences in conformation between TSWAB and chicken lysozyme, on one hand, and drastically different function with conserved molecular conformation between α-lactalbumins and c-type lysozymes, on the other, provide an interesting contrast. It appears that structure changes much more slowly during rapid evolution as observed for α-lactalbumins and c-type lysozymes as against that during normal course of evolution as observed between c-type lysozymes and the insect lysozyme.The crystal structure of TSWAB, an antibacterial protein, described here is the first structure belonging to the insect lysozyme family. It represents the structural class corresponding to the induced lysozymes of innate immune origin and provides insights into the functional aspects of this class. Despite the fact that the mechanism of action of TSWAB is likely to be similar to that of chicken lysozyme, it is expressed only on bacterial infection and has significant structural differences as compared to chicken lysozyme. The insect lysozymes diversified from the lineage of chicken lysozyme while retaining the common function, the lactalbumins evolved rapidly resulting in new function. However, structurally chicken lysozyme and α-lactalbumins are closer to each other compared with insect lysozyme, implying that structure is resistant to changes during rapid evolution. Thus, rapid evolution leads to the acquisition of new function by modification of certain critical residues without drastically changing the structure.

The humoral immune response in insects shares some fundamental characteristics with innate immune response of vertebrates in the sense that it apparently lacks specificity and memory, and nevertheless functions with great efficiency against microbial pathogens.

The expression of TSWAB was induced after Escherichia coli infection of the larvae, leading to the secretion of large quantities of the protein in the hemolymph.

DISCUSSIONThe TSWAB is an E. coli-induced immune protein expressed as a part of humoral immune response in tasar silkworm from the order Lepidoptera. It is truly a protein among those designed for insect immune defense. The chicken lysozyme, on the other hand, is a constitutive antibacterial protein. However, TSWAB has antibacterial activity comparable with that of the chicken lysozyme against Gram-positive bacteria (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of the action of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are expected to be similar. On the other hand, α-lactalbumins are involved in the regulation of lactose synthase activity. As also observed in many other cases, a common molecular scaffold is used for these three apparently different physiological roles (36Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Wang C Xi J Begley T.P. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins with similar fold could also be related phylogenetically. α-Lactalbumins, c-type lysozymes, and insect lysozymes have been implicated to have a common evolutionary precursor (38Katsutoshi N. Shintaro S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).The physiological roles of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are different, considering that one is instantaneously induced on bacterial infection and the other acts constitutively. Because the catalytic residues are structurally conserved between the two proteins and their antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria were comparable (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar), it is likely that TSWAB employs a similar catalytic mechanism as that of chicken lysozyme to cleave its substrate. Correspondingly, the electrostatic potential surfaces in the active site region are also similar. However, a substantial number of other residues that may be important in stabilizing the substrate in the active site are different from those seen at analogous positions in chicken lysozyme. Therefore, there might be differences in levels of specificity between the two enzymes. On the other hand, the surface electrostatic potential in the regions corresponding to the active site defined in chicken lysozyme is remarkably different in human α-lactalbumin. Thus, the correlation of physiological activities of these three proteins sharing common fold can be seen in their surface properties as well, which show obvious gradation in the negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 5).The TSWAB is a lysozyme recruited for immune function. In the case of lepidopteran lysozymes (of which TSWAB is an example), the expression is induced only on infection. Considering the high sequence homology, the structures of other insect lysozymes of induced origin will also be very similar to that of TSWAB. As seen in Fig. 6, the homology of other lysozymes with A. aegypti is relatively less, perhaps because of the fact that the others belong to same order, Lepidoptera, as opposed to A. aegypti, which belongs to Diptera, although it is also of induced immune origin. On the other hand, there are other insect lysozymes, e.g. lysozyme of fruit fly, the expression of which is constitutive. The structure of TSWAB may not represent those members of insect lysozyme family that have different physiological origins and have much lower (40%) sequence identity. Among the residues defining the active site, four are conserved between insect lysozymes of induced origin, which are not conserved with respect to c-lysozymes (Fig. 6). Perhaps these residues may relate to the specific character of the proteins of this group. Measurement of the molecular volumes showed that TSWAB (10570 Å3) is smaller and more compact than the other c-type lysozymes (11,800–12,200 Å3). The primary reason for this is that the loops are shorter in the case of TSWAB. This compactness might impart greater thermal stability to insect lysozymes, as has been seen for other proteins (39Thompson M.J Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Greater stability would also ensure that the protein is physiologically present for a longer duration, which would be important, considering that TSWAB expression is induced and not constitutive.Comparison of the TSWAB structure with those of other c-type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins led to interesting observations concerning molecular evolution that may be of general significance. It has been suggested that α-lactalbumins have evolved from mammalian lysozyme after divergence of the avian and mammalian lineages and have undergone a rapid evolution, leading to acquisition of a new function and loss of lysozyme activity (38Katsutoshi N. Shintaro S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the insect lysozymes diverged earliest from the lineage that led to vertebrate lysozyme and α-lactalbumins. Thus, although the differences in sequences of human α-lactalbumin and TSWAB with respect to chicken lysozyme are comparable, the differences in the corresponding structures are not. Unlike human α-lactalbumin, the structure of TSWAB is significantly different from chicken lysozyme. This is an interesting observation considering the fact that chicken lysozyme shares mechanism of action with TSWAB and not with α-lactalbumin. Apparently, during evolution, TSWAB has undergone structural changes in those parts of the protein that were not involved in the function. Thus, the catalytic residues were selectively conserved and the function was retained. The conservation of function with significant differences in conformation between TSWAB and chicken lysozyme, on one hand, and drastically different function with conserved molecular conformation between α-lactalbumins and c-type lysozymes, on the other, provide an interesting contrast. It appears that structure changes much more slowly during rapid evolution as observed for α-lactalbumins and c-type lysozymes as against that during normal course of evolution as observed between c-type lysozymes and the insect lysozyme.The crystal structure of TSWAB, an antibacterial protein, described here is the first structure belonging to the insect lysozyme family. It represents the structural class corresponding to the induced lysozymes of innate immune origin and provides insights into the functional aspects of this class. Despite the fact that the mechanism of action of TSWAB is likely to be similar to that of chicken lysozyme, it is expressed only on bacterial infection and has significant structural differences as compared to chicken lysozyme. The insect lysozymes diversified from the lineage of chicken lysozyme while retaining the common function, the lactalbumins evolved rapidly resulting in new function. However, structurally chicken lysozyme and α-lactalbumins are closer to each other compared with insect lysozyme, implying that structure is resistant to changes during rapid evolution. Thus, rapid evolution leads to the acquisition of new function by modification of certain critical residues without drastically changing the structure. The TSWAB is an E. coli-induced immune protein expressed as a part of humoral immune response in tasar silkworm from the order Lepidoptera. It is truly a protein among those designed for insect immune defense. The chicken lysozyme, on the other hand, is a constitutive antibacterial protein. However, TSWAB has antibacterial activity comparable with that of the chicken lysozyme against Gram-positive bacteria (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of the action of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are expected to be similar. On the other hand, α-lactalbumins are involved in the regulation of lactose synthase activity. As also observed in many other cases, a common molecular scaffold is used for these three apparently different physiological roles (36Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Wang C Xi J Begley T.P. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins with similar fold could also be related phylogenetically. α-Lactalbumins, c-type lysozymes, and insect lysozymes have been implicated to have a common evolutionary precursor (38Katsutoshi N. Shintaro S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of TSWAB and chicken lysozyme are different, considering that one is instantaneously induced on bacterial infection and the other acts constitutively. Because the catalytic residues are structurally conserved between the two proteins and their antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria were comparable (21Nagaraju J. Abraham E.G. Sethuraman B.N. Datta R.K. Akai H. Kato Y. Kiuchi M. Inouchi J. Wild Silkmoth '92. International Society for Wild Silkmoths, Tokyo, Japan1992: 22-30Google Scholar), it is likely that TSWAB employs a similar catalytic mechanism as that of chicken lysozyme to cleave its substrate. Correspondingly, the electrostatic potential surfaces in the active site region are also similar. However, a substantial number of other residues that may be important in stabilizing the substrate in the active site are different from those seen at analogous positions in chicken lysozyme. Therefore, there might be differences in levels of specificity between the two enzymes. On the other hand, the surface electrostatic potential in the regions corresponding to the active site defined in chicken lysozyme is remarkably different in human α-lactalbumin. Thus, the correlation of physiological activities of these three proteins sharing common fold can be seen in their surface properties as well, which show obvious gradation in the negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 5). The TSWAB is a lysozyme recruited for immune function. In the case of lepidopteran lysozymes (of which TSWAB is an example), the expression is induced only on infection. Considering the high sequence homology, the structures of other insect lysozymes of induced origin will also be very similar to that of TSWAB. As seen in Fig. 6, the homology of other lysozymes with A. aegypti is relatively less, perhaps because of the fact that the others belong to same order, Lepidoptera, as opposed to A. aegypti, which belongs to Diptera, although it is also of induced immune origin. On the other hand, there are other insect lysozymes, e.g. lysozyme of fruit fly, the expression of which is constitutive. The structure of TSWAB may not represent those members of insect lysozyme family that have different physiological origins and have much lower (40%) sequence identity. Among the residues defining the active site, four are conserved between insect lysozymes of induced origin, which are not conserved with respect to c-lysozymes (Fig. 6). Perhaps these residues may relate to the specific character of the proteins of this group. Measurement of the molecular volumes showed that TSWAB (10570 Å3) is smaller and more compact than the other c-type lysozymes (11,800–12,200 Å3). The primary reason for this is that the loops are shorter in the case of TSWAB. This compactness might impart greater thermal stability to insect lysozymes, as has been seen for other proteins (39Thompson M.J Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Greater stability would also ensure that the protein is physiologically present for a longer duration, which would be important, considering that TSWAB expression is induced and not constitutive.

In particular, phosphorylation of acidic clusters in the cytosolic domains of proteins such as furin (6Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G.

For furin, the binding of both adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS-1) is increased by casein kinase II (CKII)-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser residues located within an acidic cluster (Fig. 1A) (18Dittie A.S.

Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the cytosolic domain of PAM, the region located between Lys953 and Lys971 is extremely acidic, forming a PEST motif, with Thr959 and Ser961 identified as potential phosphorylation sites (NetPhos 2.0 Prediction, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/). However, truncation of PAM-1 at Ser961, which interrupts the acidic cluster, yields a protein that is trafficked normally (20Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of an acidic cluster has not been demonstrated to be important in PAM trafficking. When membrane PAM is expressed in the neuroendocrine cell line, AtT-20, it is efficiently cleaved in the secretory pathway to yield soluble peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and membrane peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL). Although intact membrane PAM exhibits both enzymatic activities, soluble PHM has a turnover number severalfold higher than intact PAM, revealing a regulatory role for the COOH-terminal regions of PAM (21Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of membrane PAM and PAL accumulates in a distal region of thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) at steady state, although some of the protein is located in secretory granules (22Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small amount of PAM expressed on the surface of AtT-20 cells at steady state undergoes rapid internalization and is recycled to the TGN via perinuclear endosomes. The internalized protein may undergo lysosomal degradation or be packaged into new granules (11Steveson T.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

PAM is phosphorylated on multiple residues in its cytosolic COOH-terminal domain (CD) (10Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Test tube assays utilizing recombinant PAM-CD were used to determine that protein kinase A phosphorylates Ser921 and protein kinase C phosphorylates Ser932 and Ser937 (10Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser937 to Ala937 or Asp937demonstrated that the inability to phosphorylate Ser937limits the secretion of soluble PHM and increases the turnover rate of newly synthesized PAM-1 (11Steveson T.C.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of PAM-1 at Ser937 directs the protein away from lysosomes after internalization from the cell surface, whereas dephosphorylation of this site is needed for a later step in the endocytic pathway (10Yun H.Y.

The novel protein kinase, PAM cytosolicinteractor protein-2 (P-CIP2), selectively phosphorylates Ser949 in the CD of PAM (25Caldwell B.D. Darlington D.N. Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E.

P-CIP2 interacts with the CD of PAM at several sites that are closer to the transmembrane domain than Ser949 (25Caldwell B.D. Darlington D.N. Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

Mutation of the PAM-CD at these juxtamembrane sites eliminates the ability of PAM to bind tightly to P-CIP2 and eliminates the ability of PAM to modify regulated secretion (26Alam M.R. Steveson T.C. Johnson R.C. Back N. Abraham B. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutations do not eliminate the ability of PAM to be phosphorylated by P-CIP2 (25Caldwell B.D. Darlington D.N. Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34646-34656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since Ser949lies within a fairly acidic region of the PAM-CD (Fig. 1), this raised the possibility that this region functions as an acidic cluster in PAM trafficking. Therefore, our goals were to identify sites where CKII phosphorylates the CD of PAM and to determine whether these sites could be involved in mediating PAM trafficking. In this study, we identified Thr946 and Ser949 (Fig. 1) as sites phosphorylated by sea star CKII. We then explored the roles of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of these sites in the biosynthetic and endocytic trafficking of PAM-1 by mutating Thr946 and Ser949 (Fig. 1) to Ala946 and Ala949 or to Asp946 and Asp949. Mutant PAM proteins were expressed in AtT-20 cells to evaluate their biosynthesis, catalytic activity, steady-state localization, and internalization. Purified, recombinant rat PAM-CD (Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gln-Met-Gly-Arg-Ile-Pro-rPAM-1(898–976)) (40 µg) was incubated with 0.4 µg of CKII from sea star,Pisaster ochraceus (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), in 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0) buffer containing 10 mm ATP and 100 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 2 h (37 °C). The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide was bound to a C18 SepPak cartridge, washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The dried eluate was redissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.5) and digested with endoproteinase LysC (2.0 µg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h at 37 °C. The lyophilized sample was applied to a series of Bio-Sil TSK-DEAE (Bio-Rad) columns equilibrated and eluted in 32% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The single major peak of labeled material included in the column was pooled and dried before application to a Bio-Sil TSK-DEAE column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) containing 30% acetonitrile. This column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25 mNaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), and 30% acetonitrile. The phosphopeptides were pooled and dried before desalting on the Bio-Sil TSK-DEAE columns. The labeled Bio-Sil TSK-DEAE eluates were covalently linked to arylamine membranes (Sequelon-AA; Waters Instruments) for Edman degradation sequencing in an ABI model 477A instrument. The sequencer was configured to divide the successive phenylthiohydantoin fractions, 40% for on-line high pressure liquid chromatography detection, and 60% for determination of 32P radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. pBluescript plasmids encoding either PAM-1 with Thr946 and Ser949 mutated to Ala946 and Ala949 or to Asp946 and Asp949 were made using SOEing polymerase chain reaction (27Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification for both constructs involved an upstream sense primer (rPAM-1(2954–3250)) and mutagenic antisense primers with codons (underlined) either for Ala946 and Ala949(5′-GCCCCCTCTGCGCTCACTCGG -3′) or for Asp946 and Asp949(5′-CATCCCCTCGTCGCTCACTCGG-3′) and mutagenic sense primers for Ala946 and Ala949(5′-GAGCGCAGAGGGGGCTGACCAAGAG-3′) or for Asp946 and Asp949(5′-GAGCGACGAGGGGGATGACCAAGAG-3′) and T7 antisense primers. pBS.KrPAM-1 TS/AA and pBS.KrPAM-1 TS/DD were both made by inserting the final respective amplified fragment into pBS.KrPAM-1 using the restriction enzymes HindIII andXmaI. The DNA regions derived from polymerase chain reaction were verified by sequencing. Constructs were placed into the pCI.neo mammalian expression vector (Promega Corp.) using SalI andNotI cloning sites. AtT-20 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Sigma) with either pCI.neo.KrPAM-1/T946A/S949A (TS/AA) or pCI.neo.KrPAM-1/T946D/S949D (TS/DD) (10Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J.

Medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 was used for selection and maintenance of transfected cells.

A peptide, Asp942-Arg-Val-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gly-(P)Ser949-Asp-Gln-Glu-Lys953(Fig. 1, italics), from the cytosolic domain of PAM was synthesized with an NH2-terminal Cys residue using monobenzyl-protected Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) phospho-Ser. The peptide was purified as a monomer and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) with glutaraldehyde or with maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydrosysuccinimide ester. Two rabbits were immunized by Covance (Denver, PA) using an equal mixture of the two conjugates. Serum (JH2541) was depleted of antibody against the non-phosphorylated PAM-1(942–953) peptide by incubation with Affi-Gel 10 to which non-phosphorylated peptide had been linked. The titer and specificity of the P-Ser949 antibody (JH2541) were determined with a solid phase assay using the synthetic peptides PAM-1(942–953) and PAM-1(942–953)P-Ser949. The depleted phosphoserine specific antibody, JH2541, was used at a dilution of 1:250. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously using 4% paraformaldehyde or 100% methanol (24Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For experiments with the microtubule destabilizing drug, nocodazole (Sigma), cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and grown for 36 h before incubation for 20 min in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) (37 °C). The cells were then incubated in CSFM containing 10 µm nocodazole for 20 min (37 °C) before fixation in 100% ice-cold methanol. Following fixation, the cells were blocked with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer, before incubation with the exon A and syntaxin 6 antibodies. Visualization was done using a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were observed under epifluorescence optics on a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, MT). Cells were photographed and analyzed with a Princeton Instruments Micromax digital camera. Antisera to PAL or exon A (JH471 or JH629; diluted 1:50) were used as described (11Steveson T.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were incubated with antiserum at different temperatures (4, 20, or 37 °C) and chased in antibody-free CSFM without sodium bicarbonate (CSFM-Air) for various lengths of time to trap the internalized PAM-antibody complexes in either early or late stages of internalization (29Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). Nocodazole was dissolved in CSFM-Air and used at a concentration of 10 µm. After incubation with exon A antiserum (1:50), for 1 h at 20 °C to load early and late endosomes with PAM-antibody complexes, cells were rinsed in antibody-free CSFM, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated with 10 µm nocodazole for 60 min before fixation and double immunostaining with the syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody. The CKII inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; Calbiochem) (30Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was dissolved in CSFM-Air. AtT-20 PAM-1 cells were incubated with exon A antiserum for 30 min (20 °C) to load early and late endosomes with PAM-antibody complexes before the addition of 100 µm DRB to the medium (30 min; 20 °C). The medium was then replaced with 37 °C antibody-free CSFM-Air containing 100 µm DRB for either 30 or 60 min before fixation and immunostaining. Stably transfected AtT-20 cells were plated in triplicate on poly-l-lysine-coated culture plates. Prior to the experiment, cells were incubated in three changes of CSFM-Air over 1.5 h. Basal collections of medium were for 30 min each; these were followed by one 30-min collection in the presence of 1 mm BaCl2 (31Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A. Bao C. Kozlovsky C.

Collected medium was centrifuged after addition of protease inhibitors. Cells were extracted in 20 mm sodiumN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 10 mm mannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). To measure PHM activity, aliquots of medium or cell extracts were assayed using 0.5 µm CuSO4, 0.5 mmascorbate, 0.5 µm Ac-Tyr-Val-Gly, trace amounts of125I-labeled Ac-Tyr-Val-Gly, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, and 150 mm NaMES (pH 5.5) (32Eipper B.A. Quon A.S.

One confluent well of a 6-well dish from each of the three stably transfected AtT-20 cell lines was grown for 2 days before preincubation in 500 µl of CSFM-Air for 5 min (37 °C). The cells were then incubated on ice in ice-cold buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7 and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors (30 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 16 µg/ml benzamidine, 5 µg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor) and 1% Triton X-100 (500 µl) added (15 min) (31Ratovitski E.A.

Aliquots (200 µl) from the supernatant of each cell type were further fractionated on 2 ml of 5–20% linear sucrose gradients buffered to pH 7.5 or pH 5.5 with the PIPES buffer minus detergent. A 50% sucrose “pad” (169 µl) was placed at the bottom of each gradient, and the following molecular weight markers (50–250 µg) were used as internal standards: cytochrome c, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, catalase, and apoferritin (Sigma). Gradients were centrifuged in a Ti-55 swinging bucket rotor in a TL-100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) for 5 h (4 °C) at 50,000 rpm (214,000 × g). Fractions (169 µl) from each gradient were collected from the top to the bottom and particulate matter at the bottom of the gradient was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blot using the exon A antibody, and molecular weight markers were visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A 100-mm dish of confluent AtT-20 PAM-1 cells was extracted as described above (31Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A. Bao C. Kozlovsky C. Hand T.A. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E.

Aliquots (200 µl) from the supernatant were incubated with 10 µl of the exon A antibody or the P-Ser949 antibody for 90 min (4 °C). Following centrifugation of the immunoprecipitates at 10,000 × g (20 min), they were incubated with 60 µl of protein A coated in 0.25% bovine serum albumin (60 min). Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled into 200 µl of sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot with the exon A antibody. The use of twice as much P-Ser949 antibody and exon A antibody immunoprecipitated the same amount of PAM. Cell extracts, immunoprecipitates, and sucrose gradient samples were fractionated on polyacrylamide (10, 15, or 4–15%), 0.25%N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide/SDS gels (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) were visualized with one of several primary antisera and the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Kit: PAL (JH471; 1:1000), PHM (JH1764; 1:1000), exon A (JH629; 1:1000), or P-Ser949 (JH2541, 1:250) (21Husten E.J.

By using [35S]Met labeling mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or [32P]PO43−, cells were metabolically labeled, and pulse-chase experiments were performed (10Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T.

Ice-cold 20 mm sodiumN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 10 mm mannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) buffer with protease inhibitors plus protein phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate and 50 mm NaF) was used for cell extraction. Immunoprecipitates were prepared as described (10Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J.

Phosphorylation of recombinant PAM-CD was carried out as described (25Caldwell B.D. Darlington D.N. Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34646-34656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reaction volume was 30 µl and consisted of the following reagents: kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5), 0.1% Thesit); 5 µg of recombinant PAM-CD; ± 100 µm DRB; purified recombinant P-CIP2, CKII (Calbiochem), or protein kinase A (Calbiochem); and 1 or 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Since acidic clusters often play a crucial role in the trafficking of membrane proteins and may serve as sites for phosphorylation by CKII, we wanted to determine whether the cytosolic domain of PAM is a substrate for CKII. Purified recombinant PAM-CD incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and sea star CKII underwent phosphorylation primarily on Ser residues (data not shown). To identify the phosphorylation sites(s), endoproteinase LysC-digested samples were subjected to gel filtration. The single major peak observed was then applied to an anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography resin, yielding two major peaks, A and B (Fig.1 B). Edman degradation of each peak yielded NH2-terminal sequences commencing with Gly940-Phe941-; [32P] was released from peak A primarily at cycle 10, which corresponded to Ser949, whereas [32P] was released from peak B at both cycles 7 and 10, corresponding to Thr946 and Ser949 (Fig. 1 C). To investigate the role of phosphorylation at these two sites, vectors encoding PAM-1 in which both residues were mutated to Ala (PAM-1 TS/AA) or to Asp (PAM-1 TS/DD) were created and individually transfected into AtT-20 cells. The steady state localization of each mutant PAM-1 protein in AtT-20 cells was compared with that of PAM-1. As shown previously, wild-type PAM-1 was localized in the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 2A, top panel, wide arrows) in a compact structure identified as the TGN on the basis of immunoelectron microscopy (11Steveson T.C.

Acid titration spectra show that the second group protonating with Asp85 is revealed in E204Q in the absence of Cl− but is not observed in the triple mutant E9Q/E194Q/E204Q or in the quadruple mutant E9Q/E74Q/E194Q/E204Q. The results point to Glu9 as the second group protonating cooperatively with Asp85. Comparison of the apparent pKa of Asp85 protonation in water and in the deionized forms and results of calcium titration suggest that cation-binding sites are of low affinity in the multiple Glu mutants. Like for deionized wild type bacteriorhodopsin, differential scanning calorimetry reveals a lack of the pretransition in the multiple mutants, whereas in E9Q it appears at lower temperature and with lower cooperativity. Additionally, at neutral pH the band at 630 nm arising from cation release upon temperature increase is absent for the multiple mutants. Based on these results, we propose the presence of two cation-binding sites in the extracellular region of bacteriorhodopsin having as ligands Glu9, Glu194, Glu204, and water molecules.

An important achievement has been the description of several water molecules in the extracellular region, forming a hydrogen-bonded network with key residues (2Belrhali H. Nollert P. Royant A.

The role of Asp85 in the extracellular region is not limited to be the first acceptor of the Schiff base proton. According to a coupling model, protonation of Asp85 induces the deprotonation of the proton release group through a relationship existing between their pKa values (7Balashov S.P. Govindjee R.

Although this model is useful in understanding protonation/deprotonation mutual influences between ionizable groups, it cannot give the answer about the exact mechanism of proton transfer steps. In fact, several important questions remain still elusive. One of these refers to the identity of the assemblies involved in proton release, the proton release group. Recent studies suggest that it is a complex including at least Glu194, Glu204, and some water molecules (9Rammelsberg R. Huhn G. Lübben M. Gerwert K.

It should be noted, however, that these two Glu side chains do not behave equivalently, as demonstrated by the inhibition of the second increase of the Asp85 pKa during the photocycle in the E194Q mutant but not in the E204Q mutant (12Lazarova T. Sanz C. Querol E. Padrós E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2022-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This is a clear indication that Glu194 forms part of X′H, the group coupled to the Asp85 pKa.From the time when the presence of divalent cations in the purple membrane was described, numerous efforts have been devoted to identify their role and location (13–26). Some authors claim a nonspecific location of the cations in the double layer (18Szundi I. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 286: 861-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which detected the presence of charges and polarized water molecules in some locations of their structure.Recently we have described some spectral and functional properties of the quadruple mutant E9Q/E74Q/E194Q/E204Q (4Glu), including high hydroxylamine and Cl− accessibility to the Schiff base environment and severalfold decreased effect of Ca2+ on the regeneration of the purple color of deionized 4Glu (36Sanz C.

These results suggest a more open structure for the extracellular region of the 4Glu mutant and reduced affinity of cations for the color-controlling binding site(s) as compared with wild type. Therefore, we proposed that the extracellular Glu side chains could be involved in cation binding and in the maintenance of the correct protein structure. To get further insight on the role of extracellular Glu side chains in these issues, as well as in proton transport, in this work we study BR mutants in which the extracellular Glu have been substituted by Gln. Even if these changes are very conservative, Gln cannot deprotonate on one hand and has a reduced capability of forming hydrogen bonds on the other (37Jeffrey G.A. Saenger W. Hydrogen Bonding in Biological Structures. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1994: 459-486Crossref Google Scholar). Although some characteristics of these mutants (especially E194Q and E204Q) have already been published (11Balashov S.P. Lu M. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Othersen III, B. Chen Y.

Finally, we propose a model of cation binding in the extracellular region, involved in protein structure and function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe construction of the mutants and their expression inHalobacterium salinarum was done as described previously (12Lazarova T. Sanz C. Querol E. Padrós E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2022-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Sanz C. Lazarova T. Sepulcre F. González-Moreno R. Bourdelande J.-L. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutagenized membranes were isolated as purple membrane sheets according to Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius (41Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Deionized membranes were obtained by dialyzing the samples against a cation exchange resin (Dowex-50W). All manipulations of deionized samples were done using well rinsed plastic materials. Concentration of deionized samples was calculated by the method of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modified for membrane proteins (43Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary3-Bio spectrophotometer in the 250–800-nm range. To avoid light-scattering artifacts, an integrating sphere was used.The pH of purple and deionized membranes (at a concentration of 1.5–2.0 × 10−5m) was adjusted by microadditions of NaOH, HCl, or H2SO4solutions. To avoid contamination, pH adjustment of deionized samples was done using duplicates. All experiments were performed in the dark using dark-adapted samples. Because of abnormal dark adaptation kinetics of the E194Q, 3Glu, and 4Glu mutants (36Sanz C. Lazarova T. Sepulcre F. González-Moreno R. Bourdelande J.-L. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the samples were kept in the dark for about 25 days.Absorbance changes at 630 nm as a function of pH were used to monitor the purple-to-blue transition. Experimental points were normalized with respect to the largest value at 630 nm and fitted to the Boltzmann equation.Calcium binding experiments were done in darkness with deionized samples adjusted to pH 4–4.5. Absorbance changes induced by the addition of small quantities of calcium were monitored spectrophotometrically. BR concentration was in the 1.5–2 × 10−5m range.DSC experiments were performed using a Micro-Cal MC2 instrument. The samples were dialyzed previously in water adjusted at pH 6.5–7, giving a final concentration of 1.5–2 mg/ml. Experiments were done under 1.7 atm nitrogen pressure to avoid sample evaporation at high temperatures. Scanning speed was set at 1.5 K/min. Three thermograms were registered for each sample. The first informs about the heat released or taken by the protein upon temperature increase. After cooling down to room temperature, second and a third thermograms were run to check the reversibility of the transitions. Two corrections were applied to the first thermogram: (i) subtraction of the second thermogram, which acts as a blank, and (ii) subtraction of the chemical base line using the Takahashi and Sturtevant method (44Takahashi K. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6185-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Tm was defined as the point where the Cp value is maximal.Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out on dark-adapted samples in H2O and pH 7.0 by following changes in the UV-visible absorption spectra upon temperature increase. Spectra were taken every 5 °C in the range 250–800 nm, starting at 20 °C and allowing 8 min for stabilization at each temperature. BR concentration was 1 × 10−5m.RESULTSSpectral Behavior of Extracellular Glu Mutants upon Acidification: the Purple-to-Blue TransitionAs has been widely described, acidification of purple membrane samples causes the formation of the blue form, because of Asp85 protonation (45Subramaniam S. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 46Metz G. Siebert F. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig.1(A and B) shows the absorbance and difference spectra of the dark-adapted E74Q mutant in 150 mm KCl upon acidification of the medium from pH 5.7 to 2.1. As in wild type, the difference spectra of E74Q reveal the presence of two isosbestic points at about 620 and 578 nm. The isosbestic point at about 620 nm reflects a transition that produces a small band broadening in the red edge of the spectrum and a small blue shift (47Mowery P. Lozier R. Chae Q. Tseng Y.W. Taylor M. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 48Váró G. Lanyi J.K. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), yielding the so-called BRacid form. The second isosbestic point at 578 nm corresponds to the red shift of the spectrum because of protonation of Asp85, giving the principal transition (the purple-to-blue transition). Similar spectral changes upon pH decrease are obtained for E74Q in H2O and for dark-adapted E9Q and E194Q single mutants in 150 mm KCl or in H2O (not shown).Acidification of the dark-adapted E204Q mutant reveals more complex spectral changes. Whereas in 150 mm KCl a similar behavior to wild type is obtained, in H2O or in 75 mmNa2SO4 where Cl− ions are not present, the absorption maximum undergoes a small blue shift and band broadening in both sides (Fig. 1, C and D). This gives rise to two positive bands at 640 and 460 nm in the difference spectra (Fig. 1D). Further decrease of the pH leads to the main transition, where all species are converted to the blue form. This produces a positive band at 628 nm and a negative band at 538 nm.Titration of deionized wild type and deionized forms of the single mutants E9Q, E74Q, and E194Q by increasing the pH from 4 (the initial pH after deionization) to 8 gives only one isosbestic point at 577 nm in the difference spectra (Fig.2A for the spectra of deionized E9Q). However, titration of deionized E204Q shows not only that the red form persists but also that it is better distinguished than in the presence of Na2SO4 (Fig.2B). Thus, E204Q is unique among wild type and the single Glu mutants, in that titration of the deionized sample displays changes in the protonation state of more than one group. Moreover, the λmax never reaches 603 nm in any of the condition examined (not shown).Figure 2Purple-to-blue transition of dark-adaptedBRmutants.A, curves 1–7, difference spectra between the sample at pHi minus the sample at pH 8.8 of deionized E9Q, where pHi is 7.6, 6.9, 6.5, 5.6, 5.3, 5.0, and 3.6.

The difference spectra of 3Glu or 4Glu mutants do not show the red band at about 460 nm in any of the conditions analyzed (salt, H2O, deionized; see Fig. 2C for difference spectra of 3Glu in 75 mm Na2SO4). However, acidification of the E194Q/E204Q mutant in Na2SO4 or in water gives rise to the red band (Fig. 2D), arising from a small blue shift and broadening of the absorption band, similar to the single E204Q mutant.Determination of the Apparent Asp85 pKaAs is known, the plot of the absorbance increase at 630 nm as a function of pH yields the apparent pKa of Asp85 (45Subramaniam S. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 46Metz G. Siebert F. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Table Ishows the calculated values for pKa of Asp85for all mutants and wild type in three different conditions: 150 mm KCl, water, and deionized membranes. Values for the Asp85 pKa similar to those found in the presence of 150 mm KCl were obtained upon titration in 75 mm Na2SO4 (not shown). In low salt concentration (150 mm KCl) all single mutants gave similar values (pKa ∼ 2.7, although E194Q shows slightly lower pKa), whereas the pKavalues of the multiple mutants are elevated (around one unit above wild type). In water, the absence of ions in the medium induces more negative electrical surface potential and increased proton concentration, giving rise to increased an apparent pKa value as compared with the salt-containing samples. In water, all samples give higher pKavalues as compared with the same samples in salt, except the E74Q mutant (pKa about 2.8, similar to that in salt). Multiple mutants E194Q/E204Q and 4Glu have an identical and elevated pKa of 4.7, whereas 3Glu has a pKa of 5.2 (Table I).Table IApparent Asp85 pKa of dark-adapted wild type bacteriorhodopsin and extracellular Glu mutants determined by spectrophotometric titration in different salt conditionsSample150 mmKClH2ODeionizedΔDei-H2O1-aDifference between Asp85 pKa in deionized samples and in H2O.

These values indicate the relative differences in cation binding among the BR samples. Open table in a new tab Analysis of deionized membrane samples permit the evaluation of the effect of mutations themselves over the Asp85pKa, regardless of the presence or absence of endogenous cations. Additionally, comparison of the sample properties in water with those of deionized form allows estimation of the effects of the endogenous cations. As Table I shows, all deionized mutants give slightly lower pKa values as compared with deionized wild type, except for E9Q, which presents an increased pKa of 6.0. On the other hand, the absence of endogenous cations in the deionized form as compared with the sample in water cause an increase of the pKa of more than 2 pH units for wild type (13Chang C.H. Chen J.G. Govindjee R. Ebrey T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 49Kimura Y. Ikegami A. Stoeckenius W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 40: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and similar values for the single mutants except for E204Q. It is noteworthy that the multiple mutants exhibit differences of less than 1 pH unit between pKavalues of the deionized form and in water. This suggests that the nondeionized forms of these samples have low content of endogenous cations, thus affecting only slightly the apparent Asp85pKa in comparison with deionized sample.Addition of Calcium to Deionized BacteriorhodopsinWhen calcium or some other cations are added to blue deionized samples, the purple form of bacteriorhodopsin is recovered, because of the deprotonation of Asp85 (13Chang C.H.

Fig.3A shows typical difference spectra obtained upon calcium addition to the wild type blue form. The presence of only one isosbestic point at 578 nm strongly indicates that only the deprotonation of Asp85 is involved in the process, leading to a sigmoidal curve in the plot of absorbance change as a function of pCa (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Calcium titration of deionized blue membranes.A, curves 1–7, difference spectra of deionized wild type incubated with different amounts of Ca2+ (Ca2+/BRi) minus deionized wild type, at pH 5.

As can be seen, the most drastic changes in Ca2+ binding, as compared with wild type are obtained for the multiple mutants where the quadruple mutant 4Glu needs more than 10 Ca2+/BR molecule, 3Glu needs about 8 Ca2+/BR, and E194Q/E204Q needs 3.5 Ca2+/BR.

Fig. 4shows thermograms of extracellular mutants in H2O, obtained after correction for instrumental and chemical base lines (see “Experimental Procedures”). A known feature of the thermal scan of native purple membranes is the presence of two transitions (51Jackson M.B. Sturtevant J.M.

The main transition at about 98 °C accounts for the destruction of the helical interactions within the protein and retinal release. The small and reversible pretransition at about 80 °C has been interpreted as resulting from disorganization of the hexagonal para-crystalline arrangement (51Jackson M.B. Sturtevant J.M.

The components of the CO-oxidizing (coo) regulon, which are produced only in the presence of exogenous CO, are encoded by two operons, and their expression is controlled by CooA, a transcriptional activator that binds CO under reducing conditions and is itself expressed constitutively from an adjacent operon (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) superfamily of transcriptional activator proteins. All three proteins are homodimers when competent to bind DNA, and the structures of CooA and CRP reveal effector-binding and DNA-binding domains in each monomer. The structure of CooA in the reduced (FeII) form has been solved recently (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and revealed that the general folding topology of CO-free CooA and cAMP-bound CRP (9Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) were similar (see Fig. 1below). In the case of CRP, only the effector (cAMP)-bound structure has been solved (9Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and for CooA, only the effector (CO)-free structure is known (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Significant differences were observed in the positions of the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins. However, because both proteins bind to similar DNA sequences (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it is assumed that the DNA-binding regions of the effector (CO)-bound form of CooA should adopt a roughly similar orientation compared with that of effector (cAMP)-bound CRP (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This suggests that a rotation of ∼180° of the recognition helices occurs in CooA upon effector binding (see Fig. 1). In CooA, CO binds to the heme in the effector-binding domain and causes a conformational change that subsequently positions the DNA-binding domain to interact effectively with target DNA. Some CooA variants have been described with varying levels of effector-independent activity (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These have been referred to as “CooA*” by analogy to the variants of CRP (denoted CRP* (11Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) with cAMP-independent activity. In CooA, some of the substitutions with this phenotype affect the heme region directly (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas others affect residues in and around the long “C helices” (Fig. 1) that form the dimer interface. 2R. L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10840-10845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). RNAP (Fig. 2) consists of two molecules of the α subunit, one molecule each of the β and β′ subunits, and one of several ς subunits. The α subunit can be further divided into an N-terminal domain (α-NTD) and a C-terminal domain (α-CTD), which are joined by a flexible linker. These domains, along with the ς subunit, have distinct functions in transcription activation through specific interactions with activator proteins. CRP is known to activate transcription in distinct ways at three different classes of promoters (classes I, II, and III (14Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar)). At class II CRP-dependent promoters, CRP binds to a site centered around −41.5 in which the CRP-binding site overlaps the −35 promoter element. At these promoters (Fig. 2), the “upstream” subunit of CRP contacts the RNAP α-CTD through activating region 1 (AR1), whereas the “downstream” subunit of CRP contacts RNAP α-NTD through a second surface termed AR2 (Figs. 1 and 2). The AR2 of CRP is comprised of a surface patch of negatively charged amino acid residues in the effector-binding domain that interacts with a positively charged patch of amino acids on the α-NTD of RNAP (15Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). AR2 primarily affects the rate of isomerization from a “closed” to an “open” promoter complex (15Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). AR3 is known to be important for FNR function at class II promoters (18Bell A. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but it apparently exists in a non-functional “cryptic” form in CRP (16Rhodius V.A. Busby S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A functional AR3 can be created in CRP by point mutations that change Lys52 to a neutral or negatively charged residue (19Williams R. Bell A. Sims G. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6705-6712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Bell A. Gaston K. Williams R. Chapman K. Kolb A. Buc H. Minchin S. Williams J. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7243-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). AR3 of CRP is a surface-exposed β-turn region (named the “4/5 loop”; Fig. 1) in the effector-binding domain comprised of predominantly negatively charged residues (16Rhodius V.A. Busby S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which interacts with a positively charged surface patch on the ς subunit (17Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P. Busby S. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CooA activates transcription at PcooF when expressed heterologously in vivo inEscherichia coli (21Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that CooA can interact withE. coli RNA polymerase at PcooF in vitro, dependent on CO and the α-CTD of RNAP (13He Y.

Furthermore, studies using RNAP variants with single substitutions in the α-CTD revealed that the contacts between CooA and the E. coli α-CTD are similar but not identical to those between CRP and α-CTD at class II promoters (13He Y.

Because the CooA target sites, PcooF (13He Y. Gaal T. Karls R. Donohue T.J. Gourse R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are typical of class II-dependent promoters, comparison of potential CooA·RNAP interaction sites with those that are known for CRP and FNR will suggest general properties of the CRP/FNR/CooA family in terms of RNAP interactions. This work characterizes the AR2 and AR3 regions of CooA, with implications for the properties of the CRP/FNR superfamily of activator proteins. The construction of E. colistrains expressing WT CooA and CooA variants and strains containing a chromosomal β-galactosidase reporter system was described previously (21Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Site-directed variants were constructed in a pKK223-3-based plasmid expression system as described previously (21Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Random mutations affecting the effector-binding domain (residues 1–131) of CooA variants H77E and H77K were created using error-prone polymerase chain reaction in two separate mutagenesis reactions that were adapted from Vogel and Das (23Vogel A.M. Das A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and from Fromant et al. (24Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The mutagenized segments were then cut with EcoRI andClaI (Promega) and gel-purified. The resulting mutagenized fragment was ligated into a digested pKK223-3 vector encoding the wild-type (WT) C terminus of CooA (residues 132–222). The resulting pool of plasmids, encoding a randomly mutagenized CooA effector-binding domain fused to a WT CooA DNA-binding domain, was transformed into theE. coli strain in which β-galactosidase is expressed from PcooF, a CooA-dependent promoter. Clones were screened for significant activity in the presence of CO, using MOPS-buffered agar plates (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) containing 40 µg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 450 µg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated anaerobically in the presence of CO for 2 days at 30 °C. After storing the plates aerobically at 4 °C to allow color development, blue colonies were isolated and corresponding plasmids containing cooA were sequenced to determine the mutations that were responsible for the gain-of-function phenotype. Because of the mutagenesis method, most sequenced mutants contained several mutations. These were then individually recreated by site-directed mutagenesis in a WT cooA background (i.e. encoding the normal His at position 77), and all further analyses were carried out with those strains. Putative loss-of-function variants were similarly created by site-directed mutagenesis in a WT cooA background and verified by sequencing. Strains containing the PcooF-lacZreporter fusion and plasmid-borne cooA variants were measured, in the absence or presence of CO, for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 13-30Google Scholar). Purification of WT CooA and CooA variants (to >95% homogeneity) was performed using standard procedures as described previously (21Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The heme content of CooA preparations was measured by either using the Soret peak absorbance from UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (extinction coefficient of FeIII CooA = 105 mm−1 cm−1 at 423 nm (26Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)) or the reduced pyridine hemochromogen method (27DeDuve C. Acta Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 264-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro DNA binding of CooA preparations was measured using a fluorescence polarization assay as described (28Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

The ability of isolated CooA to activate in vitro transcription under anaerobic conditions was determined by procedures described previously (13He Y. Gaal T. Karls R. Donohue T.J. Gourse R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10840-10845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except that CooA was bound to DNA for 10 min before the addition of RNA polymerase. This study began as a screen for mutations incooA that would suppress mutations that alter His77, one of the normal heme ligands in the FeII (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and FeII + CO forms (28Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J.

Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CooA variants in the starting strains (with either H77K 3Numbering of CRP residues typically starts with the N-terminal Val, whereas numbering of CooA residues begins with the Met1, which is proteolytically removed. or H77E substitutions) have a very low level of CO-independent activity and, although they bind CO with an affinity roughly similar to that of WT CooA, 4M. V. Thorsteinsson, unpublished data. CO binding does not result in increased activation of transcription (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We assume that the forms of WT CooA that are active and inactive for DNA binding exist in an equilibrium and that CO binding shifts the equilibrium toward the active form. The replacement of His77 in CooA apparently shifts that equilibrium slightly toward the active form in the absence of CO, but CO binding does not further change that equilibrium, so that the low level of activation in vivo is not increased by the presence of CO. Using an in vivo β-galactosidase assay system in E. coli, we screened a pool ofcooA-bearing clones in which the region encoding the effector-binding domain (residues 1–131) of the two His77variants had been randomly mutagenized. Colonies displaying significantly higher β-galactosidase activity than did the starting strains were chosen, and the cooA region was amplified and sequenced. Because of the nature of the mutagenesis, many of the strains contained multiple substitutions. Each mutation was recreated by site-directed mutagenesis in a WT cooA background (i.e. with the WT FeII heme-ligand His77). This allowed us to identify those mutations that were causative of the increased β-galactosidase activity and to analyze them without the complication of the mutation affecting the His77 position. From each original strain with multiple mutations, only one mutation displayed a clearly mutant phenotype in the WT background, and all subsequent analyses were limited to these mutations in that background. Two general classes of suppressor mutations were found: (i) those that render CooA active in the absence of CO and affect residues in its interior (CooA* (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) and (ii) those that remain CO-dependent for activity and affect surfaces of CooA that might contact RNA polymerase. The first class of suppressors encoded the following changes in CooA: S78L, F98L, E128K, and D134N. Because of their effector independence, as well as the positions of the affected residues in the CooA structure, they may perturb the pathway by which CO binding to the heme is transmitted to the DNA-binding regions. It appears that a repositioning of the C helices (Fig. 1) with respect to each other plays a role in signal transmission within CooA (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We assume that these substitutions mimic CO binding by stimulating that repositioning in some fashion. The second class of suppressors, which is the focus of this paper, consisted of four substitutions: E60G, D94N, E38K, and E41K. The first two affect residues homologous to the AR2 and AR3 regions of CRP (Fig.1), whereas the latter two fall in an intermediate position. We used the position of these residues as an indicator of the regions of CooA involved in activation and compared these positions to those of residues affecting AR2 and AR3 of CRP and FNR. We verified that the behavior of this second class was not a result of altered protein accumulation or differential heme content, because they all displayed WT levels of heme-containing CooA in extracts (data not shown). It is our working hypothesis that this class was detected in the screen, because they have a significant increase in their ability to interact with E. coli RNAP and that this interaction “traps” the small fraction of these CooA variants that happens to be transiently arranged in the DNA binding conformation. In β-galactosidase assays, D94N CooA showed activity that was greater than that of WT both with and without CO (Table I). Increases in CO responsiveness have been reported for a D94A variant of CooA in another study (31Aono S. Nakajima H. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 190–192: 267-282Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but no further analysis of the basis of its behavior was performed. An examination of the local structures of both CooA and CRP suggested that a gain-of-function substitution in CRP (E96N) maps to the same surface region and apparently acts by removing an unfavorable charge·charge interaction between CRP and α-NTD. This residue lies near the AR2 of CRP, a set of basic residues (His19, His21, and Lys101) that contact an acidic patch on α-NTD (15Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To further test whether WT CooA actually possesses an AR2 region, we attempted to construct loss-of-function mutants in this region on the basis of structural comparisons with CRP. Both T97E and K26E CooA substitutions were constructed (the former is analogous to CRP Lys101, and the latter was chosen because of its charge and position), because we anticipated that they would create unfavorable charge·charge interactions at the AR2·α-NTD interface. Both mutants have severely reduced activity in β-galactosidase assays (Table I), consistent with our hypothesis that this region is important for activation.Table IIn vivo β-galactosidase and in vitro fluorescence polarization assays of selected CooA variantsGenotype1-aStrains that areunderlined were isolated during the initial screens for gain-of-function CooA variants.Activity −CO1-bReported activity values are displayed as a percentage compared to that of WT CooA.

Consistent with the suggestion that the alterations affect interactions with RNAP but not with DNA, both variants bound DNA normally in the fluorescence polarization assay withK D values that were similar to that of WT CooA (Table I and Fig. 3, A andB; variants in Figs. 3 and 4are arranged by functionality). The variants were then tested for their ability to support CO-dependent transcription in vitro (13He Y. Gaal T. Karls R. Donohue T.J. Gourse R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

These considerations may be the reason that we detect CO-independent activityin vivo for all of the gain-of-function mutants (Table I) but not in the in vitro assays where CooA is limiting. We assume that the excess of CooA in the in vivo assay allows the detection of the small fraction of protein in the DNA binding configuration when an improved AR region allows the “trapping” of this active fraction. The identification and characterization of both gain- and loss-of-function variants of CooA in this region demonstrate that CooA contains an activating region in the same approximate position as AR2 of CRP and that negatively charged residues on this surface region are deleterious to its activation function. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the AR2·α-NTD interaction is electrostatic with a negatively charged surface on the α-NTD of RNAP interacting with a positively charged surface of CooA. Because CooA is only the second member of this large protein superfamily for which the x-ray crystal structure is known, the similarity in positioning and function of these regions is striking and suggests that the hypothesis might extend generally to other divergent members of the CRP family. Another CooA variant that increased β-galactosidase activity with and without CO contained an E60G substitution (Table I), which lies on the exposed β-turn region known as the 4/5 loop"

https://openalex.org/W2319536463,"The ability to suppress wild type p53-independent apoptosis may play an important role in the oncogenicity of p53 mutant proteins. However, structural elements necessary for this activity are unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this mutant p53 mediated inhibition is specific to the apoptotic pathway or a more general suppression of the cellular response to stress. We observed that an unmodified C-terminus was required for the suppression of apoptosis by the p53 135(Ala to Val) oncogenic p53 mutant. It was also required for the novel activity of G2 arrest suppression, the predominant response at low levels of genotoxic stress. These observations are consistent with a model whereby mutant p53 suppressive activity is not specific to the apoptotic pathway, but rather increases the threshold of genotoxic stress needed for a DNA damage response to occur. Furthermore, these observations indicate that it may be possible to selectively kill mutant p53 expressing cells based on the lower sensitivity of their growth arrest response."

Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) groups are covalently attached to such proteins via a thioether linkage to cysteine residues near the C terminus. Three different enzymes are known to catalyze these irreversible modification reactions. Protein farnesyl transferase (PFT)1uses farnesyl diphosphate to prenylate Ras, the nuclear lamins, and other proteins with the C-terminal consensus sequence CaaX(where a is any aliphatic residue and X is Met, Ser, or Gln). Protein geranylgeranyl transferase type I (PGGTI) modifies members of the Rho family and most of the γ-subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins using geranylgeranyl diphosphate. These proteins have a different C-terminal CaaX sequence whereX is typically Leu. Finally, newly synthesized members of the Rab family of small GTPases bind to the Rab escort protein (REP) to form a complex recognized by Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGT, also known as PGGTII). This enzyme then modifies the Rab proteins at both cysteines in the C-terminal sequences XXCC, CXC, or CCXX, where X can be any amino acid residue.

The magnitude of the hydrophobicity of the modification has been shown to be an important determinant of prenylated protein function, suggesting that hydrophobicity mediates membrane attachment (5Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, a binding activity for prenylated Ras in the plasma membrane has been characterized that can be inhibited by isoprenoid analogs (6Siddiqui A.A. Garland J.R. Dalton M.B. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prenylated peptides bind microsomal membranes with high affinity (Kd = ∼30 nm) (7Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these results support the idea that specific membrane factors recognize the lipid moiety itself. The importance of prenylation for cytosolic protein-protein interactions is also well established. For example, prelamin A must be prenylated for recognition by the endoprotease activity that catalyzes its processing to a mature form (8Kilic F. Dalton M.B. Burrell S.K. Mayer J.P. Patterson S.D. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5298-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rho and Rab proteins interact with their soluble guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) only when post-translationally modified (9Hori Y. Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The nature of such protein-lipid interactions is only beginning to become understood. Recently, photoprobe analogs of the isoprenoid diphosphates have been used to study protein-prenyl interactions. The ω-isoprene units of these photoprobes are replaced with a diazotrifluoropropionyloxy group (Fig.1). Previous work has shown that these analogs competitively inhibit purified or recombinant PFT and PGGTI and cross-link to their β subunits upon activation with UV light (11Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Bukhtiyarov Y.E. Omer C.A. Allen C.M. J. Biol.

Yeast PFT has been further shown to use the farnesyl analog as a substrate for the in vitro modification of recombinant Ras protein (14Edelstein R.L. DiStefano M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One aim of this investigation was to determine whether RabGGT recognizes the geranylgeranyl DATFP analog as a substrate to modify Rab proteins, specifically Rab5, in a similar fashion. Rab5 facilitates both receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosisin vivo (15Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5048-5056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The precise role of Rab5 in these events is not yet fully understood; however, the function of Rab proteins is closely tied to their GTPase cycle (19Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 20Amstrong J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Rabs, in their GDP-bound form, exist as a complex with GDI (21Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Delivery of Rabs to membranes by GDI requires a GDI displacement factor, which dissociates the Rab-GDI complex and places the Rab in the membrane. A guanine nucleotide exchange factor then catalyzes the release of GDP and the binding of GTP. In the active GTP-bound form, Rab proteins bind and recruit the protein components of the machinery that mediates budding, movement, and fusion of membrane vesicles. After membrane fusion, a GTPase-activating protein accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Rab to regenerate its GDP-bound form. In a process hypothesized to involve a membrane-bound Rab recycling factor (22Luan P. Balch W.E. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14806-14817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), GDI then extracts the GDP-bound Rab from the membrane for return to its donor compartment. Although it is established that Rab protein prenylation is required for association with GDI and membranes (2Seabra M.C. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), it is not known whether protein-prenyl interactions are involved in other steps of the GTPase cycle. The modification of Rab5 with the photoactivatable isoprenoid analog DATFP-FPP reported here is the first step toward this analysis employing UV cross-linking techniques. DATFP-FPP was chemically synthesized as described previously (12Bukhtiyarov Y.E. Omer C.A. Allen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C in the dark in 2 mm NH4OH at 485 µm. [35S]Methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. RNAsin, RQ1 DNase, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega (Madison, WI). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was purchased from Pierce and prepared as a 10 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO just before use. Triton X-114 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and prepared as a 10% stock in Tris/NaCl/EDTA as described (23Bordier C. J. Biol.

Suzanne Pfeffer (Stanford University, CA), Assia Shisheva (Wayne State University, MI), and Miguel Seabra (Imperial College, UK), respectively. Anti-GDI-1 peptide antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The plasmids pAGA-Rab5WT and pAGA-Rab51–211 were purified by CsCl density ultracentrifugation and linearized withHindIII (27Sanford J.C. Pan Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23773-23776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Run-off transcripts were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 20 µm amino acids and 20 mm KCl was programmed with these transcripts (90 µg/ml) to translate peptides in the presence of [35S]methionine (200,000 cpm/µl for characterization and 800,000 cpm/µl for cross-linking experiments). Translation reactions to prepare proteins for cross-linking experiments also contained protease inhibitor cocktail (1 µg/µl each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, translation was terminated with addition of 50 µg/ml RNase A. The amount of peptide synthesized was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Post-translational modification with mevalonate or DATFP-FPP was performed at 37 °C. These prenylation reaction mixtures included 40% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 12 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 µg/ml RNase A. A 2-µl aliquot of protein was diluted into 200 µl of 1% Triton X-114 in Tris/NaCl/EDTA. The samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 1 h. Phase separation was induced by incubation at 37 °C for 3 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (23Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The top aqueous phases were transferred to new tubes and re-extracted with 20 µl of 1% Triton X-114 in TBS. The lower detergent phases were re-extracted with 100 µl of TBS. The final phases were made up to the same volume and detergent concentration by adding 200 µl of TBS to the detergent phases and 20 µl of 10% Triton X-114 in TBS to the aqueous phases. Fifty-µl samples of each fraction were mixed with Laemmli buffer before characterization on a urea-acrylamide gradient gel. Reticulocyte lysate containing radiolabeled peptides was fractionated on 4.8 ml of 5–20% continuous sucrose gradients in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 µm GDP (28Sanford J.C., Yu, J. Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26904-26909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation at 165,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SWTi 55 rotor, 150-µl fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Thirty-µl aliquots of odd-numbered fractions were analyzed on urea-acrylamide gradient gels. To determine the molecular mass of complexes in the sucrose gradients, the following standard proteins were used: carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Prenylated protein was desalted into assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 85 mm sucrose, 20 µm EGTA) through Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. The concentration of radiolabeled protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The membranes were prepared from K562 cell post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C (29Jones A.T. Spiro D.J. Kirchhausen T. Melancon P. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3477-3485PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Folin/Lowry assay. 35S-Labeled Rab5 (3 nm) was mixed with membranes (2 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mm GDP or GTPγS. Membrane pellet and supernatant fractions were isolated by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The pellets were washed and resuspended with an equal volume of assay buffer. To determine the fraction of membrane bound35S-labeled Rab5, the pellet and supernatant fractions were separated on urea-acrylamide gradient gels, and the amount of modified protein in the dried gel was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis (Bio-Rad). Proteins were chemically cross-linked using 0.5 mg/ml DSS for 1 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and incubating on ice for 30 min. For UV cross-linking, the proteins were diluted 10-fold in assay buffer into quartz cuvettes and exposed to a short wave (254 nm) 4-W UV lamp at a 1-cm distance for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were adjusted to 1.0% Triton X-100, diluted to 500 µl with IP buffer (assay buffer with 1.0% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor cocktail, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 60 min. Five-µl aliquots of the appropriate antiserum (Rab5, GDI-1, GDI-2, or REP) or 50 µg of purified antibody (GDI) was added, and incubation on ice continued for 90 min. Nonspecific complexes were removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 4 °C, 10 min), and 100 µl of 10% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) in IP buffer was added. The samples were then rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 min) and washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer. Proteins were released from the beads and denatured by boiling for 10 min in 50 µl of Laemmli buffer and then resolved on acrylamide gradient gels for phosphorimaging analysis. The products of in vitroprenylation and membrane binding reactions were analyzed by urea-acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (30Sanford J.C. Foster L. Kapadia Z. Wessling-Resnick M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, a continuous gradient of 4–8 m urea and 10–15% acrylamide was formed in the absence of SDS. The samples were prepared in Laemmli buffer but were not boiled. These gels were fixed and dried before exposure to phosphorimaging screens. Cross-linked products were characterized on gels with a continuous gradient of 5–15% acrylamide containing 0.1% SDS. The gels were processed for fluorography by saturating them in Me2SO followed by a 5-min incubation in 20% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in the same solvent. The gels were then washed extensively with water before they were dried and exposed to film. The following molecular size markers were used to calibrate gels: cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), and β-galactosidase (116 kDa). Allen and co-workers (12Bukhtiyarov Y.E. Omer C.A. Allen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that the photoactivatable analog of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, DATFP-FPP, inhibits PGGTI activity in vitro. To determine the effect of DATFP-FPP on RabGGT activity, the analog was added to prenylation reaction mixtures containing in vitro translated35S-labeled Rab5. Reaction products were analyzed using a urea-acrylamide gradient gel system that separates prenylated product from the less mobile unmodified Rab5 (Fig.2A). Rab5 is prenylated in a temperature-dependent manner (lane 1 versus lane 4). A fraction of the Rab5 (∼ 20%) is modified by endogenous lipid donors, but the addition of mevalonate to the assay effects complete prenylation of the 35S-labeled protein (lane 2 versus lane 4). However, the presence of increasing concentrations of DATFP-FPP reduces the amount of prenylated product (lanes 4–8). An increase in the amount of unmodified substrate is observed as well as the appearance of a new species of intermediate mobility. Thus, the photoprobe inhibits native prenylation of Rab5 by rabbit reticulocyte RabGGT. Because DATFP-FPP competitively inhibits PGGTI activity (12Bukhtiyarov Y.E. Omer C.A. Allen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is likely that the analog also competes as a lipid substrate for RabGGT. The mobility-shifted reaction product that appears in the presence of DATFP-FPP supports this idea. This product is more apparent in the reactions that are not supplemented with mevalonate (lane 3). With or without mevalonate, this radiolabeled species represents roughly 50–60% of the total material. The unique band does not represent a normal intermediate in the post-translational modification of Rab5 because it is not observed in assay reactions containing other inhibitors of RabGGT activity, such asN-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-cysteine orN-acetyl-S-farnesyl-cysteine (Fig.2B). Thus, the appearance of this species of intermediate mobility in assays containing DATFP-FPP strongly suggests that RabGGT uses the photoprobe as a substrate to modify Rab5. To verify that Rab5 is modified with the hydrophobic photoprobe, the protein product was extracted with Triton X-114 for phase separation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, unmodified Rab5 (that is, untreated after translation) fails to partition into the detergent phase and is exclusively found in the aqueous phase. In contrast, the majority of prenylated protein can be extracted into the detergent phase. The 35S-labeled product of intermediate mobility produced in the presence of DATFP-FPP partitions into the detergent phase to the same extent as prenylated Rab5. Thus, this Rab5 band of intermediate mobility must represent protein that has been modified by the hydrophobic isoprenoid, DATFP-FPP. It should be noted that the stoichiometry of DATFP modification could not be determined from this analysis. The gel mobility of monogeranylgeranylated Rab51–212 is the same as digeranylgeranylated Rab5WT (30Sanford J.C. Foster L. Kapadia Z. Wessling-Resnick M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that the band of intermediate mobility is not necessarily a monoprenylated form of Rab5. Thus, the altered gel mobility likely reflects the more polar nature of DATFP, whether Rab5 is modified with one or two groups. To examine whether modification of Rab5 with DATFP-FPP affects its function, the association of DATFP-Rab5 with other cytosolic factors was evaluated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Previous studies have demonstrated the prenylation-dependent association of Rab5 with GDI-2 by this method (28Sanford J.C., Yu, J. Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26904-26909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, the C-terminal truncation mutant Rab51–211, which lacks the prenylation motif, sediments as the expected monomeric species of ∼24 kDa, whereas both prenylated and DATFP-modified Rab5 sediment in a larger mass complex. These results suggest that like prenylated Rab5 (28Sanford J.C., Yu, J. Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26904-26909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), DATFP-Rab5 can form a complex with other reticulocyte lysate proteins. It is possible that the larger mass complex with DATFP-Rab5 reflects an oligomer of Rab5 molecules interacting via the hydrophobic modification. However, prenylated Rab5 that is not complexed to other proteins is insoluble (31Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11085-11090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To directly determine whether reticulocyte lysate factors bind to DATFP-Rab5 and are in direct contact with the prenyl analog, protein-prenyl cross-linking was performed by UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5, several UV cross-linked products containing 35S-labeled Rab5 are detected. Importantly, these complexes are specific because they are not observed when DATFP-Rab5 was left in the dark. DATFP-Rab5 therefore binds and UV cross-links to cytosolic proteins in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a prenylation-dependent manner.Figure 5DATFP-Rab5 cross-links to proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate upon exposure to UV light. Ten-µl aliquots of lysate containing 30 nm35S-labeled Rab5 modified with 48 µm DATFP-FPP were diluted 10-fold. The samples were exposed to UV light with a 254 nm, 4-W bulb in a quartz cuvette at 4 °C for 30 min (+) or left wrapped in aluminum foil on ice (−). The samples were then mixed with Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on an acrylamide gradient SDS gel. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 48 h. The sizes (in kDa) and migration of standard proteins are shown on theleft. The calculated molecular masses of the Rab5 complexes are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One hallmark of Rab activity is the coupled process of membrane binding and nucleotide exchange (GDP for GTP) (32Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GTPγS, the slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP, is known to enhance the membrane binding of Rab proteins, stabilizing the active membrane-bound form and reducing the amount of GDP-bound Rab available for GDI-mediated release (33Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the ability of DATFP-Rab5 to bind membranes, prenylated or DATFP-modified Rab5 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was mixed with a crude membrane preparation in the presence of GDP or GTPγS. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, membrane and supernatant fractions were separated by centrifugation. The amount of modified Rab5 in each fraction was determined by phosphorimaging proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. The Rab51–211 truncation mutant is not recruited to the membrane fraction in control assays (data not shown); therefore binding activity requires the prenylation of Rab5. Membrane binding of both native prenylated and DATFP-Rab5 is enhanced by GTPγS (Fig. 6); however, the overall extent of DATFP-Rab5 binding is reduced relative to prenylated Rab5 in the presence of either GDP or GTPγS. The DATFP-Rab5 bound to membranes does not represent contaminating mono- or di-prenylated Rab5 because the isoprenoid photoprobe completely inhibits native prenylation under the conditions used to produce 35S-labeled protein for this assay (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Therefore, DATFP-Rab5 binds membranes in a nucleotide-dependent fashion, albeit to a lesser extent than the native prenylated Rab5. The ability of membrane-bound DATFP-Rab5 to UV cross-link proteins was compared with the chemical cross-linking of native prenylated Rab5 with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). DSS is a bifunctional amine-reactive lipid-soluble reagent with an 11.4-angstrom linker. In contrast, DATFP will UV cross-link at a 2–3-angstrom distance. Briefly, membrane fractions with Rab5 bound as described above were recovered by centrifugation after UV or DSS cross-linking. Detergent-solubilized Rab5 complexes were then immunoprecipitated and separated by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.7, DSS promotes cross-linking of both native prenylated Rab5 and DATFP-Rab5 into two complexes of ∼45 and 70 kDa in mass. These results confirm that DATFP-Rab5 binds to the same membrane-associated factors as native prenylated Rab5 and is thus appropriately oriented in the membrane. However, UV irradiation does not promote cross-linking of DATFP-Rab5 into these or any other complexes. If membrane-associated proteins directly interact with the prenyl moiety, additional bands would have been expected upon UV irradiation of DATFP-Rab5. The absence of such bands strongly suggests that protein-prenyl interactions do not occur in the membrane. These results fail to identify any specific “prenyl receptors” and therefore imply that Rab5 interacts with the membrane through hydrophobic interactions between the geranylgeranyl groups and the membrane lipids as well as through protein-protein interactions between Rab5 and membrane-associated factors such as those observed upon DSS cross-linking. Because DATFP-Rab5 does not UV cross-link to membrane-associated factors, the soluble cross-linked complexes observed in rabbit reticluocyte lysate were further characterized. To identify the soluble proteins that cross-link to Rab5, the supernatant fractions of the membrane binding assays described above were immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised against candidate proteins, GDI-1, GDI-2, and REP (Fig.8). Antiserum recognizing REP immunoprecipitates a 170-kDa complex containing DATFP-Rab5 (right panel). Interestingly, this complex cannot be detected by chemical cross-linking of native prenylated Rab5 with DSS (left panel). Two different polyclonal antibodies against GDI-1 precipitate 90- and 105-kDa complexes from assays containing either DSS cross-linked prenylated Rab5 or UV cross-linked DATFP-Rab5 (bothpanels). The expected mass of the complex between Rab5 (24 kDa) and GDI-1 (55 kDa) is 79 kDa, so why larger than expected 90- and 105-kDa complexes are cross-linked to Rab5 is not clear. Although an antibody specific for GDI-2 (45 kDa) did not precipitate any Rab5 complexes, the 67-kDa cross-linked complex observed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 5) is consistent with a Rab5-GDI-2 complex. It is possible that this antibody may not be able to immunoprecipita"

A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, the mechanism of activation is essentially different for ACs and GCs. Mammalian 12-transmembrane adenylyl cyclases are regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligand binding to the GPCR causes intracellular dissociation of the heterotrimeric G-protein into its Gα and Gβγ subunits. These subunits can activate (Gαs, Gβγ) or inhibit (Gαi, Gβγ) AC (4Simonds W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Hanoune J.

In cell lysates GTPγS, a GTP analogue that cannot be hydrolyzed by Gα, is often used as indication for G-protein regulation (7Martelli A.M. Bareggi R. Cocco L. Manzoli F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Hess S.D. Doroshenko P.A. Augustine G.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). Mammalian GCs can be separated into two groups, soluble and membrane-bound enzymes (10Wedel B. Garbers D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,11Foster D.C. Wedel B.J. Robinson S.W. Garbers D.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 1-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble GCs form a heterodimer and are activated by NO, which binds to a heme group that is associated to the dimer (12Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Membrane bound GCs have an extracellular domain, which often functions as a receptor, and ligands have been identified for a number of these GCs. Recently, several unusual GCs have been cloned in lower eukaryotes. We have characterized a GC in Dictyostelium, DdGCA, that has the topology of mammalian ACs, consisting of two stretches each with six membrane-spanning regions and two cyclase domains (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). InParamecium, Tetrahymena, andPlasmodium, GCs with the same topology have been found, but at the N terminus these proteins contain a P-type ATPase, providing an additional 10 membrane-spanning region (14Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Carucci D.J. Witney A.A. Muhia D.K. Warhurst D.C. Schaap P.

The regulation of GC in these last three organisms is essentially unknown. Although G-protein regulation has been considered for the Parameciumand Tetrahymena GCs, no 40-kDa heterotrimeric G-protein family members have been found in these organisms (16Linder J.U. Hoffmann T. Kurz U. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11235-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, activation of GC in vivo is known to be dependent on GPCRs and on heterotrimeric G-proteins. cAMP and folic acid are two well known extracellular ligands that induce a transient rise in cGMP. Disruption of the single Gβ gene abandons the cGMP response to both stimuli (17Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas disruption of Gα2 or Gα4 inhibits the cGMP response to cAMP and folic acid, respectively (18Kesbeke F. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Kumagai A. Pupillo M. Gundersen R. Miake-Lye R. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A.

In cell lysates of wild-type cells, GTPγS stimulates AC and GC activity. However, in lysates of the gβ− cell line, this activation is lost for AC but not for GC (17Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, the GTPγS activation of ACA depends on heterotrimeric G-proteins. The mechanism by which GTPγS regulates GC activity is still unclear, especially because GTPγS is known to be a substrate of GC from Dictyostelium and several other organisms (25Brandwein H.J. Lewicki J.A. Waldman S.A. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1309-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Janssens P.M. De Jong C.C. Vink A.A. Van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that GTPγS-mediated stimulation of cGMP formation is a substrate effect (17Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Janssens P.M. De Jong C.C. Vink A.A. Van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the mechanism by which GTPγS regulates GC activity, we converted DdGCA to an adenylyl cyclase. The results demonstrate that a protein with three point mutations, DdGCAkqd, shows strong AC activity and can rescue the phenotypic defects of the adenylyl cyclase null mutant, aca−. Next we analyzed the effect of GTPγS on DdGCAkqd and show that GTPγS stimulates AC activity; this indicates that the GTPγS effect is independent of substrate specificity and not acting on the catalytic site. Finally, by expressing DdGCAkqd in several Gα and Gβ deletion mutants, we have demonstrated that a heterotrimeric G-protein does not mediate GTPγS activation of GC. The role of monomeric G-proteins in GC regulation is discussed. The following strains were used in this study: wild-type strain AX3, gβ−strain LW6 (27Lilly P. Wu L. Welker D.L. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), gα2− strain JH104 (20Kumagai A. Hadwiger J.A. Pupillo M. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1220-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),gα4−(28Hadwiger J.A. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), aca− (29Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar),gca− (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), andgα2−gα4− (see below). Cells were grown in HG5 medium supplemented with 10 µg/ml blasticidine S or 10 µg/ml neomycin based upon the selection marker present. To study morphogenesis, cells were plated on non-nutrient agar at different densities (2 × 106, 4 × 105, and 8 × 104 cells/cm2) and incubated at 22 °C to develop. Cells were transfected with DNA by electroporation as described (30Mann S.K. Richardson D.L. Lee S. Kimmel A.R. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10561-10565Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To make a double null of Gα2 and Gα4, gα4− cells were transformed with a Gα2 knock-out construct obtained as follows. A PCR fragment, obtained by using primers ga2f1 (5′- AGCCTC CGCGGG CGCGCA AGAAAT GGGTAT TTGTGC ATC-3′) and ga2r1(5′-CTAGCT AGCCAT ACCACT AGTACC AGAATA TAAACC AGC-3′) on genomicDictyostelium DNA, was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). A Bsr cassette (31Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was cloned in theHindII site of the obtained plasmid. The resulting Gα2 knock-out construct was digested with EcoRI, and the fragment containing the Bsr cassette with the Gα2 flanks was isolated and used as template in a PCR reaction with primersga2f1 and ga2r1. In this way sufficient knock-out fragment was obtained devoid of any residual circular plasmid that could cause a high background of random insertion in the transformation of Dictyostelium cells. Transformation by electroporation and selection of clones was done as described previously (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All mutations were made using PCR (32Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Before creating the mutant cyclases, two silent mutations were introduced in pGEM7GCA (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) at nucleotide positions 1365 (A to T) and 2049 (T to C), creating unique PstI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, that flanked the coding region of the first cyclase domain. The plasmid obtained was used as the template for PCR mutagenesis to introduce three point mutations, E440K, S502Q, and H504D, which have been confirmed by sequencing. The obtained PCR products were cloned in the PstI and HindIII sites of full-length DdGCA, which were subsequently cloned in the expression plasmids MB12N (bsr selection) and MB12Neo (G418 selection) (33Heikoop J.C. Grootenhuis P.D. Blaauw M. Veldema J.S. Van Haastert P.J. Linskens M.H. Eur J Biochem. 1998; 256: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to create DdGCAkqd. The sequence of the plasmid is similar to that of A15-Δ5′-A5-GCA (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the exception of the introduced restriction sites and point mutations. DdGCAkqd(bsr) was transformed toaca− cells, and DdGCAkqd(bsr) or DdGCAkqd(neo) to the otherDictyostelium strains depending on the selection markers available for the specific strain. GC assays were performed as described previously (34Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 387-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In short, cells (108 cells/ml) in lysis buffer (40 mmHepes/NaOH, 6 mm MgSO4, and 6 mmEGTA, pH 7.5) with or without GTPγS (0.1 mm) were lysed by forced filtration through a Nucleopore filter (pore size, 3 µm). The reactions were started at 30 s after lysis by the addition of an equal amount of assay mixture (10 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm GTP). Reactions were terminated at the indicated time points by the addition of an equal amount of 3.5% (v/v) perchloric acid; the time zero sample was taken immediately after cell lysis. The AC assay was performed similar to the GC assay, except that the assay mixture contained 1 mm ATP instead of GTP. The cGMP or cAMP content was measured using an isotope dilution assay as described previously (34Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 387-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To measure responses to cAMP, cells were starved for 5 h and resuspended at 108 cells/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer. Cells were stimulated with 10 µm 2′-deoxy-cAMP, and reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 3.5% perchloric acid. cAMP and cGMP levels were measured in the neutralized lysates. The guanylyl cyclase activity of DdGCA is strongly dependent on GTPγS (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To analyze the catalytic activity in more detail. DdGCA was overexpressed in AX3 cells, and guanylyl cyclase activity was determined at different concentrations of GTP or GTPγS (see Fig.1A). The Lineweaver-Burk plot shows that the Km for GTP and GTPγS are 340 and 200 µm, respectively, with a similarVmax of 75 pmol/min/mg for both substrates. Thus, it seems that GTPγS is a better substrate than GTP; however, GTPγS is also a potent activator of GC activity inDictyostelium (26Janssens P.M. De Jong C.C. Vink A.A. Van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GC activity was measured at different GTP concentrations in the presence of 50 µm GTPγS. Without GTP no cGMP formation was detected at this concentration of GTPγS. The results reveal that GTPγS leads to a reduction of theKm for GTP from 340 to 88 µm and to an increase of the Vmax with a factor of 1.5 (Fig. 1A). The Ka of GTPγS stimulation is about 5 µm as determined by measuring GC activity with 500 µm GTP at increasing concentrations of GTPγS (Fig.1B). These measurements have two intrinsic caveats. First, GTPγS is an activator as well as a substrate of the enzyme, making it difficult to distinguish substrate-related effects from non-catalytic activation. Second, although the measurements were done in cell lysates from DdGCA-overexpressing cells, these cells still express another GC (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We may circumvent both problems upon mutation of DdGCA to an adenylyl cyclase and expression in aca− cells, because GTPγS will no longer be a substrate and aca−cells do no contain AC activity under our assay conditions. DdGCA has a typical mammalian AC topology consisting of two clusters each with six transmembrane-spanning regions and two cyclase domains (Fig.2A). The cyclase domains show homology to the domains of eukaryotic ACs and GCs. Sequence analysis clearly show that the C1 domain of DdGCA is functionally equivalent to the C2 domains of mammalian ACs, and the C2 domain of DdGCA corresponds to the mammalian C1 domains (13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a homodimer of the rat AC type II C2 domain and a heterodimer of canine AC type V C1 and rat AC type II C2 domains together with modeling studies gave a good indication of which amino acids are involved in substrate binding and catalysis (1Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Based on this information and on alignments of several AC and GC sequences (Fig. 2B), we might be able to predict which amino acids in DdGCA are involved in determining substrate specificity. In ACs, three amino acids seem to be most important for ATP recognition: a lysine (Lys-938 in ACII), a glutamine (Gln-1016 in ACII), and an aspartate (Asp-1018 in ACII). These three amino acids are highly conserved among all ACs in higher eukaryotes. Their counterparts in GCs, a glutamate (Glu-928 in GCE), an arginine (Arg-998 in GCE), and a cysteine (Cys-1000 in GCE), are also strongly conserved among GCs. In DdGCA, the glutamate (Glu-440 in DdGCA) is conserved as well, but the other amino acids are unique, being a serine (Ser-502 in DdGCA) and a histidine (His-504 in DdGCA). To study the involvement of these amino acids in substrate specificity, we mutated all three amino acids to their counterparts in AC, creating DdGCAkqd. Disruption of the DdACA gene leads to an aggregation defective phenotype of theaca− cells (29Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.3, expression of DdGCAkqd inaca− cells resulted in the formation of small aggregates that developed into fruiting bodies with spores. Expression of DdGCA did not result in any kind of rescue. AC activity in lysates from in aca− cells is very low under our assay conditions (∼2 pmol/min/mg protein). Expression of DdGCA inaca− cells did not yield AC activity, whereas expression of DdGCAkqd resulted in enhanced AC activity (25 pmol/min/mg protein; Fig. 4A). GC activity levels as well as basal cGMP levels are significantly higher upon expression of DdGCA in aca− or wild-type cells (Fig. 4B and Ref. 13Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Expression of DdGCAkqd in aca− cells did not result in enhanced GC activity or a higher basal cGMP level (Fig.4B). Thus, by making three point mutations DdGCA was successfully converted to an adenylyl cyclase.Figure 4Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase activity ofaca− cells overexpressing DdGCAkqd. Adenylyl cyclase (A) and guanylyl cyclase (B) activities were measured in cell lysates ofaca−cells expressing MB12Neo (empty plasmid), DdGCA, or DdGCAkqd. Activities were determined in the presence of 50 µm GTPγS and 500 µm ATP or GTP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of known regulators of GC activity, the inhibition of DdGCAkqd by calcium in vitro (35Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and stimulation by cAMP in vivo was tested. As shown in Fig. 5, AC activity ofaca− cells overexpressing DdGCAkqdis strongly inhibited by similar Ca2+ concentrations as GC activity of wild-type AX3 cells. This finding suggests that both DdGCAkqd and DdGCA are regulated by a protein that strongly binds calcium, like e.g. guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GCAP) modulating GC activity in the retina (36Gorczyca W.A.

Dictyostelium cells show a transient rise in cGMP levels, peaking at 10–15 s after stimulation with cAMP. Overexpression of DdGCAkqd in aca− cells may result in a similar response, but now a transient rise in cAMP should occur. This cell line has the important advantage that the simultaneous detection of cGMP and cAMP levels provide information on the activation of endogenous GC enzymes and overexpressed DdGCAkqd, respectively. Cells were stimulated with 2′-deoxy-cAMP, an analogue that stimulates the receptor but does not interfere with cAMP determinations. As shown in Fig. 6, cGMP levels increase about 8-fold to a maximum at 10 s after stimulation. In addition, cAMP levels produced by DdGCAkqdincrease about 4-fold; the response is biphasic with enhanced cAMP levels after prolonged stimulation. This difference in cGMP and cAMP response could be because of the phosphodiesterases that degrade cGMP and cAMP, respectively, which have very different regulatory properties in Dictyostelium (38Van Haastert P.J.

These results of Fig. 6demonstrate that DdGCAkqd is activated by extracellular cAMP, probably via a cAR1 receptor dependent pathway. To study the effect GTPγS on the activity of GCA, we used aca− cells expressing DdGCAkqd. As shown in TableI, AC activity is hardly detectable without GTPγS, whereas in the presence of GTPγS substantial production of cAMP is observed. The kinetic constants of DdGCAkqd were determined from activity measurements at different substrate concentrations (Fig.7), demonstrating that GTPγS regulates AC activity of DdGCAkqd by reducing theKm from 270 to 141 µm ATP and by increasing the Vmax from 17 to 38 pmol/min/mg. These kinetic data for the AC activity of DdGCAkqd are essentially identical to the effect of GTPγS on the kinetic data for the GC activity of DdGCA (Fig. 1), suggesting that the mechanism of stimulation by GTPγS did not change dramatically upon mutation of DdGCA.Table IAdenylyl cyclase activity in cell lines overexpressing DdGCAkqdCells expressing DdGCAkqdAdenylyl cyclase activity−GTPγS+GTPγSpmol/min/mgaca−−2 ± 1.525 ± 1.6gβ−1.7 ± 1.833 ± 2.0gα2−−3.8 ± 6.544 ± 1.8gα4−0.4 ± 3.036 ± 4.0gα2−/gα4−−1.0 ± 2.545 ± 0.9Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in lysates with 0.5 mm ATP in the presence or absence of 50 µmGTPγS.

The AC activity was below the detection limit in cells without expression of DdGCAkqd (data not shown). The activation of Dictyostelium GCs was studied in vitro and in vivo using several cell lines in which subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein have been deleted. To investigate the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the regulation of DdGCA by GTPγS, we expressed DdGCAkqd in the different knock-out cell lines (gβ, gα2−,and gα4−) and measured the AC activities in lysates plus and minus GTPγS. The endogenous DdACA, which is also stimulated by GTPγS in some of these cells, has not been deleted but is expressed at very low levels in vegetative cell and does not cause interference in the assay (data not shown). Dictyosteliumcells possess only one Gβ subunit (27Lilly P. Wu L. Welker D.L. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which is essential for a cAMP and cGMP response in vivo. Unexpectedly, expressing DdGCAkqd in gβ− cells results in AC activity that is still strongly activated by GTPγS (Table I). At least nine Gα subunits have been described inDictyostelium (45Aubry L.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but only two of them, Gα2 and Gα4, have been implicated in the activation of AC and GC activityin vivo after stimulation of cells with cAMP and folic acid, respectively (18Kesbeke F.

The results shown in Table I indicate that AC activity of DdGCAkqd in lysates fromgα2− or gα4− cells are still stimulated by GTPγS. It can be argued that in vitro GC activity in gα2− cells is regulated by GTPγS via Gα4 and vice versa. Therefore, a double null cell line was made, in which both Gα2 and Gα4 were deleted. This cell line still shows in vitro activation of endogenous GC activity by GTPγS (data not shown). Upon expression of DdGCAkqd, stimulation of AC activity by GTPγS was observed (Table I). The results imply that Gβ, Gα2, and Gα4 are not essential for the GTPγS stimulation of DdGCAkqd inDictyostelium lysates, making the direct involvement of G-proteins unlikely. Dictyostelium GCA is an unusual GC because it has the topology of an AC and is activated by GTPγS. We have converted DdGCA to an AC, expressed it in aca− null cells that have no endogenous AC activity, and demonstrated that the obtained AC activity is still stimulated by GTPγS. This clearly demonstrates that GTPγS stimulates DdGCA not by binding in the catalytic site or being a better substrate but via a modulator such as a GTP-binding protein. For GCs it has been proposed that a glutamate (Glu-928 in GCE, see Fig. 2B) is the most important amino acid for specific recognition of GTP as it probably interacts with the N-1 nitrogen of the guanine ring of GTP. This hypothesis has been supported experimentally, because mutant GCs without this glutamate have no GC activity (47Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

In ACs the counterpart of this glutamate is a lysine (Lys-938 in ACII) that interacts with the N-1 of the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxy-3′-AM"
https://openalex.org/W1968422338,"Betacellulin (BTC) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family. It has two biological activities: mitogenic activity in fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells, and differentiation activity for the differentiation of pancreatic acinar AR42J cells into insulin-secreting cells. The previous finding that recombinant BTC promotes the neogenesis of β-cells in a mouse model supports the possibility that BTC is a therapeutic protein. However, the mitogenic activity of BTC may not be needed for differentiation into β-cells and may cause a side effect in clinical use. We prepared several derivatives of BTC to segregate the two activities, to decrease the mitogenic activity, and to maintain the differentiation activity. We succeeded in obtaining BTC derivatives segregated by the two biological activities by preparing truncated-type derivatives. A derivative of BTC, BTC24–76, with a truncated N-terminal 23 amino acids and C-terminal 4 amino acids, was 2.5-fold more active in differentiation and had one-tenth of the mitogenic activity. The derivatives described in the present study should be helpful in future applications as therapeutic proteins and in basic research for discovery of a BTC-specific receptor.

Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). BTC belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of peptide ligands that are characterized by a six-cysteine consensus motif that forms three intramolecular disulfide bonds crucial for binding the ErbB receptor family. The EGF family consists of at least 15 members, including EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), amphiregulin (AR), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, epiregulin, heregulins, and other growth factors (3Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The 80-amino acid mature BTC is proteolytically processed from a 177-amino acid membrane-anchored precursor. BTC is a potent mitogen for a wide variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and pigment epithelial cells, with a potency nearly identical to that of EGF (1Shing Y. Christofori G.

Sasada R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9966-9973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BTC also acts as a differentiation factor of the pancreatic tumor cell line AR42J (5Christophe J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G963-G971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differentiating amylase-secreting cells into insulin-secreting cells in combination with activin A (6Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K.

This differentiation activity of BTC was not reproduced by applying a similar dose of EGF or TGF-α. BTC is also required for the induction of insulin and glucokinase expression by PDX-1 in glucagonoma cells (7Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Miyagawa J. Hanafusa T. Hamaguchi K. Matsuoka T. Yamamoto K.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1494-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The localization of BTC and the strong immunoreactivity to BTC detected in primitive duct cells of the fetal pancreas suggest that it may play physiologically important roles in the growth and differentiation of islet cells in the human pancreas (9Miyagawa J.

The administration of recombinant human BTC was shown to improve glucose tolerance in a selective alloxane perfusion model in the mouse by increasing the β-cell volume in the islets (12Yamamoto K. Miyagawa J. Waguri M. Sasada R. Igarashi K,. Li M. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Imagawa A. Yamagata K. Nakajima H,. Namba M. Tochino Y. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that BTC holds promise as a therapeutic tool for diabetics. The structure and biological functions of BTC were reviewed by Dunbar and Goddard (13Dunbar A.J. Goddard C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Differentiation into β-cells is not known in the EGF family, except for BTC. Since structural homology is highly conserved in the EGF family, including with BTC, these conserved amino acids may be unrelated to the differentiation activity of BTC. To determine whether it is possible to create a BTC derivative that exhibits differentiation activity but not mitogenic activity and whether such a derivative could become a useful therapeutic tool, we prepared in this study several derivatives of BTC and clarified the segregation of the two activities of BTC. Recombinant human 125I-EGF was purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]thymidine was purchased from DuPont-New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). G418 was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Groningen Netherlands). Recombinant human EGF was prepared by Bacillus brevis in the manner described by Yamagata et al. (14Yamagata H. Nakahama K. Suzuki Y. Kakinuma A. Tsukagoshi N. Udaka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A431 cells and Balb/c 3T3 (clone A31–714) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (Osaka, Japan), respectively. AR42J cells were provided by Dr. I. Kojima of Gunma University (Maebashi, Japan). Structural genes of the 80-amino acid mature BTC (BTC80) and its truncated derivatives were prepared by polymerase chain reaction from pBO41 (10Seno M. Tada H. Kosaka M. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Shing Y. Folkman J. Ueda M. Yamada H. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and inserted into pTCII expression vector containing the replication origin and tetracycline-resistance gene of pBR322, T7 promoter, and T7 terminator of pET3c (Novagen, Madison, WI). To construct the C-terminal truncated mutants, we used an upper primer, 5′-CATATGGATGGGAATTCCACCAGAAGTCCTG-3′, containing anNdeI site and ATG as the start codon. The lower primers containing the stop codon and BamHI site were 5′-GGATCCCTAGTCAACTCTCTCACACCTTGCTCC-3′ for BTC77, 5′-GGATCCCTAGTCAACTCTCTCACACCTTGCTCC-3′ for BTC76, 5′-GGATCCCTAAACTCTCTCACACCTTGCTCCAAT-3′ for BTC75, 5′-GGATCCCTATCTCTCACACCTTGCTCCAATGTA-3′ for BTC74, and 5′-GGATCCCTACTCACACCTTGCTCCAATGTAGCC-3′ for BTC73. To construct BTC2–76 and BTC24–76, we used 5′-CAGCATATGGGGAATTCCACCAGAAGTCCT-3′ and 5′-CAGCATATGGCTACCACCACACAATCAAAG-3′ as the upper primers, respectively. The lower primer to construct BTC2–76 and BTC24–76 was the same as that used in BTC76. Structural genes of BTCR72K, substituting Lys for Arg72, and of BTCL78A, substituting Ala for Leu78, were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis with using a QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In BTCR72K, the codon AGG coding for Arg72 was mutated to AAG using 5′-CTACATTGGAGCAAAGTGTGAGAGAGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAACTCTCTCACACTTTGCTCCAATGTAG-3′ as primers. In BTCL78A, the codon TTG coding for Leu78 was mutated to GCG using 5′-GGTGTGAGAGAGTTGACGCGTTTTACTAGTG-3′ and 5′-CACTAGTAAAACGCGTCAACTCTCTCACACC-3′ as primers. Structural genes of BTCR72K and BTCL78A were also subcloned into pTCII expression vector. Each plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli MM294 (DE3) to obtain recombinant E. coli for protein expression. Recombinant E. coli cells were cultured in modified M9 medium at 37 °C. The expression of recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl β-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cultivation was continued for an additional 4 h. After cultivation, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation. Recombinant BTC80 and BTC derivatives were expressed as inclusion bodies. Recombinant protein was extracted from E. coli cells with extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 7m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm (p-amidinophenyl)methane sulfonyl fluoride, at pH 8.0). After incubation with vigorous stirring at 4 °C for 1 h, the extracted solution was cleared by centrifugation, followed by 25-fold dilution with the refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m urea, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm glutathione in oxidized form, 1 mmglutathione in reduced form, and 0.1 m arginine hydrochloride at pH 8.0). After renaturation at 4 °C for 15 h, the refolded solution was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was concentrated by ultra filtration (molecular weight cut off: 3,000). After urea was added at a concentration of 2 mand the pH was adjusted to 5.0, the solution was applied to an SP-TOYOPEARL 650 m column (2.2 × 12 cm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0). After absorption, the column was washed with the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1m). The desired fractions were collected, and the eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrated solution was applied to an Asahipak C4P-50 column (1.0 × 25 cm) (Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After absorption, the column was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–28% for BTC80, BTCR72K, and BTCL78A; and 0–13% for the deletion-type derivatives BTC77, BTC76, BTC75, BTC74, and BTC73). The eluted fractions were collected and re-chromatographed on an Asahipak C4P-50 column. The purified protein was dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Amino acid composition analysis was carried out using a HITACHI l-8500 amino acid analyzer. Approximately 10 µg of protein was hydrolyzed for 24 or 48 h at 110 °C in 5.7 n HCl containing 4% thioglycolic acid. Protein sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Model 477A protein sequencer. C-terminal amino acid analysis was performed using a Hitachi l-8500 amino acid analyzer after treated vapor-phase hydrazinolysis for 3.5 h at 100 °C (16Yamamoto A. Toda H. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 3T3 cells mitogenic assay was performed as described previously (17Sasada R. Kurokawa T. Iwane M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, Balb/c 3T3 cells were plated on 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (5 × 102 cells/well). The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS at day 1, and serial 2-fold dilutions of BTC80, BTC derivatives, EGF, or medium alone were added at day 4. After 18 h of cultivation, DNA synthesis was monitored by pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine for 6 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then dissolved with 0.1 ml of 5% SDS for 15 min at 37 °C. The amounts of radioactivity incorporated into the cells were determined by liquid scintillation counting. We performed a differentiation assay of the AR42J cells becoming insulin-secreting cells by BTC80 and BTC derivatives, as described by Mashima (6Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K. Mine T. Miyagawa J. Hanafusa T. Seno M. Yamada H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), except the assay was performed in the absence of Activin A. AR42J cells were plated on an 8-well Lab-TekTM II Chamber Slide (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) in DMEM containing 10% FBS (5 × 104cells/well) with BTCs and were then cultured for 5 days. The cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 16 h and then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The fixed cells were incubated sequentially with Block Ace (Snow Brand, Tokyo, Japan), with anti-insulin antibody (Advanced Immunochemical, Long Beach, CA), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kappel, West Chester, PA). The cells were examined using a fluorescent microscope. To measure the differentiation of AR42J cells to insulin-secreting cells quantitatively, we established an AR42J clone, AR1898–0192, which contained a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) (18Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) gene downstream of rat insulin II gene promoter (19Chan S.J. Noyes B.E. Agarwal K.L. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rat insulin II gene promoter was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from rat tail genomic DNA and inserted upstream of the SEAP gene to construct plasmid pTB1898. Plasmid pTB1898 contains rat insulin II gene promoter, SEAP, SV40 splicing junction, SV40 poly(A), and ampicillin resistance. Plasmid pTB1898 was co-transfected into AR42J cells with pMCI neomycin poly(A) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing neomycin resistance gene using Trans ITTM-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI), and the cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (800 µg/ml). The stable transfectant clones were screened for SEAP activity in the culture media in response to adding BTC. A clone AR1898–0192 was obtained as one of the higher responding transfectants. AR1898–0192 cells were plated on 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS (1 × 104cells/well) and cultured for 5 days in the presence of serial dilutions of BTCs. The culture supernatant was then collected and treated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity derived from serum and was incubated with 1 mdiethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mml-homoarginine, and 2 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) at 37 °C for 24 h. Optical density at 405 nm was measured by a micro-plate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). EGF receptor binding assay was performed using human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells (20Winkler M.E. O'Connor L. Winget M. Fendly B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The A431 cells were plated on 48-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS (3 × 104 cells/well). At day 2, each well was washed three times with binding media (DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then incubated with 125I-EGF (0.02 pm) for 90 min at 4 °C in the presence of serial 2-fold dilutions of BTCs and washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding media followed by lysis with 0.1 n NaOH containing 1% SDS. The amounts of radioactivity bound to the cells were determined by a gamma counter. The mature form of BTC consists of 80 amino acid residues, and the EGF motif in the C-terminal domain consists of 50 amino acid residues. Both forms of BTC have been reported to have the same mitogenic activity on Balb/c 3T3 cells (4Watanabe T. Shintani A. Nakata M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Igarashi K. Sasada R. J. Biol.

In particular, six cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds and a characteristic three-loop structure are completely conserved in the EGF family.

In TGF-α, the Gly19, Val33, Tyr38, Gly40, Arg42, Asp47, and Leu48 were shown to be important for both mitogenic and binding activity (21Dunbar A.J. Priebe I.K. Belford D.A. Goddard C. Biochem.

In these residues, which are crucial for biological activities, Arg (41 in EGF, 42 in TGF-α) and Leu (47 in EGF, 48 in TGF-α) are highly conserved in the EGF family. Although the conserved Leu adjacent to the C terminus is absent in AR, the importance of Leu at that position in mitogenic activity was shown by Thompson et al.(39Thompson S.A. Harris A. Hoang D. Ferrer M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17927-17931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They prepared AR with an extended C terminus containing the conserved Leu adjacent to the C terminus, AR-DLLA. AR-DLLA showed higher mitogenic activity than mature AR. The Leu residue is also absent in HRGβ1, which has no affinity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB1. According to the homology of the EGF motif in BTC to EGF and TGF-α, we attempted to identify the amino acids crucial for the mitogenic activity of BTC, as shown in Fig. 2. Arg72 and Leu78 seem to contribute to the mitogenic activity of BTC, and the mutation of these residues will decrease the activity. We proposed that if the amino acids are unrelated to the differentiation activity of BTC, it would be possible to create a BTC derivative exhibiting the differentiation activity and not the mitogenic activity. Fig. 3shows the BTC derivatives used in the present study. BTCR72K and BTCL78A are mutated derivatives with Lys replacing Arg72 and Ala replacing Leu78. BTC77, BTC76, BTC75, BTC74, and BTC73 are truncated derivatives lacking the C-terminal peptides of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 amino acid residues, respectively. BTC2–76 and BTC24–76 are truncated derivatives of BTC76 lacking the N-terminal peptides of 1 and 23 amino acid residues, respectively. The BTC80 and BTC derivatives having a proper N terminus had an additional N-terminal Met when expressed in E. coli. Although we already developed a technology to remove an additional Met at the N-terminal of the recombinant protein (40Nishimura, O., Suenaga, M., Ohmaeh,. H, Tsuji, S., Fujino, M. (1998)J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1135–1136.Google Scholar), in this case we did not remove the N-terminal additional Met. The presence of a Met residue does not seem to be vital to the biological activity of BTC, as reported by Seno et al. (10Seno M. Tada H. Kosaka M. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Shing Y. Folkman J. Ueda M. Yamada H. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All preparations showed high purities in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and good agreement with the theoretical values determined by amino acid analysis, C-terminal amino acid analysis, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing (data not shown).Figure 3Amino acid sequences of human Betacellulin and its derivatives.

BTC77, BTC76, BTC75, BTC74, and BTC73 are truncated-type derivatives lacking a C-terminal peptide consisting of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 residues, respectively. BTC2–76 and BTC24–76 are truncated-type derivatives of BTC76 with deleted N-terminal 1 and 23 amino acids, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first prepared the BTC80 and BTC derivatives BTCR72K and BTC77 and assayed for biological activities. Fig. 4shows the results of the mitogenic assay with Balb/c 3T3 cells. BTC80 was equally active with EGF, while BTCR72K and BTC77 were less active than BTC80. BTCR72K was almost inactive and the mitogenic activity of BTC77 was ∼1/100 that of BTC80. Fig. 5shows the results of the differentiation assay with AR42J cells according to the immunofluorescence method using anti-insulin antibody. In the case of the culture without BTC80 or with EGF, no AR42J cell was strongly stained. BTCR72K was also inactive in the differentiation assay. BTC77 was equally as active as BTC80 on the differentiation of AR42J. These results showed that Arg72 is essential for both activities and the C-terminal peptide containing Leu78is essential for mitogenic activity and contribute less to differentiation activity. We also prepared BTCL78A, replacing Leu78 with Ala and assayed the activities. BTCL78A showed the same behavior as BTC77: the mitogenic activity was decreased and the differentiation activity was maintained (data not shown). The manipulations of Leu78 lead BTC80 to interesting molecules with decreased mitogenic activity and a maintained differentiation activity. Although the manipulated mutation and deletion are both effective in decreasing the mitogenic activity, we concluded that deletion-type derivatives are the most promising for further investigation. Because of the potential of BTC derivatives as therapeutic tools, deletion is more favorable than mutation since it is essentially a wild type BTC and causes no antigenicity or immunogenicity. We also prepared the deletion-type derivatives BTC76, BTC75, BTC74, and BTC73. To measure the activity of BTC derivatives on the differentiation of AR42J cells into insulin-secreting cells, we established stable transfectant AR1898–0192 cells. Since the SEAP gene was inserted downstream of insulin promoter II, the differentiated cells by BTC secreted not only insulin but also SEAP, and the SEAP activity in the culture medium was detected as a reporter. Figs.6and 7show the mitogenic and differentiation activities of the BTC80 and BTC derivatives. As shown in Fig. 6, deletion of the C-terminal peptides decreased the mitogenic activity drastically. The derivatives BTC74 and BTC73 retained almost no mitogenic activity. BTC75 retained less than 1% of that of BTC, and BTC77 and BTC76 retained only a low percentage. In the differentiation activity, the derivatives BTC75, BTC74, and BTC73 retained almost no activity, but BTC77 and BTC76 retained approximately one third of the differentiation activity of BTC. The deletion of the C-terminal 3 or 4 amino acid residues decreased the differentiation activity, but the extent of the decrease was relatively low compared with that of the mitogenic activity.Figure 5AR42J cells differentiation assay ofBTCand theBTCderivatives BTCR72K and BTC77.

Shintani A. Nakata M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Igarashi K. Sasada R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9966-9973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also investigated the N terminus truncation of BTC in combination with C terminus truncation. In BTC2–76 and BTC24–76, the N-terminal 1 and 23 amino acid residues were truncated from BTC76 and were constructed to avoid the addition of Met at the N terminus when expressed by E. coli. BTC80 and BTC derivatives with a proper N-terminal amino acid, Asp, had an additional Met at the N terminus. BTC2–76 and BTC24–76 with the N-terminal amino acid residues Gly and Ala, respectively, had no additional Met at the N terminus, as confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Figs.8and 9show the results of the receptor binding assay and AP-reporter assay, respectively. The specific binding of the BTC derivatives to EGFR was based on the ability of various concentrations of the derivatives to compete with 125I-labeled hEGF in the radioreceptor binding assay. Indeed, the reduction of mitogenic activity was observed using Balb/c 3T3 cells. However, it is important to clarify at which step the reduction occurred, either by lowering the affinity to EGFR or by affecting the subsequent signal transduction steps. The derivative having no mitogenic activity or affinity to EGFR is the most promising because it is less likely to be affected by EGFR and can be deliver into the pancreas where the differentiation activity of BTC is most important. The concentration of the competitor causing a 50% binding inhibition (IC50) was estimated for each derivative from the curve represented in Fig. 8. The relative binding affinity was calculated from IC50 values compared with that of BTC80. BTC80 bound to EGFR on A431 cells with an IC50 value of 1.2 nm. The IC50 values and relative activity for BTC76, BTC2–76, and BTC24–76 were 95 nm (1.3%), 38 nm (3.2%), and 11 nm (10.9%), respectively. As these results indicate, BTC76 has decreased mitogenic activity and binding affinity to EGFR, and it is in the preferred form for being a promising therapeutic candidate. Similarly, the effective concentration of each derivative resulting in 50% maximal differentiation of AR42J cells (EC50) was estimated for each derivative from the curve represented in Fig. 9. The relative differentiation activity for each derivative was calculated by comparison of this value with that of BTC80. BTC80 differentiated AR42J cells into insulin-secreting cells with an EC50 value of 0.2 nm. The EC50 values and relative activity for BTC76, BTC2–76, and BTC24–76 were 0.6 nm (33.3%), 0.2 nm (100%), and 0.08 nm (250%), respectively. The binding affinity of BTC76 was reduced to 1/100 of that of BTC80, whereas the differentiation activity was reduced only to one third that of BTC80. The truncation of the N terminus of BTC76 showed higher affinities to EGFR than BTC76. The affinities are 1/30 (BTC2–76) and 1/10 (BTC24–76) that of BTC80. The differentiation activity also increased: BTC2–76 has the same activity as BTC80 and BTC24–76 has 2.5 times the activity of BTC80. These values and the calculated ratio of the differentiation activity to the binding affinity to EGFR are listed in Table I.Figure 9AR42J cells differentiation assay ofBTCand theBTCderivatives BTC76, BTC2–76, and BTC24–76 by AP-reporter assay.

Differentiation/binding = relative differentiation activity/relative binding affinity. The ratio of the differentiation activity to the binding affinity to EGFR of the derivatives BTC76, BTC2–76, and BTC24–76 were all in excess of 20. Although the differentiation activity and the binding affinity to EGFR of each derivative differ with the status of the N terminus, the extent of the separation of the differentiation activity from the binding affinity does not differ. Regarding the site specific mutation of Leu47 of EGF, the affinity to EGFR decreased drastically but the reduction in mitogenic activity was lower (35Matsunami, R. K., Yette, M. L., Stevens, A., Niyogi, S. K. (1991) J. Cell. Biochem. 46242–46249.Google Scholar). While the truncation of the C-terminal peptide of BTC drastically decreased both activities, the reduction of the mitogenic activity was more drastic than that of the binding affinity to EGFR. Further characterization of these differences will yield a better understanding of their binding and signaling mechanisms. We segregated the two activities of BTC while maintaining the differentiation activity and decreasing the mitogenic activity. The receptors of BTC reported are ErbB-1 homodimer, ErbB-4 homodimer, and heterodimers including ErbB-1 or ErbB-4 as well as ErbB2/ErbB3 (41Riese D.J. Bermingham Y. Van Raaij T.M. Buckley S.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6809-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies have suggested the possible existence of a specific receptor for BTC, besides the known ErbB family, in AR42J cells (45Ishiyama N. Kanzaki M. Seno M. Yamada H. Kobayashi I. Kojima I. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-terminal peptides greatly decreased the affinity to ErbB-1 with little effect on the affinity to ErbB-4 or the specific receptor of BTC on AR42J cells. Alterations in the conformation of BTC and BTC derivatives may also be useful in future research on receptor binding. Further, crystallographic investigations of BTC80 and BTC76 may prove useful. In the present study, we produced both mutations and deletions of amino acid residues. The truncated-type derivatives are more promising as a therapeutic tool than the derivatives having one or more mutated amino acid residues because the former are free from risk of immunogenicity and antigenicity. BTC80 was previously shown to improve glucose tolerance in a mouse model (12Yamamoto K. Miyagawa J. Waguri M. Sasada R. Igarashi K,. Li M. Nammo T. Moriwaki M. Imagawa A. Yamagata K. Nakajima H,. Namba M. Tochino Y. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the BTC derivatives are expected to improve tolerance even more effectively than BTC80 because of their decreased affinity to the EGF receptor. Since the truncated-type derivatives with high differentiation activity are composed of the amino acid sequence that exists in the mature BTC, such derivative might be generated naturally by proteolytic digestion of BTC80 in vivo. It is our hope that the present findings will lead to the discovery of a novel biological function of BTC and, perhaps, to the development of BTC as a therapeutic tool for diabetes. We thank Dr. Y. Sumino and Dr. H. Sawada for their continuing encouragement."
