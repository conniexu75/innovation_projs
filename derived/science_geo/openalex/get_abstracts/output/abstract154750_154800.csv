https://openalex.org/W1626008731,"Xylella fastidiosa is a fastidious, xylem-limited bacterium that causes a range of economically important plant diseases. Here we report the complete genome sequence of X. fastidiosa clone 9a5c, which causes citrus variegated chlorosis--a serious disease of orange trees. The genome comprises a 52.7% GC-rich 2,679,305-base-pair (bp) circular chromosome and two plasmids of 51,158 bp and 1,285 bp. We can assign putative functions to 47% of the 2,904 predicted coding regions. Efficient metabolic functions are predicted, with sugars as the principal energy and carbon source, supporting existence in the nutrient-poor xylem sap. The mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and virulence involve toxins, antibiotics and ion sequestration systems, as well as bacterium-bacterium and bacterium-host interactions mediated by a range of proteins. Orthologues of some of these proteins have only been identified in animal and human pathogens; their presence in X. fastidiosa indicates that the molecular basis for bacterial pathogenicity is both conserved and independent of host. At least 83 genes are bacteriophage-derived and include virulence-associated genes from other bacteria, providing direct evidence of phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer."

Harmonics that extend up to orders of about 300 have been reported4,5, some corresponding to photon energies in excess of 500 eV. Because this technique is simple to implement and generates coherent, laser-like, soft X-ray beams, it is currently being developed for applications in science and technology; these include probing the dynamics in chemical and materials systems6 and imaging7. Here we report that by carefully tailoring the shape8 of intense light pulses, we can control9,10 the interaction of light with an atom during ionization, improving the efficiency of X-ray generation by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate that it is possible to tune the spectral characteristics of the emitted radiation, and to steer the interaction between different orders of nonlinear processes."

https://openalex.org/W1983372621,"Tyrosine nitration is a widely used marker of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) produced from the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide. Pfeiffer and Mayer (Pfeiffer, S., and Mayer, B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27280–27285) reported that superoxide produced from hypoxanthine plus xanthine oxidase in combination with nitric oxide produced from spermine NONOate did not nitrate tyrosine at neutral pH. They suggested that nitric oxide and superoxide at neutral pH form a less reactive intermediate distinct from preformed alkaline peroxynitrite that does not nitrate tyrosine. Using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer to rapidly mix potassium superoxide with nitric oxide at pH 7.4, we report that an intermediate spectrally and kinetically identical to preformed alkalinecis-peroxynitrite was formed in 100% yield. Furthermore, this intermediate nitrated tyrosine in the same yield and at the same rate as preformed peroxynitrite. Equivalent concentrations of nitric oxide under aerobic conditions in the absence of superoxide did not produce detectable concentrations of nitrotyrosine. Carbon dioxide increased the efficiency of nitration by nitric oxide plus superoxide to the same extent as peroxynitrite. In experiments using xanthine oxidase as a source of superoxide, tyrosine nitration was substantially inhibited by urate formed from hypoxanthine oxidation, which was sufficient to account for the lack of tyrosine nitration previously reported. We conclude that peroxynitrite formed from the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide at physiological pH remains an important species responsible for tyrosine nitration in vivo. Tyrosine nitration is a widely used marker of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) produced from the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide. Pfeiffer and Mayer (Pfeiffer, S., and Mayer, B. (1998) J. Biol.

We conclude that peroxynitrite formed from the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide at physiological pH remains an important species responsible for tyrosine nitration in vivo. In the decade since its discovery, nitric oxide has been shown to have multiple physiological actions and is implicated in the pathology of a wide range of diseases. However, nitric oxide itself is neither highly reactive nor particularly toxic, but rather forms secondary oxidants responsible for tissue injury. A major pathway that enhances the toxicity of nitric oxide is the near diffusion-limited reaction with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). One of the most easily identified products of peroxynitrite attack on proteins is 3-nitrotyrosine (2Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Nitrotyrosine has been identified in human atherosclerosis, pulmonary and heart disease, acute and chronic kidney rejection, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3Beckman J.S.

Quantitatively, the amount of nitration in human diseased tissues can be surprisingly high. Circulating levels of free nitrotyrosine as high as 120 μm have been found in septic patients in renal failure (21Fukuyama N. Takebayashi Y. Hida M. Ishida H. Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). From 1 to 3% of tyrosine in spinal cords of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients is nitrated (22Ferrante R.J. Shinobu L.A.

The mechanisms by which tyrosine is nitrated in vivo remain an area of active investigation and controversy (2Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 24Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Most experiments have used preformed alkaline peroxynitrite, which can be commercially purchased or easily synthesized by a variety of methods (26Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 269: 296-302Crossref Google Scholar, 27Pryor W.A. Cueto R. Jin X. Koppenol W.H. Ngu-Schwemlein M. Squadrito G.L. Uppu P.L. Uppu R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite in alkaline solution is present only in thecis conformation (28Tsai J.-H.M. Harrison J.G. Martin J.C. Hamilton T.P. van der Woerd M. Jablonsky M.J. Beckman J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4115-4116Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Tsai H.-H. Hamilton T.P. Tsai J.-H. van der Woerd M. Harrison J.G. Jablonsky M.J. Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 15087-15095Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which contributes to the unusual stability of peroxynitrite by preventing the rearrangement of the terminal oxygen to form nitrate (NO3−). Curiously, peroxynitrite in the solid state is entirely in thecis conformation (28Tsai J.-H.M. Harrison J.G. Martin J.C. Hamilton T.P. van der Woerd M. Jablonsky M.J. Beckman J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4115-4116Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Lo W.J. Lee Y.P. Tsai J.H. Tsai H.H. Hamilton T.P. Harrison J.G. Beckman J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 4026-4034Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the tetramethylammonium salt of peroxynitrite has recently been determined and was also in the cis conformation (31Worle M. Latal P. Kissner R. Nesper R. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that nitric oxide plus superoxide reacting at neutral pH might form peroxynitrite in a different conformation or in an excited electronic state that could be substantially less reactive than preformed cis-peroxynitrite (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Co-generation of superoxide and nitric oxide is experimentally difficult to control. The products and reactants used to generate superoxide and nitric oxide can competitively inhibit tyrosine nitration (32Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merényi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For example, urate produced by xanthine oxidase is a strong antioxidant and decreases both dihydrorhodamine oxidation and phenolic nitration by peroxynitrite (33Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 34Skinner K.A. Crow J.P. Skinner H.B. Chandler R.T. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A second issue is the limited availability of dissolved oxygen in buffer, which is generally in the range of 200–250 μm depending upon ionic strength and temperature. Both xanthine oxidase and SIN-1 can quickly make a solution anaerobic, thereby stopping superoxide production unless special precautions are taken to refresh oxygen supplies (35Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, increased nitration of tyrosine in cellular proteins by co-generation of nitric oxide plus superoxide has been demonstrated by a number of laboratories (7Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 18Zou M.-H. Ullrich V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 36Haddad I.Y. Crow J.P. Hu P. Ye Y.Z. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L242-L249PubMed Google Scholar). Co-generation of nitric oxide and superoxide has been shown to be equally toxic or slightly more toxic than the bolus addition of peroxynitrite to bacteria and cultured cells (35Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,37Shin J.T. Barbeito L. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, Pfeiffer and Mayer (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that the co-generation of superoxide from xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide from spermine NONOate yielded far less nitrotyrosine than produced by preformed alkaline peroxynitrite. They confirmed the rate of peroxynitrite formation by monitoring the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine. To explain the apparent lack of nitration, Pfeiffer and Mayer (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) proposed that superoxide and nitric oxide react at neutral pH following a pathway whose intermediate products decay without nitrating tyrosine. To address whether peroxynitrite was formed from nitric oxide reacting with superoxide at neutral pH, we developed a stopped-flow method to mix potassium superoxide with nitric oxide in phosphate buffer. We report that this resulted in the stoichiometric formation of peroxynitrite, which gave the same yields of nitrotyrosine as with preformed alkaline peroxynitrite. Xanthine oxidase was purchased from CalBiochem (La Jolla, Ca). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All water was deionized and had a conductivity greater than 18 megaohms. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was dried over 3-Å molecular sieves and used to dissolve potassium superoxide (KO2). Alkaline peroxynitrite was synthesized from acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide as described previously (38Beckman J.S. Wink D.A. Crow J.P. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester1996: 61-70Google Scholar). Generally, hydrogen peroxide was not removed by treatment with manganese dioxide since it did not interfere in the present assays. To investigate whether peroxynitrite was generated at neutral pH, we utilized an SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom) to rapidly mix superoxide dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO with nitric oxide dissolved in anaerobic phosphate buffer. The stopped-flow spectrophotometer was fitted with two different sized drive syringes to minimize the final concentration of Me2SO. A 100-μl drive syringe holding Me2SO/KO2 was placed in the left most mixing port of the stopped-flow, while a second 2.5-ml syringe contained nitric oxide in anaerobic buffer (Fig.1). Because of the 25-fold dilution of Me2SO/KO2 with the asymmetric mixing in the stopped-flow cuvette, the final Me2SO concentration was 0.5m. A stock solution of KO2 was prepared by adding an excess of KO2 (5 g) to 5 ml of Me2SO, strongly mixed with a vortex mixer for 1 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove excess solid KO2. This yielded a stock concentration of approximately 3.6 mm KO2 in Me2SO. Solid KO2 is caustic and potentially combustible, requiring appropriate caution in handling and waste disposal. The final concentration of superoxide in the stopped-flow cell was determined by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c substituted for nitric oxide in drive syringe B (Fig. 1). A light-path of 2 mm was used due to the strong absorption of cytochrome c. The smaller drive syringe A was filled with Me2SO/KO2 and the larger syringe was filled with 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 200 μm cytochrome c and the reaction was followed at 550 nm (Δε550 nm = 21 mm−1cm−1). An apparent rate of 1 × 106m−1 s−1 was obtained from the converted reduction traces by non-linear fit of a second order equation and was consistent with that previously determined by pulse radiolysis (39Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To work with nitric oxide in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, solutions in the 2.5-ml syringe were carefully maintained under anaerobic conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. A tonometer designed for anaerobic work was fitted to the loading port of drive syringe B. Both the bottom of the drive syringes and the nitric oxide tonometer junction were shrouded with a continuous flow of nitrogen to minimize oxygen leakage into the drive syringes (Fig. 1). In addition, the water bath was continuously bubbled with nitrogen. Sodium dithionite (500 mg) was also directly added to the water in the bath to further scavenge residual oxygen. Buffer in the tonometer was bubbled with helium for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide before addition of nitric oxide. Residual carbon dioxide dissolved in non-sparged buffers increased tyrosine nitration to a variable extent by 1–2-fold. The stock buffer was 104 mmsodium phosphate plus 104 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at pH 7.37. Nitric oxide was added from a saturated stock solution to sparged buffer in the tonometer and mixed by repeatedly drawing the NO solution in and out of drive syringe B. The nitric oxide stock solution was prepared by bubbling 100 ml of helium-sparged 104 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.37, at room temperature in a 300-ml gas sampling tube (Fisher Scientific Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) with 100% nitric oxide gas for 5 min. The nitric oxide solution was determined to be 1.32 mm by measuring the oxidation of 6 μm oxy-hemoglobin tetramer to met-hemoglobin (40Kelm M. Dahmann R. Wink D. Feelisch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9922-9932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The differential extinction coefficient at 401 nm of 52.1 mm−1cm−1 was used to calculate the amount ofmet-hemoglobin formed (40Kelm M. Dahmann R. Wink D. Feelisch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9922-9932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The dissolved nitric oxide concentration was less than in distilled water due to the increased ionic strength of the buffer. The concentration of nitric oxide after dilution in the stopped-flow tonometer was confirmed by removing a small amount of the solution via a gas-tight Hamilton syringe fitted with a cannula for assay with oxy-hemoglobin. To study the nitration of tyrosine, we added 1.04 mmtyrosine to the buffer in the tonometer before adding nitric oxide. There was no detectable nitrotyrosine formation in this solution for as long as 4 h. To study the effects of dissolved CO2, we added a final concentration of 26 mm sodium bicarbonate to sparged buffer before addition of nitric oxide. The bicarbonate-containing buffer was then sparged briefly with helium to remove any oxygen introduced with the bicarbonate. The bicarbonate was then allowed to re-establish equilibrium with free CO2 for 2 min before addition of nitric oxide. The final pH of all buffers was 7.43, which was measured in the stopped-flow effluent. All stopped-flow reactions were performed at 37 °C. Alkaline stock peroxynitrite was used as a comparison to the nitric oxide/superoxide system by placing alkaline peroxynitrite in the 100-μl drive syringe in place of superoxide. Because peroxynitrite stock solutions are unstable in concentrated Me2SO, we controlled for the effects of Me2SO by adding 0.5m Me2SO into the 2.5-ml drive syringe B with the buffer. Because the mixing chamber in the stopped-flow is not symmetric with respect to the drive syringes, greater mixing artifacts were apparent during the initial mixing but did not interfere with the last 90% of the reaction course. Decay of peroxynitrite anion was followed at 302 nm (1.70 mm−1 cm−1) (41Bohle D.S. Hansert B. Paulson S.C. Smith B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7423-7424Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Formation of nitrotyrosine was observed at 430 nm (3.87 mm−1 cm−1 as determined using nitrotyrosine standards in the stopped-flow instrument under identical reaction conditions). Reaction rates were determined using Applied Photophysics stopped-flow software. The spectrum of the intermediate product from the reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide was constructed from consecutive stopped-flow traces between 250 and 450 nm taken in 5-nm steps. These data plus the initial concentrations of superoxide and nitric oxide were used by a single value decomposition algorithm in the kinetic software Pro-K supplied with the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer to estimate the spectrum and extinction coefficient of the intermediate product generated from superoxide and nitric oxide as a function of wavelength. The spectrum of preformed peroxynitrite decreases at more acidic pH because peroxynitrous acid does not absorb significantly in the near UV. The pK a of peroxynitrite in phosphate buffer is 6.8 (42Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), which was used to calculate the apparent absorption spectrum at pH 7.4 via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pH-adjusted extinction coefficient is thus εpH = εONOO− × 10pH/(10pH+106.8), where εONOO− is the extinction coefficient of peroxynitrite at alkaline pH. At 302 nm, the apparent extinction coefficient for peroxynitrite decreases from 1.7 mm−1 cm−1 (41Bohle D.S. Hansert B. Paulson S.C. Smith B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7423-7424Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) at alkaline pH to 1.36 mm−1 cm−1. We repeated the xanthine oxidase/spermine NONOate co-generation experiments of Pfeiffer and Mayer (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) at 22 °C using 10 milliunits of xanthine oxidase, 1 mm hypoxanthine, 1 mm tyrosine, and 1 mm spermine NONOate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The activity of xanthine oxidase was measured using xanthine and 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to produce 1 μmol of urate min−1at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Urate formation was measured at 292 nm (ε = 1.1 × 104m−1 cm−1) (43Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide was measured by the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm as described above. Dihydrorhodamine oxidation was followed by withdrawing 1-ml aliquots of the xanthine oxidase reaction at timed intervals, adding dihydrorhodamine, and then measuring the rate of increase in absorbance at 550 nm. The accumulation of an inhibitor of tyrosine nitration was monitored by adding 0.5 mmperoxynitrite to aliquots taken at progressively longer times following the addition of xanthine oxidase. Superoxide reacted with nitric oxide at neutral pH to produce an intermediate product with the same spectrum as preformed alkaline peroxynitrite (Fig. 2). The solid line shown in Fig. 2 is not a fitted curve to the experimental data, but rather the spectrum of cis-peroxynitrite at alkaline pH adjusted to account for the 20% peroxynitrous acid present at pH 7.4. Utilizing all of the experimental data in Fig. 2 and the starting concentration of superoxide, a simple irreversible bimolecular reaction was fitted by a single value decomposition algorithm and yielded an extinction coefficient of 1.34 mm−1s−1 at 302 nm for the intermediate product at pH 7.4. As described under “Materials and Methods,” the expected apparent extinction coefficient for peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 is 1.36 mm−1 s−1 when taking into account the 20% peroxynitrous acid present. The formation of the intermediate product was complete within the dead time of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, consistent with the near diffusion-limited rate reported for the reaction of superoxide with nitric oxide (44Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The intermediate product then decomposed at the same rate as preformed peroxynitrite (Fig. 3). The yield of peroxynitrite was 105 ± 9% of the starting superoxide and 101 ± 10% of the nitric oxide concentration (mean ± S.D. from seven separate experiments). These data indicated that peroxynitrite was quantitatively produced at neutral pH in the stopped-flow system. When tyrosine was added to the syringe buffer plus nitric oxide, equimolar nitric oxide plus superoxide produced the same amount of nitrotyrosine and at the same rate as produced by preformed peroxynitrite (Fig. 2). Carbon dioxide present in the buffer accelerated the decomposition of the intermediate product from superoxide and nitric oxide (Fig. 4) and increased the yield of nitrotyrosine by 3–4-fold to the same extent as preformed peroxynitrite (Table I). Reducing the initial concentration of nitric oxide resulted in a proportional decrease in the formation of peroxynitrite and nitrotyrosine. In the absence of superoxide, even saturated solutions of nitric oxide mixed with 100% oxygen-saturated phosphate buffer containing 1 mm tyrosine did not yield detectable nitrotyrosine after as long as 2000 s. Me2SO, necessary to dissolve superoxide, did not interfere with nitration by peroxynitrite in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide as previously reported (45Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H.

Consistent with the results of Pfeiffer and Mayer (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we have observed little nitration of free tyrosine using hypoxanthine plus xanthine oxidase with spermine NONOate to generate superoxide and nitric oxide. Hypoxanthine, xanthine oxidase, and spermine NONOate tested separately did not interfere with nitration by bolus additions of peroxynitrite. However, hypoxanthine is oxidized to urate by xanthine oxidase and urate is known to inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated nitration (47Skinner K.A. White C.R. Patel R. Tan S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Darley-Usmar V. Parks D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions using 10 milliunits of xanthine oxidase, urate was formed from hypoxanthine at a rate of 5.2 μmmin−1 and superoxide was produced at 6.7 μmmin−1. Hypoxanthine donates four electrons to xanthine oxidase, which under our experimental conditions resulted in 32% univalent reduction of oxygen to superoxide. The remaining 68% was consumed by direct divalent reduction of oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide as previously demonstrated by Fridovich (43Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When bolus additions of preformed peroxynitrite were made to the xanthine oxidase reaction, tyrosine nitration was progressively inhibited as urate accumulated in the assay system (Fig. 5). Addition of 50–100 μm urate into the stopped-flow system also strongly inhibited tyrosine nitration to an equal extent with either preformed peroxynitrite or the combination of superoxide and nitric oxide (not shown). Pfeiffer and Mayer (1Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) quantified peroxynitrite formation from xanthine oxidase plus spermine NONOate by measuring the rate of dihydrorhodamine oxidation only at the start of the assay. The oxidation of dihydrorhodamine is known to be strongly inhibited by urate (33Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Immediately after the addition of xanthine oxidase, the rate of dihydrorhodamine oxidation was 1.4 μm/min−1, which corresponds to 4.8 μm/min−1peroxynitrite after correction for"

https://openalex.org/W3104029145,"As a liquid approaches the glass transition, its properties are dominated by local potential minima1,2 in its energy landscape. The liquid experiences localized vibrations in the basins of attraction surrounding the minima, and rearranges via relatively infrequent inter-basin jumps3. As a result, the liquid dynamics at low temperature are related to the system's exploration of its own configuration space. The ‘thermodynamic approach’ to the glass transition considers the reduction in configuration space4,5,6,7,8 explored as the system cools, and predicts that the configurational entropy5,9,10 (a measure of the number of local potential energy minima sampled by the liquid) is related to the diffusion constant. Here we report a stringent test of the thermodynamic approach for liquid water (a convenient system to study because of an anomalous pressure dependence in the diffusion constant). We calculate the configurational entropy at points spanning a large region of the temperature–density plane, using a model11 that reproduces the dynamical anomalies of liquid water. We find that the thermodynamic approach can be used to understand the characteristic dynamic anomalies, and that the diffusive dynamics are governed by the configurational entropy. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic approach might be extended to predict the dynamical behaviour of supercooled liquids in general."

Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Mammals contain two classes of defensins, named α and β, based on the arrangement of cysteines within their sequences. To date, six α-defensins and two β-defensins (hBD11 and hBD2) have been identified in humans. Four of the six α-defensins are sequestered in secretory granules within neutrophils and are termed neutrophil peptides (hNP1–4), whereas the remaining two α-defensins (human α-defensins 5 and 6) are secreted from Paneth cells in the gastrointestinal tract. α-Defensins manifest microbicidal activity only at relatively high concentrations and have a broad spectrum of activity, killing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses (3Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 797: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, β-defensins are inducible, more potent, and selective, killing mainly Gram-negative bacteria and yeast (4Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schröder J.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Both α- and β-defensins also mobilize cells engaged in adaptive immune responses (5Chertov O. Michiel D.F. Xu L. Wang J.M. Tani K.

The microbicidal activity of defensins stems from the permeabilization of anionic lipid bilayers and the subsequent release of cellular contents (7Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S. Ganz T.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interactions between defensins and bacterial membranes are governed mainly by electrostatic forces (11Fujii G. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One mechanism of permeabilization is thought to involve the formation of ion pores in bacterial membranes (12Kagan B.L. Selsted M.E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 13Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The existence of pores and the estimation of their dimensions are based on studies of ion conductance through the bilayer (14Cociancich S. Ghazi A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19239-19245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gálvez A. Maqueda M. Martı́nez-Bueno M. Valdivia E. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24224-24233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A physical model of such a pore has been constructed based on the x-ray structure of hNP3 (11Fujii G. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H.

Based on its amphiphilic charge distribution and dimeric shape, 12 monomers of hNP3 were arranged to form a membrane-spanning pore of ∼20 Å inner diameter (13Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 16Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24224-24233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A second model has also been proposed for other small cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as magainins (18Ludtke S.J. He K. Heller W.T. Harroun T.A. Yang L. Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13723-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and cecropins (19Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). According to this model (sometimes called the “carpet” model), the structural aspects of the interaction between peptides and the microbial membrane are of secondary importance. Rather than forming distinct and structurally stable ion pores, these peptides are thought to aggregate into positively charged patches that neutralize anionic lipid headgroups of the membrane over a wide area around the peptides. This neutralization disrupts the integrity of the lipid bilayer, causing transient gaps to arise and allowing ions (and larger molecules, depending on the extent of local disruption) to permeate the membrane (20Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Except for the x-ray structure of hNP3, no other oligomeric structures of defensins have been determined. Because oligomerization of defensins may occur only at elevated protein concentrations (>3 mm) and possibly in the sterically constraining environment of a bacterial membrane, a crystalline environment is probably suitable for studying the quaternary structure of defensins. To investigate the importance of the structure for the antimicrobial activity of hBD2, we solved the x-ray structure of this defensin by using a novel method of derivatizing the protein crystals, followed by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing protocol. Additionally, we studied the permeabilization of large unilamellar vesicles by native and reductively alkylated hBD2, as well as the oligomerization of native hBD2 in solution. Protein was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The homogeneity of the preparation was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop diffusion with equal volumes of concentrated protein (30 mg/ml after dissolving lyophilized protein in water) and reservoir solution containing 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 mLi2SO4. Two crystal forms grew together in the same hanging drops. The orthorhombic form belongs to space group P21212 with cell constants a = 50.05 Å, b = 103.91 Å, and c = 28.27 Å. The monoclinic form belongs to space group P21 with cell constants a = 54.53 Å, b = 79.95 Å, c = 74.27 Å, and β = 105.30°. Individual crystal forms could be identified by their morphologies, with the orthorhombic form growing as rods and the monoclinic forms growing as square plates. The crystal forms were propagated and grown by macroseeding hanging drops preequilibrated to 20% PEG 4000, 0.066m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.133 mLi2SO4 with washed seed crystals of the intended form. The monoclinic form was the preferred form. Data were collected using flash-frozen crystals. Prior to freezing in the 100 K nitrogen stream, crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing 36% PEG 4000, 0.16 m MOPS (pH 7.1), 0.32m Li2SO4, 10% glycerol for approximately 60 s. Native and derivative data of both crystal forms were collected at beamline X9B (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. CCD images were indexed, processed, merged, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Orthorhombic form crystals were soaked briefly (60 s) against KBr and KI (0.25 m) in the cryoprotectant solution immediately prior to freezing in the nitrogen stream and diffraction experiments (22Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MAD data at three wavelengths (see Table I) were collected for the KBr-soaked crystal, and one data set was collected at 1.54 Å for the KI-soaked crystal. The anomalous differences calculated by PHASES (23Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) were 2.1% (based on F 2) and 1.5% (based on F) (1.4-Å resolution) for the KBr-soaked crystal data set, and 4.1% (based on F 2) and 2.7% (based onF) (1.9-Å resolution) for the KI-soaked crystal. Bromide and iodide sites were located from the anomalous differences using SHELXS (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The highest nine E-map peaks from the KBr peak wavelength anomalous data were seen to be almost identical with those from the KI anomalous data, and so the same set of sites was used in refinement of the anomalous scatterer sites and phase generation. Anomalous scatterer sites were refined for each of the four data sets, and initial phases were generated for data from 24- to 2.0-Å resolution using MLPHARE (25Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar). The phases were then extended to 1.4 Å and refined with a solvent content of 35% using DM (26Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). Because the handedness of the calculated phases was unknown, both the original positions of the sites (x, y,z) and their negative inversions (−x, −y, −z) were refined. Although the resulting figures of merit for both coordinate sets were indistinguishable, the rate of convergence to a final solution for the correct set of coordinates using DM was significantly faster compared with its enantiomorph. The final map from phase refinement and solvent flattening was easily interpretable. An initial model was built automatically using the program ARP/wARP (27Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) by placing single atoms (oxygen atoms) into electron density peaks. The protein model was then automatically built based on the positions of the oxygen atoms, and the structure factors were improved by combining the initial experimental phases with those calculated from the model. In total, 1,334 atoms were built into the map (out of a total 1,424, or ∼94% of the final model). The orthorhombic form model was completed using O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refined to 1.35 Å using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), followed by SHELXL (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). In the final steps, anisotropic B factors for all atoms were individually refined, and 194 water molecules and one sulfate ion were added. TheR value for all reflections (20–1.35 Å) is 15.9% (R free 23.5%). The solution of the monoclinic form was obtained by molecular replacement technique using AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Based on the estimated solvent content and strong noncrystallographic 422 symmetry seen in Patterson self-rotations of the monomeric crystal form, 16 independent monomers were expected to reside within the a.u. Because of the conservation of dimeric interfaces between the AB and CD dimers within the orthorhombic crystal form, a dimer containing chains A and B of the orthorhombic form was used as the search model. Searches using various resolution ranges were only successful in locating six of the eight dimers within the a.u. The best results were obtained for the resolution range 15–3.8 Å. The remaining two dimers were located on inspection of the resulting ‖Fo ‖ − ‖Fc ‖ maps, and by applying noncrystallographic transformations onto those chains already found. The 16 monomers of the monoclinic model were positioned as rigid bodies, then refined to 1.7-Å resolution in cycles of least-squares minimization and B factor refinement using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr.

Water molecules were placed automatically with a density cutoff of 2.5 ς and hydrogen bonding constraints using the program SHELXL (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R.

The final monoclinic model contains 814 water molecules and 5 sulfate ions were added. The R value for all reflections (25–1.7 Å) is 18.8% (Rfree 25.5%). hBD2 was dissolved in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) to 30 mg/ml. The protein was cleared by centrifugation and filtered using a 0.05-μm filter immediately prior to light-scattering measurements. A DynaPro-801 instrument was used for the measurements, and multicomponent analysis was performed using the software provided with the instrument. Large unilamellar vesicles were formed by extrusion through 0.2-μm nucleopore polycarbonate membranes under nitrogen pressure as described (13Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and loaded with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (376 Da) fluorescein dextran (3 or 10 kDa). All reagents were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The reduction and carboxyamidomethylation of hBD2 were performed as described (31Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Crossref Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of modified hBD2 revealed alkylation of all six cysteine residues. To show that the activity of hBD2 is dependent not on charge alone but also on its native structure, we performed experiments on the permeabilization of artificial lipid vesicles, using both native and reduced hBD2. During our experiments, native hBD2 (0.125 μm) induced a 50% release of a small (400 Da) marker from large unilamellar vesicles made from anionic lipid palmitoyloleoylphosphatidyglycerol. Under these conditions, about 20% of 3-kDa dextran and less than 5% of 10-kDa dextran were released. The effect of hBD2 was lipid dependent; the increase in the proportion of neutral palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine led to a dramatically decreased sensitivity to hBD2, indicating the electrostatic nature of hBD2 interaction with lipids. The correct fold of hBD2 is clearly required for this effect, because hBD2 linearized by disulfide bond reduction and carboxyamidomethylation was ineffective even at concentrations that resulted in 100% release of the vesicle contents induced by native hBD2. These results indicate that both the native structure of hBD2 and its charge interaction with the membrane are critical for the membrane permeabilizing activity of this protein. The crystal structure of the orthorhombic form was solved by the MAD technique, using an anomalous signal originating from bromide and iodide anions soaked into the crystals of the hBD2 derivatives. The method that we used to derivatize the protein has been successfully applied to several test proteins (22Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, hBD2 is one of the first proteins of unknown structure to be solved using this technique. The electron density map determined from experimentally derived phases was of excellent quality (Fig.1), and approximately 90% of the final structure could be automatically traced from the initial map. The remainder of the structure was built using the x-ray data collected for the native hBD2 crystal at 1.35-Å resolution. Four individual protein chains (A–D) are located within the asymmetric unit (a.u.), and all residues, except two C-terminal proline residues of the B and C chains, are traceable in the final electron density maps. The a.u. of the monoclinic form of hBD2 has a volume nearly 4 times that of the orthorhombic form. Therefore, taking into account the possible solvent contents, we assumed that hBD2 contains 14–20 monomers per a.u. Because the four monomers of the orthorhombic form exist as two topologically identical dimers within the a.u., we expected approximately eight of such dimers to be present in the a.u. of the monoclinic form. We solved phases of the monoclinic form by using the molecular replacement technique, which confirmed the presence of 16 monomers per a.u. All residues for the 16 monomers (A–P) could be easily placed in the electron density, and the structure was refined to 1.7-Å resolution. Data and refinement statistics are shown in TableI. After soaking crystals in KBr- and KI-containing solutions (immediately prior to flash freezing and data collection), bromide and iodide anions bind to similar sites on the surface of hBD2. To investigate in more detail the anion-binding sites, after calculating phases from the MAD data and refining the orthorhombic structure, we refined the coordinates of the complete model (including halide anions) against the derivative x-ray data to the maximum resolution (1.4 and 1.9 Å, respectively), using the program CNS. The anion-binding sites are located within cavities and depressions formed by mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments. Coordination is mainly through van der Waals contacts, with few ionic interactions. The occupancies of the ions are relatively low (20–40% as refined by MLPHARE (Ref. 25Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar); during the CNS refinement, these occupancies were fixed to 0.5 (Ref. 29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar)). Despite low occupancies, the high atomic numbers of the halide anions resulted in clear peaks in electron density maps calculated from the derivative x-ray data. Additionally, even though only a moderate concentration (0.25m) of KBr and KI was used in our experiments (due to problems of crystal stability in the resulting soak solution), the successful derivatization and phasing were the combined result of such factors as the overall positive charge of the protein, attracting anions from the bulk solvent, and the high resolution of anomalous data. The use of surface-bound halide anions to solve the phase problem of protein crystallography provides a simpler, relatively universal, and rapid method of solving crystal structures. Because only moderate concentrations of halides are necessary, this approach can be applied to a wide range of protein crystals. Increasing the concentration of halide anions probably would improve the strength of the anomalous signal sufficiently to allow successful structure solution using significantly lower resolution x-ray data. The hBD2 monomer displays a fold similar to that of hNP3 (17Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and bovine β-defensin-12 (bBD12) (32Zimmermann G.R. Legault P. Selsted M.E. Pardi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13663-13671Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), with a three-stranded β-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bonds (Fig.2 a). We found that hBD2 contains an additional secondary-structure element, an α-helical region spanning residues Pro5–Lys10, held against the sheet by a disulfide bond formed between Cys8 and Cys37. The electron density corresponding to the majority of the structure is very well defined, and several residues could be refined in multiple conformations. Residues Arg22 and Arg23 are highly flexible, as is the entire β-turn between strands β1 and β2. The C termini are also mobile, with Lys39, Lys40, and Pro41 having elevated B factors (>40 Å2). Formation of the conserved dimer is assisted by interactions between strands β1 of both monomers, resulting in the formation of a six-stranded β-sheet. This interaction, however, only extends through two hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of Cys15(Fig. 2 b). We postulate that the presence of Pro17 prevents more extensive hydrogen bonding within the intermolecular sheet, thereby lowering the stability of this motif. The formation of the dimer buries 1,000–1,200 Å2, or on average 18.4% of the total surface area of the monomer, and the interface is flat and mainly hydrophobic in nature. Residues Pro5, Ala13, Ile14, Cys15, His16, and Pro17 make the majority of van der Waals contacts across the dimer interface. The monoclinic form contains two octameric assemblies within the a.u., each composed of four hBD2 dimers arranged with an approximately 422 symmetry (Fig. 3 a). The four monomers in the orthorhombic form create one half of the octameric assembly; the full octamer is generated by applying a crystallographic two-fold to the contents of the a.u. Thus, the octameric oligomer is conserved across two unique crystal forms. The octamer is formed by a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding contacts, with residues Gly1, Asp4, Thr7, Lys10, Gly31, Leu32, Pro33, and Lys39 creating most of the contacts. The octamer is shaped like a distorted square, and is roughly 25 Å × 25 Å × 50 Å. Four inner monomers make up the majority of the octameric interfaces (1, 150–1, 800 Å2, or on average 24% of the molecular surface area of the isolated monomer), with the dimer-related outer monomers making fewer contacts (200–500 Å2, or on average 7% of the molecular surface area of the monomer). Dynamic light-scattering experiments performed on concentrated solutions of hBD2 showed a mixture of aggregated molecules, mostly populated by dimers. This result indicates that octamer formation requires additional factors. These may be, for example, the stabilizing interactions with a negatively charged membrane. The distribution of temperature factors across the octamer, lowest in the center of the octamer and increasing toward the edges, resembles the dynamic properties of many globular proteins in solution and cannot be correlated with interactions resulting from crystal formation. Additionally, a search of the Protein Data Bank for x-ray structures of proteins (except viruses) consisting of 12 or more independent molecules in the a.u. resulted in only six such structures. In all cases, multimeric molecules found in the a.u. were proven to represent biologically relevant assemblies. Therefore, it is quite likely that the hBD2 octamers common to both crystal forms correspond to stable, naturally forming oligomers of this protein. The core of the octamer is created by the N termini of the four inner monomers (chains A, C, E, G, and I, K, M, O in the monoclinic form, and chains A and C in the octameric form) (Fig. 3 a). Gly1, Gly3, Asp4 (the only acidic residue in the protein), and Thr7 create a constellation of hydrogen bonds that close the core of the octamer to solvent movement. The octamer is thus solid, and no solvent-accessible pore or channel is evident without significant movements of the protein backbone in this region. However, there are six water molecules trapped within the core of the octamer. Their mobilities are minimal, as deduced by their lowB factors, conservation in position among the three independent octamers, and coordination between protein atoms. Four of these water molecules create a cavity within the core of the octamer (Fig. 3 b). The α-helical regions of hBD2 seem to play a key role in formation of the"

There is growing evidence that epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) in a phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner, but it is not yet clear which Akt isoforms are involved in this signal transduction pathway. We investigated the functional regulation of three Akt isoforms, Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ, in esophageal cancer cells where EGFR is frequently overexpressed. Upon EGF simulation, phosphorylation of Akt1 at the Ser-473 residue was remarkably induced. This result was corroborated by in vitro Akt kinase assays using glycogen synthase kinase 3β as the substrate. PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, significantly blocked the Akt kinase activity induced by EGF. Akt2 activity was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Robust activation of Akt2 by EGF was observed in some cell lines in a PI3K-dependent manner. EGF-induced Akt3 activation was demonstrated by Ser-472 phosphorylation of Akt3 but in a restrictive fashion. In aggregate, EGF-mediated activation of Akt isoforms is overlapping and distinctive. The mechanism by which EGFR recruits the PI3K/Akt pathway was in part differentially regulated at the level of Ras but independent of heterodimerization of EGFR with either ErbB2 or ErbB3 based upon functional dissection of pathways in esophageal cancer cell lines.

Overexpression of EGFR has been reported in a number of human cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (1Itakura Y. Sasano H. Shiga C. Furukawa Y. Shiga K. Mori S. Nagura H.

By contrast, ErbB2 overexpression has been noted in approximately 10- 25% of human esophageal carcinomas (2Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K.

Korc M. Buchler M.W. World J. Surg. 1999; 23: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EGFR overexpression is often associated with increased production of ligands, which bind EGFR, thereby creating an autocrine loop, which facilitates tumor growth (6Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways are two major downstream pathways initiated by the activation of EGFR (7Busse D. Doughty R.S.

Akt (also named protein kinase B (PKB) and RAC protein kinase) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with homology to protein kinases A and C (8Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 9Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Jones P.F.

Three mammalian isoforms (Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ) have been cloned thus far. Akt2 and Akt3 have 81 and 83% homology in amino acid sequences with Akt1, respectively (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The Thr-308 residue in the kinase domain and Ser-473 residue in the tail domain of Akt1 need to be phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-2 (PDK2), respectively, for its maximal activation. The corresponding phosphorylation sites in Akt2 (Thr-309 and Ser-474) and Akt3 (Thr-305 and Ser-472) have been identified, and Akt2 and Akt3 appear also to be regulated by PDK1 and PDK2 (12Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A limited number of studies of the expression pattern of the three Akt isoforms reveal Akt1 and Akt2 are ubiquitous, whereas Akt3 is expressed predominantly in brain, heart, and kidney (13Brodbeck D.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and ovarian cancer cells (52Liu A.X. Testa J.R. Hamilton T.C. Jove R. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2973-2977PubMed Google Scholar). Since most studies focus on the Akt1 isoform or have not discriminated among the differences between the three Akt isoforms, it is still unclear which Akt isoform(s) can be activated upon ligand stimulation under physiological conditions. Therefore, we sought to investigate the regulation of the three mammalian Akt isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, in cells derived from human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma where EGFR can be overexpressed. Furthermore, we sought to elucidate whether EGFR-mediated activation of the Akt isoforms requires heterodimerization of members of the ErbB receptors or, alternatively, recruits the Ras pathway. We have found that human esophageal cancer cells can be categorized into three groups as follows: cells in which EGF stimulation activates all three Akt isoforms; cells in which EGF stimulation activates Akt1 and Akt2 but not Akt3; and cells in which EGF stimulation activates only Akt1. Functionally, EGFR activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway differentially in a Ras-dependent manner but ErbB2- and ErbB3-independent fashion in the cells. TE-1, TE-2, TE-3, TE-5, TE-6, TE-8, TE-9, TE-10, TE-11, TE-12, TE-15, T.T, HCE-4, and HCE-7 cells are human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines; HaCaT cells are immortalized skin keratinocytes; MCF-7 cells are human breast cancer cells; A431 cells are epidermoid cancer cells; HepG2 is a liver cancer cell line; and Panc-1 cells are derived from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), andl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell lysates of NIH3T3 cells treated or untreated with PDGF were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Total RNA was prepared as described previously (53Nakagawa H. Zukerberg L. Togawa K. Meltzer S.J. Nishihara T. Rustgi A.K. Cancer (Phila. ). 1995; 76: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was incubated with 5 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 20 °C for 15 min in 50 μl of a reaction consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm KCl. The reaction was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 15 min in the presence of 2.5 mm EDTA. Ten μl of the reaction was mixed with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and on ice for 5 min. Following annealing at 42 °C for 5 min, 200 units of SuperScript II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and further incubated at 42 °C for 50 min in 20 μl of reaction consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was terminated by incubating at 70 °C for 15 min and treated with 2 units of Escherichia coli RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 20 min. For polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the following oligonucleotides were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coraville, IA) and used as primers: 5′-GCTGGACGATAGCTTGGA-3′ (Akt1 sense); 5′-GATGACAGATAGCTGGTG-3′ (Akt1 antisense); 5′-GGCCCCTGATCAGACTCTA-3′ (Akt2 sense); 5′-TCCTCAGTCGTGGAGGAGT-3′ (Akt2 antisense); 5′-GCAAGTGGACGAGAATAAGTCTC-3′ (Akt3 sense); 5′-ACAATGGTGGGCTCATGACTTCC-3′ (Akt3 antisense); 5′-AGGAAGTAGAGCTGGAGCCA-3′ (c-ErbB3 sense); 5′-TTTGAGGTGTGTATCTGGCA-3′ (c-ErbB3 antisense). PCR was carried out for 35 cycles (denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) in a 50 μl reaction mixture consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 200 nm primers, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Fisher), and 2 μl of the cDNA. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. For PCR Southern blot analysis, the Akt3 RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was denatured with 1.5m sodium chloride, 0.5 n sodium hydroxide, neutralized with 1.5 m sodium chloride, 0.5 mTris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting. The blot was fixed by ultraviolet cross-linking with Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An Akt3-specific oligonucleotide, 5′-TGGACATCACCAGTCCTAGCTCT-3′ (Akt3 S2), was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) as a probe and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs). Hybridization was carried out using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 42 °C for 1 h. Subsequent washes were done once at room temperature with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and twice at 42 °C with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). One μg of either a dominant negative ras plasmid (RasAsn-17) (gift from T. Wang) or an empty vector was transiently transfected into 1 × 106/ml cells by a liposome-mediated method using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE and 6 μl of PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After overnight serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse EGF (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min; total cell lysates were obtained, and Western blotting was carried out as described under “Immunodetection of Phospho-Akt and Phospho-GSK3β ” and “Akt2 Mobility Shift Assays.” Antibodies against EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or NeoMarkers (Union City, CA). An anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Sheep anti- Akt1 and -Akt3 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Akt antibodies were generated against the carboxyl-terminal sequences CHFPQFSYSASGTA in Akt1 and CDQTHFPQFSYSASIRE in Akt2. Antibodies specific for Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 and specific for GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser-9 were obtained from New England Biolabs. Monoclonal antibodies against GSK3β and the p85 subunit of PI3K were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Secondary anti-mouse and rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and an anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Subconfluent cells were lysed in ErbB lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Total protein samples (10 μg) were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with anti-ErbB antibodies specific for each of the four ErbB receptors for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in TBST, incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody diluted 1:3,000 in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times in TBST. The signal was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was exposed to Kodak-X-Omat LS film (Kodak). When cells were subconfluent, they were switched to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% fetal bovine serum) overnight (16–18 h) and were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37 °C. For the time course experiment, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. To block the PI3K signaling pathway, cells were pretreated with 100 nmwortmannin (Upstate Biotechnology) or 100 μm LY294002 (Sigma) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 30 min prior to stimulation with EGF. After treatment, cells were lysed in Akt lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and a protease inhibitor tablet). The total cell lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE for the detection of Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 (100 μg/lane) and GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser-9 (10 μg/lane). The transferred proteins on PVDF membranes were probed with the phospho-Akt or phospho-GSK3β antibody (1:1,000) followed by incubation with the anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:3,000) and then immunodetected as described above. The membranes were stripped by exposing them to either 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C or reblotting solution (Re-Blot Western blot Recycling Kit, Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for 10 min at room temperature and reprobed with the anti-Akt1 antibody or anti-GSK3β antibody for confirmation of equal protein loading. Total protein samples (40 μg/lane) prepared in Akt lysis buffer as described above were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE using a tall gel apparatus (Hoefer SE410 Sturdier Vertical Unit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for adequate separation between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Akt2 bands and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The anti-rabbit Akt2 antibody was used at 1:5,000 dilution as a primary antibody for the immunodetection of Akt2. After overnight serum starvation, subconfluent TE-2, TE-5, TE8, TE-9, TE-10, and TE-12 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min and followed by Akt kinase assays. To inhibit the PI3K signaling pathway, subconfluent TE-2, TE-3, TE8, and TE-12 cells were pretreated with 100 nmwortmannin, 100 μm LY294002, or vehicle alone for 30 min prior to stimulation with EGF. The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%. We employed a non-radioactive kinase assay system of Akt (Akt kinase assay kit, New England Biolabs) following the company's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein (150 μg) and were then incubated with cross-linked Akt antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted and washed twice in cell lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2). The pellets were suspended in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of a GSK3 fusion protein (CGPKGPGRRGRRRTSSFAEG) as the substrate and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.03% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred on a PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was done with the phospho-GSK3β antibody raised against Ser-9. The kinase assays were repeated three times in each cell line. The signals were quantified using the NIH Image 1.62 program, and statistical analysis was performed by Scheffe's test, andp < 0.05 was considered significant. TE-8 cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in Akt lysis buffer as described above, and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. TE-8 cells cultured in medium supplemented with 10% serum served as a positive control. The supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of the anti-EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, or p85 antibody or 4 μg of the anti-Akt3 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 5 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times with Akt lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting under the conditions described above. We sought initially to determine the expression of the four ErbB family members in human esophageal cancer cells by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies for each receptor. This was done to assess the levels of each receptor as a basis for the determination of whether there was heterodimerization between receptors that could eventually be involved in the activation of Akt. EGFR was expressed in TE-2, TE-5, TE-8, TE-9, TE-10, TE-12, and HaCaT cells, and the expression level of EGFR in TE-8 and TE-12 cells was comparable to A431 cells that are well established EGFR overexpressing cells (Fig.1). ErbB2 was expressed in TE-2 and TE-5 cells and barely expressed in TE-10 and HaCaT cells (Fig. 1). Although we performed Western blots with an anti-ErbB3 antibody, we were able to detect signals from esophageal cancer cell lines only when immunoprecipitation was employed prior to the immunoblot. The expression level of ErbB3 was much weaker than in A431 cells which are well known ErbB3 expressing cells (data not shown), suggesting that the expression level of ErbB3 in esophageal cancer cells is relatively low. The presence of ErbB3 mRNA in all cell lines was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis using ErbB3-specific primers (data not shown). We could not detect expression of ErbB4 in the esophageal cancer cell lines tested even when immunoprecipitation with an ErbB4 antibody was conducted prior to the immunoblot (data not shown). Akt/PKB is one of the major downstream molecules of EGFR transduced via the PI3K signaling pathway. Since we found EGFR is highly expressed in human esophageal cancer cells, we next examined the expression of the three Akt isoforms in those cell lines. The expression of Akt1 and Akt2 was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis utilizing primers and specific antibodies for each isoform, respectively, and the expression of Akt3 was analyzed by RT-PCR alone since an anti-Akt3-specific antibody useful for Western blot has yet to be generated to our knowledge. As shown in Fig.2, both Akt1 and Akt2 proteins were expressed in the human esophageal cancer cell lines tested. Akt2 expression was ubiquitous, whereas Akt1 expression was variable and even low as in TE-1, HCE-4, and HCE-7 cells. The expression levels of both isoforms did not reveal any obvious correlation with the expression level of EGFR. RT-PCR analysis was consistent with that of the Western blots for Akt1 and Akt2. The Akt1 and Akt2 transcripts were ubiquitous and detected in various cancer cell lines including MCF-7, HepG2, and Panc-1 cells (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, Akt3 mRNA showed cell type-specific expression with negative and positive expression in HepG2 and Panc-1, respectively. Interestingly, Akt3 mRNA revealed specific expression among esophageal cancer cells with high exp"

A total of 35 phage clones that express a peptide sequence that can be hydrolyzed by the recombinant catalytic domain of human collagenase 3 are identified. The translated DNA sequence of these clones reveals highly conserved putative P1, P2, P3 and P1′, P2′, and P3′ subsites of the peptide substrates. Kinetic analysis of synthetic peptide substrates made from human collagenase 3 selected phage clones reveals that some of the substrates are highly active and selective. The most active substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-GPLGMRGL-NH2 (CP), has a k cat/K m value of 4.22 × 106m−1s−1 for hydrolysis by collagenase 3. CP was synthesized as a consensus sequence deduced from the preferred subsites of the aligned 35 phage clones. Peptide substrate CP is 1300-, 11-, and 820-fold selective for human collagenase 3 over the MMPs stromelysin-1, gelatinase B, and collagenase 1, respectively. In addition, cleavage of CP is 37-fold faster than peptide NF derived from the major MMP-processing site in aggrecan. Phage display screening also selected five substrate sequences that share sequence homology with a major MMP cleavage sequence in aggrecan and seven substrate sequences that share sequence homology with the primary collagenase cleavage site of human type II collagen. In addition, putative cleavage sites similar to the consensus sequence are found in human type IV collagen.

Human collagenase 3 degrades type II collagen, the primary collagen in articular cartilage, more than 10 times as efficiently as collagenase 1, another MMP known to be up-regulated in arthritic diseases (5Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. Lopresti-Morrow L.L. Yocum S.A. Rosner P.J. Geoghegan K.F. Hambor J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar).

Furthermore a preferential collagenase 3 inhibitor significantly reduces collagen degradation from unstimulated osteoarthritic cartilage (3Billinghurst R.C. Dahlberg L. Ionescu M. Reiner A. Bourne R.

These cumulative data suggest that collagenase 3 may play a significant role in the cleavage of type II collagen in arthritic cartilage. The specificity of this enzyme for aggrecan and other collagenous substrates has also been investigated. Collagenase 3 cleaves aggrecan at the same major and minor sites identified for other members of the MMP family as well as at a novel site (7Fosang A.J. Last K. Knauper V. Murphy G. Neame P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, collagenase 3 can degrade fibronectin and type IV, IX, X, and XIV collagens (8Knaüper V. Cowell S. Smith B.

MMPs are considered to be potential therapeutic targets. A highly active and selective substrate is a prerequisite for screening small molecule inhibitors in high throughput screening. Knowledge of the sequence specificity can facilitate the design and optimization of potent and selective inhibitors. Synthetic peptide substrates based on physiological cleavage site sequences are routinely used for enzymatic assays. These substrates can often be improved because physiologically based peptide substrates may not be the optimal substrate (9Kassel D.B. Green M.D. Wehbie R.S. Swanstrom R. Berman J. Anal.

Recently two biological systems using phage display have been developed to quickly search and decode a large peptide library for substrate optimization (14Matthews D.J. Wells J.A.

These chemical and biological methods may also be useful in searching for substrates of proteases where the natural physiological substrate is unknown. In this study, we have screened a phage-displayed random hexapeptide library of 2 × 108 members using the catalytic domain of recombinant human collagenase 3. We have identified 35 phage clones that express a hexapeptide sequence cleaved by the enzyme. We searched sequence data bases for potential collagenase 3 cleavage sites by running FASTA and BLAST searches with the hexapeptide phage sequences as queries. These searches identified potential collagenase 3 cleavage sites in type IV collagen and the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β−3. Using collagenase 3 and other closely related MMPs, we have also carried out kinetic studies for synthetic peptide substrates synthesized based on the hexapeptide sequence from a selected number of the 35 phage clones. These synthetic peptides are shown to be highly sensitive and selective to human collagenase 3. Escherichia coli K91 was obtained from Marc Navre of Affymax.

Base pairs 34–36 of the 5-prime oligo change an ATG to CTT, which removes a problematic second start site, whereas base pair 29 of the 3-prime oligo changes a G to an A, which removes a naturally occurringBamHI site. The final product was cloned via NdeI and BamHI into pET11b. A 10-liter broth culture of E. coli BL21[DE3] bearing pETcoll3 was grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 1, shifted to 16 °C, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued for 4 h until harvest. The E. coli cell pellet was suspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml APMSF (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonylfluoride), 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin)/g of wet weight cells. Cells were lysed with two passes through a French press. Inclusion bodies were spun at 48,000 × g and washed twice with 1.5 ml of Triton buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100)/g of cells and once with 1.5 ml of low salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100)/g of cells. The human recombinant collagenase 3 was solubilized with 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 6m urea)/g of cells. Protein was applied to an anion exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems Poros HQ20) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 6 m urea) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0 to 300 mm). Fractions containing collagenase 3 were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. Collagenase 3 was refolded at 4 °C by rapid dilution to 100 μg/ml (∼45-fold dilution) in folding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2). Unfolded or incorrectly folded protein was removed by filtration (0.2 μm). The active enzyme was concentrated and stored at −80 °C. Negative collagenase 3- resistant (fTCol-3R) and positive collagenase 3-sensitive (fTCol-3S) control substrate phage clones were constructed by ligating oligonucleotides withKpnI/XhoI-digested fAFF-TC-LIB vector (15Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTAATCCTGTTGAGCCTGCTCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGAGCAGGCTCAACAGGATTACCACTACCACCGC were used for the construction of fTCcol-3R phage. Oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTCCGCTGGGTCTGTGGGCCCGTCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGACGGGCCCACAGACCCAGCGGACCACTACCACCGC were used for the construction of fTCol-3S phage. The displayed peptide sequence of fTCol-3R was described previously (15Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The substrate sequence of fTCol-3S was based on peptide substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-PLGLWAR for MMPs (17Stack M.S. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4277-4281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The construction of phage-displayed hexapeptide library fTC-LIB-N6 with 2 × 108 individual sequence members was as described previously (15Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A total of 2 × 1010 fTC-LIB-N6 phage were digested at 37 °C for 1 h by 2 nm collagenase 3 in a 250-μl reaction mixture containing 1× MMP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 200 mm NaCl, pH7.6) and 0.005% Brij 35. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5m EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. Then 100 μg of mAb 179 and 10 μg of mAb 3-E7 was added to the terminated reaction mixture followed by the addition of bovine serum albumin to 0.1%. Both of the monoclonal antibodies were used to capture uncleaved phage as described previously (15Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation on ice, 100 μl of Pansorbin cells were added, and the reaction mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. The adsorption of uncleaved phage-mAb complex to Pansorbin cells was repeated once. Phage in the final supernatant were transfected intoE. coli K91 and amplified overnight at 37 °C. Phage in a small aliquot of the final supernatant was titered on E. coli K91. The above screening was performed for five rounds. Single phage clones from the titer plates were picked randomly and grown in 4 ml of LB for isolation of single-stranded DNA and for Western blotting analysis of phage. C2–12P3A, NF, DL, PV and consensus CP phage clones were constructed by inserting oligo cassettes intoKpnI/XhoI-digested fAFF-TC-LIB vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing. NF phage was made based on the major MMP site (PEN-FFG), and DL phage was made based on the minor MMP site (SED-LVV) in aggrecan. PV phage was constructed on the basis of a novel human collagenase 3 cleavage site (VKP-VFE), which was not observed for other MMPs in aggrecan (7Fosang A.J. Last K. Knauper V. Murphy G. Neame P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTGGTGCTTTGGGGTTGTCGCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGCGACAACCCCAAAGCACCACCACTACCACCGC were used for the construction of C2–12P3A. Oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTCCGGAAAACTTCTTCGGTCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGACCGAAGAAGTTTTCCGGACCACTACCACCGC were used for the construction of NF phage clone. Oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTTCTGAAGACCTGGTTGTTCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGAACAACCAGGTCTTCAGAACCACTACCACCGC were used for the construction of DL phage clone. PV phage was made by 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTGTTAAACCGGTTTTCGAACTGGTAC and 5′-CAGTTCGAAAACCGGTTTAACACCACTACCACCGC. Consensus CP phage clone was made with oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGTAGTGGTCCTTTGGGTATGCGTGGTCTGGTAC and 5′-CAGACCACGCATACCCAAAGGACCACTACCACCGC. Phage were precipitated by adding 200 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol, 2.5m NaCl to 1 ml of phage supernatant and centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Phage pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline. Three different enzymatic reactions were performed. For the first reaction, phage was incubated in 50 μl of 1× MMP buffer and 0.005% Brij 35 at 37 °C for 1 h, but enzyme was not added. For the second reaction, phage was treated as described for the first reaction except 0.4 nm collagenase 3 was added. For the third reaction, phage were treated the same way as described for the first reaction except 0.4 nm collagenase 3 and 0.05 μl of 10 μm GW9471 inhibitor were combined (19McGeehan G.M. Becherer J.D. Bast R.C.J. Boyer C.M. Champion B. Connolly K.M. Conway J.G. Furdon P. Karp S. Kidao S. McElroy A.B. Nichols J. Pryzwansky K.M. Schoenen F. Sekut L Truesdale A. Verghese M. Warner J. Ways J.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). EDTA was added to 5 mm to terminate enzymatic reactions. Each reaction mixture of 10 μl was analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Substrate peptide-phage gene gIII fusions were detected by mAb 179. Phage cleaved by human collagenase 3 but whose cleavage was inhibited by the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GW9471 was chosen for further study. Single-stranded DNA from individual phage clones was prepared using QIAprep M13 BioRobot kit in a Bio Robot 9600 system (Qiagen, CA). The phage substrate DNA sequences were determined by an ABI automated fluorescent DNA sequencer. A 19-kDa collagenase 1 catalytic domain was expressed in E. coli. Purification was described previously (20Hassell A.M. Anderegg R.J. Weigl D. Milburn M.V. Burkhart W. Smith G.F.H. Graber P. Wells T.N.C. Luther M.A. Jordan S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1410-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Full-length stromelysin 1 was also expressed inE. coli and purified from inclusion bodies using a protocol similar to that used for collagenase 1. Truncated progelatinase B (lacking the C-terminal domain) was expressed from baculovirus infectedTrichoplusia ni cells and purified from the media using gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography. Purity was greater than 90%, as assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis. All synthetic 2,4-dinitrophenyl peptide substrates were ordered from Synpep (Dublin, CA) and prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. A substrate concentration of 10 μm was used for all enzymatic reactions. Before the assay, collagenase 3 was diluted 100-fold to a 250 nm stock in 200 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μmZnSO4, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5 (assay buffer). Hydrolysis reaction concentrations were adjusted from 0.1 to 10 nm by further dilution. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 to 180 min. The reactions were terminated with the addition of an equal volume of 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid. Peptide substrate and product were separated by reverse phase HPLC, and the peaks were evaluated by monitoring absorbance at 350 nm. Cleavage sites in synthetic peptides were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of each reaction mixture. The specificity constantsk cat/K m were also determined for collagenase 1, stromelysin 1, and gelatinase B. Collagenase 1 was refolded by dilution to 5 μM with extensive dialysis against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 μmZnCl2 (refolding buffer). Hydrolysis reactions were performed using 1–10 nm enzyme in assay buffer. Stromelysin 1 was refolded by diluting to 15 nm in assay buffer. After 1 h at room temperature, the enzyme was concentrated to a 150 nm stock solution using an Amicon CentriPrep 30 concentrator. Stromelysin 1 assay concentrations ranged from 5 to 50 nm. Gelatinase B was diluted to a 2.5 μM stock in assay buffer and activated for 12 h with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C. The enzyme was desalted with Bio-Rad Bio-Spin 6 columns into assay buffer. The enzyme was diluted to a final assay concentration of 1–10 nm. All enzyme concentrations were verified by active site titration with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, GW9471 (19McGeehan G.M. Becherer J.D. Bast R.C.J. Boyer C.M. Champion B. Connolly K.M. Conway J.G. Furdon P. Karp S. Kidao S. McElroy A.B. Nichols J. Pryzwansky K.M. Schoenen F. Sekut L Truesdale A. Verghese M. Warner J. Ways J.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The IC50 for collagenase 3, collagenase 1, gelatinase B, and stromelysin 1 is 0.5, 1.2, 1.0, and 2.4 nm, respectively, for this inhibitor. A substrate concentration of 10 μm was used for each enzymatic reaction. Hydrolysis reactions and HPLC analysis were performed under the same conditions as for collagenase 3. The standard error for specificity constantk cat/K m is less than or equal to 30% based on 3 independent experiments. The specificity constantk cat/K m for 2,4-dinitrophenyl-GPLGMRGL-NH2 (CP) was also estimated by performing enzymatic reactions at a substrate concentration of 2.5 μm, and thek cat/K m value was similar to that estimated at a substrate concentration of 10 μm. A total of 2 × 1010 fTC-LIB-N6 phage from the phage-displayed random hexapeptide library was treated with the catalytic domain of human collagenase 3. Undigested phage was removed by mAb 3E-7 and mAb 179 attached to Pansorbin cells. Cleaved phage was amplified in E. coli K91 cells and then subjected to four more rounds of enzyme digestion and screening. This screening yielded 35 phage clones, which were shown to be more sensitive by Western blot analysis to human collagenase 3 treatment than the positive control phage fTCol-3S (Table I). DNA sequencing of the 35 phage clones and sequence alignment analysis reveal that a proline appears in all 35 clones in a putative P3 subsite, a leucine appears in 13 clones at the P2 subsite, a glycine occurs in 12 clones at the P1 subsite, a methionine occurs in 8 clones at the P1′ subsite, a basic residue arginine, lysine, or histidine occurs in 12 clones at the P2′ subsite, and a glycine occurs in 7 clones at the P3′ subsite (Table I). A consensus sequence, PLGMRG, can be deduced based on the preferred residue in each subsite position. A site-directed mutant phage C2–12P3A was constructed in which proline at the putative P3 subsite in phage clone C2–12 was replaced by alanine (TableII). Western blotting did not detect cleavage of the site-directed mutant by collagenase 3, whereas the parent phage was cleaved (Table II and Fig.1). Thek cat/K m for the synthetic peptide, however, was reduced 7-fold by the alanine substitution (TableV).Table ITranslated amino acid sequences of human collagenase 3-selected phage clones from a random hexapeptide substrate phage libraryPhage cloneAmino acid sequenceCleavageP3P2P1P1′P2′P3′fTCol-3RNPVEPANDfTCol-3SPLGLWAR+C2–12GPLGLS+++C3–9GPLGLK+++C2–6VRPLGI++C5–19/5–24APLGMS+++C3–10PLSISG+++C3–15PLQFRG+++C3–19PLTMMG+++C5–10PLPMRM++C5–9APLAMR+++C5–12PLSIQD+++C3–20PLSFQG+++C3–26VLPLPM+++C4–21PLSLLS+++C3–18PAGLSD+++C4–8PRGLVA+++C3–12PKGLRA+++C4–18PYGMRA+++C4–13/4–27PVALKA+++C3–16/4–1PKGVYS+++C4–19PKGITS+++C4–24PSGIHV+++C5–27PFGFKS+++C4–4GPPMSL+++C3–33PINLHG+++C2–16PHPLFL++C2–2PSELKG++C2–7MAPYAL+++C4–14/5–25PFAFQG+++C2–14PSAYHS+++C5–15PMSYNA+++C2–27PAEIVA+++C4–1PMEMVE++C2–9VTPYNM+++C2–23PPRAIR+++C2–22PRPFNY+++Consensus CPPLGMRG++++++, strong cleavage; ++, some cleavage; +, less cleavage; ND, no cleavage of phage by human collagenase 3 detected by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phage clones were named in such a way that C2–12 represented clone 12 from round 2 screening.

Under current culture conditions, neonatal foreskin-derived human keratinocytes possess a relatively short replicative lifespan. Recently it was reported that forced overexpression of the helix-loop-helix protein Id-1 was capable of immortalizing keratinocytes, secondary to activation of telomerase activity and suppression of p16/Rb-mediated growth arrest pathways. To investigate the relationship between Id-1, telomerase activity, telomere length, p16, Rb cell cycle regulators, and senescence, whole populations of keratinocytes were infected with a retrovirus to induce overexpression of Id-1. In these unselected cultures, enhanced Id-1 levels clearly extended the lifespan of keratinocytes, but Id-1 did not prevent the onset of replicative senescence. Under these experimental conditions, Id-1 expression did not trigger induction of telomerase activity, and there was progressive shortening of the telomeres that was accompanied by elevated p16 levels and prevalence of active Rb. The ability of Id-1 to postpone, but not prevent, senescence may be related to partial inhibition of p16 expression, as the Id-1-overexpressing cultures displayed a decreased capacity for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-mediated p16 induction. Thus, while no immortalization was observed, Id-1 could delay the onset of replicative senescence in unselected human keratinocyte populations.

Exp. Cell. Res. 1965; 37: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar), more recently a growing interest in human keratinocyte senescent pathways has emerged (2Kiyona T. Foster S.A.

For example, to achieve immortalization of keratinocytes requires inactivation of Rb1/p16 function plus activation of telomerase, whereas in human fibroblasts, telomerase activation suffices to significantly extend their life span (5Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that overexpression of the helix-loop-helix protein Id-1 was sufficient to immortalize primary human keratinocytes (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was concluded that Id-1 expression lead to activation of telomerase activity with inactivation of Rb and p16 in keratinocytes (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since the methodology employed in this report involved a selection step following transfection of the Id-1 cDNA, it was possible that the selected clones of immortalized keratinocytes had acquired other mutations that were contributing to bypassing of replicative senescence (4Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C.

To further investigate the role of Id-1 in an unselected population of cultured keratinocytes, a retroviral vector containing the Id-1 cDNA was used to examine the relationship between Id-1 expression and the resultant phenotype in neonatal foreskin-derived human keratinocytes. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer facilitates introduction of target genes with high efficiency so that effects of the transduced gene can be examined in whole cell populations (7Serrano M. Lin A.W.

A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the overexpression of Id-1 by keratinocytes using this different experimental approach delayed the onset of replicative senescence, but did not prevent senescence. The Id-1-expressing keratinocytes with delayed senescence in later passaged cells resembled spontaneously senescent keratinocytes in that there was no increase in telomerase, but there were shortened telomeres (approximately 6 kb in length), and increased p16, and active Rb levels. The importance of these findings is discussed in terms of normal epidermal homeostasis and cutaneous oncology (8Campisi J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1997; 45: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Campisi J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 31: 1-5Google Scholar). Keratinocyte cultures were initiated from discarded neonatal foreskins, in which the epidermis was initially separated from dermis by exposure to dispase. The subsequent epidermal sheet was treated with trypsin/EDTA to produce a single cell suspension of keratinocytes that were placed in plastic Petri dishes (Corning, New York) as described previously (3Chaturvedi V.

Keratinocytes were fed with a low calcium (0.07 mm), serum-free medium (KGM, Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA). From each foreskin, the initial epidermal suspension was seeded into three different 35-mm dishes and then transferred to a six-well cluster plate for retroviral infection. After infection and washing, keratinocytes were routinely cultured in 10-cm dishes and passaged at 60–70% confluence with feeding using fresh KGM every other day. Cell counts to determine population doublings was performed manually using a hemocytometer and estimated based on the log2 (number of keratinocytes at subculture/number of cells initially plated) as previously described (4Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N. Li F.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1436-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). For induction of p16 and p21, representative keratinocytes from various passages were incubated with phorbol ester (TPA; 100 nm; Sigma) for 3 days and then protein extracts performed as described below. For growth control and TPA response controls, neonatal foreskin-derived keratinocytes were derived exactly as above, except they were either never exposed to the retroviral infection or were exposed to retroviral preparations containing only linker, but not containing the Id-1 cDNA. Id-1 cDNA was obtained from BamHI and NotI of LZRS and MGF-based retroviral expression vector. The LZRS vector was kindly provided by Dr. Paul A. Khavari (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) and used as described previously (10Qin J.-Z. Chaturvedi V. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37957-37964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Phoenix-Ampo retroviral packing cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) with permission from Dr. Gary P. Nolan (Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA). The packing cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with Id-1 containing vector or linker (without Id-1) vector by using CaCl2 and 2 × Hanks' balanced saline solution. After overnight incubation, the cells were fed with fresh medium and incubated at 32 °C for an additional 24–48 h. The supernatants were collected for subsequent infection of primary cultures of keratinocytes. The normal keratinocytes were seeded into six-well plates and infected with 300 μl of viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene) (Sigma H-9268) for 1 h at 32 °C, then the supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the infected cells were propagated and treated with TPA. The overexpression of the Id-1 protein was detected with Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Immunostaining was performed using the SC-488 anti-Id-1 ab (Santa Cruz) combined with an avidin-biotin peroxidase detection system (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Positive staining was accomplished using 3-amino-4-ethylcarbazole as the chromagen producing a positive red reaction with 1% hematoxylin as the counter-stain as described previously (10Qin J.-Z.

Whole cell lysates were prepared to detect different proteins. In brief, keratinocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were incubated on ice for 15 min in CHAPS buffer (3Chaturvedi V.

Cells were microcentrifuged, and supernatants were saved and frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentration of each sample was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of protein were loaded on 6–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane and blocked in 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBST (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody in 2.5% powdered milk in TBST, washed extensively with TBST, and then incubated with 1:1500 diluted anti-rabbit or mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instruction. Loading of proteins to verify equivalent distribution of proteins in each well was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Antibodies against p21 (SC397R), p16 (SC-759), Id-1 (SC-488), pRB (SC-50), and Cdk4 (SC-260) were purchased from Santa Cruz and used at 1 μg/ml concentration. Other antibodies were obtained from the following produced against: Bcl-x (monoclonal antibody 1513A) and cyclin D1 (clone DCS-6), purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, and actin (clone C4; ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The assay for telomerase activity utilized the polymerase chain reaction-based, telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP assay); (12Counter C.M. Botelho F.M. Wang P. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The estimation of telomere length was performed by hybridizing a32P-labeled telomeric (TTAGGG)4 repeat probe toHinfI- and RsaI-digested genomic DNA separated on 0.8% agarose gels as described previously (13Kim N.W. Win F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Radioactive signal was quantified using a FUJIFILM Fluorescent Analyzer (FLA-2000) and analyzed using NIH image software. Weighted averages of the distances of band migration were calculated using Microsoft Excel and compared with DNA molecular weight standard to determine mean telomere length. Neonatal foreskin-derived keratinocytes normally proliferate rapidly in KGM (0.07 mm calcium), dividing every 1–2 days for three to four passages (approximately 20 population doublings; PD), before undergoing irreversible growth arrest (i.e. replicative senescence). Using unselected cell populations infected with an empty (only linker cDNA) retroviral vector, similar kinetics and number of PD was observed. However, unselected keratinocyte populations infected with an Id-1 containing retrovirus had a significantly greater number of population doublings (greater than 60 PD in two of the three independently generated Id-1-overexpressing cell lines), compared with uninfected or linker control keratinocyte populations. Id-1-overexpressing keratinocytes also proliferated rapidly (dividing every 1–2 days), but in contrast to the earlier report (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), all three independently transduced cell populations ultimately did undergo irreversible growth arrest. The onset of replicative senescence in the three different Id-1-infected keratinocyte cultures occurred at PD 84, 62, and 52, respectively. Upon onset of senescence, the keratinocytes underwent a change in morphology in which the small cuboidal-shaped proliferating cells became enlarged and flattened acquiring cytoplasmic vacuoles. The senescent keratinocyte cultures failed to undergo further proliferation despite frequent changes of medium and addition of fresh KGM. While the senescent keratinocytes remained viable for weeks with continued replacement of KGM, they displayed progressive detachment from the plastic dish, and upon exposure to mild trypsin/EDTA displayed a low tendency to re-attach (data not shown). The relative levels of Id-1 for the different keratinocyte populations reveal higher Id-1 protein levels in the transduced keratinocytes at early passages (PD 3 and PD 8), compared with the control keratinocyte populations (Fig. 1). Examination of cytospins of retroviral infected keratinocyte cell lines by immunohistochemistry revealed approximately 80% of the population overexpressed Id-1 (data not shown). Fig. 1 displays several control lanes, including the relatively low Id-1 levels in normal uninfected keratinocytes that were allowed to reach confluence (lane 1) or that had undergone spontaneous replicative senescence (lane 2). Normal proliferating keratinocytes had slightly increased Id-1 levels (lane 3), but keratinocytes infected with the Id-1 containing retrovirus had markedly elevated Id-1 levels during their proliferative stages (lanes 4 and 5). While overexpression of Id-1 by proliferating retroviral infected keratinocyte cell lines in early passage (PD 3 and PD 8) was expected (Fig. 1), the relative levels of Id-1 in these transduced keratinocytes at the onset of replicative senescence was of interest. When nontransduced keratinocytes undergo spontaneous senescence either due to confluence or replicative exhaustion, Id-1 levels are barely detectable compared with early passage proliferating normal keratinocytes (Fig. 1, lanes 1and 2). Interestingly, compared with these growth arrested nontransduced keratinocytes, the senescent Id-1-transduced keratinocyte lines continue to overexpress Id-1, although the relative levels decreased slightly compared with the proliferating Id-1-transduced keratinocytes examined at earlier passages (Fig. 1, lanes 6and 7). There was either no change, or minimal change, in the levels of either Bcl-x or β-actin (Fig. 1). Examination of Bcl-x levels was selected because of the ability of Bcl-x to influence resistance of keratinocytes to apoptosis (14Pena J.C. Fuchs E. Thompson C.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). Since we previously established that keratinocytes undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence strongly induced p16 levels (3Chaturvedi V. Qin J.-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23358-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Western blot analysis was performed on the keratinocyte cell lines. Normal proliferating keratinocytes possess low to absent p16 and p21 levels (Fig. 2, lane 1). Early (PD 3) and mid-passage (PD 28) Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte lines had either none or barely detectable levels of p16 and variable levels of p21 (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3). However, at the onset of replicative senescence there was an increase in the p16 levels in both Id-1-overexpressing cell lines examined (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and5). To explore the levels of expression for cyclin D1 and Cdk4, Western blot analysis of extracts prepared from the aforementioned cells was performed. Under all of these conditions, there was only relatively minor changes in levels of both cyclin D1 and Cdk4 (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5). Thus, both early population doubling keratinocytes in either control or Id-1-transduced cells, as well as keratinocytes undergoing senescence, did not consistently increase or decrease either cyclin D1 or Cdk4 levels. The relative levels and phosphorylation status of Rb revealed the presence of both inactive and active forms with prevalence of inactive forms in proliferating normal keratinocytes (Fig.3, lane 1) and early and mid-passage keratinocytes infected to overexpress Id-1 (Fig. 3). However, upon onset of replicative senescence, Id-1-expressing keratinocyte cell lines expressed higher levels of the active (hypophosphorylated) form of Rb (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and7). As the initial report suggested a link between Id-1 and telomerase activity (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the keratinocyte populations at various passages were assayed for telomerase activity. Even though an immortalized cell line (i.e. HaCaT cells), or normal keratinocytes infected with a hTERT-containing retrovirus, had elevated telomerase levels, no increase in telomerase activity was detected in any of the three different Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte cell lines, at either early or late passages (Fig. 4). To follow up this observation, telomere lengths were also determined, and it became clear that there was progressive telomere shortening in the Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte cell lines (Fig.5). While proliferating keratinocytes had telomere lengths between 10 and 11 kb (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and2) at the onset of replicative senescence in normal keratinocytes (lane 3), or Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte cell line 1 (lane 4; PD 83), cell line 2 (lane 5; PD 62), and cell line 3 (lane 6; PD 52), telomere length in these cultured keratinocytes had been reduced to approximately 6–8 kb. The immortalized HaCaT cells had the shortest telomeres (lane 7, 2.6 kb).Figure 5Telomere length was determined by phosphoimager analysis and computer-assisted program software using relevant standards. The calculated mean telomere lengths are as follows: normal proliferating PD 3 keratinocytes, 11 kb (lane 1); normal senescent PD 5 keratinocytes, 10 kb (lane 2); normal senescent PD 16 keratinocytes, 8 kb (lane 3); Id-1-overexpressing senescent cell line 1, PD 83, 7.5 kb (lane 4); Id-1-overexpressing senescent cell line 2, PD 62, 8 kb (lane 5); Id-1-overexpressing senescent cell line 3, PD 52, 6.0 kb (lane 6); immortalized HaCaT cells, 2.6 kb (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To begin to probe the potential mechanism by which Id-1 could delay senescence in our keratinocyte populations, the influence of Id-1 levels on p16 induction was determined. Exposure of proliferating keratinocytes to phorbol ester (i.e. TPA) induces irreversible growth arrest accompanied by increased p16 levels after 72 h following TPA treatment (Fig. 6, left panel,lanes 1 and 2). By contrast to the p16 induction in normal keratinocytes either following TPA treatment (left panel, lane 2) or onset of replicative senescence (right panel, lane 2), the Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte cell lines (right panel, lane 3) displayed markedly reduced p16 induction following TPA exposure (right panel, lane 4), but the cells still underwent cell cycle arrest. The changes in p21 levels under these same conditions were characterized by an increase in p21 in the Id-1-overexpressing keratinocyte cell line exposed to TPA (Fig. 6,right panel, lane 4). Thus, while Id-1 overexpression inhibits p16 induction by TPA, it does not inhibit a similar induction of p21. A growing body of evidence implicates Id proteins such as Id-1 as regulators of cell growth in numerous cell lineages (reviewed in Ref. 15Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell. Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many cell types, including the normal keratinocytes examined in this study, Id-1 expression is down-regulated upon withdrawal of growth factors or onset of senescence (16Barone M.F. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Phillipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D.

The forced overexpression of Id-1 in unselected keratinocyte populations using a retroviral vector significantly impacted the behavior of the cells by delaying the onset of replicative senescence. However, in contrast with the earlier report (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we did not observe an immortalized phenotype, induction of telomerase, or inactivation of Rb in three different independently created cell lines overexpressing Id-1. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the previous investigators isolated selected clones that included keratinocytes with elevated telomerase activity and inactivated Rb/p16 pathway. We suspect that our keratinocyte cell lines succumbed to the onset of replicative senescence secondary to shortened telomeres, since no induction of telomerase activity was detected. It would appear for some type of fibroblasts, retinal pigment epithelial cells, mesothelial cells, as well as keratinocytes, that replicative senescence is a telomere length-sensitive response, with the primary difference reflected by the ability of hTERT overexpression, by itself, to overcome senescence in fibroblasts and retinal pigment cells (2Kiyona T. Foster S.A. Koope J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 4Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N.

Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results in this report are consistent with the notion that immortalization of human keratinocytes requires not only inactivation of Rb/p16, but also activation of telomerase (5Bodnar A.G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the current results is the earlier report utilized distinctive growth media. Alani et al. (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) established their primary cultures and expanded the keratinocyte populations using Life Technologies, Inc. media, whereas we utilized Clonetics media. The formulation of these media may permit or facilitate the outgrowth of different types of keratinocytes. Immortalization studies with viral oncoproteins of normal human mammary epithelial cells highlighted the genetic requirements for immortalization of a given population of cells can be dramatically different depending on the experimental protocol and reagents (21Wazer D.E. Liu X.-L. Chu Q. Gao Q. Band V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3687-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Since squamous epithelia, such as skin contain cells with stem cell-like properties that are TRAP-positive, the inability to detect telomerase activity under the current conditions may point to the importance of specific media, since Alani et al. (6Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 963-9641Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) did detect some level of TRAP activity in their control transfected/selected keratinocyte population. Despite these potentially important technical differences, the positive findings of this report should be emphasized, including the extension of keratinocyte lifespan due to Id-1 overexpression and the mechanistic insights involved in the prolonged survival as regards the Cdk inhibitor p16 by Id-1. Based on the Western blot analysis of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 (Fig. 2), it does not appear that Id-1 has any significant direct effect on these cell cycle regulators. Even though late passage keratinocyte lines overexpressed Id-1 (as well as stable levels of cyclin D1 and Cdk4), this did not abrogate the growth-suppressive function of p16 and abundance of active Rb accompanying the onset of replicative senescence. Thus, these results reinforce the notion that the enhanced p16 level (rather than absent or low cyclin D1/Cdk4) is responsible for the relative paucity of phosphorylated Rb and are consistent with the apparent inability of Id-1 (and Id-3, but not Id-2) to directly interact with Rb (22Iavargne A.P. Garg A. Lasorella J. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 23Lasarella A. Ivarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Exactly how Id-1 overexpression could suppress the TPA-mediated induction of p16 is under investigation. Whether activation of protein kinase C is important in this keratinocyte response also requires further exploration (24Deed R.W. Bianchi S.M. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Santibanez-Koref M. Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 599-607PubMed Google Scholar). The growth arrest of the Id-1-overexpressing cells induced by TPA in the absence of p16 induction may have been triggered by the enhanced levels of p21, consistent with our earlier observation (3Chaturvedi V. Qin J.-Z. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23358-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these results indicate that Id-1 has important growth regulatory effects on keratinocyte populations, including a delay in the onset of replicative senescence. However, since telomerase is not directly activated by Id-1, telomeres continue shortening in these unselected keratinocyte lines, triggering the onset of senescence, which is accompanied by elevated p16 levels and activated Rb. Further studies are indicated to more clearly define the link between Id-1 and regulation of p16 gene expression, as such a line of inquiry could lead to better understanding of the biology of epidermal stem cells (25Bickenbach J.R.

Thus, as an important component of normal tissue turnover and regenerative repair processes, the proliferative potential of transiently amplifying progenitor cells committed to the epithelial lineage must be tightly controlled. In human skin, disease states, which include high epithelial turnover as seen following thermal injuries or in psoriasis (28Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), are associated with a remarkably low frequency of keratinocyte neoplastic transformation, particularly salient when compared with transformation observed in epithelial cells of other tissues (e.g. colonic epithelium in inflammatory bowel disease). Thus, the current results together with previous reports (2Kiyona T. Foster S.A. Koope J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A.

These data converge upon the p16/Rb regulatory complex as a crucial regulator of keratinocyte replicative senescence that must be inactivated for telomerase-dependent immortalization. It will also be of interest to determine the role of Id-1 in normal cutaneous homeostasis and the target genes and binding partners for Id-1 in epidermal keratinocytes.

Our results suggest that evolutionary distance alone is not a precise predictor of nuclear-mitochondrial interactions as previously suggested for primates. mitochondrial DNA nuclear DNA fetal bovine serum polymerase chain reaction normal rat kidney Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine nucleotide million years restriction fragment length polymorphisms flavoprotein Nuclear-mitochondrial interactions play a fundamental role in cellular homeostasis. The nuclear genome encodes more than 95% of all proteins located in the mitochondria, whereas only 13 polypeptides (all subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, OXPHOS) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. An optimal interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial encoded factors is essential for transcription and translation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)1 and also for the correct assembly and function of the OXPHOS system (1Rosamond J. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Various attempts have been made to understand the interactions between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and their respective contributions to the expression of different phenotypes such as tumorigenicity (2Hayashi J. Werbin H. Shay J.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4001-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayashi J.I. Yonekawa H. Tagashira Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4715-4720PubMed Google Scholar) and cell differentiation (4Clark M.A. Shay J.W. Nature. 1982; 295: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Iwakura Y. Nozaki M.

One approach that has facilitated the study of nuclear-mitochondrial interactions is the construction of interspecific hybrids and cybrids. Because the mtDNA sequence divergence is about 5–13 times more rapid than in nuclear DNA (nDNA), a general incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrially coded gene products is expected between pairs of even recently diverged taxa (6Brown W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3605-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Previously, Kenyon and Moraes (7Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) demonstrated that OXPHOS function of a human cell line lacking mtDNA (ρ0) could be restored by inserting mitochondria from other humanoid primates including common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), pigmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), or gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). These studies suggested that at least in primates, mitochondrial/nuclear compatibility has been retained over approximately 5–12 million years (Myr) period. On the other hand, mtDNA from orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), a species that diverged from the other hominoids more than 12–18 Myr ago, could not functionally replace human mtDNA, suggesting an increase in failed nuclear-mitochondrial interactions. Further studies on human xenomitochondrial cybrids harboring chimpanzee or gorilla mtDNA revealed a 20–30% decrease in oxygen consumption rate and approximately 40% decrease in complex I activity (8Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These deficiencies could be attributed to defective interactions between nDNA- and mtDNA-coded complex I subunits (9Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Interspecific hybrids between cells from different rodent species and rodent-human cells have been documented (10De Francesco L. Attardi G. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4079-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Giles R.E. Stroynowski I. Wallace D.C.

Cell Res. 1982; 138: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the maintenance of mtDNA has been shown to require an essentially complete set of cognate chromosomes. The retention of both species of mtDNA in mouse-rat and mouse-hamster cell hybrids also has been reported, although it has not been determined whether both mitochondrial genomes are expressed or if there is a selective repression of one mtDNA species (14Solus J.F. Eisenstadt J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 151: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, the uniparental loss of mtDNA has been shown to occur in parallel with chromosomal loss (15Clayton D.A. Teplitz R.L. Nabholz M. Dovey H. Bodmer W. Nature. 1971; 234: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Attardi B. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to transfer either rat (Rattus norvegicus) or Mus spretus mtDNA to a Mus musculus domesticus cell devoid of mtDNA (ρ0). As described under “Discussion,” the evolutionary distance between these species is controversial but is believed to be approximately 10–12 Myr ago between mouse and rat and 1 Myr ago between Mus musculus and M. spretus (19She J.X. Bonhomme F. Boursot P. Thaler L. Catzeflis F.M. Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 1990; 41: 83-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We could obtain viable xenomitochondrial cybrids in both cases and report the characterization of these cells. We found reduced OXPHOS activity in cybrids harboring rat mtDNA, whereas the OXPHOS was not affected in cybrids harboringM. spretus mtDNA. These observations provide new insights into nuclear DNA-mtDNA interactions by showing that predictions on the viability and phenotype of xenomitochondrial cells (and possibly interspecifically cloned mammals) do not correlate strictly with evolutionary divergence and will vary depending on the species used. Mouse (M. musculus domesticus) LM(TK−), NIH/3T3, and rat (R. norvegicus) NRK (normal rat kidney) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 1.3, CRL1658, and CRL6509, respectively). M. spretus skin fibroblasts were isolated in our laboratory. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate. Mouse LM(TK−) cells were treated with 50 ng/ml ditercalinium (20Inoue K. Takai D. Hosaka H. Ito S. Shitara H. Isobe K. LePecq J.B. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Hayashi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for 6 weeks, then with 500 ng/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma) for 2 weeks, and finally 10 ng/ml ditercalinium for 2 more weeks. Isolated clones were allowed to grow in complete medium for 15 days and then tested for the presence of mtDNA by Southern blot or PCR amplification of total DNA with mouse primers specific for the COX I gene or the D-loop (sequence of primers given below under “Mitochondrial and Nuclear DNA Analysis”). As expected, the isolated clones were also auxotrophic for uridine (21Morais R. Gregoire M. Jeannotte L. Gravel D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 105 rat NRK or mouse NIH/3T3 orspretus cells were plated on 35-mm culture dish 1 day prior to fusion. Enucleation of NRK, NIH/3T3, and spretuscells and fusion with 1.5 × 106 LM(TK−) cells, either ρ0 or R-6G treated, were performed as described previously (22King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The fusion products were selected in DMEM containing high glucose and supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were fed every 3 days with selective medium. After approximately 2–3 weeks, 10–18 proliferating clones were isolated by ring cloning and cultivated for further characterization. Approximately 106 mouse LM(TK−) cells were plated into a 75-cm2 flask and treated with 3 μg/ml rhodamine 6G (R-6G) in complete medium for 7 days (23Trounce I. Wallace D.C. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The R-6G treated LM(TK−) cells were fed with complete medium (without R-6G) 3 h before fusion. Approximately 3 × 105 rat NRK cells were plated on 35-mm culture dish 1 day prior to fusion. Enucleation of NRK cells and fusion with 1.5 × 106LM(TK−) cells were performed as described previously (22King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The fusion products were selected in DMEM containing high glucose and supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were fed every 3 days with selective medium. After approximately 2–3 weeks, 10–18 proliferating clones were isolated by ring cloning and cultivated for further characterization. After at least 30 days under selection followed by 20 days without, total DNA was extracted from cybrids following standard procedures (24Moraes C.T. Ricci E. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 934-949PubMed Google Scholar). For the heteroplasmic cell line, clone RM44R6G, DNA was prepared at consecutive times after clone isolation (after 4, 8, and 12 weeks). To determine mtDNA haplotype, we amplified an mtDNA region containing the COX I gene, using primers Rod-F (corresponding to nt 5559–5578 in the mouse mtDNA (25Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) and nt 5540–5559 in the rat mtDNA (26Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar)) and Rod-B (nt 6259–6278 in the mouse mtDNA and nt 6240–6259 in the rat mtDNA). We labeled the PCR products with [α-32P]dCTP in the last cycle of the reaction to avoid the detection of heteroduplexes (i.e. the formation of duplexes containing one strand from mouse and one from rat). The details of the procedure, termed “last cycle hot PCR,” have been reported previously (24Moraes C.T. Ricci E. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 934-949PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fragments were digested with MspI for rat × mouse cybrids and with PvuII for mouse × mouse cybrids, electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiographed. For characterization of mtDNA in mouse × rat cybrids, amplification of the D-loop was also done in addition to theCOX I gene. The primers used were MOU TPRO-F (nt 15380–15410 for mouse) and MOU TPHE-B (nt 1–30 for mouse and 1–29 for rat). The PCR products were labeled as mentioned above, digested with Sau3A1, and autoradiographed. The nuclear background of clones was determined by microsatellite analyses. Mouse and rat MAPPAIRSTM primers were obtained from Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The mouse MAPPAIRSTM used were D1Mit200, D2Mit135, D3Mit85, D4mit196, D5mit72, D6Mit149, D7Mit68, D8Mit224, D9Mit94, D10Mit256, D11Mit254, D12Mit31, D13Mit35, D14Mit220, D15Mit223, D16Mit169, D17Mit49, D18Mit58, D19Mit85, and DXMit109. The rat-specific MAPPAIRSTM used were D1Mgh24, D2Mit24, D3Mit8, D4Mgh32, D5Rat24, D6Rat41, D7Rat23, D8Rat49, D9Mgh7, D10Rat3, D11Rat27, D12Mit1, D13Mgh4, D14Mit7, D15Mit6, D16Mgh3, D17Mit8, D18Rat16, D19Rat13, and DXRat1. The presence of mouse mtDNA in clone RM44R6G was also analyzed by Southern blot analysis. Ten μg of total DNA from each cell type were digested with EcoRI, electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). To avoid bias hybridization of mouse or rat mtDNA, we used [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe made of an equal mixture of PCR fragments (719 base pairs corresponding to the COX Iregion) amplified independently from mouse and rat DNA. Growth curves were obtained by plating 2 × 104 cells on 100-mm dishes in 10 ml of medium. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) lacking glucose supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 10% dialyzed FBS, and either 5 mm glucose or 5 mm galactose. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, and cell counts were performed at daily intervals. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in 0.9 ml of medium (DMEM containing 5% dialyzed FBS) with a Clark oxygen electrode in a micro water-jacketed cell, magnetically stirred, at 37 °C (Hansatech Instruments Limited, Norfolk, UK). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in medium, and the measurement of intact cell-coupled endogenous respiration was performed as described previously (8Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For measuring the specific activity of respiratory chain complexes, mitochondria were isolated by N2 cavitation (27Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21878-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and assays were performed spectrophotometrically (DU-640 spectrophotometer, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) as described previously (8Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The activities of NADH-decyl-ubiquinone reductase (complex I), succinate decyl-ubiquinone DCPIP reductase (complex II), succinate cytochrome creductase (complex II + III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) were determined. Mitochondrial protein synthesis was determined by pulse-labeling cell cultures in the presence of emetine as described (28Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ninety percent confluent cells were treated with 100 μg/ml emetine for 4 min, followed by pulse-label with 350 μCi of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (EXPRESS, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately collected in a minimum volume of 1% SDS. Approximately 45 μg of total protein were resolved by electrophoresis in a 15–20% exponential gradient polyacrylamide gel (28Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was fixed in a 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution, treated with Fluoro-Enhance (Research Products International), dried, and exposed to an x-ray film at −80 °C for 5 days. Mitochondria were isolated by N2cavitation (27Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21878-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and 40 μg of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products). Blots were blocked with 5% milk and probed with different monoclonal antibodies, anti-complex I, 39-kDa subunit (1:2500 dilution), anti-core 1, complex III antibody (1:2000 dilution), anti-cytochrome coxidase subunit IV (COX IV; 1:500 dilution), anti-flavoprotein of succinate dehydrogenase (1:1000 dilution), and anti-cytochromec (1.5 μg/ml, PharMingen, San Diego, CA), followed by a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Primary antibodies were a gift from Dr. R. Capaldi, University of Oregon. The detection was done using Phototope-horseradish peroxidase Western blot Detection Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). After scanning appropriately exposed autoradiograms, band signals were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software package. Comparison between protein and RNA pairs was performed by “BLAST 2 sequences” (29Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental data were analyzed using Excell Statistical Package (Microsoft Co.). Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Mouse LM(TK−) cells were treated with ditercalinium and ethidium bromide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Selected clones were allowed to recover in medium without intercalating agents for 30 days. No mouse mtDNA could be detected when mouse-specific primers were used to amplify either COX I or D-loop mtDNA regions using DNA extracted from putative ρ0 clones (Fig.1 A). The absence of mtDNA was also confirmed by Southern blot analysis (not shown). In addition, treated cells became auxotrophic for uridine, which is characteristic of mtDNA-less (ρ0) cell lines."

ADA plays a critical role in controlling the concentration of adenosine, thereby affecting many areas of intercellular signaling. Thus, in the absence of ADA, the uncontrolled elevations of adenosine could unleash a variety of adenosine signaling cascades with detrimental effects on numerous areas of physiology. The other ADA substrate, 2′-deoxyadenosine, is known to be cytotoxic by interference with a number of critical metabolic pathways. High levels of 2′-deoxyadenosine may lead to the interference of transmethylation reactions (22Hershfield M.S. Kurtzberg J. Chaffee S. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 198: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar), reduction of deoxynucleotide synthesis (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that some tissues in mice, especially the thymus and spleen, produce high levels of 2′-deoxyadenosine (24Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), making them especially sensitive to metabolic consequences of 2′-deoxyadenosine-induced metabolic cytotoxicity. We have also shown that the murine fetal liver is sensitive to 2′-deoxyadenosine elevations (26Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright Jr., J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, ADA deficiency may provoke a variety of consequences, either through metabolic disturbances caused by elevated 2′-deoxyadenosine, or cell signaling disturbances caused by elevated adenosine.We have recently used a two-stage genetic engineering strategy to produce a line of ADA-deficient mice (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These mice develop a combined immunodeficiency that is associated with profound disturbances in purine metabolism. Elevations in ADA substrates were greatest in the thymus and spleen (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting the metabolic disturbances in these major immune organs play a role in the ensuing immunodeficiency. In addition to immunodeficiency, ADA-deficient mice develop severe abnormalities including rib cage alterations, renal abnormalities, and pulmonary insufficiency (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mice fail to thrive and die from respiratory insufficiency by 3 weeks of age (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Blackburn M.R. Volmer J.B. Thrasher J.L. Zhong H. Crosby J.R. Lee J.J. Kellems R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 129: 159-170Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar).ADA-deficient mice serve as a useful model for elucidating the biochemical basis of the various phenotypic abnormalities associated with the loss of ADA function. In considering the complexity of the phenotypes associated with ADA deficiency in humans and mice, it is likely that some features may be attributed to alterations in adenosine signaling, whereas others are due to 2′-deoxyadenosine-induced metabolic disturbances. Here we report the use of ADA enzyme therapy to regulate the level of metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency and show that relatively low levels of ADA enzyme therapy correct the pulmonary abnormalities. Much higher doses of enzyme therapy are required to alleviate the immunodeficiency, a finding relevant to the use of enzyme therapy to treat ADA deficiency in humans. Available evidence suggests that the pulmonary insufficiency in ADA-deficient mice results from abnormalities in adenosine signaling (27Blackburn M.R. Volmer J.B. Thrasher J.L. Zhong H. Crosby J.R. Lee J.J. Kellems R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 129: 159-170Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas the immunodeficiency stems largely from 2′-deoxyadenosine-induced metabolic cytotoxicity. Thus, ADA enzyme therapy serves as a convenient experimental strategy to regulate the metabolic consequences of ADA deficiency and differentially correct abnormalities associated with ADA deficiency.DISCUSSIONADA deficiency in humans is most often associated with a severe combined immunodeficiency (2Hershfield M.S.

However, additional non-lymphoid abnormalities have been noted, including bone, kidney, and adrenal abnormalities (9Ratech H. Greco M.A. Gallo G. Rimoin D.L. Kamino H. Hirschhorn R. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 120: 157-169PubMed Google Scholar), liver damage (8Bollinger M.E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Schwarz K. Hershfield M.S. Lederman H.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and problems associated with the nervous system (10Hirschhorn R. Paageorgiou P.S. Kesarwala H.H. Taft L.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pulmonary insufficiency in ADA-deficient patients is similar to pulmonary insufficiency seen in patients with other forms of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. It is not present at birth, and is most commonly found in association with known pathogens. The lung injury in ADA-deficient mice is present early in life and is not associated with infection (27Blackburn M.R. Volmer J.B. Thrasher J.L. Zhong H. Crosby J.R. Lee J.J. Kellems R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 129: 159-170Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the current study, PEG-ADA enzyme therapy was used to study the impact of tissue metabolic disturbances on the pulmonary and immune phenotypes seen in ADA-deficient mice (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Blackburn M.R. Volmer J.B. Thrasher J.L. Zhong H. Crosby J.R. Lee J.J. Kellems R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 129: 159-170Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ADA-deficient mice were initially given a low-dose of PEG-ADA that resulted in circulating enzyme activities below plasma PEG-ADA levels achieved in patients with ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency disease (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar, 31Hershfield M.S.

Invest. 1993; 92: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this low-dose of PEG-ADA was capable of rescuing ADA-deficient mice from lethality due to pulmonary injury. This low-dose treatment corrected systemic and lung accumulations of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine, but did not prevent elevations of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine in the thymus and spleen. Consequently, defects in lymphoid development persisted. A PEG-ADA treatment protocol designed to maintain circulating PEG-ADA activity at concentrations that are in the effective range seen in humans (31Hershfield M.S. Chaffee S. Sorensen R.U. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: S42-S47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Weinberg K. Hershfield M.S. Bastian J. Kohn D. Sender L. Parkman R. Lenarsky C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) resulted in substantial improvements in immune status as well as a major reduction in the degree of substrate elevations in the thymus and spleen. These findings suggest that the pulmonary and immune phenotypes seen in ADA-deficient mice are separable and are mediated by the different degrees of metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency.The pulmonary phenotype seen in ADA-deficient mice is characterized by a developmental defect in alveogenesis that results in enlarged alveolar airways (27Blackburn M.R. Volmer J.B. Thrasher J.L. Zhong H. Crosby J.R. Lee J.J. Kellems R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 129: 159-170Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, these animals develop severe lung inflammation and damage that kills these animals by 3 weeks of age. Lung damage and inflammation was associated with the elevation of adenosine and to a lesser extent, 2′-deoxyadenosine in the lungs (25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We show that maintaining ADA-deficient mice on a low-dose of PEG-ADA resulted in normal lung development, and lung inflammation and damage was not seen. This was associated with prevention of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine elevations in the lungs, suggesting ADA substrates are mediating the abnormal lung development and inflammation. Both adenosine (14Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2′-deoxyadenosine (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar) have potent physiological effects on cells. Adenosine elicits its actions on cells by engaging G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface (14Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This signaling pathway plays important roles in many aspects of lung inflammation and damage (20Jacobson M.A. Bai T.R. Jacobson K.A. Jarvis M.F. Purinergic Approaches in Experimental Therapeutics. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Danvers, MA1997: 585-591Google Scholar), and adenosine elevations in the lung could influence normal adenosine signaling during lung development, and may promote inflammation and damage in ADA-deficient lungs. Efforts to identify the adenosine receptor subtypes expressed in normal and ADA-deficient lungs, and the use of genetic and pharmacological approaches to study their function will help us to understand the impact of adenosine signaling in this model. 2′-Deoxyadenosine elevation has been implicated to lead to the disruption of cell growth and development (38Benveniste P. Zhu W. Cohen A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 536-544PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carson D.A. Seto S. Wasson D.B. Carrera C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and influence apoptosis (23Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). Although 2′-deoxyadenosine elevations in ADA-deficient lungs were relatively low, the potential impact of 2′-deoxyadenosine cytotoxicity on the pulmonary phenotype cannot be ruled out at this time.A major finding of this study was the observation that the pulmonary and immune phenotypes could be separated. This was made possible by the finding that a low-dose of PEG-ADA was sufficient to normalize adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine levels in the circulation and the well vascularized lung, but was not sufficient to prevent substrate elevations in the thymus and spleen. Elevated thymic nucleosides are likely due to high levels of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine generated in the thymus due to the large amount of apoptosis naturally occurring in this organ as a part of thymocyte development 2L. F. Thompson, unpublished observations. (24Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observation that enzyme treatments that maintained high PEG-ADA trough values were needed to achieve metabolic and phenotypic improvement in the thymus and spleen. The benefits of PEG-ADA enzyme therapy in humans have focused predominantly on the immune system; however, some studies show a rapid improvement of non-immune phenotypes following PEG-ADA treatment or red cell transfusion (8Bollinger M.E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Schwarz K. Hershfield M.S. Lederman H.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Hirschhorn R. Paageorgiou P.S. Kesarwala H.H. Taft L.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pulmonary insufficiency is common in ADA-deficient patients, and these insufficiencies are most often attributed to bacterial or viral pneumonia that arises from a compromised immune system. However, in many cases of interstitial pneumonia an organism cannot be isolated (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). Our observations in ADA-deficient mice suggest that it is possible that the metabolic disturbances may directly contribute to the pulmonary insufficiency occurring in ADA-deficient patients.ADA deficiency in humans results in a severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a depletion of T, B, and NK cells (6Buckley R.H. Schiff R.I. Schiff S.E. Markert M.L. Williams L.W. Harville T.O. Roberts J.L. Puck J.M. J. Pediatr. 1997; 130: 378-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). All three of these cell populations were reduced in ADA-deficient mice, making them a valuable model for studying mechanisms governing the immunodeficiency seen as a result of ADA deficiency. In this model we were able to conduct experiments not permissible in humans, including the removal of lymphoid organs for the examination of specific lymphoid cells, and the investigation of metabolic disturbances in various tissues. Results showed an apparent block in T cell development at the transition from DN to DP stage in ADA-deficient thymuses, which was in agreement with previously observed findings2 (24Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). High doses of PEG-ADA were required to see an improvement in lymphocyte differentiation and an increase in the number of mature T, B, and NK cells. T cells have been demonstrated to be sensitive in vitro to the metabolic consequences of ADA deficiency (reviewed in Ref. 2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). Toxicity has been demonstrated for adenosine (40Kizaki H. Suzuki K. Tadakuma T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5280-5284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however; more notable are the effects of 2′-deoxyadenosine cytotoxicity on lymphoid cells (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S.

Less is known about the impact of ADA substrate accumulation on B and NK cells. However, results presented here and results in ADA-deficient patients during PEG-ADA therapy and after its discontinuation (8Bollinger M.E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Schwarz K.

Med. 1998; 4: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggest that B and NK cells are directly impacted by ADA substrate accumulation. More research into the mechanisms of substrate actions on B and NK cells are needed to improve our understanding of the immunodeficiency associated with ADA deficiency.These studies lay the groundwork for the use of ADA-deficient mice to advance the treatment of ADA deficiency in humans. Rescuing ADA-deficient mice from lethality using PEG-ADA enzyme therapy will make possible the examination of bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy interventions in these animals. Furthermore, this model will be useful in the analysis of the metabolic and immunologic consequences associated with the cessation of PEG-ADA enzyme therapy. This information will be important for fully understanding the potential benefits of ADA gene therapy, which is currently performed in conjunction with PEG-ADA therapy. In addition to therapeutic advances, the ability to manipulate substrate accumulations in ADA-deficient mice using various doses of ADA enzyme therapy will allow for the examination of the impact of these substrates or their metabolites on the immune system and other phenotypes associated with ADA deficiency. In particular, the use of PEG-ADA in ADA-deficient mice provides a means to manipulate the levels of adenosine in tissues and cellsin vivo. This may provide an opportunity to study a vast array of physiological systems that are influenced by adenosine signaling. Adenosine deaminase (ADA)1 deficiency was the first of the immunodeficiency diseases for which the underlying biochemical defect was discovered (1Giblett E.R. Anderson J.E. Cohen F. Pollara B. Meuwissen H.J. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1067-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). This unexpected finding revealed the crucial importance of ADA for the development and function of the immune system. Subsequent analysis indicated that ADA deficiency accounted for approximately 20% of the incidence of combined immunodeficiency disease in humans (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). However, the causal link between purine metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency and the resulting immunodeficiency has not been determined. In recent years, ADA deficiency has received added interest because it has served as a testing ground for the development of novel therapies, especially enzyme therapy (3Hershfield M.S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1995; 76: S228-S232Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and gene therapy (4Blaese R.M. Culver K.W. Miller A.D. Carter C.S. Fleisher T. Clerici M. Shearer G. Chang L.

Complex II is entirely nuclear gene-encoded. Unlike nuclear genes the mtDNA exists in thousands of copies per cell, is replicated throughout life, and in most animals including humans is maternally inherited. Transcription of mtDNA is linked to replication, and the 13 proteins are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes and assembled with around 60 nuclear gene products to produce the functional holocomplexes (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Clayton D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 2Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The five OXPHOS complexes act as a redox pathway, transferring electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen. The passage of electrons is linked to proton efflux from the matrix through complexes I, III, and IV across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The proton gradient in turn is the source of power for the H+-ATP synthase (2Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). OXPHOS produces the majority of the ATP of the cell and is also a major source of reactive oxygen species production. In efficiently respiring mitochondria around 2% of oxygen consumed is directly converted into reactive oxygen species, and this amount is increased when the respiratory chain is inhibited in in vitro and in vivo studies (3Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Genetic defects of OXPHOS may therefore result from nuclear or mtDNA gene mutations. Since the first descriptions of disease-related mtDNA mutations appeared just over 10 years ago (4Wallace D.C. Singh G. Lott M.T. Hodge J.A. Schurr T.G. Lezza A.M.S. Elsas L.J., II Nikoskelainen E.K.

Clincal presentations of mtDNA diseases are extremely variable, although a few syndromes are associated with specific mtDNA defects. Presentations range from severe and progressive neonatal or childhood neuromuscular disease, to milder adult disease including muscle weakness, cardiac disease, diabetes, vision, and hearing loss (see Refs. 6Wallace D.C.

Despite these genetic advances, our understanding of pathogenesis in mitochondrial diseases remains poor, with little progress made on the underlying causes of clinical heterogeneity and progression of symptoms, which in turn has inhibited development of directed therapies. The creation of in vitro and in vivomouse models of mtDNA diseases is therefore of great current interest. However the unique features of mitochondrial genetics including the high cellular mtDNA copy number and the lack of demonstrated mechanisms of recombination have presented technical barriers to producing mtDNA “knockout” mice. Several groups have reported different approaches aimed at directly manipulating the mitochondrial genotype of oocytes or zygotes or using direct mitochondrial injection into oocytes (see Ref. 9Irwin M.H. Johnson L.W. Pinkert C.A. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two other groups (10Levy S.E. Waymire K.G. Kim Y.L. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Marchington D.R. Barlow D. Poulton J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have reported production of transmitochondrial mice using an embryonic stem (ES) cell approach and one of very few characterized cultured mouse cell mtDNA mutants (a rRNA mutation resulting in resistance to chloramphenicol). One of these groups recently reported successful germ line transmission of this mtDNA mutation, although from limited data presented to date the phenotype appears to be post-natal lethal (12Wallace D.C. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65 (abstr.): 18Google Scholar). If the ES cell approach to producing transmitochondrial mice is validated, the major limitation to producing models is now the lack of available mtDNA mutants in cultured mouse cells. Another approach to producing OXPHOS defects in mouse cells was suggested by Kenyon and Moraes (13Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) who established that human mtDNA-less (ρ0) cells could be repopulated with closely related primate mtDNAs. The resulting “xenomitochondrial cybrids” could replicate and transcribe the foreign mtDNAs and showed defective respiratory chain complex I with preserved function of the other complexes (14Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we report the introduction of mtDNAs from different murid species into mouse cells to produce mouse xenomitochondrial cybrids. We have introduced closely related (Mus spretus) and more distantly related (Rattus norvegicus) murid mtDNAs into a Mus musculus ρ0 cell line, which in the latter case results in multiple respiratory chain defects similar to some human mtDNA diseases. All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Primary fibroblast lines were created from a 2-day-old laboratory mouse (M. musculus, CBA/C57Bl6 cross) and 5-week-old M. spretus (Spret/Ei, a gift from Dr. Simon Foote, Walter & Eliza Hall Institute). Skin from the belly of euthanized mice was washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 2× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in RPMI medium for 4 h at 4 °C, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, then passed through a tissue sieve using a glass pestle, and plated in complete medium in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Denmark). Media were replaced twice weekly, and after 2–3 weeks the primary cultures began to grow vigorously, and aliquots were viably frozen. Two independent mouse ρ0 cell clones were used, designated LMEB3 and LMEB5. These were produced from the parental line LMTK− by exposure to ethidium bromide and are described in detail elsewhere (15Trounce I.A. Schmiedel J. Hsiu-Chuan Y. Hossini S. Brown M.D. Olsen G. Wallace D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These mtDNA-less cells are auxotrophic for uridine and pyruvate (see Ref. 16King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the medium was supplemented with glucose to 4.5 mg/ml, uridine, 50 μg/ml, and pyruvate, 1 mm (RPMI/GUP medium). The following cell lines were obtained from the ATCC: NRK52E (R. norvegicus kidney epithelial cells), RN1T (R. norvegicus mammary tumor line), Chinese hamster ovary cells (Cricetulus grigaeus), and Syrian hamster kidney cells (Mesocricetus aureus). Cybrids were produced by enucleation of mitochondrial donor cells and fusion of the cytoplasts with mouse ρ0 cells followed by selection for respiratory-competent transformants as described in detail previously for human cells (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells used as mitochondrial donors included the mouse primary fibroblast line, the M. spretus primary fibroblast line, the Rattus lines NRK52E and RN1T, and the hamster lines Chinese hamster ovary cells and Syrian hamster kidney. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were enucleated by centrifugation at in an isopycnic Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient in the presence of 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma). The cytoplast/karyoplast mixture was combined with 2 × 106 mouse ρ0 cells and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was aspirated and the pellet overlaid with polyethylene glycol (Sigma) for 1 min. The polyethylene glycol was then removed, and the cells were gently resuspended in complete medium and plated at 104 and 105 cells per 100-mm dish in RPMI-GUP medium. After 24 h the medium was replaced with select medium as follows: RPMI supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma). In this medium lacking uridine and pyruvate the ρ0 cells cannot grow, and the bromodeoxyuridine kills surviving TK+ mitochondrial donor cells so that only LMTK− cybrids can survive. After 7–14 days cybrid clones were isolated using cloning cylinders, expanded, and viably frozen. Three independent clones were frozen from each successful fusion experiment, and cybrids were used in experiments from passage 5 through passage 10. To confirm the nuclear origin of the cybrids, karyotyping of a control cybrid and a Rattus xenocybrid clone was performed. Cells were grown in RPMI/GUP medium in a 25-cm2 flask. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml demecolcine (Sigma) for 5 h, harvested, resuspended in 10 ml of 75 mm KCl, and incubated at room temperature for 12 min. Cells were pelleted before being resuspended in 5 ml of fresh methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C, pelleted, washed once in fixative, and then resuspended to give a pale milky solution. Cells were then dropped onto wet, acid-washed slides from a distance of 70 cm, allowed to dry, and stained with Giemsa (Sigma). A mtDNA D-loop fragment was generated by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from cybrid clones. Primers were chosen to enable amplification from both mouse (18Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) and R. norvegicus (19Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) mtDNA. The mouse amplicon was 461 base pairs in length, whereas the rat amplicon was 496 base pairs due to intervening sequence insertions compared with the mouse mtDNA (18Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 19Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The forward primer sequence was 5′-ctc aac ata gcc gtc aag gc-3′ representing nucleotides 15934–15953 (18Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar), and the reverse primer was 5′-acc aaa cct ttg tgt tta tgg g-3′ representing nucleotides 59–80. PCR was performed using 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 ng of DNA, and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Sequencing was performed using 60 ng of purified amplicon, with a Thermo Sequenase II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing reactions were visualized on an ABI 377 automated sequencer. The mouse and rat D-loop PCR amplicons described above were used to probe mtDNA, whereas a PCR fragment of mouse 18 S rRNA gene was used as a nuclear probe. This PCR amplicon was 501 base pairs in length; the forward primer sequence was 5′-ctg tgg taa ttc tag agc taa tac atg ccg-3′, representing positions 151–180 of the mouse 18 S rRNA gene (GenBankTM accession number X00686) The reverse primer sequence was 5′-tat acg cta ttg gag ctg gaa tta cc-3′, representing nucleotides 626–651. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a RediPrime II random prime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For each lane of a 0.85% agarose gel, 5 μg of genomic DNA was loaded after restriction with SacI (Life Technologies, Inc.), which has a single restriction site in mouse and rat mtDNA. The transfer, probe annealing, and washing was done using standard conditions. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (20Brown M.D. Yang C.-C. Trounce I. Torroni A. Lott M.T. Wallace D.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51: 378-385PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 105 cells in single wells of a 24-well tissue culture dish (Nunc) were washed with methionine-free RPMI before adding 0.5 ml of the same medium containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide and incubating the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2for 15 min. After this preincubation 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN) was added to each well, and the cells returned to the incubator for 2 h. Cold methionine (0.1 mm, Sigma) was then added, and the cells were incubated a further 30 min. Cells were immediately harvested, centrifuged, and frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets were prepared for electrophoresis by thawing and dilution in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysates were sonicated with 3 pulses at setting 5 using a Tosco sonicator (MSE, Melbourne, Australia). Electrophoresis of labeled proteins was performed using 15% acrylamide (1:36 bisacrylamide) mini-gels (CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA) with 10 μg of cellular protein per lane. Gels were electrophoresed at 100 V for 30 min, fixed in methanol/acetic acid, treated with “Amplify” (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried for autoradiography. Lactate was measured in media using a commercial kit (Sigma). Cybrids were grown to confluence in 24-well culture dishes, and the media were replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh media after two rinses with 1 ml of media, and the cells were incubated for 10 h. Samples of media were removed at 2-h intervals and tested immediately for lactate concentration. Mitochondrial isolation and polarography using freshly isolated mitochondria was performed as described previously in detail for human cell mitochondria (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control and xenomitochondrial cybrids (xenocybrids) were grown in paired cultures so that a control was always processed alongside the experimental xenocybrid culture. Cultures were expanded to around 109 cells by seeding 2 × 107 cells into roller bottles (Corning) in 200 ml of complete medium, expanded after 4 or 5 days to 1000 ml, and then harvested after another 4 days. Mitochondria were isolated by digitonin lysis and homogenization, followed by differential centrifugation (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria were resuspended to around 20 mg/ml protein in isolation buffer and used immediately for polarographic analysis. Protein was measured according to the Lowry method. Aliquots were also frozen at −80 °C for enzymological analysis. Polarography was performed using an Instech (Plymouth Meeting, PA) microelectrode and chamber coupled with a magnetic stirrer and an Instech model 203 dual oxygen electrode amplifier with output to a chart recorder. Each mitochondrial isolate was tested for respiratory capacity using pyruvate plus malate, glutamate plus malate, and succinate as substrates. Two runs were performed with each substrate, and in each run two additions of ADP were made. Conditions and experimental details were as described previously (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3), complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.5.1), complex II + III (succinate:cytochromec oxidoreductase), and complex IV (ferrocytochrome-c:oxygen oxidoreductase, or cytochrome oxidase, EC 1.9.3.1) activities were measured spectrophotometrically, essentially as described previously (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. A single beam spectrophotometer was used for all assays (Cintra 10, GBC Melbourne) instead of a dual-beam machine. For complex I, the oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm (21Estornell E. Fato R. Pallotti F. Lenaz P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) using ubiquinone-1 (Sigma) as electron acceptor. For the complex II, II + III, and IV assays, conditions were as described previously (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except the single-beam machine was used. For each assay, each mitochondrial sample was tested in triplicate. Control cybrids produced by fusion of the ρ0 cell clone LMEB3 with enucleated M. musculus primary fibroblasts were obtained at a frequency of around one per 5 × 103ρ0 cells used. Similar cybrid frequencies were obtained in a fusion of LMEB3 with enucleated M. spretus cells (diverged from M. musculus 2–3 million years ago, see Refs.22Catzeflis F.M. Dickerman A.W. Michaux J.

Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, and see Fig. 1). Both the control cybrids and M. spretus xenomitochondrial cybrids were similar in appearance and growth characteristics to each other and to the parental LMTK− cell line. Fusions using enucleatedRattus NRK52E cells with LMEB5 and enucleatedRattus RN1T cells with LMEB3 also produced cybrids at high frequencies, around one per 104 ρ0 cells used. However both these sets of cybrid clones grew more slowly, showed a morphology intermediate between the control cybrids and the ρ0 cells, and acidified the media much more quickly than the control cybrids. The Mus/Rattus divergence is dated at around 10 million years ago (Fig. 1). TableI summarizes the amino acid sequence differences between the M. musculus and R. norvegicus mtDNA-encoded proteins.Table IComparison of M. musculus and R. norvegicus mitochondrial translation productsmt gene productIdentityNo. of amino acidsNo. of amino acid differencesRnMm%NAD19031831532NAD27434534588COX I9751451414COX II992272273ATP879676714ATP69522622612COX III972612619NAD38711511415NAD4L86989714NAD48745945959NAD578610607133NAD68017217234Cytochromeb9338038126 Open table in a new tab Fusions of enucleated hamster cells with LMEB3 failed to produce any cybrids in two experiments, one using Chinese hamster (C. grigaeus) cells and the other using Syrian golden hamster (M. aureus) cells. The Muridae subfamily Cricetinae, which includes the hamsters, diverged from the Murinae subfamily around 16 million years ago (Fig. 1). Karyotyping of a control (M. musculus) cybrid and aRattus xenocybrid revealed the same number of chromosomes, with a mean of 40 ± 2.2 (n = 4 counts) for the control, and 40 ± 1.5 (n = 6 counts) for the xenocybrid. For theM. spretus and R. xenocybrids, mitochondrial transfer was verified by direct sequencing of a PCR fragment of the mtDNA D-loop region. The M. spretus xenocybrid showed 81% identity with the published M. musculus sequence (18Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) for the region sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF287305). The Rattus xenocybrids produced using NRK52E cells as mitochondrial donors showed only 62% identity to M. musculus for the region sequenced and in agreement with the published R. norvegicus sequence (19Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The cybrids made from RN1T cells showed a single nucleotide difference to the R. norvegicus sequence, an insertion of a C in a 8-C tract at nucleotide pair 16075. This cell line is listed by ATCC asRattus rattus, but this almost perfect identity with theR. norvegicus sequence indicates it is also derived fromR. norvegicus, as R. rattus would be expected to show many more sequence differences in this highly polymorphic D-loop region, based on molecular studies of these two species (25Verneau O. Caatzeflis F. Furano A.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Southern blot of control cybrid and Rattusxenocybrid DNA after restriction with SacI and probing with a mouse and rat mtDNA D-loop PCR amplicon showed similar mtDNA hybridization signals. SacI has a single restriction site in both mouse and rat mtDNA, resulting in a single band seen at 16.5 kilobase pairs. The blot showed that similar levels of mtDNA are maintained in the xenocybrid compared with the control. Mitochondrial translation products labeled in the presence of cycloheximide are shown after electrophoresis in Fig.2. Most of the 13 proteins are identifiable by mobility together with characteristic intensity of labeling, as shown at left in Fig. 2. The profiles of the control cybrid and Rattus xenocybrid are similar overall. One mobility polymorphism between the M. musculus andRattus products is evident, possibly the ND2 gene product NAD2, which was also seen in the parental NRK52E cells (not shown). Two proteins appear to be produced in increased amounts, possibly NAD4 and ATP6, while two others, likely NAD5 and cytochromeb, appear to be decreased. The same pattern was observed in two independent labeling experiments. The similarity of the profiles shows that transcription and translation of the foreign mtDNA is not markedly impaired. Fig. 3shows the lactate production from the control and M. spretuscybrids, the Rattus cybrid, and the ρ0 cell line. A respiratory defect is signaled in the Rattusxenocybrid by the 10-fold greater lactate production compared with the control cybrid, whereas the M. spretus xenocybrid shows similar low lactate production to the control (Fig. 3). The ρ0 cell line produced 2-fold greater amounts of lactate than the Rattus xenocybrid, indicating that the cybrid was able to produce some ATP oxidatively. Fig.4 shows typical polarograph traces of site I (glutamate + malate) and site II (succinate) oxidation in the control and Rattus xenocybrid mitochondria. The control traces (A and B) show good coupling to ADP stimulation and high respiration rates and ADP/O ratios. In theRattus xenocybrid (C and D), site I-linked respiration is impaired but remains coupled to ADP availability, whereas site II-linked respiration shows a more severe defect, with little stimulation by added ADP. Comparison of the mean specific respiratory rates from three independent experiments (TableII) revealed that the M. spretus cybrid showed similar respiratory capacity to the control, whereas the Rattus cybrid state III (ADP-stimulated) rates were significantly lower than the control. This was true for site I substrates (31% mean control rates) and succinate (12% mean control rate). The ADP/O ratios obtained with site I substrates were also significantly lower in the Rattus cybrid (71% controls, Table II). These results are consistent with defects in either or both complex III or IV limiting respiratory chain electron flow, possibly combined with a complex I defect.Table IIPolarographic analysis of OXPHOS in mitochondria isolated from xenocybridsSubstrateCybrid (mtDNA donor)State III rateRCRADP/Ong atom/O/min/mgGlutamate + malateM. musculus137 ± 264.52.56 ± 0.20M. spretus136 ± 123.82.55 ± 0.26R. norvegicus42 ± 17 2-ap < 0.005 compared with control.2.31.83 ± 0.13 2-ap < 0.005 compared with control.Pyruvate + malateM. musculus127 ± 294.62.76 ± 0.31M. spretus144 ± 104.42.48 ± 0.07R. norvegicus40 ± 19 2-ap < 0.005 compared with control.2.31.96 ± 0.44 2-ap < 0.005 compared with control.SuccinateM. musculus133 ± 303.41.74 ± 0.32M. spretus151 ± 173.41.57 ± 0.26R. norvegicus16 ± 10 2-ap < 0.005 compared with control.Numbers are mean ± S.D. of three mitochondrial isolates studied.

Table IIIsummarizes the mean activity of OXPHOS complexes I, II, II + III, and IV measured in triplicate using three independent mitochondrial isolates from each of the control, M. spretus andRattus xenocybrids. No significant differences were found for the M. spretus xenocybrid compared with the control. TheRattus xenocybrid showed normal complex II activity with varying defects of the other complexes. Complex I (rotenone-sensitive activity) was significantly decreased to 46% of the control levels, whereas complex IV showed a partial but significant defect with 78% control activity (Table III). The most striking defect was indicated by the II + III assay result, showing only 37% of the control activity (Table III). Together with the preserved complex II activity, this result suggests a severe complex III defect since this linked assay is normally rate-limited by complex II (26Taylor R.W.

By introducing R. norvegicus mtDNA into a mouse mtDNA-less cell line, we have produced a new mouse in vitromodel of a severe mtDNA OXPHOS defect. Only a handful of mtDNA mouse cell mutants have been described, the best characterized being a point mutation in the 16 S rRNA gene resulting in resistance of the mitochondrial ribosome to chloramphenicol (CAPR) (27Blanc H.

The lack of methods to produce targeted mtDNA knockouts has limited attempts to produce mtDNA mutant mice. A transfection approach using a DNA construct linked to a mitochondrial target peptide leader sequence is promising but has not yet succeeded in transforming mitochondria in cultured cells (29Seibel P. Trappe J. Villani G. Klopstock T. Papa S. Reichmann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Seibel M. Bachmann C. Schmiedel J. Wilken N. Wilde F.

A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) pioneered the approach of xenomitochondrial cybrids by showing that only the most closely related primate mtDNAs could be maintained in human ρ0cells. These human/primate xenomitochondrial cybrids exhibited defects in respiratory chain complex I (14Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and an increased sensitivity to programmed cell death when treated with complex I inhibitors (31Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The finding by Moraes et al. (32Moraes C.T. Kenyon L. Hao H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that human cells preferentially replicate even defective human mtDNA over introduced normal primate mtDNAs showed that mtDNA determinants fortrans-acting factors may be more important than OXPHOS functionality. In the present studies we found that there is also a limit on mtDNA compatibility as indicated by the inability of the mouse ρ0 cells to maintain hamster mtDNA. Divergence of hamsters (Muridae subfamily Cicetidae) from the Murinae subfamily including mice and rats was around 16 million years ago (Fig. 1 (22Catzeflis F.M. Dickerman A.W. Michaux J. Kirsch J.A.W. Szalay F.S. Novacek M.J. McKenna M.C. Mammal Phylogeny: Placentals. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1993: 159-172Crossref Google Scholar)). The Mus/Rattus divergence was around 10 million years ago (Fig. 1 (23Bonhomme F. Guenet J.-L. Lyon M.F. Rastan S. Brown S.D.M. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1577-1595Google Scholar)) and may approximate the limit of compatibility in this system. The resulting xenocybrids exhibited a severe OXPHOS impairment (Table II and III and Figs. 3 and 4) despite showing preserved mtDNA replication and translation (Fig. 3). This shows the defects are consequent to the mismatches between the mouse nuclear OXPHOS subunits and the Rattus mtDNA subunits (Table I; see also accompanying article (33Dey R. Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31520-31527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). A marked defect of complex I was seen in the Rattus xenocybrids (Table III) but unlike the human/primate xenocybrids there was also a striking defect of complex III together with a partial defect of complex IV (Table III). This shows that predictions from the human/primate system do not translate directly into the murid system. The number of amino acid substitutions range from only 3 in the highly conserved COX-2 protein, to 133 in NAD5 (Table I), making it difficult to predict which changes are functionally important. The suggestion of a severe complex III defect is particularly interesting since cytochrome b is the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of this complex. Cytochrome b shows 26 amino acid differences between M. musculus and R. norvegicus (Table I). The polarographic results (Table II and Fig. 4) show that succinate-linked respiration is more severely impaired than site 1-linked respiration, despite the latter requiring the same electron transfer pathway through complexes III and IV. This could result from substrate inhibition exacerbating the complex III defect, as there will be a greater steady state ubiquinol concentration during succinate oxidation compared with site 1-linked substrate oxidation due to the higher specific activity of complex II over complex I. M. spretus and M. musculus diverged approximately 2–3 million years ago (Fig. 1). Although the present studies show no differences in OXPHOS capacity for the M. spretusxenocybrids, further studies may show subtle but important defects in this model. The levels of M. spretus mtDNA were too low in the mice produced by Irwin et al. (9Irwin M.H. Johnson L.W. Pinkert C.A. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to conclude there were no pathogenic effects, and creation of this mouse would be an important proof of the principle from which to proceed to make other xenomitochondrial mice using the ES cell approach. By making further xenomitochondrial constructs with species intermediate between M. spretus and Rattus, it should be possible to produce cybrids with intermediate OXPHOS phenotypes. By comparative studies of OXPHOS and mtDNA sequences from the species used, it should be possible to gain important new insights into the nuclear-mtDNA-encoded subunit interactions, in addition to the potential value of this system in producing mouse models of human mtDNA diseases. Evolution has provided a rich source of options. The Muridae is the most successful family of the order Rodentia, having the greatest number of extant species of any mammalian family (22Catzeflis F.M. Dickerman A.W. Michaux J. Kirsch J.A.W. Szalay F.S. Novacek M.J. McKenna M.C. Mammal Phylogeny: Placentals. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1993: 159-172Crossref Google Scholar, 24Silver L.M. Mouse Genetics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). There are literally dozens of potential constructs that can be produced. The Gerbillinae subfamily of Muridae, the gerbils, are intermediate in divergence to Rattus and the hamsters (Fig. 1) and may produce viable xenocybrids. We would predict these constructs to produce severe OXPHOS defects if the mtDNAs could be replicated. We thank Dr. Simon Foote for the M. spretus specimen. We also thank Professor Richard Cotton, Professor Ed Byrne, and Dr. Andrew Wilks for support."

Activity was measured against bovine testicular hyaluronidase using a microtiter-based assay and reverse hyaluronan substrate gel zymography. The predominant inhibitory activity was magnesium-dependent and could be eliminated by protease or chondroitinase digestion and by heat treatment. Kinetics of inhibition were similar against hyaluronidases from testis and snake and bee venoms. The inhibitor had no effect on Streptomyceshyaluronidase, indicating that inhibition was not through protection of the hyaluronan substrate. Inhibition levels in serum were increased in mice following carbon tetrachloride or interleukin-1 injection, inducers of the acute-phase response. Reverse zymography identified a predominant band of 120-kDa relative molecular size, with two bands of greater and one of smaller size. The predominant protein was tentatively identified as a member of the inter-α-inhibitor family. Inhibition was also observed using either purified inter-α-inhibitor or an inter-α-inhibitor-related 120-kDa complex. Inter-α-inhibitor, found in the hyaluronan-rich cumulus mass surrounding mammalian ova and the coat of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells, may function to stabilize such matrices by protecting against hyaluronidase degradation. Turnover of circulating hyaluronan is extraordinarily rapid, with a half-life of 2–5 min. Prompt increases in levels of serum hyaluronan occur in patients with shock, septicemia, or massive burns, increases that can be attributed, in part, to suppression of degradation by these acute-phase reactants, the inhibitors of hyaluronidase.

The enzymes that digest HA, the hyaluronidases, are a family of proteins that, until recently, have been relatively neglected (8Kreil G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1666-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Csóka T.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 297-311PubMed Google Scholar, 10Csóka A.B. Stern R.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), embryonic development (14Toole B.P. Goldberg R.L. Chi-Rosso G. Underhill C.B. Orkin R.W. Trelstad L.

Using molecular genetic techniques, it was established recently that there are seven hyaluronidases in the human genome, a paralogous group of six genes clustered three each on chromosomes 3p21.3 and 7q31 (19Csóka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). 2See www.glycoforum.gr.jp/science/hyaluronan/HA15/HA15E.html. The gene for a putative seventh hyaluronidase enzyme, unrelated to this group of six, is found on chromosome 10q24 (20Heckel D. Comtesse N. Brass N. Blin N. Zang K.D. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1859-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another level of control for HA deposition may be hyaluronidase inhibitors, a group of compounds about which little is known. The first studies documenting the existence of a circulating inhibitor of hyaluronidase were published from 1946 to 1949 (21Haas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 163: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dorfman A. Ot M.L. Whitney R. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 174: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moore D.H. Harris T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 179: 377-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were followed by clinical reports that increased inhibitor levels occur in the sera of patients with cancer (24Hyman J.J. Friedman B.A. Freedlander S.O. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 1955; 100: 515-520PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fiszer-Szafarz B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1968; 129: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Kolaova M. Neoplasma ( Bratisl. ). 1977; 24: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar), liver disease (27Snively G.G. Glick D. J. Clin. Invest. 1950; 29: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and dermatological disorders (28Grais M.L. Glick D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1948; 11: 259-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These inhibitors were high molecular mass thermolabile glycoproteins (29Newman J.K. Berenson G.S. Mathews M.B. Goldwasser E. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 31-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) requiring magnesium ion for full activity (30Mathews M.B. Moses F.E. Hart W. Dorfman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 35: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The inhibitor in cancer patients was qualitatively different, not requiring magnesium for activity (25Fiszer-Szafarz B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1968; 129: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite the facts that evidence for such inhibitors has been available for over half a century and that they have obvious clinical importance, and even though a review appeared in 1955 that summarized these findings (31Mathews M.B. Dorfman A. Physiol. Rev. 1955; 35: 381-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), no further characterization seems to have been undertaken. Impediments to progress perhaps may be attributed to lack of sufficiently sensitive tools and to the absence of rapid assays that could facilitate detection of activity during the course of biochemical isolation. This is compounded by the fact that most serum and plasma proteins are large structures with multiple carbohydrate chains attached, making common techniques such as ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography; isoelectric focusing; and sequential salt, alcohol, or pH precipitation and elution procedures notoriously difficult or ineffective. The techniques that enabled our identification of the hyaluronidase family of enzymes were a microtiter-based assay (32Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and a HA substrate gel zymography procedure (33Guntenhoener M.W. Pogrel M.H. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A variation of the latter was developed: reverse zymography in which the HA-containing gels are incubated in a solution of hyaluronidase. Stained bands mark the presence of inhibitors that protect the HA from degradation. Using this procedure, a major band of hyaluronidase inhibitor activity was observed in human plasma and serum specific for the neutral-active hyaluronidase associated with mammalian sperm, PH-20. Recent studies show that a factor that induces compaction of follicular cells in oocyte cultures is a member of the inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) family present in fetal bovine serum added to culture medium (34Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagashita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen L. Zhang H. Powers R.W. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19409-19414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Inter-α-inhibitors are among the major Kunitz-type plasma protease inhibitors with large molecular sizes ranging from 130 to 240 kDa (37Balduyck M. Laroui S. Mizon C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Salier J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 39Fries E. Blom A.M. Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and Its Derivatives. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 149-154Google Scholar). The original isoform reported for IαI consists of two heavy chains and one light chain called bikunin. The three polypeptide chains are covalently linked by a chondroitin sulfate chain. Further studies verified the existence of a large range in molecular size of IαI molecules (40Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition to the many genes coding for the heavy chains, divergence in the number and combination of peptides makes IαI a complex protein family. In this study, the hypothesis that some of the circulating hyaluronidase inhibitors are members of the IαI family was examined. Microtiter-based enzyme inhibitor analyses, immunoprecipitation studies, and the reverse HA substrate gel procedure demonstrated that the molecular size of the predominant circulating hyaluronidase inhibitor is ≅120 kDa and that it may be a member of the IαI family complex. Such inhibitors of hyaluronidase participating in the controls that establish levels of HA deposition in tissues may parallel the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases that regulate the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (41Tschesche H. J. Protein Chem. 1998; 17: 549-551PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Sera from various species were purchased from Sigma. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Wydase®) was kindly provided by Wyeth-Ayerst Co. (Philadelphia, PA). Covalink-NH microtiter plates were obtained from NUNC Co. (Placerville, NJ). Rabbit anti-human IαI antibodies and control rabbit IgG were purchased from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA), and Streptomyces hyaluronidase was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Human umbilical cord HA was the product of ICN Biomedical Inc. (Aurora, OH). Recombinant human plasma hyaluronidase-1 (Hyal-1) and monoclonal antibodies against Hyal-1 (17E9) were prepared in this laboratory as described (43Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 10-15Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Hyaluronidase assays were performed by a method reported previously (32Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 mg/ml human umbilical cord HA in 0.1 m Mes (pH 5.0) was biotinylated using 0.184 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 30 μm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The solution was dialyzed in distilled H2O and stored at −20 °C until used. The 96-well Covalink-NH plates were coated by placing 100 μl of biotinylated HA in each well and incubating overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with buffer and kept at 4 °C until used. For the hyaluronidase assay, samples were diluted in a buffer solution containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Each sample of 100 μl was applied to the biotinylated HA-coated plates, and the plates were subjected to enzymatic reaction for 30 min at 37 °C. The amount of undigested biotinylated HA was measured using an avidin-biotin complex reaction, followed by o-phenylenediamine substrate color detection at 492 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Titertek Multiskan Plus, ICN Biomedical Inc.). Hyaluronidase activity is expressed in relative turbidity reducing units (rTRUs) as defined previously (44Tolksdorf S. McCready M.H. McCullagh D.R. Schwenk E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1949; 34: 74-79PubMed Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using comparison with a set of standards generated by diluting the testicular hyaluronidase from 10 to 1 × 10−5rTRUs/ml. The test enzyme activity was calculated against the calibrated rTRUs. Hyaluronidase inhibition activity was measured in similar units, 1 inhibitor unit being sufficient to inhibit 1 rTRU/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase. Units of inhibition were validated by ensuring that the concentration of inhibitor was in a linear range and that inhibition was proportional to the amount of inhibitor added. Wydase® (bovine testicular hyaluronidase) and other neutral-active hyaluronidases were diluted to 1 rTRU/ml in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Mouse or human serum containing the putative hyaluronidase inhibitor activity was added to this solution at different concentrations (v/v). Suppression of testicular hyaluronidase activity was then measured. In the inhibition assay under acid conditions, Hyal-1-depleted human serum was used. It was necessary to eliminate endogenous acid-active hyaluronidase activity for this determination. Only mouse IgG antibodies against human Hyal-1 were available. For this reason, Hyal-1-immunodepleted human serum was used in this study, whereas all other studies were performed using mouse serum. Purified IgG from 17E9 hybridoma clones was used for the immunoprecipitation studies (43Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 10-15Google Scholar). Anti-human Hyal-1 antibody 17E9 at 4 μg/ml was conjugated to an equal volume of protein A-agarose by mixing at 4 °C overnight. The complex was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to remove unbound antibodies. The complex was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. Hyaluronidase in the serum was removed by an antibody capture technique. Equal volumes of 50% human serum in PBS with 17E9-conjugated beads were mixed. After rotation at 4 °C overnight, Hyal-1-depleted human serum was collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. Endogenous hyaluronidase activity and inhibition capacity against testicular hyaluronidase were measured before use. In this experiment, 94% of the hyaluronidase activity was depleted from the serum; on the other hand, >80% of the inhibitory activity remained. The effect of the remaining hyaluronidase activity was measured for each experiment, and allowance was made in the calculation of the data. Mammalian sera do not contain hyaluronidase activity in the neutral pH range. Human serum had ∼50% of the inhibitor activity against neutral-active Wydase, the commercial testicular hyaluronidase preparation, compared with mouse serum. The inhibition assay was performed using 2% (v/v) serum to adjust for the level of inhibition activity. For experiments of pH dependence of inhibitor activity, Hyal-1-depleted human serum was used as a source of inhibitor. The HA substrate gel technique was applied to detect the hyaluronidase inhibitor. The HA substrate gel zymography technique, devised for the detection of hyaluronidase activity (33Guntenhoener M.W. Pogrel M.H. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was modified for the detection of hyaluronidase inhibitor activity. The protocol described here was optimized for use with Bio-Rad 8 × 10-cm minigels. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-acrylamide gels containing 100 μg/ml HA. The SDS gels were then rinsed with 3% Triton X-100 for 1 h to substitute SDS, which might inactivate enzyme activity. The gels were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.15 mNaCl, and 1.0 mm MgCl2 containing 0.5 rTRU/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase. The hyaluronidase digestion step can be difficult. The gel is fragile at this stage and must be handled with care. Minor changes in temperature and pH may produce variable results. For this reason, three levels of hyaluronidase were used with each experiment. 0.5 rTRU/ml was the successful concentration in each case here. However, 0.25, 0.50, and 2.00 rTRUs/ml were used routinely to demonstrate that over- or under-digestion of the gels was not occurring. Proteins in the gel, which may disturb penetration of dye into the gel, were digested by incubating gels in 0.1 mg/ml Pronase (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 4 h at 37 °C. Undigested HA was detected in the gels by Alcian blue staining. The gels were washed with 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 20 min, followed by staining with 0.5% Alcian blue in 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h. This acidification of the Alcian blue enhances staining and prevents precipitation of dye. The gels were destained in 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid until the inhibitor bands, representing undigested HA, appeared. This usually was accomplished in 1 h. 2-month-old male Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). CCl4 was mixed in olive oil at 1:3 (v/v) and injected into the peritoneum of mice (160 μl/20 g of body weight). After 6, 24, and 48 h, blood was collected from mice under CO2 anesthesia. Serum fractions were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min following clot formation. Samples were kept frozen until used. IL-1, a kind gift from Dr. Charles Dinarello (University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO), was administered intraperitoneally (1 μg in 200 μl of PBS). For the serum acidification studies, serum samples were mixed with an equal volume of either 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) or 100 mm formate buffer (pH 3.7) and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were collected at each time period, frozen immediately, and stored until assayed. Enzymatic digestion with bacterial chondroitinase was also performed. Chondroitinase AC (Flavobacterium heparinum; Sigma C-2780) was added to 50 μl of serum at 50 units/ml and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The reverse HA substrate gel zymography procedure was then performed as described above. The multiple immunoprecipitation step study was performed using small volumes of rabbit anti-human IαI antibodies. The purified immunoglobulin fraction (Dako A301) and control rabbit IgG (Dako X0903) were utilized in a protocol slightly modified from that described in a previous report (35Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, 7.6 mg of rabbit anti-human IαI antibodies or control rabbit IgG were conjugated with 0.5 ml of protein A-agarose by mixing at 4 °C overnight. The IgG-protein A-agarose complex was washed three times with PBS to eliminate unbound IgG. The volume of each IgG-protein A-agarose complex was adjusted to 0.5 ml. The complex was added to serum samples at 10% (v/v) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to remove the pellets. This procedure was repeated four times. Hyaluronidase inhibition efficiency of each precipitation step in samples was compared with that of the untreated serum. Hyaluronidase inhibition activity from precipitated beads was also examined using these antibodies. Rabbit anti-human IαI antibodies or control rabbit IgG was added to 50% mouse serum at final concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/ml. Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight and then centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to separate the supernatant and IgG-protein A-agarose complex. The IgG-protein A-agarose complex was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. Hyaluronidase inhibition of the supernatant and IgG-protein-A-agarose complex was measured. Mouse IαI was isolated from mouse plasma according to the protocol described by Carrette et al. (46Carrette O. Mizon C. Sautière P. Sesboüé R. Mizon J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The protocol was slightly modified to adapt it to the AktaTM purifier system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, 10 ml of mouse plasma (RJO Biologicals, Inc., Kansas City, MO) were diluted 1:10 (v/v) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 4 mm EDTA (buffer A). The plasma was loaded onto a MonoQ HR5/5 column equilibrated in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing the column to remove unbound proteins, elution was performed by increasing the NaCl concentration to 0.6 m and then to 1m. IαI was found in the fraction that eluted at 0.6m NaCl. The fractions recovered from five different consecutive Q-Sepharose chromatography procedures were pooled and equilibrated by dialysis in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 4 mm EDTA and 0.1 m NaCl. After concentration by ultrafiltration to 5 ml, the dialyzed sample was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a 0.1–0.5 mNaCl linear gradient (total volume of 50 ml). An IαI-related 120-kDa complex was found in a fraction that eluted at 0.35 m NaCl, and mouse IαI was recovered in a fraction that eluted at 0.4m NaCl. The IαI fraction was ∼95% free of other proteins as judged by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purity of the IαI-related 120-kDa product, however, was ∼80%. Because of the high susceptibility of IαI to proteolysis, a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, one tablet dissolved in 2 ml of water; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added at a 1% (v/v) final concentration to both samples for long-term storage before testing for hyaluronidase inhibitory activity. Hyaluronidase inhibition activity was measured in sera using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay system. In preliminary data, mouse serum had approximately twice the levels of inhibitory activity as human serum. Mouse serum was therefore used in most subsequent experiments. Levels of inhibition activity were examined in mouse serum using bovine testicular hyaluronidase as the test enzyme. This is a neutral-active hyaluronidase with a bimodal curve of pH optima at 4.5 and 7.5, possibly the result of two forms of the enzyme present in the preparation, a soluble and a membrane-bound form (47Cherr G.N.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The inhibition assay was performed at pH 7.5. Serum was examined between 0.25 and 2.00% (v/v) reaction mixture. The hyaluronidase activity was suppressed by addition of mouse serum in a dose-dependent manner. 50% inhibition was obtained at ∼0.35% volume (Fig.1). Heparin, a well characterized inhibitor of hyaluronidase (50Wolf R.A. Glogar D. Chuang L.-H. Garrett P.E. Ertl G. Tumas J. Braunwald E. Kloner R. Feldstein M.L. Muller J.E. Am. J.

Res. 1989; 55: 791-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was also examined. 50% inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the assay incubation mixture, which is far greater than physiological concentrations. The concentration of naturally occurring heparin in plasma is too low to be detected by conventional means. The serum inhibitor was further characterized. Following heat treatment, inhibitory activity was decreased 80% after 2 h at 60 °C and 100% after 3 min at 100 °C, confirming the thermolabile nature of the inhibitor (Fig.2), as reported previously (29Newman J.K. Berenson G.S. Mathews M.B. Goldwasser E. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 31-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion with Pronase demonstrated that the inhibitor was also proteinase-sensitive, with a 91% loss of inhibitor activity (Fig.2). No loss of activity was observed following digestion with collagenase or heparinase, but a 25% loss of activity was documented following digestion with glycopeptidase F. The pH for optimal inhibitory activity was examined. To eliminate endogenous hyaluronidase activity, all of which is in the acid pH range in serum, human plasma Hyal-1 was removed from serum by immunoprecipitation using anti-human Hyal-1 antibodies. The mouse anti-human Hyal-1 monoclonal antibody is the antibody currently available. Therefore, human serum was used in these experiments instead of mouse serum. Human serum was pretreated with bead-conjugated anti-human Hyal-1 antibodies (43Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 10-15Google Scholar) to eliminate endogenous serum hyaluronidase activity. Optimal inhibition activity was observed between pH 6 and 8 (Fig. 3), in sharp contrast to the wide range of activity reported for the test enzyme, bovine testicular hyaluronidase (43Frost G.I.

Several microorganisms as well as the venom from a number of insects and species of snakes contain hyaluronidases active at neutral pH. Snake venom from the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus horridus), bee venom from the honeybee (Apis mellifera), and hyaluronidase fromStreptomyces hyaluronlyticus were examined. The serum inhibitor had potent inhibitory activity against bovine testicular hyaluronidase, with 80% inhibition being observed in this experiment. The snake venom enzyme was inhibited 45%, and the bee venom hyaluronidase was inhibited 70%. No inhibition was observed againstStreptomyces hyaluronidase, and only 15% inhibition was observed against recombinant acid-active human plasma Hyal-1 under these assay conditions (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W1845819512,"The ‘characteristic age’1 of a pulsar is usually considered to approximate its true age, but this assumption has led to some puzzling results, including the fact that many pulsars with small characteristic ages have no associated supernova remnants2,3. The pulsar B1757-24 is located just outside the edge of a supernova remnant4,5,6; the properties of the system indicate that the pulsar was born at the centre of the remnant with a substantial velocity, and that it has subsequently overtaken the expanding blast wave5,6,7,8. With a characteristic age of 16,000 yr, the pulsar is expected8 to have a proper motion of 63–80 milliarcseconds (mas) per year. Here we report observations of the nebula surrounding the pulsar, which limit its proper motion to less than 25 mas yr-1, implying a minimum age of 39,000 yr. A more detailed analysis argues that the true age may be as great as 170,000 yr, which is significantly larger than the characteristic age. We conclude from this result and other discrepancies associated with pulsars that characteristic ages greatly underestimate the true ages of pulsars."

Mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause the disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Approximately 50% of the mutations in the LDL receptor gene in patients with FH lead to receptor proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Misfolding of mutant LDL receptors is a probable cause of this ER retention, resulting in no functional LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, the specific factors and mechanisms responsible for retention of mutant LDL receptors are unknown. In the present study we show that the molecular chaperone Grp78/BiP co-immunoprecipitates with both the wild type and two different mutant (W556S and C646Y) LDL receptors in lysates obtained from human liver cells overexpressing wild type or mutant LDL receptors. A pulse-chase study shows that the interaction between the wild type LDL receptor and Grp78 is no longer detectable after 2½ h, whereas it persists for more than 4 h with the mutant receptors. Furthermore, about five times more Grp78 is co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptors than with the wild type receptor suggesting that Grp78 is involved in retention of mutant LDL receptors in the ER. Overexpression of Grp78 causes no major alterations on the steady state level of active LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, overexpression of Grp78 decreases the processing rate of newly synthesized wild type LDL receptors. This indicates that the Grp78 interaction is a rate-limiting step in the maturation of the wild type LDL receptor and that Grp78 may be an important factor in the quality control of newly synthesized LDL receptors.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. Heterozygous FH is a common disorder with an estimated frequency of about 1 in 500. Today, more than 500 different mutations have been identified in the LDL receptor gene. About 50% of the characterized mutations result in LDL receptor proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Since the existence of an ER quality control system ensures that only correctly folded, newly synthesized proteins are transported to the plasma membrane or secreted, it is likely that protein misfolding contributes to the pathogenesis of FH. Protein misfolding is implicated in the pathogenesis of many genetic diseases (reviewed in Refs. 3Bross P. Corydon T.J. Andresen B.S. Jorgensen M.M. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 4Brooks D.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Missense mutations and small in frame deletions or insertions rarely affect the function of a given protein directly. Mostly these disease-causing mutations affect the ability of the proteins to fold into a correct conformation, and they often give rise to premature degradation or aggregation of the mutant proteins. Diseases caused by this kind of molecular pathological mechanism are termed “conformational diseases” (5Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 6Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, few diseases have been experimentally proven to be conformational diseases. Prominent examples related to ER are Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis (reviewed in Refs. 3Bross P. Corydon T.J. Andresen B.S. Jorgensen M.M. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Soto C. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, and 8Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Sidhar S. Foreman R. Chest. 1996; 110: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ER retention of a variety of LDL receptor mutants suggests that FH may belong to the group of conformational diseases. The folding and maturation pathway of the newly synthesized LDL receptor in the ER has not yet been characterized. In order to reach a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of FH, we embarked on identification of ER quality control components involved in prolonged interaction with mutant, ER-retained, and LDL receptors. The ER quality control system includes a number of chaperones and folding enzymes localized in the lumen or in the membrane of the ER (reviewed in Ref. 9Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). It is likely that most, if not all, proteins synthesized in the ER interact with chaperones at some stage of the folding and maturation pathway. The chaperones bind non-native proteins and are thought to assist folding by preventing irreversible aggregation and misfolding. Exactly how chaperones act in concert to keep non-native proteins on the productive folding pathway, and selectively retain certain proteins, is not fully understood. Although some chaperones in the ER are well studied, including 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78 or BiP), calnexin, calreticulin, and 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp94 or endoplasmin), it is at present impossible to predict which chaperones a specific protein will interact with and to predict the consequences of the interaction. Grp78 is the ER-located Hsp70 analogue. It binds transiently to a variety of newly synthesized proteins and more persistently to some misfolded proteins. Furthermore, Grp78 is known to assist folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins by recognition and binding of hydrophobic stretches of unfolded proteins. Binding of Grp78 prevents protein aggregation and maintains the proteins in a folding and oligomerization-competent state (reviewed in Ref. 10Gething M.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Calnexin and calreticulin are lectin-like ER chaperones, which specifically recognize monoglycosylated N-linked core glycans. A major function of the two chaperones is to monitor glycoprotein folding and to prevent misfolded protein from leaving the ER (11Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Grp94 is the ER homologue to cytosolic Hsp90. It is abundant in the ER and possesses Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity (12Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Grp94 interacts with several nascent polypeptides and presumably mediates folding of apolipoprotein B (13Linnik K.M. Herscovitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was first to identify ER chaperones interacting with the wild type and mutant LDL receptors. Second, it was to characterize possible differences in the chaperone-LDL receptor interaction for the mutant receptors compared with the wild type receptor. Third, it was to manipulate the amount of identified chaperones, by overexpression, in an attempt to influence the folding and maturation of the LDL receptor. To identify chaperones/folding enzymes interacting with wild type and mutant LDL receptors, we performed expression studies in human liver epithelial cells (Chang cells). Two mutants, ER-retained, LDL receptors, and the wild type LDL receptor were analyzed. Both mutant receptors contain amino acid substitutions caused by missense mutations. The first causes a tryptophan to serine substitution at amino acid position 556 (W556S) in the receptor protein. About 12% of FH in Denmark is caused by this W556S mutation (14Jensen H.K. Holst H. Jensen L.G. Jorgensen M.M. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Heath F. Hansen P.S. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Faergeman O. Kolvraa S. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The second was a missense mutation causing a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 646 (C646Y) (15Leitersdorf E. Tobin E.J. Davignon J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing mutant LDL receptors were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned in the pMP6 expression vector as described previously (14Jensen H.K. Holst H. Jensen L.G. Jorgensen M.M. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Heath F. Hansen P.S. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Faergeman O. Kolvraa S. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Grp78 cDNA was generated using “The 1st-Strand™ ” cDNA kit (CLONTECH Laboratories) as recommended by the supplier. Grp78 cDNA was amplified using two primers flanking the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the coding region of theGrp78 gene (sense primer, 5′-CCTGCTGCTGGTCGACTGGCTGGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GAGTCCAGTGTCGACAATATTACAGCAC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was purified, cut with the endonucleaseSalI, and cloned into the XhoI site of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Correct orientation and sequence of the Grp78 construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Chang cells (ATCC, CCL-13) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 (In Vitro, Denmark) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin (Leo, Denmark), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Leo, Denmark), and 0.01 mg/ml phenol red, in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were seeded in T-75 flasks (TPP®, Switzerland) 24 h before transfection. On the day of transfection, cells were inspected microscopically in order to check that they had reached 50% confluency. Transfection was performed using FuGENE™6 transfection reagent (Roche Dianostics Corporation) according to suppliers' recommendations. 16 h after transfection the cells were seeded in 12.5-cm2 culture dishes, and the medium was replaced with complete RPMI containing 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (Sigma) in order to down-regulate endogenous LDL receptor expression. Transfected Chang cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 (In Vitro, Denmark), containing 5% dialyzed FCS and 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, for 30 min to deplete intracellular pools of methionine and cysteine. The depletion medium was replaced with methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640, containing 0.1 mCi/ml Promix ([35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 5% dialyzed FCS, and 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol. For pulse-chase experiments the cells were labeled for 30 min and chased for 0–4 h, in complete RPMI containing 5 mm methionine, 5 mm cysteine. In other experiments cells were labeled for 2 h, with no chase period, as indicated. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS, 2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.2% Me2SO, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide), and harvested with a plastic scraper. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the LDL receptor was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody (14Jensen H.K. Holst H. Jensen L.G. Jorgensen M.M. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Heath F. Hansen P.S. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Faergeman O. Kolvraa S. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, for purification of the LDL receptor, immunoprecipitation was performed under denaturing conditions. The cell extracts were supplemented with SDS to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The extracts were diluted with HBS buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and 0.9% Triton X-100. The LDL receptor was immunoprecipitated overnight, at 4 °C, using the polyclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody (14Jensen H.K. Holst H. Jensen L.G. Jorgensen M.M. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Heath F. Hansen P.S. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Faergeman O. Kolvraa S. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody (C7) (16Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads by incubation in Laemmli sample buffer, for 5 min, at 95 °C and analyzed by 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitation of gel bands was performed using a PhosphorImager (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the immunocomplexes were dissociated and solubilized by incubating in 50 μl of two-dimensional lysis buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG-buffer 3–10L™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.3% dithiothreitol, 1.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm leupeptin). Chang cell pellets were solubilized in the two-dimensional lysis buffer described above to a final protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. 25 μl of the solubilized immunocomplex and 100 μl of the Chang cell extract were diluted with 95 μl of rehydration solution (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG-buffer pH 3–10L™, 0.3% dithiothreitol, few grains of bromphenol blue) to ensure a sufficient amount of protein for the mass spectrometry analysis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out using a Multiphor apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first dimension isoelectric focusing was performed on an immobilized pH gradient (immobiline dry strips, Amersham Pharmacia biotech) with a total length of 11 cm. An Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for rehydration and loading of the sample. After the first dimension, the strips were equilibrated twice for 10 min in equilibration solution (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 6m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS) supplemented with 16 mm dithiothreitol in the first incubation and 0.25 mm iodoacetamide in the second incubation. The second dimension was carried out in horizontal SDS-PAGE using 8–18% Excel Gel. The gels were run according to suppliers' recommendation, dried, and analyzed using the PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, CA) as described above. Tryptic digestion of protein in excised two-dimensional gel plugs was performed as described previously (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar,18Jensen O.N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). In brief, the excised gel plugs were washed in 100 mmNH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1). The protein was reduced and S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and the gel plugs were dried by vacuum centrifugation. Modified porcine trypsin (12 ng/μl) (Promega, sequencing grade) in digestion buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mmCaCl2) was added to the dry gel pieces, and they were incubated on ice for 1 h in order to reswell them. After removing the supernatant, 10–20 μl of digestion buffer was added, and the digestion was continued overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and redissolved in 20 μl of 5% formic acid prior to mass analysis. A Bruker REFLEX delayed extraction MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUT source and variable detector bias gating was employed for mass analysis of peptide mixtures in positive ion reflector mode. Ion acceleration voltage was 22 kV. Thin matrix films of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose were prepared by the fast evaporation method (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar, 18Jensen O.N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). An aliquot of peptide solution (0.3 μl) was injected into a 0.6-μl droplet of 5% formic acid previously deposited onto the thin matrix layer, and the solvent was then allowed to dry. The analyte/matrix surface was washed with 10 μl of 5% formic acid and then with 10 μl of pure water prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were calibrated by using matrix ion signals and trypsin autolysis peptide signals as internal mass calibrants (19Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). High mass accuracy MALDI-TOF peptide mass maps were used to query a comprehensive protein sequence data base (NRDB, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK) utilizing the PeptideSearch software (20Mann M. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Unambiguous protein identification was achieved by requiring a tryptic peptide mass error below 50 ppm. Equal proportions of immunoprecipitated proteins and aliquots of total cell protein extracts corresponding to 1/50 of the extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation were subjected to 4–15% gradient SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked, and immunoblotted with anti-Grp78 antibody (SPA-827, StressGen, Canada). The antibody stock was diluted 1:10,000 in PBS-Tween (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween20) containing 5% skim milk powder. The membranes were incubated 15 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (DAKO, Denmark) diluted 1:25,000 in PBS/Tween containing 5% skim milk powder for 2 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence detection was performed with ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and direct image analysis using the Molecular Dynamics Storm blot imaging system. Transfected cells for LDL receptor activity measurements were cultivated for 5 h in RPMI containing 5% lipid-deficient human serum and 2 μg/ml 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-conjugated LDL (21Barak L.S. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes). Cells were harvested in PBS containing 0.6 mm EDTA followed by a short incubation in PBS containing 0.6 mm EDTA and 0.01% trypsin, washed 3 times in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described below. For surface staining cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by incubation in PBS containing 0.6 mm EDTA followed by a short incubation in PBS containing 0.6 mm EDTA and 0.01% trypsin. The cells were labeled with 2.5 μg/ml monoclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody (C7) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed in complete RPMI, and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes), and diluted 1:400 in RPMI for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with an argon laser operating at 488 nm. Forward angle light scatter gates were established to exclude dead cells and cell debris from the analysis. 5 × 104 cells were analyzed in each sample. Chang cells expressing wild type LDL receptor, W556S-LDL receptor, or C646Y-LDL receptor were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit further protein synthesis. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LDL receptor antibodies under non-denaturing conditions. Fig.1 shows that within 1 h most of the immunoprecipitated wild type LDL receptors were processed from the faster migrating 120-kDa precursor form to the more slowly migrating 160-kDa mature form. In contrast, none of the mutant W556S-LDL receptors and C646Y-LDL receptors appeared to be processed after a 4-h chase (Fig. 1 A). The band appearing approximately at 160 kDa at the early time points for the C646Y mutant is not present when the immunoprecipitation is performed under denaturing conditions, indicating that it does not represent mature LDL receptors (results not shown). These results confirm previously obtained results showing that the two mutant LDL receptors are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (14Jensen H.K. Holst H. Jensen L.G. Jorgensen M.M. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Heath F. Hansen P.S. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Faergeman O. Kolvraa S. Bolund L. Gregersen N.

Invest. 1990; 85: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The pulse-chase experiment reveals one protein with an apparent mass of 78 kDa that specifically co-immunoprecipitates with the newly synthesized wild type LDL receptor (Fig. 1 A). The interaction between the wild type LDL receptor and the 78 kDa protein is detectable only in the initial phase of the chase. After 2½ h of chase, where most of the LDL receptor has been transported out of the ER, interaction is no longer detectable. In contrast, the association between the two mutant LDL receptors and the 78-kDa protein persists during 4 h of chase (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the ratio between the intensity of the band representing the 78-kDa protein and the band representing mutant LDL receptors is about 1/5 and constant during the 4-h chase, whereas it decreases from 1/10 to undetectable for the wild type receptor (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results indicate that the 78-kDa protein interacts transiently with the wild type LDL receptor and is involved in retention of mutant LDL receptors in the ER. To identify the 78-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitating with the LDL receptor, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to purify and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify the protein. Cells expressing wild type LDL receptor, W556S-LDL receptor, or C646Y-LDL receptor were continuously labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LDL receptor antibody under non-denaturing conditions. The immunocomplexes were dissociated by incubation in denaturing lysis buffer and loaded on an immobilized pH gradient. Following isoelectric focusing the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The two-dimensional analysis confirms that the 78-kDa co-immunoprecipitates with the LDL receptor (Fig. 2). The spots representing the 78-kDa protein were cut out of the gel, in-gel reduced, alkylated, and proteolytically degraded by trypsin. The trypsinized protein sample was analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Fig.3 A). Querying a comprehensive sequence data base with the measured set of tryptic peptide masses retrieved human Grp78 (Swiss-Prot P11021) as the highest ranking candidate. A total of 24 tryptic peptide masses were assigned to the Grp78 polypeptide corresponding to an amino acid sequence coverage of 41% (Fig. 3 B). The high number of assigned peptides and the high sequence coverage unambiguously identified this protein. To confirm the results obtained with this novel identification technique, a Western blot was performed with an antibody specifically recognizing Grp78 and Grp94 (Fig. 4). Cells transiently expressing wild type or one of the two mutant receptors were lysed, subjected to immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotted using an antibody recognizing both Grp78 and Grp94. The Western blot confirms that Grp78 co-immunoprecipitates with the LDL receptor. A faint band representing Grp78 could be detected when expressing wild type LDL receptor (Fig. 4, lane 1). A significantly larger amount of Grp78 co-immunoprecipitated with either of the two mutant receptors compared with the wild type (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and3). Quantification of the bands representing Grp78 showed that in the steady-state situation five times more Grp78 co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptors compared with the wild type. Furthermore, aliquots corresponding to 1/50 of the total Chang cell extract were isolated and immunoblotted together with the immunoprecipitated proteins. The antibody detects both Grp78 and Grp94 in the Chang cell lysates (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). However, using these specific co-immunoprecipitation conditions Grp94 was not co-isolated with the LDL receptor (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3), indicating no detectable association between the LDL receptor and Grp94.Figure 3Identification of human Grp78 by MALDI peptide mass mapping and data base searching.

This group of polysaccharides includes theO-antigen portion of lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS).1 Each of these structures is biosynthesized from an oligosaccharide repeat unit that has been assembled on a polyisoprenyl-pyrophosphate lipid anchor, most likely at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, by the sequential action of specific glycosyltransferases. The oligosaccharide is subsequently translocated, polymerized, and either secreted (EPS) or ligated to another membrane anchor as in the case of lipopolysaccharides and capsular polysaccharides (for a review see Ref.1Whitfield C. Valvano M.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1993; 35: 135-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell surface-associated polysaccharides are extremely diverse in their composition. This diversity is reflected in the large number of genes thought to encode glycosyltransferases that have been identified to date. However, both the details of the catalytic mechanism and the structural features dictating the substrate specificity for this broad class of enzymes remain poorly defined. A greater understanding of bacterial glycosyltransferase activity is necessary for biotechnological applications such as chemoenzymatic oligosaccharide production or polysaccharide engineering. One example of a bacterial exopolysaccharide, whose biological function has been relatively well defined, is succinoglycan or EPS I produced by the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. Succinoglycan, a polysaccharide composed of an octasaccharide repeat unit (2Reinhold B.B. Chan S.Y. Reuber T.L. Marra A. Walker G.C. Reinhold V.N. J Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1997-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to be necessary for the invasion of the host root nodules during the establishment of the symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants (3Wang L.X.

Of the 26 genes known to be required for succinoglycan biosynthesis (5Becker A. Kuster H. Niehaus K. Puhler A. Mol. Gen.

Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7033-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that a recombinant form of one of these six putative glycosyltransferases, ExoM, is capable of transferring glucose from UDP-glucose to the native polyprenyl-pyrophosphate trisaccharide substrate (Glcβ1–4Glcβ1–3GalP-P-lipid) in vitro (11Lellouch A.C. Geremia R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus confirming its function as a nonprocessive β(1–4)- glucosyltransferase. Several recent glycosyltransferase classification schemes, notably the Pfam Protein Family Database of Batemann et al. (12Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), have shown that the N-terminal 100-amino acid region of ExoM contains significant sequence similarity with a large family of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycosyltransferases that utilize a nucleotide diphospho-hexose sugar donor (12Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar, 13Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem.

With a few exceptions, the majority of these enzymes function with inversion of the anomeric configuration. In accordance with the Pfam Database, the N-terminal region will hereafter be referred to as the glycosyltransferase-2 domain (GT2Domain) and ExoM will be referred to as belonging to the GT2Domain family. The recent publication of the crystal structure of SpsA ofBacillus subtilis bound to UDP provides the first structural information for GT2Domain family glycosyltransferases (16Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). SpsA is a UDP binding protein of unknown activity involved in spore coat formation but which has sequence similarity to members of the GT2Domain family. In the SpsA-UDP structure, two of the 6 residues (Asp-39 and Asp-99) involved in the UDP binding exist in clusters of amino acids that are highly conserved among members of the GT2Domain family (16Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, 2 Asp residues, Asp-158 and Asp-191, were found bound to a free glycerol molecule, which was in turn bound to the distal pyrophosphate moiety of UDP via Mn2+, in a fashion that would mimic the binding of the sugar acceptor. Because of the appropriate geometric relationship between Asp-191, the Mn2+ ion, and the UDP-phosphate and the fact that only Asp-191 is conserved among family members, Charnock and Davies (16Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) speculated that this Asp residue might function as the catalytic base in the transferase reaction. However, because no functional assay exists for the SpsA activity, this very interesting hypothesis was not tested. To further our understanding of the ExoM reaction mechanism, we have re-analyzed the sequence comparisons between SpsA and ExoM to verify that the ExoM Asp-44 and Asp-96 residues correspond to the nucleotide binding aspartic acid residues SpsA Asp-39 and Asp-99, respectively. In addition we have identified ExoM Asp-187 as being in the homologous location as the potential catalytic base, SpsA Asp-191. We found that replacement of each of the three positions by alanine (D44A, D96A, and the newly identified D187A) abolished glucosyltransferase activityin vitro and resulted in the loss of the ability to restore succinoglycan production in an in vivo rescue assay. However, for the conservative mutations aspartic acid to glutamic acid, complete loss of activity both in the in vitro and thein vivo assays was observed only for D187E, a finding consistent with this residue playing a role in catalysis. Interestingly, we found that the substitution D98A of the DXD motif (17Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Busch C.

Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) and using ExoM sequence as query. Site-directed mutagenesis of theexoM gene was carried out by PCR using the “megaprimer” method (23Sarker G. Sommers S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar), with pALC1 as the template. Appropriated mutations were generated by using synthetic oligonucleotides specifying the desired change. A mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with the universal primer or the reverse primer, whichever was appropriate. After isolation of the first product with the Qiaex kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany), a second PCR reaction was performed using the first PCR product as a megaprimer together with either the reverse or universal primer, whichever was appropriate. The second PCR product containing the desired mutation was then purified and restricted withSacI and HindIII. The 535-bpSacI-HindIII fragment containing the desired mutation was then ligated with the SacI-HindIII 5794-bp fragment of pLGC2. This construction encodes a Stag-ExoM fusion protein. Mutated DNA was fully sequenced (Genome Express SA, Grenoble, France) to confirm the PCR fidelity. Culture and expression of ExoM in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS harboring plasmid pLGC2 with different mutations was performed as described previously (11Lellouch A.C. Geremia R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.4 mm, was added to 50-ml cultures at A 600 of 0.5 and cultured for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 70 mmTris-HCl/10 mm EDTA (pH 8.2) at 40 OD equivalents/ml (approximately 2 ml). Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press (18,000 p.s.i.). Unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by a 15-min centrifugation (5,000 × g) at 4 °C. The 5,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged for 45 min at 50,000 × g to obtain the membrane fraction. This fraction was resuspended in the same volume of buffer and used immediately to measure the activity and then stored at −20 °C. ExoM activity was determined as described previously (11Lellouch A.C. Geremia R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions containing equivalent amounts of ExoM, as judged by Coomassie Blue-staining SDS-PAGE, were incubated with freshly prepared glycolipid acceptor in the presence of UDP-[U-14C]glucose. The glycolipid acceptor was extracted, and incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. When comparing wild type and mutant forms of ExoM, radioactivity recovered from BL21(DE3)/pLysS E. coli strain, harboring pET29b, was taken as background and subtracted from reported values. The results reported are the average of at least four assays. The oligosaccharide was released from the pyrophosphate-lipid by mild acid hydrolysis and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). 10,000 cpm of each sample supplemented with 50 μg of malto-oligosaccharides (dimer to pentamer) was spotted in a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60, 0.25 mm, Sigma). Malto-oligosaccharides were used as standards. The TLC plate was developed twice in 1-propanol:nitromethane:water (50:20:20, v/v). Standards were revealed by charring after treatment with 5% H2SO4 in ethanol. Photographic films with a Transcreen LE (Hyperfilm βmax, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were exposed 24–72 h before development. The 1120-bpXbaI fragment containing the promoterless S-tag ExoM fusion open reading frame with the ribosomal binding site was cloned into theXbaI site of pBBR1MCS-3 under the control of PLac promoter-generating pCS3. The different S. meliloti strains containing mutated exoM forms were obtained by mating S. meliloti 1021exoM::Tn5 and E. coli S-17 cells harboring the appropriate pCS3. EPS-I production by S. meliloti mutants was detected by the Calcofluor white staining method as described previously (24Hynes M.F. Simon R. Muller P. Niehaus K. Labes M. Puhler A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 356-363Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For succinoglycan quantification, S. meliloti strains were grown for 6 days in 25 ml of M9-glutamate-mannitol, CaCl2, MgSO4medium (described above) at 30 °C. Exopolysaccharide was precipitated from the culture supernatant by addition of 1 m NaCl in the initial volume and 2 volumes of ethanol. Sugars were quantified by the phenol method (25Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40199) Google Scholar). EPS-I production of S. meliloti harboring pBBR-MCS-3 was taken as background and subtracted from reported values. Results for succinoglycan production represent the average of at least two experiments. Total protein extracts (equivalent OD) from 2-day cultures of S. meliloti, containing mutant ExoM, were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The presence of the N-terminal S-tag epitope fusion was confirmed by transfer of the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subsequently treated with the Novagen S-tag Western blotting kit with alkaline phosphatase S-protein conjugate following the manufacturer's instructions. ExoM is a 309-amino acid glucosyltransferase with two predicted C-terminal transmembrane helices (Fig.1 A). In the work of Saxenaet al. (14Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where a limited number of inverting glycosyltransferases, including the S. meliloti Exo glucosyltransferases, were analyzed by HCA, two strictly conserved aspartic acid residues were identified in an N-terminal region, which was then named Domain A. In this scheme, ExoM residues Asp-44 and Asp-96 were identified as strictly conserved residues, which may be of functional importance. The recent Pfam Database (12Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) defines a larger glycosyltransferase family, the GT2Domain family, which comprises 348 proteins, including ExoM. The defining feature of this family is an N-terminal region of sequence similarity, the GT2Domain, which is equivalent to the Domain A defined by Saxena et al. (14Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like ExoM, SpsA is a member of this larger family. In the crystal structure of SpsA, 3 aspartic acid residues are involved in UDP binding (16Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), 2 of which, Asp-39 and Asp-99, are found in conserved regions within the GT2Domain. SpsA Asp-39 binds the uracil ring, whereas SpsA Asp-99 binds the pyrophosphate via one molecule of Mn2+. We will refer to these conserved regions within the GT2Domain as regions I and II. To determine whether the UDP binding aspartic acid residues of SpsA (Asp-39 and Asp-99) correspond to the previously described conserved aspartic acid residues in ExoM (Asp-44 and Asp-96), we have re-examined the sequence similarities between these two proteins using several different methods, such as BLAST, HCA, and secondary structure prediction programs. In addition, we wished to identify an aspartic acid in ExoM, which might correspond to the SpsA Asp-191, found outside the GT2Domain in what we will term region III and which has been proposed to be a catalytic base in the transferase reaction. Despite their belonging to the same GT2Domain family, ExoM and SpsA share low sequence similarity. Therefore, we decided to compare each protein to a third protein, which has a greater degree of sequence similarity to ExoM and SpsA than ExoM and SpsA have to each other. Using BLAST searches, we identified several proteins that matched both the ExoM or SpsA queries. Among the common matches, we have selected AceP (Acetobacter xylinus) for the comparison, because this protein has been confirmed biochemically to be a β1–6 glucosyltransferase (26Edwards K.J. Jay A.J. Colquhoun I.J. Morris V.J. Gasson M.J. Griffin A.M. Microbiology. 1999; 145, (Pt 6): 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We then used HCA and secondary structure prediction to identify aspartic acids conserved among these three proteins. The equivalent amino acids in the other S. meliloti Exo glucosyltransferases were located in a similar way (Fig. 2). In region I of the GT2 domain, both HCA and secondary structure prediction programs predict that ExoM Asp-44 and AceP Asp-42 are located after a β-sheet (Fig.1 B). This result is compatible with the position of Asp-39 in the SpsA crystal structure. In region II, the interpretation of the HCA analysis is more ambiguous, because the number of residues separating the relevant aspartic acids (SpsA Asp-99 and ExoM Asp-96) from the neighboring hydrophobic cluster is different. However, both the HCA and the secondary structure prediction of ExoM predict that Asp-96 is the first amino acid in a loop following a β-sheet (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, SpsA Asp-99 is found in exactly such a position in the SpsA crystal structure. Although the same considerations are also valid for the other Exo glucosyltransferases (Fig. 2), it is not possible to unambiguously identify this position in AceP, because HCA analysis provides two possible interpretations. AceP Asp-95 and Asp-96 are located at the same distance from the preceding hydrophobic cluster as SpsA Asp-98 and Asp-99; whereas AceP Asp-93 is in the same position with respect to the nearest hydrophobic cluster as is ExoM Asp-96 (Fig. 1 B). Finally, by the same methods we have identified ExoM Asp-187 and AceP Asp-193 as being equivalent to SpsA Asp-191. HCA and secondary structure analysis predict that these ExoM and AceP residues are located just before an α-helix (Fig.1 B), as is SpsA Asp-191 in the SpsA crystal structure. We therefore postulate that ExoM Asp-187 is also a potential catalytic residue in the transfer reaction. To test these hypothesis, we undertook site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved aspartic acids in regions I, II, and III. Each conserved aspartic acid residue within regions I, II, and III, as well as certain neighboring amino acids (Fig.1 A), were mutated to alanine, and these ExoM mutants were subsequently expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coliwith an N-terminal S-tag fusion to facilitate their detection. 14 of the 16 mutants were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS at levels equivalent to the wild type ExoM. However, the two mutants N45A and D96E were not detected on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3). Subsequent Western blotting against the S-tag revealed that these mutant proteins are degraded when expressed in E. coli (data not shown). The glucosyltransferase activity of each mutant was determined using total membrane fractions containing equivalent quantities of ExoM protein. The amount of 14C-labeled Glc transferred from UDP-[14C]Glc to the native rhizobial glycolipid acceptor (see “Materials and Methods”) was quantified. The activity of the mutants was expressed as a percentage of the activity of the wild-type ExoM (TableII). In region I, the substitution of the highly conserved residue Asp-44 with alanine resulted in a complete loss of the activity. Similar data were obtained for the conservative change D44E. Mutations of the neighboring amino acids, for example V42I and D46A, resulted in little if any loss of activity. Ala-43 was replaced with Asp, because in the other Exo glucosyltransferases Asp occupies this position. However the A43D mutation resulted in a complete loss of activity.Table IIInfluence of amino acid substitution in the activity of ExoMIn vitroactivitySuccinoglycan production (%wt)%wt ExoM100100Site I V42I10069 A43D3>3 D44A 2-aThe mutations involving conserved amino acid residues are in italics.0>3 D44E777 N45ANE 2-bNE, not expressed.NE D46A75NESite II F94V6977 L95A30114 D96A07 D96ENE41 D97A15115 D98A26139 E99A10084Site III D187A03 D187E04The in vitro activity of ExoM-S-tag fusion protein produced in E. coli and production of succinoglycan by merodiploideS. meliloti strains, harboring the different forms of pCS 3, were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Succinoglycan production was normalized to the expression level of ExoM (see Fig. 5).2-a The mutations involving conserved amino acid residues are in italics.2-b NE, not expressed. Open table in a new tab The in vitro activity of ExoM-S-tag fusion protein produced in E. coli and production of succinoglycan by merodiploideS. meliloti strains, harboring the different forms of pCS 3, were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Succinoglycan production was normalized to the expression level of ExoM (see Fig. 5). In region II, surrounding the highly conserved Asp-96, each of the residues from Leu-95 to Glu-99 were substituted by alanine. Each of the mutants L95A, D97A, and D98A displayed reduced activity in vitro (around 30%), whereas the mutant E99A retained 100% activity. Only the mutation of the conserved Asp, D96A, resulted in complete loss of activity. Unfortunately, the mutant protein containing the conservative D96E mutation was not stably expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3) but, as will be presented below, was stably expressed in S. meliloti. Asp-96 and Asp-98 together comprise the DXD motif, which has been shown to be essential for activity in other β-glycosyltransferases (17Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that, in vitro, only Asp-96 is critical for activity. The activity of the mutant proteins D97A and D98A was found to decrease after storage at −20 °C, as compared with the wild type ExoM protein, suggesting that these residues are involved in structural stability. In region III, the replacement of Asp-187 by alanine or by glutamate resulted in complete loss of in vitro activity. Finally, to verify that the radioactivity incorporated into the glycolipid extract during the assay of each of the partially active mutants (V42I, D46A, F94V, L95A, D97A, D98A, and E99A) corresponds to the expected tetrasaccharide product, we have analyzed the reaction products by TLC. Each of the reaction products was found to comigrate with the authentic ExoM product (Fig. 4). To further assess the role of each of the mutations, the wild-type and mutant forms of S-tag-ExoM fusion were introduced into a strain of S. meliloti in whichexoM has been interrupted and therefore produces no succinoglycan. Expression of ExoM-S-tag fusion protein in theexoM − S. meliloti strain restores succinoglycan production (Table II). This in vivocomplementation assay is more sensitive than the in vitroassay, because lower levels of enzyme activity, which are yet physiologically significant, may be detected. Each of the mutant ExoM-S-tag fusions was cloned into the broad host vector pBBRMCS-3 and introduced into the S. melilotistrain by bi-parental mating. Blotting against the S-tag showed that a"

This response was partially inhibited by cyclosporin A and staurosporine, suggesting the participation of both the Ca2+ and the protein kinase C pathways in CD43 signaling.

Thus, a cell senses not only the presence of an antigen but also its environment, and a particular cellular response will result from the integration of signals delivered through the antigen-specific receptor and the numerous co-receptors. The CD43 co-receptor is very abundant on T cells surface; it comprises a highly glycosylated extracellular portion of 239 amino acids that protrudes 45 nm from the cellular membrane, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain of 123 amino acids (3Cyster J.G.

On T cells, CD43 is differentially glycosylated in two major isoforms: a 113–123-kDa product, mainly present on resting CD4+ T cells and a 125–135-kDa form expressed mostly on resting CD8+lymphocytes, which is up-regulated both on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, following cellular activation (6Jones A.T. Federsppiel B. Ellies L.G. Williams M.J. Burgener R. Duronio V. Smith A.A. Takei F. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3426-3439PubMed Google Scholar). The 125–135-kDa form has been shown to be down-regulated during positive selection of double positive cells in the thymus, involving CD43 in thymic selection events (7Ellies L.G. Tao W. Fellinger W.

Carbohydrate moieties have an important role in CD43 function, because alterations in the glycosylation patterns of the molecule are associated with severe immunodeficiency such as in the case of patients affected with the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome or infected with HIV (8Giordanengo V.

Because of its high content of sialic acid residues, resulting in a strong negative charge, it has been proposed that CD43 functions as an antiadhesive molecule, providing the cells with a repulsive barrier (13Manjunath N.

However, CD43 ligation with specific mAbs has been shown to promote the formation of homotypic aggregates, some of which were only partially inhibited with mAbs against lymphocyte integrins, suggesting an active involvement of CD43 in regulating cellular adhesion (16Cyster J.G.

A participation of CD43 in leukocyte rolling was suggested by experiments where an anti-CD43 mAb inhibited the interaction between T cells and endothelial cells (18Chen S. Alon R. Fuhlbrigge R.C.

Evidence that CD43 participates in TcR-mediated T cell activation has been provided in different experimental models (for reviews see Refs. 19Rosenstein Y. Santana M.A. Pedraza-Alva G. Immunol.

Transfection of a cDNA encoding for human CD43 in a murine T cell hybridoma specific for human major histocompatibility complex II molecules resulted in enhanced IL-2 production upon stimulation with the appropriate antigen presenting cell only if cells expressed the wild type form of CD43, together with the specific major histocompatibility complex II molecules (21Park J.K.

To date, the molecular mechanisms that transduce CD43-dependent signals from the cell surface to the nucleus are not fully understood. CD43-mediated activation promotes the generation of second messengers like diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates, Ca2+ mobilization, and protein kinase C activation (23Wong R.C.K.

Moreover, CD43-specific signals have been found to promote the nuclear translocation of ERK2, suggesting that the MAPKs pathway is involved in the CD43-dependent gene expression (26Pedraza-Alva G.

In this study, we provide evidence that CD43-mediated signals are sufficient to regulate gene expression. We show that CD43 ligation on human T cells induced IL-2 gene expression without requiring additional signals provided by other receptor molecules, in opposition to what was previously reported (27Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarström S. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2912-2917PubMed Google Scholar). CD43 signals leading to IL-2 mRNA synthesis were partially inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A and by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that both the PKC and the calcium pathways participate in the CD43-mediated control of IL-2 gene expression. We also show that CD43 ligation induced the DNA binding activity of the AP-1, NFκB, and NF-AT transcription factors. These data are consistent with a dual pathway of activation through the CD43 molecule because AP-1 and NFκB activation result from a transient high peak of calcium and signals coming from the MAPKs pathway (28Dolmetsch R.E.

Moreover, data provided here demonstrate that CD43 stimulates the expression of genes encoding for proteins necessary for T cell effector function and clonal expansion, such as CD69 as a result of activation of AP-1 and NFκB through the PKC pathway, and CD40-L because of NF-AT recruitment by the Ca2+ pathway (33López-Cabrera M.

Data presented in this study considerably broaden the role of the CD43 molecule in the control of gene expression and cell function. Two monoclonal antibodies (both IgG1) that recognize different epitopes of the CD43 molecule were used: L10, which is specific for an epitope of the protein core (36Mentzer S.J. Rennold-O'Donnell E.

Peripheral blood T cells were isolated from healthy adult donors by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. The mononuclear cells buffy coat was resuspended in supplemented RPMI before plating the cells overnight onto 100-mm Petri dishes (8 × 107 cells/plate) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were loaded on a nylon column pre-equilibrated with supplemented RPMI. The resultant purified cells were predominantly TcR+ (>85% OKT3+) and CD43+ (>95% L10+), as determined by FACS staining. Prior to experimentation, T cells were arrested for an additional 24 h in RPMI supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Subsequent manipulations were done in this medium. Purified T cells or Jurkat cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated in 24-well plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with the following antibodies, alone or in combination: L10, 1:500 dilution of ascites or 1 μg/ml of purified IgG; MEM-59, 1 μg/ml; OKT3, 1 μg/ml (optimal, OKT3o) or 10 ng/ml (suboptimal, OKT3s); equivalent amounts of the isotype control mAb, 3D6 were used for L10 or MEM-59. Additional cross-linking was achieved by adding rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) to the wells. As positive controls, cells were activated with ionomycin (Iono; 1 μg/ml), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml), or a combination of both. When indicated, cyclosporin A (CsA; 500 ng/ml), staurosporine (50 nm), or anisomycin (10 mm) were added to the cultures 15 min prior to activation. 6 h after the onset of the experiment, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and frozen, when used for IL-2 mRNA determination. Nuclear extracts were obtained immediately after cell harvest. Total RNA was obtained usingTRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by standard reverse transcription conditions, using oligo(dT) as primer in a final volume of 25 μl. IL-2 mRNAs were amplified from 3 μl of cDNA, using the following oligonucleotides as primers: 3′ (5′-CGT TGA TAT TGC TGA TTA AGT CCC TC-3′) and 5′ (5′-CAT TGC ACT AAG TCT TGC ACT TGT CA-3′). PCR was accomplished by one denaturing cycle of 4 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 91 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) and one final extension cycle of 15 min at 72 °C to generate a product of 305 base pairs. As internal control, we evaluated the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in parallel PCR reactions, using 2 μl of the same cDNAs with the following oligonucleotides: 3′ (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′) and 5′ (5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′). PCR conditions for GAPDH were: one denaturing cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C), and one final extension cycle of 15 min at 72 °C, resulting in a product of 452 base pairs. Amplified fragments from both reactions were resolved simultaneously in 4% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Activated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before obtaining nuclear extracts, basically as described (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were lysed by incubating them for 5 min at 4 °C in a detergent-free, hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Intact nuclei were washed with this lysis buffer, and nuclear extracts were obtained by incubating the nuclei in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 450 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm spermidine, and 25% glycerol) for 45 min under constant mild agitation at 4 °C. DNA pellets were eliminated by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 ×g; protein content of the extracts was determined by Bradford assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted basically as described (43Pedraza-Alva G. Zingg J.M. Jost J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the following double stranded oligonucleotides: AP-1, 5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3′; NF-AT, 5′-AAA GAA AGG AGG AAA AAC TGT TTC ATA CAG-3′; NFκB, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′; and MCAAT (nonspecific competitor), 5′-CTC CTA TTG GCT TGA-3′. Briefly, oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using 30 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP/100 ng of oligonucleotide. Protein extracts (2.5 μg) from activated T cells (for 4 h, unless otherwise indicated) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the labeled oligonucleotide (1 × 105 cpm) in band shift buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For competition experiments, 50-fold molar excess of the cold oligonucleotides was added 5 min before adding the labeled probe, following which the assays were performed as above. For immune band shift assays, DNA-protein complexes were allowed to form prior to the addition of 0.1 μg of anti-p65 antibody or 1 μg of anti-c-Jun, anti-Fos, anti-NF-ATc, or anti-NF-ATp antibodies. Samples were incubated with the antibody for 5 h at 4 °C prior to resolving the DNA-protein complexes on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Equivalent amounts of an irrelevant antibody were used as control. T cells were activated by incubating them with the indicated amount of PMA in the presence or absence of anti-CD43 L10 mAb at 37 °C for 18 h. Cells were then collected and stained for FACS analysis. Briefly, cells (1 × 106) resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1% sodium azide (FACS solution) were incubated with anti-CD43 (L10), anti-CD3 (OKT3), biotinylated anti-CD40-L, or anti-CD69 mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed by centrifugation at 300 × g with FACS solution and incubated with second step reagent fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 min at 4 °C and washed as above, following which cells were resuspended in FACS solution and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (final concentration). Cells were analyzed with a FACSort with the CELLQUEST program (Becton and Dickinson, San José, CA). Given the importance of IL-2 in the proliferative and late stages of T cell activation and the fact that simultaneous signaling from CD43 and the TcR had been previously reported to result in IL-2 production (21Park J.K. Rosenstein Y.J. Remold-O'Donnell E. Bierer B.E. Rosen F.S. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1991; 350: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarström S. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2912-2917PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the CD43-dependent IL-2 mRNA induction. As shown in Fig.1, cross-linking CD43 on the surface of normal human peripheral blood T lymphocytes with two different mAbs, without co-ligating the TcR, was sufficient to generate signals that lead to IL-2 mRNA induction (lanes 1 and 4). When cells were incubated with both anti-CD43 mAbs simultaneously, the amount of IL-2 mRNA increased approximately 7-fold over control cells (compare lanes 7, 10, and 11), although to a lesser extent than when cells were treated with PMA and ionomycin (lane 14). Independent of the anti-CD43 mAb that was used to stimulate the cells, signals resulting in the induction of IL-2 mRNA were blocked by CsA (lanes 3, 6, and 9) and partially blocked by staurosporine (lanes 2, 5, and 8). Cells treated only with CsA or staurosporine but no antibody (lanes 12 and 13), control antibody-treated (lane 11), and untreated cells (lane 10) had equivalent levels of IL-2 mRNA. The graph shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1 represents the percentages of change in the IL-2 cDNA/GAPDH cDNA signal. These data suggest that CD43-mediated signals can induce IL-2 gene expression, recruiting the PKC and the Ca2+ pathways. To investigate the pathway leading to CD43-mediated regulation of gene expression, we looked for the induction of transcription factors following CD43 ligation, particularly for factors that bind to the IL-2 gene promoter such as AP-1, NF-AT, and NFκB (44Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Cross-linking CD43 on the surface of Jurkat cells with either anti-CD43 mAb, L10, and/or MEM-59 promoted the formation of an AP-1 complex over levels of control cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2,3, 12, and 13); co-stimulation with both mAbs did not result in higher levels of AP-1 binding than those observed when cells were stimulated with MEM-59 alone (lanes 2–4). At this time point, CD43 ligation resulted in higher levels of AP-1 than ligation with optimal amounts of OKT3 (OKT3o) or stimulation with PMA (lanes 8 and 9), probably reflecting a difference in kinetics. As expected, ionomycin did not have any effect on the DNA binding capacity of AP-1 (lanes 10 and 11), because the AP-1 family of transcription factors is activated by the MAPK pathway and not by the sustained calcium plateau characteristic of ionomycin. To determine the kinetics of the CD43-dependent AP-1 binding activity, human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were activated for different periods of time. Following CD43 cross-linking, AP-1 binding to DNA could be detected as early as 30 min and was maintained for at least 4 h (Fig.3 A, lanes 1,4, 7, and 10), whereas when cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, the response was slower, as reflected by the fact that AP-1 induction could be observed only 1 h after the onset of the experiment (lanes 2, 5,8, and 11). When cells were treated with control mAb (3D6), AP-1 binding activity remained constant all through the experiment (lanes 3, 6, 9, and12). Specificity of the DNA-AP-1 complexes formed following CD43 ligation was demonstrated by competition experiments (Fig. 3 B), where AP-1 binding to the labeled probe was competed with a 50-fold molar excess of cold AP-1 oligonucleotide (lanes 1 and2), whereas similar amounts of a nonspecific oligonucleotide, M-CAAT, had no effect (lane 3). Because c-Jun is one of the most common members of AP-1 (45Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar), we investigated whether it was present in the DNA-AP-1 complexes generated through CD43. As shown in Fig. 3 C, when nucleoprotein complexes were incubated with anti-Jun antibodies, a partial supershift could be observed (lane 2), thus indicating the presence of c-Jun. Other members of the Jun family, however, might also be present, because the induced complexes did not disappear completely following supercomplex formation. Various members of the AP-1 family of proteins (c-Fos, Fos B, c-Jun, JunB, and Fra1) have been implicated in gene regulation upon T cell activation (46Mondino A. Whaley C.D. DeSilva D.R. Li W. Jenkins M.K. Mueller D.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2048-2057PubMed Google Scholar, 47Boise L.H. Petryanik B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C.Y. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Altogether these data suggest that AP-1 participates in the CD43-specific signaling pathway leading to gene expression. We had previously shown that simultaneous stimulation through the CD43 molecule and the TcR-CD3 complex resulted in enhanced IL-2 production (21Park J.K. Rosenstein Y.J. Remold-O'Donnell E. Bierer B.E. Rosen F.S. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1991; 350: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we activated normal human peripheral blood T cells with saturating amounts of the anti-CD43 mAbs L10 or MEM-59 alone or in combination with suboptimal concentrations of OKT3 (OKT3s) for 4 h and evaluated the AP-1 binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2, integrating signals generated through the TcR with OKT3s and through CD43 with L10 or MEM-59 did not result in enhanced DNA binding activity of AP-1 as compared with cells activated either through the TcR alone or the CD43 molecule alone (lanes 2, 3,5, 6, and 7). In fact, at this time point (4 h), an inhibitory effect was observed when OKT3s was used in combination with the anti-CD43 mAbs, suggesting an eventual cross-talk between the TcR and the CD43 signaling pathways. We investigated next whether CD43 signaling would lead to NF-AT binding to DNA when Jurkat cells were activated for 4 h with L10, MEM-59, or both mAbs, with or without suboptimal amounts of OKT3 or with PMA and/or ionomycin. When cells were treated with PMA, a fast migrating complex was observed (Fig.4, lane 9, complex a) that corresponds to AP-1 binding to the NF-AT site (48Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 49Ghosh P. Sica A. Cappitelli M. Subleski J. Lahesmaa R. Young H.A. Rice N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7700-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ionomycin treatment induced the formation of a second DNA-protein complex (complex b, lane 10) that corresponds to NF-AT binding to its cognate site (48Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol.

At present, the role of the cytoplasmic domains for members of the class II family for receptor coupling to intracellular G proteins has not been fully explored. Based on studies with receptors belonging to the class I receptor family, we speculated that amino acids in either the third intracellular loop or the C terminus of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (PAC1),1 may be important for coupling to G proteins (5Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C terminus has been proposed to be necessary for the formation of a functional receptor-G protein complex and to result in heterodimerization for some GPCRs such as type B receptor for GABA and GABAB-like orphan receptor (6Kuner R. Kohr G. Grunewald S. Eisenhardt G. Bach A. Kornau H.C. Science. 1998; 283: 74-77Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) hormone was originally isolated from bovine hypothalamus and is one of the most recently identified peptides in the VIP/secretin/glucagon family (7Miyata A.

The cloning of the rat and human PAC1 cDNA and genes identified a receptor protein composed of ∼468 amino acids containing seven transmembrane domains that are characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (5Pisegna J.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The PAC1 belongs to the class II GPCR superfamily that includes VPAC1 (the classical VIP1 receptor), VPAC2 (VIP2 receptor), secretin, glucagon, and calcitonin receptors (9Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar); these molecules can be distinguished on the basis of their relative affinities for the agonists PACAP-27, PACAP-38, VIP, and helodermin (10Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. laburthe M. Pisegna J.R. Rawlings S.R. Robberecht P. Said S.I. Sreedharan S.P. Wank S.A. Waschek J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 265-270PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of the rat and human PAC1 gene have identified two unique exons that can be alternatively spliced yielding different third intracellular loops. The four major splice variants are named Null, Hip, Hop, and Hip-Hop (5Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

Therefore, the expression of splice variants in the third intracellular loop and the close similarity of the general structure of PAC1 compared with the members of the class II family make it a good candidate for developing a receptor model to understand the role of the C terminus for the activation of signal transduction cascades. Previously, the major efforts that have been made have focused on the receptor domains involved in receptor internalization, desensitization, and recycling, but these studies have mainly focused on members of the class I receptor family, such as the cholecystokinin type A, gastrin-releasing peptide, and β-adrenergic receptors (11Go W.Y.

Primers with the following sequence were were used to construct the 3′ ends of the Tr406, Tr416, Tr420, Tr424, and Tr433 mutants respectively: 5′-ACTGACTAGGAATTCTCAACCATTCAGAAAACAGTAGAGAAC-3′, 5′-ACTGACTAGGAATTCTCACCATTTTCGCTTGATCTCCGCTTGTACCAC-3′, 5′-ACTGACTAGGAATTCTCACCTCCAGCTTCGCCATTTTCGCTTGATCTCCGCTTG-3′, 5′-ACTGACTAGGAATTCTCAGTAACGGTTCACCTTCCAGCTTCGCCATTT-3′, and 5′-ACTGACTAGGAATTCTCAGTGTCGGTGCTTGAAGTCCAC-3′. The single and double amino acid mutations for HopTr420 (either Tr420A416 or Tr420A417 or Tr420A418 or Tr420A418A419) were performed by replacing the codon of original amino acid with AGC for mutation to Ala. Using a full-length hPAC1 cDNA (nucleotides 1–1591 for Null variant and nucleotide 1–1675 for Hop variant), the truncated mutants of hPAC1 cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Briefly, the following PCR conditions were used: extension at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 25 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). Following amplification, the DNA was digested with both XbaI and EcoRI and subcloned into the vector pCDL-SRα/Neo at an XbaI site and EcoRI site, as described previously (9Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). All PCR-generated mutants and chimeras were sequenced using the Applied Biosystem model 373A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA and amino acid sequence analysis was performed using the Geneworks® software package. Following linearization of the vector at the AatII restriction site, within the ampicillin resistance gene of the vector pCDL-SRα/Neo, 20 μg of recombinant plasmid were stably transfected into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts by using a BTX electroporator (model T820, San Diego, CA) at 475 V for 1 ms, 4 pulses on 2 × 107 cells, in a volume of 0.25 ml with 20 μg of the linearized recombinant vector containing the respective WT or mutant cDNA in the presence of 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA as a carrier. Clones of stably transfected cells were selected using Geneticin® (250 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). At least 10 stably transfected clones were assayed for 125I-PACAP-27 radioligand binding for each WT and transfected mutant. Cell clones with similar receptor densities were chosen for further study. A model depicting the wild type Null (NullWT) and Hop (HopWT) variants with an HA epitope tag is shown in Fig. 1. The HopWT contains additional 28 amino acids (including Ser365 as a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site) in the 3rd intracellular loop compared with the Null splice variant, as described previously (8Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 9Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Five truncation mutants were generated: one lacked the entire 63 amino acids of the C terminus (Tr406), whereas the other mutants were reconstituted with additional 10, 14, 18, or 26 amino acids, added to the carboxyl tail, (Tr416, Tr420, Tr424, and Tr433, respectively) as shown by the arrows in Fig. 1. The putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site, Ser417, within the C terminus of the hPAC1 (Fig. 1) was deleted in the Tr416 and Tr406 receptor mutants, but it was present in the Tr420 mutant. Point mutations to the full-length receptor were performed as described above using as a template for the PCR reaction the full length of the HopWT receptor. The WT and truncated mutants of the PAC1 were constructed with an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) on the N terminus of the receptor to detect them, by using a monoclonal antibody directed against this epitope. The presence of an epitope tag on the N terminus was designed to confirm surface expression. The radioligand binding, cAMP, and inositol phosphate dose responses of the transfected cells expressing this construct were compared with untransfected cells and found to be identical (data not shown). Peptides from the C terminus of the human and rat PACAP-1 receptors (EVQAEIKRKWRSWKVNRY) were synthesized by G. Poy (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health) and purified by the antibody and peptide CORE of the CURE:VA/UCLA Digestive Diseases Center. Conjugation of the peptide was performed with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin using bis-diazotized benzidine. Rabbits were immunized at 5–6-week intervals intradermally. Antibodies were screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis to assess their specificity. Cells were plated overnight at a low density on polylysine-coated coverslips. The following day, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at a dilution of 1:1000 with polyclonal anti-PAC1 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Then the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 4 °C. Results were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Cells were grown until ∼80% confluence and harvested by washing with PBS containing 2.7 mm EDTA. Harvested cells were homogenized with homogenization buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 kIU/ml aprotinin, 8% sucrose, pH 7.4) using a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton Inc., Millville, NJ) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing intact cells and nuclei was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 45 min in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resultant membrane pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was carried out by the method described by Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Fatt A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-PACAP-27 binding experiments were performed by the previously described method (23Varrault A. Journot L. Audigier Y. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 999-1007PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of membrane protein, isolated as above, were dissolved in 0.05% digitonin and mixed with 50 nm125I-PACAP-27 either with or without the indicated concentrations of PACAP-27 at a final volume of 250 μl and incubated at 37 °C. After a 75-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 800 μl of chilled phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (1% BSA/PBS). Tracer binding was measured after filtration through a GF/C glass fiber filter (Whatman) soaked with 0.1% polyethyleneimine (Sigma) and washed three times with 3 ml of 1% BSA/PBS. K d and B max were determined by Scatchard analysis by GraphPad Prism 2.01. Stably transfected cells were plated overnight on 24-well plates in DMEM with 10% calf serum, at a density of ∼50,000 cells/well. The following day, the cells were washed once in 1% BSA/PBS at 4 °C and incubated in DMEM containing 1% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C with 50 pm of 125I-PACAP-27 (2200 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) either with or without the indicated concentrations of unlabeled peptides, PACAP-27 (Bachem, Torrance, CA). The density of cell surface receptors expressed for each stably transfected cell line was determined by measuring the amount of saturable binding (total binding in the presence of125I-PACAP-27 alone minus nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 μm PACAP-27). Nonspecific binding was defined as total binding in the presence of 1 μmunlabeled PACAP. After termination of the binding reaction by washing the cells twice with cold 1% BSA/PBS, the cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was detected by a γ counter. For each mutant at least three experiments were performed in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed using the equationy = Bottom + [Top −Bottom]/(1 + 10 [x-log EC50]), where x represents the log concentration of PACAP-27 and y is the percentage of binding of control. Similar levels of125I-PACAP-27 binding displacement by PACAP-27 were observed in five independent clones for each mutant receptor. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear least squares curve fitting program Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). To normalize signal transduction data for receptor density, we estimated the receptor density by ligand binding using a concentration of free radioligand [L] > 3 × K d, a concentration of the receptor [R total] < 0.1K d and the relationship [R total] = [RL] [K d +L ]/[L] (23Varrault A. Journot L. Audigier Y. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 999-1007PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were prepared as described above and incubated with 50 pm125I-PACAP at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals between 3 and 90 min. At the time intervals, cells were washed twice with 1% BSA/PBS and treated with 0.5 m KSCN for 8 min at room temperature. Radioactivity within the cells was measured after solubilization with 0.1 n NaOH. In all experiments, parallel incubations were performed in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled PACAP-27 to determine nonsaturable binding at each time point. Internalized receptor was defined as cell-associated radioactivity after stripping and expressed as a percentage of total binding. At the indicated time points, cells were washed with a 0.5 m KSCN solution. Internalized radioligand is defined as the amount of 125I-PACAP-27 that could not be stripped by KSCN washing and expressed as a percentage of the total bound 125I-PACAP-27 in control cells processed in parallel without KSCN exposure. At least three experiments were performed in triplicate. Stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells were plated on 24-well culture dishes overnight (∼50,000 cells/well) with DMEM/10% calf serum in the presence of [3H]adenine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 2 mCi/ml. The cells were washed with DMEM, incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of PACAP-27 in DMEM containing BSA (1 mg/ml) and 2.5 mm 3-isobutyl, 1–1-methyl-xanthine for 30 min, and then aspirated. 100 μl of 2% SDS, 1 mm cAMP solution was used to lyse the cells. cAMP was assayed by consecutive Dowex AG-50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad) and aluminum oxide (Sigma) column chromatography as described by Salomon et al. (24Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Elutes were collected in vials and counted using a Beckman Liquid Scintillation Counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Transfected NIH/3T3 cells were plated on 24-well culture plates (∼50,000 cells/well) with DMEM/10% calf serum in the presence of 100 μCi/mlmyo-2-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight. Following aspiration of themyo-2-[3H]-inositol, cells were incubated with PI buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2,1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm, glucose, 0.5% BSA) in the presence of the indicated peptide concentrations. Total [3H]inositol phosphate was measured using strong anion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG 1-X8) according to a modification of the method of Berridge et al.(25Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis by using a polyclonal anti-PAC1 antibody directed against the C terminus confirmed cell surface expression of wild type and mutant constructs for representative Hop splice variants as shown in Fig.2. These results are consistent with the detection of rat and human WT PAC1s on transfected NIH/3T3 cells by confocal microscopy using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody directed against the HA epitope constructed on the N terminus of the receptor (results not shown). In addition, a fluorescent PACAP hormone (FluoPACAP) was also used to demonstrate cell surface expression using confocal microscopy for each of the constructs by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Similarly, FACS analysis using the polyclonal anti-PAC1 conjugated to Alexa488 showed that >90% of the stably transfected cells showed cell surface expression (data not shown). To investigate the ligand binding properties (K d, B max) and expression levels of mutant receptors, we studied the125I-PACAP-27 binding to membranes of NIH/3T3 cells expressing the WT or the truncated receptors (Fig.3). The binding of125I-PACAP-27 to cells expressing WT Null variant (right panel) and Hop variant (left panel) or truncated mutant receptors (Tr406 or Tr433) was performed at 37 °C. Linear regression reveals a K d of 0.87, 0.91, and 1.12 nm and a B max of 129, 118, and 157 fmol/mg of protein for the NullWT, NullTr406, and NullTr433 (left panel), respectively and a K d = 1.25, 0.55, and 0.63 nm and a B max∼130, 69, and 73 fmol/mg of protein for the HopWT, Tr406, and HopTr433 (Fig. 3, right panel), respectively. The Scatchard plot showed only small differences in K d and Bmax between the truncated and wild type receptors (see Table II).Table IISummary of the KD, Bmax, potencies and efficacies for both cAMP and inositol phosphate efficacy for the wild type and PAC1 mutant constructsPAC1 mutant constructK DB maxcAMPInositol phosphateEfficacyEC50EfficacyEC50nmpmol/mgfold stimulation over basalnmfold stimulation over basalnmWT Hop0.9 ± 0.05109.9 ± 3.145.0 ± 1.4115.5 ± 6.846.3 ± 0.3228.7 ± 0.51Tr4060.6 ± 0.5273.8 ± 1.970000Tr4160.6 ± 0.3269.3 ± 1.540000Tr4201.7 ± 0.24241.9 ± 5.960000Tr420A4162.2 ± 0.91242.8 ± 6.550000Tr420A4171.7 ± 0.16316.9 ± 7.210000Tr420A4180.3 ± 0.0579.8 ± 8.2045.3 ± 2.677.1 ± 3.358.4 ± 0.3830.0 ± 0.00Tr420A418A4190.4 ± 0.39101.4 ± 1.2634.0 ± 0.9415.5 ± 6.848.2 ± 0.7053.3 ± 9.47Tr4240.3 ± 0.4758.1 ± 9.3029.7 ± 2.140.40 ± 0.178.4 ± 0.5723.3 ± 3.85Tr4330.5 ± 0.29129.8 ± 1.0344.8 ± 2.101.1 ± 0.076.2 ± 0.5490.0 ± 8.82The data presented are the means ± S.E. for at least three experiments performed in triplicate for each of the indicated constructs. Open table in a new tab The data presented are the means ± S.E. for at least three experiments performed in triplicate for each of the indicated constructs. Radioligand competitive binding was analyzed by specific binding of 125I-PACAP-27 at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of PACAP-27. Because previous studies using NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing hPAC1 have shown that PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 are equipotent, only PACAP-27 was used (9Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A similar level of 125I-PACAP binding was observed for both the WT and truncated mutants. Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 125I-PACAP-27 was shown on intact NIH/3T3 cells expressing NullWT, NullTr406, or NullTr433 (Fig. 4 A) and HopWT, HopTr406, and Tr433 (Fig. 4 B), whereas Hop Tr420, Hop Tr420A417, and Tr420A418 (Fig. 4 C) were all nearly identical (IC50 = 3–13 nm). These data were fit to a one-site model for ligand binding and are in close agreement with the results obtained from the Scatchard analysis of membrane preparations; they suggest that truncation or substitution of amino acids within the C terminus does not alter the ligand binding to the receptor. To investigate the role of the PAC1 C terminus in receptor internalization, we created truncated receptor mutants and performed 125I-PACAP-27 internalization studies. Shown in Fig. 5are the results of 125I-PACAP-27 internalization in NIH/3T3 cells expressing NullWT, NullTr406, or NullTr433 (Fig. 5 A) and the HopWT, HopTr406 or HopTr433 (Fig. 5 B). Radioligand internalization was rapid in the NullWT and HopWT splice variants, where more than 50% of the radioligand was internalized in less than 5 min. As illustrated in Table I, the internalization process reached a plateau after 60 min, with a maximal radioligand internalization of 80 ± 2 and 90 ± 3% for NullWT and HopWT, respectively. The half-life (t 12) was 4.4 min in the NullWT and 3.1 min in the HopWT (Table I). In contrast, 125I-PACAP internalization was significantly decreased for both NullTr406 and NullTr433, which had nearly identical values. In all cases the internalization time course was longer (half-life about 8–9 min), and only 56.7 ± 4.2% and 58.4 ± 4.0% of cell-associated ligand was internalized following a 60-min incubation. Similarly, both the truncated mutants, HopTr406 and HopTr433, displayed a longer internalization time (half-life about 7–8 min), and only 60 ± 4%, 53 ± 4% of ligand was internalized for HopTr433 and HopTr406, respectively (Table I). It was noted that a small but significant difference in internalization rate and extent between the NullWT (90% at 60 min) and the HopWT (80% at 60 min). A shorter internalization time course was also observed among the truncated Hop mutants compared with truncated Null mutants.Table IInternalization of radiolabeled PACAP for the wild type and truncated mutantsReceptort 1/2 of PACAPPercentage of PACAP internalized at 60 minmin%Null WT4.41 ± 0.0290.1 ± 3.0Null Tr4068.24 ± 0.0256.7 ± 4.2 1-ap < 0.001.Null Tr4339.65 ± 0.0258.4 ± 4.0 1-ap < 0.001.Hop WT3.12 ± 0.0380.2 ± 3.6Hop Tr4068.23 ± 0.0253.0 ± 4.0 1-ap < 0.001.Hop Tr4336.67 ± 0.0161.3 ± 7.2 1-ap < 0.001.The t 1/2 (half-life) is the time to reach half-maximum internalization and is expressed in min.

We next investigated the effects of the C terminus of the PAC1 on signal transduction. The AC stimulation for the WT receptors was 20–45-fold above base line (Fig.6, A and B). Despite normal 125I-PACAP-27 binding for the WT receptor expressing cells, NIH/3T3 cells expressing the NullTr406 (Fig.6 A) and HopTr406 (Fig. 6 B) showed no coupling to AC in response to PACAP-27.

https://openalex.org/W2043068964,"We previously have described the use of an antisense RNA strategy termed random homozygous knock-out (RHKO) to identify negative regulators of cell proliferation. Here we report the discovery that RHKO-mediated deficiency of the nCL-4 calpain protease results in cellular transformation of and tumorigenesis by murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We isolated cell clones able to form colonies on 0.5% soft agar and found that these cells generated tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The gene inactivated by RHKO was identified as nCL-4 by genomic library screening, transcript analysis, and DNA sequencing. Anchorage-independent growth, as indicated by colony formation on soft agar, was reversed by reversal of antisense-mediated homozygous inactivation, but continued haplo-insufficiency of nCL-4 resulting from insertional mutagenesis of one nCL-4 allele was associated with persistent tumorigenesis. nCL-4 cDNA expressed in naive 3T3 cells in the antisense, but not sense, direction under control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter reproduced the anchorage-independent growth effects of RHKO. Our results implicate deficiency of the nCL-4 calpain protease in neoplastic transformation."

These widely distributed enzymes detoxify electrophiles, thereby protecting cells against the toxic and neoplastic effects of carcinogens. We have previously shown that increases in QR enzyme activity can be induced by low concentrations of antiestrogens in breast cancer cells (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Induction of QR enzymatic activity showed unusual reversed pharmacology, being markedly up-regulated by antiestrogen and suppressed by estrogen in breast cancer cells. The antiestrogen regulation of quinone reductase enzymatic activity represents a potentially important pharmacological mechanism for this group of anticancer drugs that had not been previously recognized. The electrophile response element (EpRE) motif has been identified in the regulatory region of the genes encoding QR and the GST-Ya subunit (4Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). QR expression is up-regulated at the transcriptional level through the EpRE by antiestrogen-liganded estrogen receptor (ER). Interestingly ERβ is a more potent activator of QR gene transcriptional activity than ERα. Gel shift assays suggest that antiestrogen-mediated induction of QR gene transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells involves a direct transcriptional effect where ERα or ERβ are components of the protein complex that binds the EpRE. However several aspects of antiestrogen regulation of QR transcriptional activity cannot be attributed solely to ER binding to the EpRE and remain to be investigated. This is especially true in light of our previous observations that 1) the time course of induction of QR enzyme activity is relatively slow (with increases in QR mRNA first detectable at 12–16 h after antiestrogen treatment of MCF7 cells (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)), 2) antiestrogen activation of GST Ya gene transcriptional activity is mediated through an EpRE that is not homologous to the ERE (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and 3) the interaction of the ER with the EpRE is weak, and the EpRE interacts with additional proteins (12Montano M.M.

Clearly the regulation by antiestrogen-liganded ER may be also attributable to changes in the levels and/or the activity of other factors. Thus studies, now reported here, were conducted to further dissect the molecular mechanism(s) involved in antiestrogen induction of QR activity and identify other transcriptional factors involved in this regulation. We used yeast genetic screenings to identify protein factors that fulfill two criteria, the ability to bind to the EpRE and interact with the ER. We report the identification and characterization of hPMC2 as a factor that fulfills these two criteria in yeast genetic screenings as well as in vitro assays. Although only a slight up-regulation of QR gene transcriptional activity was observed with hPMC2, antiestrogen-liganded ERβ enhanced hPMC2-mediated activation of QR transcriptional activity. Cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), and fetal calf serum was from Sigma. The antiestrogen trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) was obtained from Sigma. tert-Butylhydroquinone was obtained from Aldrich. Custom oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys (Grand Island, NY). The reporter constructs for one-hybrid screenings were constructed by cloning one copy of the EpRE into the pHISi-1 and pLacZi vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to make EpRE-pHISi-1 and EpRE-pLacZi. The following oligonucleotides, which contain the −476 to −437 region of the human QR gene, were used: EpRE-1, 5′-AATTAAATCGCAGTCACAGTGACTCAGCAGAATCTGAGCCTAGG -3′; EpRE-2, 5′-TCGACCTAGGCTCAGATTCTGCTGAGTCACTGTGACTGCGATTT-3′; EpRE-3, 5′-CGCGCCTAGGCTCAGATTCTGGTGAGTCACTGTGACTGCGATTT-3′. EpRE 1 and 2 were annealed, gel-purified, and cloned intoEcoRI/SalI-digested pLacZi vector. EpRE 1 and 3 were annealed, gel-purified, and cloned intoEcoRI/MluI-digested pHISi-1. The oligonucleotides containing mutated EpRE, 5′-AATTAAATCGCAGTCACAGGTCAGACGCAGAATCTGAGCCTAGG-3′ and 5′-TCGACCTAGGCTCAGATTCTGCGTCTGACCTGTGACTGCGATTT-3′, were annealed, gel-purified, and cloned intoEcoRI/SalI-digested pLacZi vector to make EpREmut-pLacZi. pNQO1CAT 0.863 (containing 863 base pairs of the QR gene promoter, which contains one copy of the EpRE between −476 and −437), pNQO1 CAT 0.365 (containing 365 base pairs of the QR gene promoter and missing the EpRE), pNQO1hARE-tk-CAT (containing the region between −476 and −446 of the QR gene promoter introduced upstream of the thymidine kinase gene promoter in the pBLCAT2 vector), pNQO1hARE(mut)-tk-CAT (containing a mutated TRE element), and pNQO1hARE(mut2)-tk-CAT (containing a mutated TRE-like element) have been described previously (9Xie T.

The partial hPMC2 clone, pAD-GAL4–2.1-hPMC2(139–422), obtained from yeast two-hybrid screening contains amino acids 139–422 of human homolog of XPMC2 cloned in-frame with the activation domain of GAL4 in the pAD-GAL4–2.1 phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The partial cDNA clone was released by BamHI/SalI digestion and inserted in-frame with the FLAG epitope intoBamHI/SalI-digested pCMV-Tag2B vector (Stratagene) to make pCMV-Tag2B-hPMC2(139–422). cDNA encoding amino acids 1–204 was obtained using Access reverse transcriptase-PCR kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, DNA-free RNA was obtained by treatment of total RNA with DNaseI in the presence of placental RNase inhibitor for 30 min at 37 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions were performed for each RNA sample using 0.25 μg of DNA-free total RNA in 1× reaction buffer, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 5 units of Tfl DNA polymerase, and 1 μm each of upstream primer (CGGCCCAGGCGCTGGACGGCAG) and downstream primer (CTATGGCAGCTTCGATATCCGGTG). The first strand cDNA synthesis reactions were performed at 48 C for 45 min, 94 C for 2 min. The second strand cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification reactions were performed at 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension step at 68 °C for 7 min. Amplified cDNA was run on a 1.2% agarose gel and purified using the QIAEX kit from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The cDNA was then cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector to make pCRII-TOPO-hPMC2(1–204) using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced using the Sequenase Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To construct a mammalian expression vector for full-length hPMC2 cDNA, pCRII-TOPO-hPMC2(1–204) was digested with BamHI and EcoRV to release the fragment encoding amino acids 1–204. The fragment was then inserted in-frame with the FLAG epitope at the 5′ end and in-frame with amino acids 205–422 at the 3′ end intoBamHI/EcoRV-digested pCMV-Tag2B-hPMC2(139–422) to make pCMV-Tag2B-hPMC2. pGEX2T-hPMC2, which encodes full-length and FLAG-epitope tagged hPMC2 in-frame with GST was constructed byNotI/XhoI digestion of pCMV-Tag2B-hPMC2. The insert, which contains cDNA encoding full-length FLAG-hPMC2, was blunted with Klenow and inserted into BamHI-digested and -blunted pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pEGFP-hPMC2, which encodes full-length hPMC2 in-frame with the coding sequence for green fluorescent protein (GFP), was constructed byBamHI/XhoI digestion of pCMV-Tag2B-hPMC2. The insert was blunted and cloned into BglII-digested and -blunted pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). The expression vectors for the wild type human estrogen receptor α and β have been described previously (12Montano M.M. Jaiswal A.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol.

To construct pBD-GAL4-ERβ(EF), which encodes the EF domain of ERβ cloned in-frame with the DNA binding domain of GAL4, CMV-ERβ was digested with KpnI/SmaI, blunted, and inserted intoSalI-digested, blunted pBD-GAL4-Cam (Stratagene). To construct pGEX2T-ERβ, which encodes full-length and FLAG epitope-tagged ERβ in-frame with GST, FLAG-ERβ-BSII-SK+ was digested with XbaI/HindIII. The insert was blunted and cloned into BamHI-digested and -blunted pGEX2T. The plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH), which encodes the β-galactosidase gene, was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency in all experiments. To identify putative EpRE-interacting proteins, the EpRE-containing reporter vectors, EpRE-pHISi-1 and EpRE-pLacZi (CLONTECH), were integrated into the yeast strain YM4271 genome sequentially. As a negative control the mutated EpRE-containing reporter vector, EpREmut-pLacZi, was introduced separately into the YM4271 yeast strain. Yeast cells containing the EpRE-pHISi-1 and EpRE-pLacZi reporter vectors were cotransformed with a human MCF7 (a breast cancer epithelial cell line) cDNA library in pAD-GAL4 (14Montano M.M. Ekena K.

A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and plated on media lacking histidine and supplemented with 50 mm3-aminotriazole. 3-Aminotriazole is a competitive inhibitor of the yeast HIS3 protein, which suppresses the basal level of expression ofHIS3. β-Galactosidase activities were determined fromHIS3 + colonies using both filter lift or liquid assays (14Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). HIS3 + colonies exhibiting high β-galactosidase activity (LacZ + colonies) were further tested for interaction with the estrogen receptor. The yeast two hybrid screenings used to test interactions of putative EpRE-interacting clones with the estrogen receptor were described previously (14Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To establish interaction of promising clones with ERβ, a standard two-hybrid strategy was used wherein library plasmids encoding putative EpRE-interacting clones were also transformed into YRG2 yeast strain containing pBD-GAL-ERβ(EF) and plated into media lacking histidine. β-Galactosidase activities were determined fromHIS3 + colonies. To recover library plasmids, total DNA from HIS3 + ,LacZ + colonies was isolated and used to transformEscherichia coli (XLI-Blu MRF′ strain from Stratagene). To ensure that the correct cDNAs were isolated, library plasmids were transformed back into the YM4271 yeast strain containing EpRE-pHISi-1 and EpRE-pLacZi, or EpREmut-pLacZi reporter vectors, plated onto media lacking histidine, and tested for β-galactosidase activity. The cDNAs were also transformed back into the YRG2 yeast strain containing pBD-GAL-ERβ(EF). Crude extracts were obtained from E. coli transformed with pGEX2T-hPMC2 or pGEX2T-ERβ and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega). Five hundred micrograms of crude extract containing GST fusion proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After three washes with 1 ml of NET (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4), the beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl (or 1.25 units) of thrombin protease in 1× PBS. After protease treatment, the beads were spun down, and the supernatants, which contain purified hPMC2 or ERβ, were collected. Aliquots of the protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein assay kit (Pierce) before being utilized in gel shift assays to check protein quality and relative purity and total protein concentration in extracts, respectively. As a negative control, crude extracts fromE. coli transformed with pGEX2T (i.e. lacking hPMC2 or ERβ coding sequence) were subjected to the same purification and protease treatment procedure. The single-stranded oligomers, either 5′-AAT TAA ATC GCA GTC ACA GTG ACT CAG CAG AAT CTG AGC CTA GG -3′, which contains the −476 to −437 region of the human QR gene or 5′-AGC TAG TCA GGT CAC AGT GAC CTG ATC-3′, which contains the consensus ERE, were annealed to their complement. The resultant double-stranded oligomer was gel-purified on a nondenaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA. The ability of purified protein(s) to bind to the EpRE was analyzed using gel mobility shift assays as described previously (12Montano M.M. Jaiswal A.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25443-25449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μl (10–100 ng) of purified proteins were mixed with 1 ng of end-labeled EpRE oligomer in the presence of 0.4 μg/μl dI-dC, 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The specificity of binding was assessed by competition with excess unlabeled double-stranded EpRE, mutated EpRE, or ERE. The non-denaturing gels used to analyze the protein-DNA complexes were run as described previously (15Kraus W.L. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 952-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The FLAG antibody M2 was obtained from Sigma. The ERβ polyclonal antibody was obtained from the laboratory of Benita S. Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, IL). In vitrotranscription and translation of ERα and ERβ were performed using the Promega TNT kit. Briefly, 1 μg of ERα-BSII-SK+ or ERβ-BSII-SK+ (12Montano M.M. Jaiswal A.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25443-25449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were mixed with 25 μl of TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 μl of TNT buffer, 1 μl of amino acid mixture, 1 μl of T3 RNA polymerase (20 U/μl), and 4 μl of [35S]methionine (15 μCi/μl; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The final reaction of 50 μl was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. For the in vitrointeraction assays, 500 μg of E. coli bacteria crude extracts containing GST-hPMC2 fusion protein were incubated at 4 °C with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2.5 h. After two washes with 1 ml of NENT (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5% milk) and two washes with 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% v/v glycerol, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA), the beads were incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated ERα or ERβ overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of NET and 2 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. After washing, bound protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The protein samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried, and radiolabeled protein was detected by autoradiography. MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Chusacultanachai S. Glenn K.A. Rodriguez A.O. Read E.K. Gardner J.F. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol.

Cells were seeded for transfection in a 100-mm dish in improved minimum essential media minus phenol red containing 5% charcoal dextran treated calf serum. Cells at 30–50% confluence were transfected by the CaPO4 coprecipitation method 48 h later with 2 μg of EpRE (wild type or mutant)-containing reporter constructs, ERβ expression vector, hPMC2 expression vector, and 1.5 μg of pCMVβ β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. Carrier DNA pTZ19R was added to adjust the total DNA to 15 μg. Cells remained in contact with the precipitate for 5 h and were then subjected to a 2.5-min glycerol shock (20% glycerol in improved minimum essential media minus phenol red plus 5% charcoal dextran treated calf serum). Cells were rinsed with Hepes-buffered saline solution and given fresh media with or without hormones. All cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment. Extracts were prepared in 200 μl of 250 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, using three freeze-thaw cycles. β-Galactosidase activity, which was measured to normalize for transfection efficiency, and CAT activity were assayed as described previously (17Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10880-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pEGFP-hPMC2 vector was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells as described above. As a control, separate plates of cells were transfected with pEGFP-C3 vector alone. Twenty-four hours after glycerol shock, the cells were observed by both phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance and tested for statistical significance using Student'st test. Yeast genetic screenings were used to identify protein factors expressed in breast cancer cells that bind to the EpRE as well as interact with the ER. One copy of EpRE (representing the −476 and −446 region of the QR gene) was cloned upstream of the LacZ and HIS3 reporter gene promoter followed by genomic integration of reporter constructs into yeast cells. cDNA libraries from MCF7 breast cancer cells were screened for expression of putative EpRE-interacting clones by their ability to activate LacZ and HIS3 reporter gene constructs. To verify the interaction of these clones with the EpRE we mutated the 5-base pair core sequence that is well conserved among the EpREs identified from different genes. Because protein factors that modulate the transcriptional activation of the QR gene by antiestrogens most likely interact with the ER, putative EpRE-interacting clones were also screened for their ability to interact with the ER. Clones were introduced into yeast cells expressing the EF domain of human ERβ fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and their interaction was measured by the ability of the clones to activate a reporter construct containing the GAL4 upstream activating sequence. Of eight putative EpRE interacting clones identified, one clone was selected for further analyses because of strong binding to the EpRE and interaction with ERβ in two separate yeast screenings (Fig.1). The sequence of the putative EpRE- and ER-interacting clone was determined, and GenBank™ and literature searches indicated that the clone was the human homologue of the X enopus laevis gene, which prevents mitoticcatastrophe, XPMC2 (18Kwiatkowska J. Slomski R. Jozwiak S. Short M.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Genomics. 1997; 44: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The partial hPMC2 clone obtained from yeast two hybrid screening contains amino acids 139–422 of human PMC2. cDNA encoding amino acids 1–138 was obtained using reverse transcriptase-PCR and fused with the rest of the coding region. The full-length hPMC2 gene encodes a 47-kDa protein that prevents premature entry into mitosis (termed mitotic catastrophe) in fission yeast (19Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). hPMC2 has 422 amino acids and is basic with many lysine residues. An exonuclease domain has been identified at the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 233–406 (20Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)). hPMC2 also has a P-loop motif (Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly) with a well conserved lysine at amino acid residues 252–257, indicative of an ATP binding domain (21Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Several potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C are localized from amino acids 9 to 98, as well as a tyrosine phosphorylation site at amino acids 342–350. The carboxyl-terminal region of hPMC2 also shows homology to two other known proteins: HEM45, an estrogen regulated transcript in human tumor lines and rat uterus (22Pentecost B.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and ISG20, an interferon-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear body-associated protein (23Gongora C. David G. Pintard L. Tissot C. Hua T.D. Dejean A. Mechti N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The interaction of hPMC2 with the ERα and ERβ was examined in vitro in GST pull-down assays. In vitro translated and radiolabeled ERβ was retained in a column wherein hPMC2 was expressed as a fusion protein with GST bound to a glutathione-Sepharose, indicating a direct interaction between hPMC2 and ERβ (Fig. 2). The interaction of hPMC2 with ERβ appears to be stronger when compared with its interaction to ERα. With regard to the effects of ligand on the interaction of ERβ with hPMC2, the strength of interaction of hPMC2 with ERβ can be described as follows: tamoxifen-liganded ERβ = unliganded ERβ > estrogen-liganded ERβ. To verify binding of hPMC2 to the EpRE, the interaction of purified FLAG-hPMC2 protein (Fig. 3 A) with radiolabeled EpRE was examined in gel shift assays. A shifted DNA-protein complex is evident in samples containing purified hPMC2 but not with control extracts (Fig. 3 B). Binding of hPMC2 to the EpRE occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The DNA-protein complex was competed by excess amounts of unlabeled EpRE but not mutated EpRE or wild type ERE (Fig. 3 C). A supershifted complex was observed in the presence of FLAG antibody. These studies indicate that hPMC2 interacted with the EpRE in a specific manner. Because our GST pull-down assays indicate the hPMC2 interacts with ERβ and more strongly so than with ERα, we examined the effect of purified ERβ (Fig. 3 A) on the ability of hPMC2 to bind to the EpRE. When purified hPMC2 was coincubated with purified ERβ, we observed a more intense DNA-protein complex band as well as supershifted bands when compared with hPMC2 alone (Fig. 3 D). Increased binding was observed in the absence of ligand and in the presence of the antiestrogen TOT. These results suggest an enhancement of the ability of hPMC2 to bind to the EpRE in the presence of ERβ. The DNA-protein complex observed in the presence of hPMC2 and ERβ was slightly supershifted and immunodepleted in the presence of ERβ antibody (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that an interaction between ERβ and hPMC2 is involved in the enhancement of hPMC2 binding to the EpRE. The ability of hPMC2 to bind to the EpRE as well as interact with the ER is supported by experiments examining intracellular localization of hPMC2. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that transiently transfected GFP-tagged hPMC2 can be localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 4). GFP vector alone showed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, and GFP-tagged prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase that has been reported to exhibit primarily non-nuclear localization (24Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) did so under our experimental conditions. To determine if binding of hPMC2 to the EpRE results in the regulation of QR gene transcriptional activity in mammalian cells, hPMC2 cDNA was cloned into the pCMV-Tag2B mammalian expression vector and cotransfected with a CAT reporter construct containing the EpRE (wild type or mutated) cloned upstream of the heterologous TK promoter. These experiments were performed in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and HepG2 liver carcinoma because of the low basal or non-induced levels of QR in these cells. Increasing amounts of hPMC2 expression vector induced a slight, albeit statistically significant increase (1.7 ± 0.2, p < 0.01) in EpRE-TK-CAT activity in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5 A). This represents maximal activation because further increases in the amount of hPMC2 expression vector did not increase reporter activity. Because increased hPMC2 binding to the EpRE was observed in the presence of ERβ, we determined if ERβ could enhance the activation of QR transcriptional activity by hPMC2. For these experiments we transfected levels of expression vector for ERβ that did not induce activation of EpRE-tk-CAT activity. Under these conditions we observe a more significant activation (3.2 ± 0.3) of EpRE enhancer activity. This level of induction is comparable with that observed withte"
https://openalex.org/W2167629420,"Activation of stably expressed M(2) and M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) as well as of endogenously expressed lysophosphatidic acid and purinergic receptors in HEK-293 cells can induce a long lasting potentiation of phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation by these and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we report that GPCRs can induce an up-regulation of PLC stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as well and provide essential mechanistic characteristics of this sensitization process. Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells for 2 min with carbachol, a mAChR agonist, lysophosphatidic acid, or ATP, followed by agonist washout, strongly increased (by 2-3-fold) maximal PLC stimulation (measured >/=40 min later) by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, but not insulin, and largely enhanced PLC sensitivity to these RTK agonists. The up-regulation of RTK-induced PLC stimulation was cycloheximide-insensitive and was observed for up to approximately 90 min after removal of the GPCR agonist. Sensitization of receptor-induced PLC stimulation caused by prior M(2) mAChR activation was fully prevented by pertussis toxin and strongly reduced by expression of Gbetagamma scavengers. Furthermore, inhibition of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes and chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) suppressed the sensitization process, while overexpression of PKC-alpha, but not PKC-betaI, further enhanced the M(2) mAChR-induced sensitization of PLC stimulation. None of these treatments affected acute PLC stimulation by either GPCR or RTK agonists. Taken together, short term activation of GPCRs can induce a strong and long lasting sensitization of PLC stimulation by RTKs, a process apparently involving G(i)-derived Gbetagammas as well as increases in intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of a PKC isoenzyme, most likely PKC-alpha."

Each of these represent one of three distinct gene classes that utilize a characteristic promoter structure and a specific set of TFs (3Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 107-126Google Scholar). 5 S rRNA genes comprise class I and contain a principal internal promoter that is a binding site for TFIIIA. Class 3 genes utilize upstream TATA elements and, in metazoans, an additional upstream element that binds a distinct multisubunit TF (4Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). Class 2 is represented by tRNA genes, which are driven by an internal split promoter composed of proximal box A and distal box B elements. In contrast to the diversity of promoter structures, the termination signal for polymerase III transcription is the run of dT residues found at the 3′-ends of pol III-transcribed genes (reviewed in Ref. 5Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The A box usually begins 10–15 base pairs (bp) downstream of the start site of transcription, and the B box is further downstream, the distance depending on the particular tRNA gene. The terminator is the most 3′ element, usually found within 20 bp of the B box (6Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 247-280Google Scholar). The multisubunit TF IIIC spans the length of tRNA genes, binding to the internal promoter and terminator regions (3Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 107-126Google Scholar). The largest subunit of TFIIIC plays a central role in initiation by recognizing the B box promoter and orienting its associated subunits along the DNA. The TFIIIC subunits that are oriented toward the start site promote TFIIIB binding and therefore assist in directing accurate initiation by pol III (7Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H.

Much less is known about the functions of the downstream TFIIIC subunits, TFC6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TFIIICβ in humans, within their transcription complexes (3Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C.

The TFIIIB subunits, TATA-binding protein (TBP), and TFIIB-related factor (Brf), have been conserved from S. cerevisiae to humans, as have the two TFIIIC subunits that localize near the A box and several subunits of pol III itself (10Hsieh Y.J.

By contrast to these initiation factors, the downstream TFIIIC subunits in these organisms had revealed no recognizable sequence relatedness. For example, hTFIIIC220, the human polypeptide that binds the B box, bears no homology to the S. cerevisiae B box-binding factor, TFC3p, or to anything in the S. cerevisiae sequence data base (22L'Etoile N.D.

Some S. cerevisiae TFIIIC subunits, TFC7p and TFC8p, as well as the downstream protein, TFC6p, were reported to have no human homologs (13Arrebola A. Manaud N. Rozenfeld S. Marsolier M.-C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another example of divergence is provided by hTFIIICβ (also known as hTFIIIC110 (10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), a pol III regulatory factor that activates transcription during cellular proliferation and in response to adenovirus E1A (15Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A critical feature that distinguishes TFIIIC complexes that bind the B box but are inactive for transcription from those that bind and are active is the presence of hTFIIICβ in the latter (15Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24446-24456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although hTFIIICβ contains intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity that relieves chromatin-mediated repression, this is presumably not its sole activity, since it is also required for transcription of naked templates in a highly purified system, (15Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Examination of the interaction of hTFIIICβ with hTFIIIC220 suggested that it is orientated downstream of the B box, toward the 3′-region of the transcription complex (14Shen Y. Igo M. Yalamanchili P. Berk A.J. Dasgupta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which hTFIIICβ activates transcription has remained an intriguing puzzle with no clues from the S. cerevisiae system (10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has begun to examine pol III transcription in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. For the present report, we identified a sequence in S. pombe, designatedsfc6 ( S . pombeTFC6) that exhibits highly significant homology to both TFC6p and hTFIIICβ. This led to the identification, cloning, isolation, and expression of four subunits of a S. pombeTFIIIC complex. Specific promoter binding and transcription activity demonstrate that Sfc6p is an integral component of an active S. pombe TFIIIC. Since homology between human hTFIIICβ and yeast TFC6p went unrecognized previously and is not apparent without the Sfc6p sequence, this study demonstrates that the S. pombesystem is uniquely valuable in extending the relatedness of the pol III systems of yeast and higher eukaryotes while simultaneously establishing a TFIIIC-dependent transcription system in this alternative model organism. The strains used for this study are described in Table I. Yeast extract plus supplements or Edinburgh minimal medium plus supplements was used for routine culture or selection of transformants (30Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymology. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Edinburgh minimal medium plus 5 μg/ml phloxin B was used to differentiate diploid from haploid cells (30Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymology. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Edinburgh minimal medium plus 200 mg/liter uracil and 1 g/liter 5-fluoroorotic acid was used for counterselection as indicated. Minimal glutamate medium plus supplements was used for sporulation. Transformations were carried out using lithium acetate (31Kanter-Smoler G. Dahlkvist A. Sunnerhagen P.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla) and two oligo-DNA primers, 5′-TCACCTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGATGACGACGACAAGGGCCCTAAATCTAAGGAATAC and 5′-GTGGGATCCTCATCTTCTTTCAACGGCTGAGAGA, containing XhoI andBamHI restriction sites, and was cloned into these sites in pREP4X (33Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A sequence encoding a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDKDFAL) was inserted beyond the initiating AUG to create pREP4X-F-Sfc6. For the general purpose N-terminal FLAG-His6 (FH-) double tag vector, two phosphorylated oligo-DNAs, “repns” (5′-pTCGAGATGGATTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGCATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACGCTAGCGCCATGGGCCCTGTCGACG) and “repnas” (5′-pGATCCGTCGACAGGGCCCATGGCGCTAGCGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCATATGCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAATCCATC) were annealed and inserted into theXhoI–BamHI site of pREP3X (34Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) to create pREP90X. To generate FH-Sfc6p, the ApaI–BamHI insert of pREP4X-F-Sfc6 was cloned into theApaI–BamHI sites of pREP90X to create pREP90X-FH-Sfc6. A cDNA encoding Sfc6p was isolated from the λ-ADH-S. pombe cDNA library (35Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). All oligo-DNAs were obtained from Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD), and the relevant regions of all constructs were verified by sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. The open reading frame of sfc3 + was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into the NcoI andSalI sites of pREP90X, resulting in pREP90X-Sfc3; this was digested with PstI and SpeI, and the resulting 2.8-kb fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of pAF1, resulting in pAF-tfc3. This fragment contains thenmt1 promoter (36Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1.6 kb of DNA encoding the FH epitopes fused to the N-terminal coding region of Sfc3. A 1.0-kbKpnI–SalI DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region upstream of the sfc3 +promoter was amplified by PCR and cloned into theKpnI–SalI sites of pAF-Sfc3, resulting in pAF-Sfc3in, which was used to construct the integrant S. pombe strain yYH2230. A sense primer TFC1sen2 (5′-CCATATTAGGCATATATCATATGAATAGTCTA,NdeI) and an antisense primer TFC1 ant1 (5′-GTGATTGAGGATCCCCCATGTCAAGGTAC, BamHI) were used to amplify Sfc1 cDNA from S. pombe cDNA (35Elledge S.J.

This was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). Sfc6 cDNA was obtained by PCR using a sense primer, PETNerm1 (5′-ATTGACGCATATGGGCCCTAAATCTAAGGAATAC, NdeI), and an antisense primer, PetCertm1 (5′-TCACCTCGAGTCATCTTCTTTCAACGGCTGAGAGA, XhoI), from S. pombe cDNA (35Elledge S.J.

The product was digested withNdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET28a. The 3′ region of Sfc3, beginning at nucleotide position 3289, was amplified with a sense primer, HISTFC3S3 (5′-GGACCATATGTCGCAAGAACGTCTTATGCAG, NdeI) and an antisense primer, TFC3NHISAN1 (5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACATTCTCGAGGCTAAGTTAA,XhoI), using S. pombe genomic DNA as template. The DNA fragment containing tfc3-C was cloned into theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET28a. The predicted size of tfc3-C protein is 28 kDa (243 amino acids). For S. pombe TBP (spTBP), a sense primer, SPTBPUP1 (5′-TAGGATCCCATATGGATTTCGCTTTACCCAC, NdeI), and an antisense primer, SPTBPDO1 (5′-TATGAATTCTGCCTTAATGTTTTCGAAATTC,EcoRI), were used to amplify spTBP cDNA (kindly provided by L. Pape, University of Wisconsin-Madison) and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a. Protein from each of the pET28a constructs above were expressed in bacteria, purified by nickel chromatography, and used for antiserum production. The sfc6 + allele was deleted by the one-step disruption method (37Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1.0 kb of genomic sequence flanking the 5′-end of sfc6 +was amplified by PCR and cloned into the KpnI andSalI sites upstream of his3 +in pAF1 (38Ohi R. Feoktistova A. Gould K.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 174: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The primers used were “N terminus 1” (5′-GGGGTACCGCTGCTTATGTAGTAGTCTTGCACCA) and “N terminus 2” (5′-TGCGGTCGACTTCCTTAGATTTAGGGCCCATACG). 1 kb of DNA flanking the 3′-end of the sfc6 + open reading frame was amplified by PCR and cloned into the PstI andSacI sites downstream of his3 + to create pAF-Δsfc6. The primers used were “C terminus 1” (5′- AAACTGCAGCTCTCAGCCGTTGAAAGAAGAT) and “C terminus 2” (5′- CGAGAGCTCACTCCTAACCTTTCGTACAGGCCAA). A 4.1-kbKpnI–SacI recombinant fragment containing the 5′-flanking sequence ofsfc6 +,his3 + and the 3′-flanking sequence of sfc6 + was isolated from pAF-Δsfc6, gel-purified, and used to transform yHL6818 (39Dang V.D. Benedik M.J. Ekwall K. Choi J. Allshire R.C. Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2351-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting diploid strain yYH8048, bearing theΔsfc6::his3 + allele was transformed with pREP90X-FH-Sfc6. Leucine, adenine, and histidine prototrophs were selected and sporulated, and the spores were released by glusulase treatment (DuPont) (30Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymology. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar), while the remaining diploid cells were eliminated by ethanol treatment (40Chen L. Guo A. Pape L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The desiredleu1 +, his3 + haploids were revealed by their pink color on limiting adenine, and one was recovered as yYH8238. The structure of theΔsfc6::his3 + allele in the integrant was confirmed by analytical PCR and Southern blotting (data not shown). The 5.8-kb DNA fragment from pAF-sfc3in was gel-purified and used to transform yHL6382 (39Dang V.D. Benedik M.J. Ekwall K. Choi J. Allshire R.C. Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2351-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prototrophichis3 + transformants were selected on the appropriate media. Southern blotting was performed by digesting 5 μg of genomic DNAs with AgeI and NheI. After fractionation on a 1% agarose gel, the DNA was denatured, neutralized, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus; NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was prehybridized in buffer containing 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, and 50% formamide at 42 °C for 2 h. A 4.0-kb fragment containing the open reading frame of sfc3 + was labeled by random primer extension to 4 × 109 dpm/mg (Lofstrand Laboratories) and added to a final concentration of 107 dpm/ml. After incubation at 42 °C for 16 h, the membrane was washed three times in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature and washed once in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. yYH8238 cells and/or control cells, SP1190, were grown to midlog phase in liquid Edinburgh minimal medium lacking uracil and histidine, collected by sedimentation, and lysed in a French press cell into buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.05 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected, avoiding the top lipid pellicle, passed through a Miracloth filter (Calbiochem), and dialyzed into 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Extract containing 10 mg of protein was gently mixed with 20 μl of M2-agarose for 6 h at 4 °C. The M2-agarose was washed with 5 × 1 ml of wash buffer (WB; 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF). The bound material was eluted by incubating twice with 40 μl of WB containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 4 °C for 20 min. The eluted material was adjusted to 5 mmimidazole and further incubated with 20 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) preequilibrated in WB containing 5 mm imidazole for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice in 1 ml of WB containing 10 mm imidazole. The bound material was eluted twice with 20 μl of WB containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluted material was subjected to immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Ab) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) or used for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). The probe used was an 85-bp gel-purified DNA that represents a wild type S. pombetRNATrpCCA gene (GenBankTM accession numberAB019620) designated tDNA (5′-GGCCCCTTAACTCAGTTGGTAGAGTGTGAGATTCCAAATCTCAAAGTCAAGTGTTCAAGTCACTTAGGGGTCATATTTTTTTTAA-3′. The 5′-end of this probe is approximately 5 bp downstream of the start site of transcription and should not include a TFIIIB-binding site (41Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Lofstrand Laboratories). EMSA was performed as described previously (42Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 10-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 ng of poly(dI/dC), and 10,000 cpm (0.16 ng; 0.3 pmol) of probe. After the addition of 2 μl of immunoaffinity-purified FH-Sfc6p eluate or control eluate, the reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and electrophoresed in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (0.45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 4 °C at 150 V for 2 h. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol for 30 min and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For the competition assay, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled tDNA or unlabeled mutated tDNA (mutDNA) 5′-GGCCCCTaAACTCgGaAtaTAGAGTGTGAGATTCCAAATCTCAAAGTCAAGTaTagatGTtACTTAGGGGTCATATTTTTTTTAAA-3′ (A and B boxes are underlined; lowercase indicates mutations) was added prior to the addition of the probe. The specific and nonspecific competitor DNAs were quantitated by UV absorbance followed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium staining (not shown). In some cases, the binding reaction was initiated, and then anti-FLAG Ab (M2) (Sigma) or control nonimmune Ab was added, and in some cases this was followed by the addition of FLAG peptide or control peptide as indicated and incubation for an additional 30 min on ice. 1 ml of cell-free extract (∼15 mg/ml) obtained by lysis in a French press as described above was incubated with 20 μl of M2-agarose (anti-FLAG IgG immobilized on agarose beads; Sigma, St. Louis) at 4 °C for 4 h. The agarose beads were washed with 5 × 0.5 ml of buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm PMSF. For immunoblotting, the material bound to M2-agarose was eluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed, blotted, and incubated with anti-Sfc6p Ab (diluted 1:4000), anti-Sfc1p Ab (1:1000), anti-Sfc3p Ab (1:2000), anti-S. pombe TBP Ab (1:500), or anti-Sfc4p-peptide Ab (1:200), respectively, developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All Abs used for immunoblotting were affinity-purified prior to use. S. pombe cell-free extracts were prepared according to a standard procedure (43Nichols M. Willis I. Soll D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the details of which are described elsewhere (44Hamada M. Sakulich A.L. Koduru S.B. Maraia R. J. Biol.

For immunodepletion, yYH2230 extracts containing FH-Sfc3p were incubated with 0.3 volume of M2-agarose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 4 h. For isolation of the TFIIIC complex, 1 ml of FH-Sfc3 extract was incubated with 20 μl of M2-agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The bound material was eluted with 20 μl of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG in the same buffer. A search of the S. pombe sequence data base using S. cerevisiae TFC6p as a query identified a predicted protein with a mass of 66.2 kDa encoded by four exons on chromosome II that is also homologous to hTFIIICβ (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar). We designated the gene for this protein sfc6 +. A cDNA in which the four predicted exons had apparently been spliced was isolated from a S. pombe cDNA library and sequenced (not shown, but see Fig. 1). This sequence encodes a protein of 582 amino acids with 25% identity (41% similarity) to TFC6p and 19% identity (33% similarity) to hTFIIICβ (Fig. 1). After two iterations, PSI-BLAST included only three proteins, Sfc6p, TFC6, and hTFIIICβ, in the set of highly significant homology, producing alignment scores above 400 and e values of 10−142 and 10−123 for TFC6p and hTFIIICβ, respectively (45Altschul S.F.

An acidic region previously noted in TFC6 is conserved in Sfc6p (residues 16–42) and to a significant degree in the corresponding region of hTFIIICβ (residues 40–74) (13Arrebola A. Manaud N.

https://openalex.org/W2011015069,"In this work, we show that the nonspecific DNA-binding protein Sso7d from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus displays a cation-dependent ATPase activity with a pH optimum around neutrality and a temperature optimum of 70 °C. Measurements of tryptophan fluorescence and experiments that used 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid as probe demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change in the molecule and that the binding of the nucleotide triggers the ATP hydrolysis-induced conformation of the protein to return to the native conformation. We found that Sso7d rescues previously aggregated proteins in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner; the native conformation of Sso7d forms a complex with the aggregates, while the ATP hydrolysis-induced conformation is incapable of this interaction. Sso7d is believed to be the first protein isolated from an archaeon capable of rescuing aggregates."

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In higher vertebrates, the α2,8-linked homopolymer of Neu5Ac is the only reported structure of polySia, although diverse structures of polySia differing in C-5 substitution of Sia residues and in the inter-residue linkages have been discovered in bacteria, invertebrates, and lower vertebrates (2Inoue Y. Inoue S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 789-800Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In embryonic vertebrate brain, the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a major carrier protein of polySia. A hypothesis that the presence of polySia on N-CAM attenuates the adhesive function of this molecule (3Bonfanti L. Olive S. Poulain D.A. Theodosis D.T. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 419-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Seki T. Arai Y. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 17: 265-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) is supported by temporally regulated expression of polySia on embryonic N-CAM, its spatially limited expression in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum of adult mammalian brain (where continuous plasticity is required). PolySia is also an oncodevelopmental antigen that is re-expressed on a number of human tumors, including neuroblastomas (5Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9443-9448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Wilms tumor (6Bitter-Suermann D. Roth L. Immunol. Res. 1987; 6: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of polySia on N-CAM not only functions as a negative regulator of N-CAM-mediated homotypic cell-cell adhesion but also decreases interactions with other cells. Although the molecular details of how polySia affects cell interactions has not been fully elucidated, it has been hypothesized to depend on the physical properties of this negatively charged and heavily hydrated polymer (7Rutishauser, U.

Recent studies have shown that two polysialyltransferases (polySTs), designated PST-1 (PST/ST8SiaIV) and STX (ST8SiaII), catalyze the polysialylation of N-CAM.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) brain have been studied. Despite extensive studies on the expression and function of polySia on N-CAM, there is a dearth of structural information on the degree of polymerization (DP) and, importantly, how the chain length may change during embryonic development. The overall structure of polysialylated glycan chains is also poorly understood, although the structure of core glycans in the embryonic chicken brain N-CAM was extensively examined and shown to have several unusual features (20Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The presence of α2,8-linked oligo/polySia in glycopeptides isolated from developing rat brain was initially established by the susceptibility to Vibrio cholerae sialidase and methylation analysis, coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (21Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this pioneering work, it was shown that 8–12 Sia residues were linked to bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycan chains. In more recent studies, evidence for the presence of polySia in neuronal tissues was based primarily on the susceptibility to a bacteriophage-induced poly(→8Neu5Acylα2→) endo-N-acylneuraminidase (Endo-N) (22Vimr E.R. McCoy R.D. Vollger H.F. Wilkinson N., C. Troy F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1971-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and reactivity to equine polyclonal antibody H.46 (23Finne J. Leinonen M. Makela P.H. Lancet. 1983; ii: 355-357Abstract Scopus (643) Google Scholar) or mouse monoclonal antibody 735 (24Finne J. Bitter-Suermann D. Goridis C. Finne U. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4402-4407PubMed Google Scholar). The functional and biosynthetic studies of polysialylation on N-CAM were stimulated and promoted by these sensitive and selective biological probes during past 15 years. However, although these specific reagents can be used for the diagnostic identification of polysialylated N-CAM, they are more effective for smaller oligoSia groups, i.e. 5 for Endo-N and 8–10 for H.46 and mouse monoclonal antibody. Consequently certain ambiguity is inevitable in the results obtained with these reagents when polySia chains are analyzed. The chemical and physicochemical determination of the DP of polySia chains contains many inherent problems which must be overcome. There are few reports on the determination of the DP of polySia on N-CAM by HPLC-based methods, and the published values vary widely, depending on the technique used. The initial evidence for the presence of extended polySia chains was based on the HPLC on a MonoQ column for the glycopeptides isolated from [3H]GlcNAc-labeled human neuroblastoma cells after brief treatment with Endo-N (5Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9443-9448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the chromatograms seem to indicate the presence of extended polySia chains up to DP of 55, the resolution for DP > 45 was poor, and furthermore, the peaks at high DP region were not explicitly identified as polyNeu5Ac chains. In contrast, average DP obtained for a sample of N-CAM from embryonic chick brain, based on the separation and quantitation of non-reducing terminal and internal sialic acid residues, was 18 (25Ashwell G. Berlin W.K. Gabriel O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, this value may be an underestimate, as the molecule contains monoSia residues in addition to polySia chains. Since the chain length-dependent physicochemical properties of polySia may determine its physiological role, a more accurate estimation of the DP of polySia chain expressed on embryonic N-CAM and the change in DP, if any, during development are essential for understanding the regulatory effects of polySia residues on N-CAM-associated physiological events. Information on the range of DP of polySia chains is also useful in understanding the biosynthetic reactions of polysialylation, and in clarifying how many sialyltransferases are involved in the formation of polySia N-CAM. To gain understanding to these problems, we addressed the following issues. First, a new analytical method was used to determining the DP of polySia chains of DP > 50 more accurately. Second, new methods were developed for isolation of polySia-N-CAM that eliminate or minimize unwanted cleavage of the inter-residue linkages of extended polySia chains, which are known to be more labile than shorter oligo/polySia (26Manzi A.E. Higa H.H. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23617-23624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, two highly sensitive analytical methods were used for selective detection of monoSia, diSia, oligoSia, and polySia residues. The advantages of these recently developed HPLC-based analytical methods are twofold. First, high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed electrochemical detector (HPAEC-PED) (27Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,28Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) method accomplishes a highly efficient separation of underivatized oligo/polySia chains with DP ranging from 2 to as high as 80. Second, high performance liquid chromatography on a MonoQ column with fluorometric detection (HPLC-FD) method (28Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is a highly sensitive and selective method to measure fluorescence-tagged oligo/polySia residues (DP up to about 30). In the present study, these methods were used in tandem with an improved method for isolating and purifying polySia glycopeptides from chicken brain, so that stage-dependent changes in the DP and level of polySia expressed in embryonic and adult chicken brains can be determined. We thus can conclude that the DP narrowly ranges between 40 and 50 Sia residues (average DP = ∼45) in embryonic chicken brain. Surprisingly, both the DP range and the average DP values showed little variation during developmental stages, E5 to E21. On the other hand, the total amount of polySia expressed per brain exhibited large differences, with maximum expression around E14, as reported previously (18Sevigny M.B. Ye J. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One of the most unexpected findings was that no glycopeptides bearing short (5 to ∼30) polySia chains were isolated from embryonic chicken brains, although diSia residues were present in a fraction separated from polySia glycopeptides. Thus, polysialylation profile in the embryonic brain was in sharp contrast to that of the adult chicken brain, which showed polySia glycopeptides with polydispersity ranging from DP ∼15 to 35. In addition, we also isolated glycopeptide fractions expressing the α2,8-linked diSia glycotope and proportionally lower levels of triSia and tetraSia residues in adult brain. Fertilized eggs were purchased from Taiwan Animal Health Research Institute and incubated at 38 °C under humidified conditions. Lyophilized homogenates of the brain prepared from chicken embryo at early developmental stages were prepared at University of California, Davis (18Sevigny M.B. Ye J. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Adult brains were purchased at the local market at Taipei soon after chicken (3 months old) were sacrificed. Brain tissues were stored at −30 °C or −80 °C for less than 1 month before further processing. Brains were homogenized at 4 °C by either of the following methods: (i) with a 2-ml Kontes glass homogenizer in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.1) containing 500 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride: (ii) with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). No detectable difference was found between these two methods. Homogenates (fresh or after lyophilization) were delipidated with chloroform-methanol as described previously (20Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The delipidated material was air-dried and exhaustively digested with bacterial protease, Streptomyces griseus proteinase (type XIV, Sigma) as described previously (20Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After digestion, an equal volume of cold acetone was added and the mixture was kept at −20 °C overnight, and precipitate (50% acetone precipitate) that contained high molecular weight compounds) was separated by centrifugation. Small glycopeptides remaining in the supernatant were precipitated by adding one more volume of acetone (75% acetone precipitate). Both the 50% and 75% acetone precipitates were subjected to size fractionation on Sephacryl S-200 columns (1.6 × 134 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. The elution was monitored by A230 nm and by determination of Neu5Ac using the fluorometric HPLC method, after hydrolysis in 0.1 n HCl for 2 h at 80 °C. Sialoglycopeptides in the 50% acetone precipitate were separated into fractions H (tube numbers 38–48, Mr100,000–20,000), and l (tube numbers 52–70,Mr 12,000–3,000). Sialoglycopetides in the 75% acetone precipitate were eluted at a position similar to thel fraction. All fractions were dialyzed against MilliQ water in the cold and lyophilized. Purification and further fractionation of the sialoglycopeptides were carried out on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and eluted with a 0–0.7 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 2 ml/min. Neu5Ac-containing fractions (monitored by the 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) method after hydrolysis) were pooled and desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column. Free Neu5Ac was quantitated by the fluorometric HPLC method after derivatization for 2.5 h at 55 °C with DMB (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) as described previously (30Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 2.7 mDMB, 9 mm sodium hydrosulfite, 0.5 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02 m trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were hydrolyzed in 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid for the time required to obtain the maximum yield of free Neu5Ac, usually 4 h for polySia, and 1 h for diSia, and evaporated under vacuum to remove the acid. To monitor the elution profile of Neu5Ac-containing material after column chromatography, samples were hydrolyzed in 0.1 n HCl for 2 h at 80 °C. For oligo/polySia analysis by the HPLC-FD method, samples (100–500 ng of total Neu5Ac) were derivatized with the DMB reagent for 2 h at 50 °C without pre-hydrolysis, and the reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 m NaOH before injection. A Hewlett-Packard HPLC system series 1100 with a fluorescence detector 1046 (set at 373 nm for excitation and 448 nm for emission) was used with a MonoQ HR 5/5 column. Samples were eluted with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing a 0–0.7 m NaCl gradient, at 0.5 ml/min. Analysis of polySia by HPAEC with pulsed electrochemical detector (PED) was as described previously (28Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To improve the yield of higher polymers, lyophilized samples (12 μg of Neu5Ac) were first treated with 10 μl of 1 m HCl at ambient temperature for 2 h to facilitate lactonization of polySia (32Zang Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), dried on a centrifugal vacuum evaporator, and then subjected to controlled hydrolysis in 100 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid for 15 min at 60 °C. To the hydrolysate, 50 μl of 0.5 m NaOH was added and a 100-μl portion (8 μg of Neu5Ac) was injected into a CarboPac PA-100 column. A DX ion chromatography system (Dionex, Sunnyvale CA) with an ED-40 electrochemical detector was operated under conditions as described previously (28Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography analysis after methanolysis and trimethylsilylation (33Chaplin M.F. Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 27-34Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-17A. Amino acid analysis was carried out after hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 105 °C for 20 h under N2 and precolumn derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate (34Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) A Pico-Tag amino acid analysis system (Waters) was used. α2,8-Linked dimer and tetramer of Neu5Ac were obtained from Nihon Gaishi (Handa, Japan). Higher oligomers and polymers of Neu5Ac were prepared from colominic acid purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) by controlled hydrolysis and ion-exchange chromatographic separation on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (35Nomoto H.

A freshly dissolved sample of colominic acid in water was subjected to fractionation on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column using an NaCl gradient (0–0.7 m) in 0.01m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). A series of resolved peaks that were identified as DP 2 to DP 32 were eluted under conditions used: 0.3 m NaCl (20 min) to 0.5 mNaCl (80 min), at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. A major broad peak that eluted after the DP 32 peak was used as a high molecular weight colominic acid sample throughout this study. A published method (20Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was modified to minimize hydrolytic cleavage of polySia chains that often occurs during prolonged treatments such as solubilization of polySia-containing glycopeptides from the precipitate with quaternary pyridinium ion (21Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and concentration of the compounds from dilute solutions. As it is imperative to keep polySia chains intact and to accurately quantify the polySia, we exhaustively digested membrane-associated polySia-containing glycopeptides from delipidated homogenates of intact whole chicken brains with nonspecific bacterial protease to bring about solubilization. During proteolysis (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), chemical and enzymatic cleavage of sialyl linkages was negligible, as no significant amounts of free Sia or free oligo/polySia chains were detected in any step of purification. Addition of equal volume of acetone to the material solubilized by proteolysis effectively precipitated all polySia-containing glycopeptides, which were readily re-solubilized in the small volume of buffer used in the next step. The polySia glycopeptides in the 50% acetone-precipitated fraction at each developmental stage was fractionated by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. The chromatographic profile (monitored for total Neu5Ac content) revealed two peaks H (high Mr) and L (low Mr) (Fig.1). The column was calibrated using sialoglycoproteins of known Mr isolated from fish eggs (36Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5256-5261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and S. Inoue, unpublished results). The peak H (Mr range 100,000–20,000, peak 45,000) increased during the early stages of development and reached a maximum value around day E14 after fertilization (designated E14) and then gradually decreased. This finding confirms the previous findings based on a polySia antibody (18Sevigny M.B. Ye J. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The H fraction from adult chicken brain eluted in a lower molecular weight range than that of embryonic H fractions (range 72,000–15,000, peak 27,000). Oligo/polySia analysis by the HPLC-FD method of H and L fractions showed that polySia was present only in the H fraction. In L fractions and the fraction soluble in 50% acetone, diSia residues were present at all developmental stages, although the major portion of Neu5Ac occurred as monoSia residue. It is noted that the colominic acid sample was eluted in a more polydisperse peak than the H fractions, with Mr values ranging from 72,000 down to 5,000, with a peak at 15,000. The HPLC-FD method is a sensitive and selective method (28Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and was used in this study. Under the conditions required for derivatization with the DMB reagent, some polySia underwent partial hydrolysis to result in the characteristic elution ladders of (Sia) n (n = 1 − n) useful in detection and identification of oligo/polySia. After such treatment, an authentic higher oligomers of Neu5Ac showed a parent peak, which is always of higher yield than the rest of the oligomer peaks produced during derivatization (Fig. 2, a–c). Thus, the peak of the highest DP can be regarded as the maximum size of the polySia chain under study. In contrast, for polydisperse materials like colominic acid, no distinct highest peak was yielded, but a range of peaks up to DP ∼ 25 was shown (Fig. 2 d). Several other conditions of acid and temperature for derivatization examined did not improve the yield of highest DP peak. When colominic acid was treated under similar conditions (0.02m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 50 °C), oligo/polymers of Neu5Ac up to DP 40 were detected by HPAEC-PED. In the chromatographic separation on a MonoQ column (similar to HPLC-FD method) for underivatized polySia, resolution of peaks in the region of DP 30–40 could be improved by changing salt gradient. However, for DMB-polySia, no such improvement has so far been achieved. Thus, the HPLC-FD method cannot be used for the determination of DP values >30. The DP of the Sia chains in the H and L fractions from embryonic and adult chicken brains was determined by HPLC-FD method. First, sialoglycopeptides (containing 300–700 ng of total Neu5Ac) isolated from H fraction after Sephacryl S-200 chromatography (Fig. 1) were treated with the DMB reagent and analyzed on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column. Fig. 3 shows a representative profile for samples obtained at three stages of development: E5, E14, and adult. Profiles nearly identical to that shown for E14 (panel b) were observed for E8, E12, E16, E18, and E21. These profiles, when compared with that of colominic acid (Fig. 2 d), indicate that polySia chains in the samples from these developmental stages are large in DP. The results indicate that polySia chains were also present in as early a developmental stage as E5 (panel a), and in the adult (panel c). It is noted, however, that the proportion of monoSia with respect to the higher DPs was large in the E5 and adult samples. In contrast to H fraction, no polySia chains were detected in L fraction when examined by the same HPLC-FD technique. Rather, this fraction contained a small amount of diSia, which as described below, was present in larger amount in the soluble fraction of the 50% acetone fractionation. To obtain information on the DP range of the polySia chains, the H and L fractions from each developmental stage were subjected to HPLC on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column, pre-equilibrated with 0.01 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Essentially all sialoglycopeptides in the H fractions obtained from E5 to E21 were eluted in a peak at 0.45–0.55 m NaCl (Fig.4). This elution position was slightly delayed in comparison to that of colominic acid, which eluted at 0.4–0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 4). It is noted that in samples obtained from late (>E18) stages, a small proportion of sialyl compounds eluted earlier than the major peak (e.g. Q2 for E21). In contrast, sialoglycopeptides isolated from adult brain showed a different elution profile (Fig. 4). In addition to peak Q1, which eluted slightly before the embryonic Q1 material, a larger portion of the adult derived sialoglycopeptides eluted over a broad region under partially separated multiple peaks (Q2–Q4). The DP analysis of these peaks by HPLC-FD showed that Q1 and Q2 contained polySia as expected from the elution position (Fig. 3 c). The Q3 and Q4 fractions, eluted at lower NaCl concentration, also contained polySia but with DPs of 15–20 (Fig. 5), significantly shorter than the chains derived from embryonic polySia. When the L fractions were fractionated on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column, the major proportion of Neu5Ac-containing molecules eluted with NaCl at less than 0.2 m, and much smaller proportions (depending on the developmental stage) eluted at NaCl concentration between 0.3 and 0.55 m. Interestingly, those fractions eluted at the lower NaCl concentrations contained only monoSia residues, as expected, whereas the fractions that eluted at the higher NaCl concentrations contained significant levels of diSia (Fig.6).

https://openalex.org/W1994049526,"Recently, the oncoprotein MDM-2 was implicated in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) growth inhibitory pathway by the finding that prolonged, constitutive expression of MDM-2 in mink lung epithelial cells could overcome the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β (Sun, P., Dong, P., Dai, K., Hannon, G. J., and Beach, D. (1998) Science 282, 2270–2272). However, using Mv1Lu cells conditionally expressing MDM-2, we found that MDM-2 does not overcome TGF-β-mediated growth arrest. No detectable changes were observed in various TGF-β responses, including cell cycle arrest, activation of transcriptional reporters, and TGF-β-dependent Smad2/3 nuclear accumulation. This finding was in direct contrast to the effect of forcing c-Myc expression, a bona fide member of the TGF-β growth inhibitory pathway, which renders cells refractory to TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that an MDM-2-dependent increase in cell cycle progression may allow the acquisition of additional mutations over time and that these alterations then allow cells to evade a TGF-β-mediated growth arrest. Our conclusion is that, whereas c-Myc down-regulation by TGF-β is a required event in the cell cycle arrest response of epithelial cells, MDM-2 is not a direct participant in the normal TGF-β antiproliferative response."

Although current macromolecular crystallization methods have been derived empirically and are generally case-specific in nature, some general guidelines, such as the significance of a pure and homogeneous sample, have emerged. One such principle regards the importance of sample stabilization during the process of crystal formation. Macromolecules exhibiting significant internal relative motion can fail to crystallize alone. Likewise, random self-aggregation poses an impediment to crystal formation. In such cases, either the removal of flexible regions or the addition of ligands can stabilize the dynamic macromolecule and promote crystal formation.NF-κB is an inducible, dimeric transcription factor involved in coordinating the cellular response to infection and stress (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar). In its resting state, NF-κB exists in a stable cytoplasmic complex with a member of the IκB family of transcription factor inhibitor proteins. Bacterial and viral products, inflammatory cytokines, and a host of other activation signals lead to removal of the complex-associated IκB molecule from the NF-κB·IκB complex, rendering the transcription factor constitutively nuclear and leading to enhanced expression of NF-κB-responsive genes (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar).The primary active form of NF-κB in immune cells is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits (Fig.1 a). Both subunits contain the approximately 300 amino acid rel homology region (RHR).1 All of the amino acid residues necessary for subunit dimerization, sequence-specific DNA binding, nuclear localization, and IκB binding are contained within the RHR (4Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several DNA-bound NF-κB homo- and heterodimers indicate that the RHR consists of two immunoglobin-like domains connected by a short linker (5Ghosh G. Van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 6Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although both domains contact DNA, intersubunit dimer-forming contacts are mediated exclusively through the carboxyl-terminal immunoglobin-like domain, which we consequently refer to as the dimerization domain. Carboxyl-terminal to the dimerization domain lies a non-conserved sequence of 30 amino acids containing a basic type I nuclear localization sequence (NLS). This region, which we denote the NLS polypeptide, does not exhibit an ordered structure in the NF-κB/DNA x-ray crystal structures.The principal players involved in the inhibition of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer transcriptional activity (10Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) are the IκB proteins, IκBα and IκBβ (Fig. 1 b). Although related by primary sequence, IκBα and IκBβ exhibit striking structural and functional differences (11Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 12Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of these transcription factor inhibitor proteins reveals three distinct regions. A centrally located ankyrin repeat-containing domain (ARD) (13Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) is flanked by an amino-terminal signal response domain and an acidic carboxyl-terminal PEST-like region (PEST).The inherent flexibility and modular arrangement of the NF-κB RHR and the propensity for IκB proteins to aggregate hinder their crystallization. We proposed that formation of the NF-κB·IκB complex might sufficiently stabilize these factors and improve the probability for formation of crystals. Here, we report the rationale behind the design of targets for co-crystallization of the transcription factor NF-κB with each of two IκB inhibitor proteins. The proposed targets were based on observations derived from the crystal structures of NF-κB·DNA complexes and from characterization of the NF-κB·IκB interaction by a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. We present the recombinant expression and purification of the individual protein complex components. We detail complex formation procedures. Finally, we report crystallization conditions and initial crystallographic characterization of NF-κB·IκBα and NF-κB·IκBβ complex co-crystals.DISCUSSIONThe preparation of single, well-diffracting protein crystals remains the principle impediment to any protein structure analysis by x-ray crystallography. Advances in molecular cloning technologies make it possible for structural biologists to overexpress isolated domains of target proteins. These independent modules often crystallize readily when the native, full-length protein will not. With the soluble protein domain in hand, commercially available sparse matrix screens provide the means for the efficient evaluation of many different crystal growth conditions. Many hundreds of protein crystals have been prepared for x-ray diffraction analysis through the application of such techniques (25McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar).Crystallization of polypeptides containing two or more independent domains or their complexes is seldom so simple. Size of the multidomain protein or complex alone is not a limitation to its ability of crystallize. Whole viral particles (26Grimes J.M. Burroughs J.N. Gouet P. Diprose J.M. Malby R. Zientara S.

Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), and ribosomal subunits (30Clemons Jr., W.M. May J.L. Wimberly B.T. McCutcheon J.P. Capel M.S. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 1999; 400: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) all readily crystallize. More often it is the physical properties of the subject, such as shape, surface charge distribution, flexibility, and interdomain dynamics that impede its crystallization. In these cases, a knowledge of the biochemistry and biophysical character of the system can be extremely helpful. Such an understanding often suggests logical modifications in the protein complex or multidomain polypeptide, which render it a better candidate for crystallization.This principle is illustrated by the crystallographic structure determination of two Src-family protein-tyrosine kinases (32Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 33Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that many crystal structures of independent protein-tyrosine kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains had each been determined separately, crystallization of the three domains covalently linked as one polypeptide eluded researchers for many years. A kinase engineered with a single phosphorylated tyrosine and the amino-terminal membrane-localization sequence removed eventually crystallized. These modifications apparently promote crystallization by forcing the protein to adopt a closed conformation that minimizes interdomain dynamics. In a similar manner, polysaccharide removal and the addition of stabilizing ligands were required for co-crystallization of the inherently flexible human immunodeficiency virus gp120 envelope protein with a CD4 fragment and monoclonal antibody Fab specific for the gp120 chemokine receptor site (34Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar, 35Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Desjardins E. Robinson J. Culp J.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Here, we have demonstrated that crystallization of two NF-κB·IκB complexes required that we first select the appropriate protein fragments in each protein-protein complex. In the case of NF-κB·IκBα protein complex crystallization, removal of the p50 amino-terminal domain and the IκBα signal response domain proved to be critical for crystal growth. In contrast, only the NF-κB·IκBβ complex containing five glutamates within the carboxyl-terminal PEST region and removal of the signal response domain of IκBβ coupled with removal of the amino-terminal domains of p65 homodimer yielded crystals.In retrospect, it is interesting to note that the amino-terminal domain of the NF-κB p65 subunit and the PEST of IκBα participate in a dynamic interaction. This hypothesis was inferred by comparison of the NF-κB·IκBα and NF-κB·DNA complex crystal structures and is supported by subsequent oxidative cross-linking studies (36Phelps C. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We suppose that this dynamic and the presence of multiple charged amino acids within this region partially account for the difficulties in obtaining NF-κB·IκB complex crystals. In the case of NF-κB·IκBα, for example, changes in buffer pH of less than 0.1 unit resulted in significant crystal formation defects.Nevertheless, we conclude that the most important parameter in crystallizing these protein-protein complexes was the selection of appropriate protein fragments in which high affinity interactions were maximized and non-interacting, flexible portions were removed or stabilized. This point is further corroborated by the fact that although two independent laboratories succeeded in growing the NF-κB·IκBα complex crystals in different space groups and under different crystallization conditions, both crystals contained similarly modified NF-κB and IκBα protein fragments (22Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 23Huxford T. Huang D.-B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Crystals of two nearly identical NF-κB·IκBβ complexes were obtained only after extensive screening of 10 closely related complexes. Analysis of macromolecules and their complexes by x-ray crystallography requires the preparation of single, well-diffracting crystals. Although current macromolecular crystallization methods have been derived empirically and are generally case-specific in nature, some general guidelines, such as the significance of a pure and homogeneous sample, have emerged.

More often it is the physical properties of the subject, such as shape, surface charge distribution, flexibility, and interdomain dynamics that impede its crystallization. In these cases, a knowledge of the biochemistry and biophysical character of the system can be extremely helpful. Such an understanding often suggests logical modifications in the protein complex or multidomain polypeptide, which render it a better candidate for crystallization.This principle is illustrated by the crystallographic structure determination of two Src-family protein-tyrosine kinases (32Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 33Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that many crystal structures of independent protein-tyrosine kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains had each been determined separately, crystallization of the three domains covalently linked as one polypeptide eluded researchers for many years. A kinase engineered with a single phosphorylated tyrosine and the amino-terminal membrane-localization sequence removed eventually crystallized. These modifications apparently promote crystallization by forcing the protein to adopt a closed conformation that minimizes interdomain dynamics. In a similar manner, polysaccharide removal and the addition of stabilizing ligands were required for co-crystallization of the inherently flexible human immunodeficiency virus gp120 envelope protein with a CD4 fragment and monoclonal antibody Fab specific for the gp120 chemokine receptor site (34Kwong P.D.

In the case of NF-κB·IκBα protein complex crystallization, removal of the p50 amino-terminal domain and the IκBα signal response domain proved to be critical for crystal growth. In contrast, only the NF-κB·IκBβ complex containing five glutamates within the carboxyl-terminal PEST region and removal of the signal response domain of IκBβ coupled with removal of the amino-terminal domains of p65 homodimer yielded crystals.In retrospect, it is interesting to note that the amino-terminal domain of the NF-κB p65 subunit and the PEST of IκBα participate in a dynamic interaction. This hypothesis was inferred by comparison of the NF-κB·IκBα and NF-κB·DNA complex crystal structures and is supported by subsequent oxidative cross-linking studies (36Phelps C. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We suppose that this dynamic and the presence of multiple charged amino acids within this region partially account for the difficulties in obtaining NF-κB·IκB complex crystals. In the case of NF-κB·IκBα, for example, changes in buffer pH of less than 0.1 unit resulted in significant crystal formation defects.Nevertheless, we conclude that the most important parameter in crystallizing these protein-protein complexes was the selection of appropriate protein fragments in which high affinity interactions were maximized and non-interacting, flexible portions were removed or stabilized. This point is further corroborated by the fact that although two independent laboratories succeeded in growing the NF-κB·IκBα complex crystals in different space groups and under different crystallization conditions, both crystals contained similarly modified NF-κB and IκBα protein fragments (22Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 23Huxford T. Huang D.-B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Crystals of two nearly identical NF-κB·IκBβ complexes were obtained only after extensive screening of 10 closely related complexes. The preparation of single, well-diffracting protein crystals remains the principle impediment to any protein structure analysis by x-ray crystallography. Advances in molecular cloning technologies make it possible for structural biologists to overexpress isolated domains of target proteins. These independent modules often crystallize readily when the native, full-length protein will not. With the soluble protein domain in hand, commercially available sparse matrix screens provide the means for the efficient evaluation of many different crystal growth conditions. Many hundreds of protein crystals have been prepared for x-ray diffraction analysis through the application of such techniques (25McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Crystallization of polypeptides containing two or more independent domains or their complexes is seldom so simple. Size of the multidomain protein or complex alone is not a limitation to its ability of crystallize. Whole viral particles (26Grimes J.M. Burroughs J.N. Gouet P. Diprose J.M. Malby R. Zientara S.

https://openalex.org/W2169479452,"Using high pressure flash photolysis, we revealed that the side chain of Leu29 controls the reaction volume of the ligand migration process in myoglobin, which is the primary factor for the unusual activation volume of ligand binding in some Leu29 mutants. As we previously reported (Adachi, S., Sunohara, N., Ishimori, K., and Morishima, I. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12614–12621), CO bimolecular rebinding in the L29A mutant was unexpectedly decelerated by pressurization, suggesting that the rate-determining step is switched to ligand migration. However, very slow CO bimolecular rebinding of the mutants implies that bond formation is still the rate-determining step. To gain further insights into effects of the side chain on ligand binding, we prepared some new Leu29 mutants to measure the CO and O2rebinding reaction rates under high hydrostatic pressure. CO bimolecular rebinding in the mutants bearing Gly or Ser at position 29 was also decelerated upon pressurization, resulting in apparent positive activation volumes (ΔV ‡), as observed for O2 binding. Based on the three-state model, we concluded that the increased space available to ligands in these mutants enhances the volume difference between the geminate and deoxy states (ΔV32), which shifts the apparent activation volume to the positive side, and that the apparent positive activation volume is not due to contribution of the ligand migration process to the rate-determining step."
