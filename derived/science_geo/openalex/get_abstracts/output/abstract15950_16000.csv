https://openalex.org/W1489654012,"High efficiency transient transfection was used to introduce cDNA corresponding to various G protein alpha subunits into Cos-7 cells. The proteins that were subsequently synthesized were detected with specific G protein alpha subunit antipeptide antiserum and were localized in the membrane fraction of the cell. Cells that were prelabeled with the [3H]inositol and transfected with G alpha q and G alpha 11 cDNA showed marked increases in formation of [3H]inositol phosphates after stimulation with aluminum fluoride. Co-transfection with cDNAs corresponding to phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C beta 1 (PI-PLC beta 1) and to G alpha q or G alpha 11 resulted in even higher levels of inositol phosphate formation. The introduction of mutations that convert residue glutamine 209 to leucine in G alpha q and G alpha 11 resulted in persistent activation of PI-PLC and high steady state levels of inositol phosphates. On the other hand, transfection with a variety of other G alpha subunit cDNAs, i.e. G alpha Z, G alpha OA, G alpha OB, transducin, and the glutamine 205 to leucine mutants of G alpha Z and of G alpha OA did not increase inositol phosphate formation. To further test the specificity of G protein activation of PI-PLC, a cell-free system was prepared by using washed membranes of transiently transfected cells and purified PI-PLC beta 1. Membranes derived from G alpha q and G alpha 11, but not G alpha OA transfected cells, showed guanosine 5-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S)-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis. The activity seen in the system reconstituted with membranes derived from G alpha 11-transfected cells was blocked by preincubation with specific G alpha 11 antipeptide antibodies. All of these results are consistent with the conclusion that G alpha q and G alpha 11 cDNA encode proteins that in the presence of GTP gamma S specifically activate PI-PLC."
https://openalex.org/W1538827891,"A truncated form of the type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1) lacking most of its cytoplasmic domain was tested for its ability to inhibit signal transduction by each of three different wild-type FGFRs (FGFR1, 2, and 3). When the truncated FGFR1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes in excess of each wild-type FGFR, mobilization of intracellular calcium mediated by the wild-type FGFRs was completely blocked. The truncated FGFR did not inhibit signal transduction by the co-expressed platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor. A form of truncated FGFR1 which lacked the first immunoglobulin-like domain also inhibited signal transduction by wild-type FGFRs. Truncated FGFR formed complexes with wild-type FGFR in the presence of basic FGF in intact cells. These observations were consistent with the hypothesis that the truncated FGFR interacted with wild-type FGFRs to form nonfunctional heterodimers, thus eliminating the signaling by the wild-type FGFRs. The observation that signaling by multiple types of FGFR can be blocked by a single type of truncated FGFR suggests that the different types of FGFR can interact with each other in ligand-mediated complexes. These findings provide a molecular basis for inhibiting the actions of FGFs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W110557356,"Elevation of either cAMP or cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation. Whether these effects are mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), or both is unknown. Pig coronary arteries were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), relaxants which elevate cGMP, and with isoproterenol or forskolin, relaxants which elevate cAMP. Incubation of the arteries with 10 microM SNP produced a 3.3-fold increase in cGMP without altering cAMP; the cGK activity ratio (-cGMP/+cGMP) in these extracts was increased by 2.6-fold as determined by a newly developed assay, while the cAK activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) was unchanged. The increase in cGK activity ratio by SNP was concentration-dependent and was nearly maximal at 30 s. Treatment of the tissue with 10 nM ANF also increased the cGK activity ratio (2.3-fold), but not that of cAK. 100 microM isoproterenol caused a 2.9-fold elevation of cAMP with no change in cGMP, but both cAK and cGK activity ratios were increased (2.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively). The increase in the cGK activity ratio could be mimicked by cAMP addition to control tissue extracts at the concentration measured in extracts of the isoproterenol-treated tissue. Forskolin (1 and 10 microM) also increased the cGK activity ratio (1.9- and 4.9-fold). The increases in cGK activity observed in extracts suggest that moderate elevation of either cGMP or cAMP causes intracellular cGK activation, thus producing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1576457008,"Abstract A number of phototransducing proteins in vertebrate photoreceptors contain a carboxyl terminal -CXXX motif (where C = cysteine and X = any amino acid), known to be a signal sequence for their post-translational prenylation and carboxyl methylation. To study the roles of these modifications in the visual excitation process, we have utilized an intravitreal injection method to radiolabel the prenylated proteins of rat retinas in vivo. We showed that two of the major prenylated polypeptides in the rod outer segments are the PDE alpha and PDE beta subunits of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase PDE alpha and PDE beta subunits of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). By chromatographic analyses of the amino acid constituents generated by exhaustive proteolysis of PDE alpha and PDE beta, we further demonstrated that they are differentially prenylated by farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, respectively. While a number of proteins ending with the -CXXX sequence have already been reported to possess either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl group, PDE is the first enzyme shown to be modified by both types of prenyl groups. The prenyl modification of PDE most likely plays a major role in membrane attachment and in correctly positioning the PDE molecule for phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1605892702,"The intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is required for signal transduction. Increased protein-tyrosine kinase activity is observed following the binding of EGF to the receptor. However, signaling is rapidly desensitized during EGF treatment. We report that EGF receptors isolated from desensitized cells exhibit a lower protein-tyrosine kinase activity than EGF receptors isolated from control cells. The mechanism of desensitization of kinase activity can be accounted for, in part, by the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor at Ser1046/7, a substrate for the multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in vitro. Mutation of Ser1046/7 by replacement with Ala residues blocks desensitization of the EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, this mutation causes a marked inhibition of the EGF-stimulated endocytosis and down-regulation of cell surface receptors. Thus, the phosphorylation site Ser1046/7 is required for EGF receptor desensitization in EGF-treated cells. This regulatory phosphorylation site is located at the carboxyl terminus of the EGF receptor within the subdomain that binds src homology 2 regions of signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1563487756,"This paper extends our recent report that renal Na+,K(+)-ATPase is digested by trypsin in the absence of Ca2+ and presence of Rb+ ions to a stable fragment and smaller membrane-embedded fragments of the alpha chain and essentially intact beta chain. These are referred to as 19-kDa membranes. Occlusion of both Rb+ (K+) or Na+ ions is preserved, but ATP-dependent functions are lost (Karlish, S. J. D., Goldshleger, R., and Stein, W. D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 4566-4570). We now show that extensive digestion with nonselective fungal proteases (Pronase and proteinase K) alone, in combination, or after tryptic digestion can remove up to 70% of membrane protein without destroying Rb+ occlusion. In the most heavily digested membranes, the fragment or a slightly shorter 18.5-kDa fragment and smaller fragments of the alpha chain remain, whereas the beta chain is largely digested, leaving smaller membrane-embedded fragments (13-15 kDa). For either trypsin or Pronase digestion, preservation of Rb+ occlusion and the specific fragmentation pattern is observed only in the absence of divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Ca2+) and presence of either Rb+ or Na+ or congener ions. Tryptic digestion at pH 7.0 can split the beta chain into two fragments of approximately 50 and 16 kDa joined by an S-S bridge. The 16-kDa fragment is protected against further digestion by the presence of Rb+ ions, but probably is not directly involved in occluding cations. Tryptic membranes show a clear and reproducible fragmentation pattern in which all predicted membrane segments are identifiable. Families of fragments from membranes, including seven peptides of 7.6-11.7 kDa, have been separated by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, concentrated, and resolved on 16.5% Tricine gels. N-terminal sequences of the different fragments have been determined after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. The most interesting findings are as follows. (a) Whereas the tryptic fragment begins at Asn831 as reported previously, the 18.5-kDa Pronase fragment begins at Thr834. (b) Fragments in tryptic membranes of 7.6-11.7 kDa begin at Asp68, Ile263, and Gln737, respectively. These include all putative transmembrane segments other than those in the fragment. (c) A Pronase fragment of 7.8 kDa begins at Thr834, i.e. apparently the fragment has been partially cut, without loss of Rb+ occlusion. (d) Tryptic 16- and approximately 50-kDa fragments of the beta chain begin at Ala5 and Gly143, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1552131244,"Abstract In the ubiquitin (Ub) pathway, proteins are ligated with polyUb chains and then are degraded by a 26 S protease complex. We describe an enzyme, called isopeptidase T, that acts on polyUb chains. It is a monomeric Ub-binding protein abundant in erythrocytes and reticulocytes. The activity of the isopeptidase is inhibited by iodoacetamide and Ub aldehyde. Treatment of the enzyme with Ub aldehyde increased its affinity for free Ub, indicating the existence of two different Ub-binding sites and cooperativity between the two sites. Isopeptidase T acts on polyUb-protein conjugates, but not on conjugates in which the formation of polyUb chains was prevented by the use of reductively methylated Ub or on abnormal polyUb chains formed with a mutant Ub that contains a Lys----Arg substitution at residue 48. The enzyme converts high molecular mass polyUb-protein conjugates to lower molecular mass forms with the release of free Ub, but not of free protein substrate. The lower molecular mass Ub-protein conjugate products are resistant to further action of the enzyme. Isopeptidase T stimulates protein degradation in a system reconstituted from purified enzyme components. The enzyme also stimulates the degradation of proteins ligated to polyUb chains by the 26 S protease complex. Preincubation of polyUb-protein conjugates with the isopeptidase did not much increase their susceptibility to proteolysis by the 26 S complex. On the other hand, preincubation of conjugates with the 26 S protease complex and ATP increased the release of free Ub upon further incubation with the isopeptidase. It thus seems that a role of this isopeptidase in protein breakdown is to remove polyUb chain remnants following the degradation of the protein substrate moiety by the 26 S complex."
https://openalex.org/W1554485696,"Abstract We have studied the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) in insulin-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing normal (CHO/IR) and mutant human insulin receptors. Insulin stimulation of CHO/IR cells results in an increase in PtdIns 3-kinase activity associated with anti-phosphotyrosine (alpha PY) immunoprecipitates, which has been previously shown to correlate with the in vivo production of PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Ruderman, N., Kapeller, R., White, M.F., and Cantley, L.C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1411-1415). Stimulation was maximal within 1 min and showed a dose response identical to that of insulin receptor autophosphorylation. The PtdIns 3-kinase also associated with the insulin receptor in an insulin-stimulated manner, as approximately 50% of the total alpha PY-precipitable activity could be specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody. Mutant insulin receptors displayed variable ability to stimulate the PtdIns 3-kinase, but in all cases the presence of PtdIns 3-kinase in alpha PY immunoprecipitates correlated closely with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate pp185. In CHO cells expressing a kinase-deficient mutant (IRA1018), there was no observable insulin stimulation of PtdIns 3-kinase activity in alpha PY immunoprecipitates and no tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp185. Substitution of Tyr1146 in the insulin receptor regulatory region with phenylalanine partially impaired receptor autophosphorylation, pp185 phosphorylation, and insulin-stimulated increases in alpha PY-precipitable PtdIns 3-kinase activity. In contrast, a deletion mutant lacking 12 amino acids from the juxtamembrane region (IR delta 960) displayed normal in vivo autophosphorylation but failed to stimulate the PtdIns 3-kinase or phosphorylate pp185. Finally, a mutant receptor from which the C-terminal 43 amino acids had been deleted (IR delta CT) exhibited normal insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, pp185 phosphorylation, and stimulation of the PtdIns 3-kinase activity in alpha PY immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that the PtdIns 3-kinase is itself a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase or associates preferentially with a substrate. A comparison of the biological activities of the mutant receptors with their activation of the PtdIns 3-kinase furthermore suggests that the PtdIns 3-kinase may be linked to insulin's ability to regulate DNA synthesis and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2151212631,"We have constructed a variety of chimeric beta 2/alpha 1 adrenergic receptors (AR) in which selected portions of the third intracellular loop of the alpha (1B)AR were substituted into the corresponding regions of the beta 2AR. The mutant receptors were both transiently and permanently expressed in COS-7 or L-cells, respectively, and tested for their ability to mediate epinephrine-induced activation of polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and adenylylcyclase. We have determined that 27 amino acids of the alpha (1B)AR (residues 233-259) derived from the N-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop represent the structural determinant conferring to the beta 2AR the ability to activate PI hydrolysis. This finding suggests that in the alpha (1B)AR the N-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop plays a major role in determining the selectivity of receptor-G protein coupling. However, replacement of alpha 1B sequences in the third intracellular loop of the beta 2AR did not abolish the latter receptor's coupling to activation of adenylylcyclase, thus resulting in chimeric adrenergic receptors which activated both PI hydrolysis and adenylylcyclase. These results indicate that, even if the N-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop is a major determinant of the selectivity of receptor-G protein coupling, other structural domains of the receptors also modulate this property. The comparison of the amino acid sequences which determine the selectivity of G protein coupling in functionally similar receptors may help to elucidate the structural basis for activation of specific G protein-effector systems."
https://openalex.org/W1510098440,"Studies by various investigators have demonstrated that the low Km, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE IV) is selectively inhibited by a group of compounds typified by rolipram and Ro 20-1724. In addition to inhibiting the catalytic activity of PDE IV, rolipram binds to a high affinity binding site present in brain homogenates. Although it has been assumed that the high affinity rolipram-binding site is PDE IV, no direct evidence has been produced to support this assumption. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the rolipram-binding site is coexpressed with PDE IV catalytic activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetically engineered to express human recombinant monocytic PDE IV (hPDE IV). Expressing hPDE IV cDNA in yeast resulted in a 20-fold increase in PDE activity that was evident within 1 h of induction and reached a maximum by 3-6 h. The recombinant protein represented hPDE IV as judged by its immunoreactivity, molecular mass (approximately 88 kDa), kinetic characteristics (cAMP Km = 3.1 microM; cGMP Km greater than 100 microM), sensitivity to rolipram (Ki = 0.06 microM), and insensitivity to siguazodan (PDE III inhibitor) and zaprinast (PDE V inhibitor). Saturable, high affinity [3H] (R)-rolipram-binding sites (Kd = 1.0 nM) were coexpressed with PDE activity, indicating that both binding activity and catalytic activity are properties of the same protein. A limited number of compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit hPDE IV catalytic activity and compete for [3H](R)-rolipram binding. Analysis of the data revealed little correlation (r2 = 0.35) in the structure-activity relationships for hPDE IV inhibition versus competition for [3H] (R)-rolipram binding. In fact, certain compounds (e.g. (R)-rolipram Ro 20-1724) possessed a 10-100-fold selectivity for inhibition of [3H] (R)-rolipram binding over hPDE IV inhibition, whereas others (e.g. dipyridamole, trequinsin) possessed a 10-fold selectivity for PDE inhibition. Thus, although the results of these studies demonstrate that hPDE IV activity and high affinity [3H](R)-rolipram binding are properties of the same protein, they do not provide clear cut evidence linking the binding site with the PDE inhibitory activity of rolipram and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1651058823,"A brain-specific multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, which exhibited characteristic properties quite different from those of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, was purified approximately 230-fold from rat cerebellum. The purified preparation gave two protein bands with molecular weights of 63,000 (alpha) and 66,000 (beta) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both of which showed protein kinase activity as examined by the activity gel method. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated as about 67,000 from sedimentation coefficient (3.2 S) and Stokes radius (50 A), indicating a monomeric structure of the enzyme. The enzyme phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin light chain, synapsin I, microtubule-associated protein 2, tau protein, myelin basic protein, histone H1, and tyrosine hydroxylase in a Ca2+/calmodulin dependent manner, suggesting that the enzyme is a multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating a large number of substrates. A synthetic peptide, Lys-Ser-Asp-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser, was found to be a specific substrate for this kinase and, using this peptide as substrate, the distribution of the enzyme activity in various rat tissues was examined. The activity was found in cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum, most abundantly in cerebellum, but other tissues tested, including liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland showed very little activity."
https://openalex.org/W1570165996,"The release of neurotransmitter glutamate from isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) was found to be tightly coupled to the entry of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but is relatively unresponsive to bulk increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c) effected by Ca2+ ionophore. Under the same conditions, this dependence on Ca2+ influx, specifically through Ca2+ channels, was also seen for the dephosphorylation of a 96-kDa protein, (P96), present in the nerve terminals, as well as the phosphorylation of proteins migrating at 75 kDa (P75), corresponding to the synapsins, a group of well characterized synaptic vesicle-associated proteins. P96 dephosphorylation, following Ca2+ influx, was persistent and insensitive to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, suggesting a phosphatase other than protein phosphatase 1 and 2A as being responsible. Perhaps through the same phosphatase activity the increase in P75 phosphorylation was rapidly reversed with a time course similar to P96 dephosphorylation. When release, P96 dephosphorylation, and P75 phosphorylation were considered as functions of the [Ca2+]c increases achieved by depolarization and Ca2+ ionophore, there was no correlation of any of these with the overall concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol. Since the fura-2 method used to measure [Ca2+] gives an averaged [Ca2+]c, these results imply that the release and protein dephosphorylation events are functionally coupled to local [Ca2+]c, in the immediate vicinity of Ca2+ channels. The reported clustering of the latter at the active zone area of the synapse and the parallelism between synaptic vesicle exocytosis and the phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins (p75:synapsins Ia/Ib), suggests that P96 may be similarly localized at the active zone area and, therefore, may be of significance in a modulatory role in glutamate release."
https://openalex.org/W1541600286,"Membranes of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, an extreme thermophilic archaebacterium, are composed of unusual bipolar lipids. They consist of macrocyclic tetraethers with two polar heads linked by two hydrophobic C40 phytanyl chains which are thought to be arranged as a monolayer in the cytoplasmic membrane. Fractionation of a total lipid-extract from S. acidocaldarius yielded a lipid fraction which forms closed and stable unilamellar liposomes in aqueous media. Beef heart cytochrome c-oxidase could be functionally reconstituted in these liposomes. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a protonmotive force (delta p) across the liposomal membrane was generated of up to -92 mV. Upon fusion of these proteoliposomes with membrane vesicles of Lactococcus lactis, the delta p generated by cytochrome c-oxidase activity was capable to drive uphill transport of leucine. Electron microscopic analysis indicated that the tetraether lipids form a single monolayer liposome. The results demonstrate that tetraether lipids of archaebacteria can form a suitable matrix for the function of exogenous membrane proteins originating from a regular lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1590226237,"The cytochrome o complex of Escherichia coli is a ubiquinol oxidase which is the predominant respiratory terminal oxidase when the bacteria are grown under high oxygen tension. The amino acid sequences of three of the subunits of this quinol oxidase reveal a substantial relationship to the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases. The two cytochrome components (b563.5 and o) and the single copper (CuB) present in the E. coli quinol oxidase appear to be equivalent to cytochrome a, cytochrome a3, and CuB of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases, respectively. These three prosthetic groups are all located within subunit I of the oxidase. Sequence alignments indicate only six totally conserved histidine residues among all known sequences of subunit I of the cytochrome c oxidases of various species plus the E. coli quinol oxidase. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to change each of these totally conserved histidines with the presumption that two of these six must ligate to the low spin cytochrome center of the E. coli oxidase. The presence of the low spin cytochrome b563.5 component of the oxidase can be evaluated both by visible absorbance properties and by its EPR spectrum. The results unambiguously indicate that His-106 and His-421 are the ligands of the six-coordinate low spin cytochrome b563.5. Although the data are not definitive in making additional metal ligation assignments of the remaining four totally conserved histidines, a reasonable model is suggested for the structure of the catalytic core of the cytochrome o complex and, by extrapolation, of cytochrome c oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1530005204,"The reactivity of several thiols, including glutathione, dihydrolipoic acid, cysteine, N-acetyl cysteine, and ergothioneine, as well as several disulfides, toward different redox states of myoglobin, mainly met-myoglobin (HX-FeIII) and ferrylmyoglobin (HX-FeIV=O), was evaluated by optical spectral analysis, product formation, and thiyl free radical generation. Only dihydrolipoic acid reduced met-myoglobin to oxy-myoglobin, whereas all the other thiols tested did not interact with met-myoglobin. Although the redox transitions involved in the former reduction were expected to yield the dihydrolipoate thiyl radical, the reaction was EPR silent. Conversely, all thiols interacted to different extent with the high oxidation state of myoglobin, i.e. ferrylmyoglobin, via two processes. First, direct electron transfer to heme iron in ferrylmyoglobin (HX-FeIV=O) with formation of met-myoglobin (HX-FeIII) or oxymyoglobin (HX-FeIIO2); the former transition was effected by all thiols except dihydrolipoate, which facilitated the latter, i.e. the formation of the two-electron reduction product of ferrylmyoglobin. Second, nucleophilic addition onto a pyrrole in ferrylmyoglobin with subsequent formation of sulfmyoglobin. The contribution of either direct electron transfer to the heme iron or nucleophilic addition depended on the physicochemical properties of the thiol involved and on the availability of H2O2 to reoxidize met-myoglobin to ferrylmyoglobin. The thiyl radicals of glutathione, cysteine, and N-acetylcysteine were formed during the interaction of the corresponding thiols with ferrylmyoglobin and detected by EPR in conjunction with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide. The intensity of the EPR signal was insensitive to superoxide dismutase and it was decreased, but not suppressed, by catalase. The disulfides of glutathione and cysteine did not react with ferrylmyoglobin, but the disulfide bridge in lipoic acid interacted efficiently with the ferryl species by either reducing directly the heme iron to form met-myoglobin or adding onto a pyrrole ring to form sulfmyoglobin; either process depended on the presence or absence of catalase (to eliminate the excess of H2O2) in the reaction mixture, respectively. The biological significance of the above results is discussed in terms of the occurrence and distribution of high oxidation states of myoglobin, its specific participation in cellular injury, and its potential interaction with biologically important thiols leading to either recovery of myoglobin or generation of nonfunctional forms of the hemoprotein as sulfmyoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1494657683,"A glutathione S-transferase fusion to the COOH-terminal acidic transactivation domain of Vmw65 from herpes simplex virus type 1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Following cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin, the transactivation domain was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography yielding approximately 0.6 mg of protein/liter of bacterial culture. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis showed the purified polypeptide to be monomeric; however, it displayed aberrant electrophoretic and chromatographic properties. Contrary to secondary structure predictions, circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that this transactivation domain was devoid of significant alpha-helical structure at physiological conditions. The polypeptide, however, became notably more structured under hydrophobic conditions or at low pH, suggesting that it was sensitive to its environment. Near-UV circular dichroism suggested that phenylalanyl and tyrosyl residues were under influence from tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1514517075,"The mechanism by which glucagon and cAMP analogues inhibit phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was investigated in rat hepatocytes. The studies were facilitated by preparation of an antibody to a synthetic peptide (D-F-V-A-H-D-D-I-P-Y-S-S-A) corresponding to residues 164-176 of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyl-transferase. The antibody, which was purified by affinity chromatography, quantitatively immunoprecipitated cytidylyltransferase from rat liver cytosol. Various analogues of cAMP had no effect on the labeling of cytidylyltransferase with 32Pi in rat hepatocytes. Nor did the cAMP analogues have any effect on the distribution of cytidylyltransferase between cytosol and membranes. These results indicate that the supply of CDP-choline does not limit phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in hepatocytes treated with cAMP analogues. A decreased supply of diacylglycerol was considered as an alternative mechanism for inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. An approximately 30% decrease in diacylglycerol concentration was observed in hepatocytes treated with the cAMP analogues or glucagon, compared with controls. A similar decrease of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was observed. The cAMP-mediated decrease in diacylglycerol levels and inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis were reversed by addition of 0.5-1.5 mM oleic acid to the treated hepatocytes. A correlation coefficient of 0.93 was calculated between the levels of diacylglycerol and the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. In another approach, the diacylglycerol levels were increased by an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase (U-57908) which also reversed the cAMP effects on diacylglycerol levels and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. We conclude that the cAMP-mediated inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was not due to an effect on the phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase. Instead, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis appears to be inhibited due to a decreased level of diacylglycerol, a substrate for CDP-choline: 1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1554589513,"Important determinants in the autoinhibitory domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II), corresponding to residues 281-302 of the kinase alpha-subunit sequence, were identified. Replacement of Thr286 with Ala (CaMK-(281-302 Ala286)) had no effect on either the potency (IC50 = 2 MicroM) or inhibitory mechanism (competitive with ATP) using the catalytic fragment of CaMK-II. Single replacement of charged residues in CaMK-(281-302, Ala286) identified His282, Arg283, Lys291, Arg297, and Lys298 as important determinants (greater than 10-fold increase in IC50) for potent inhibition of CaMK-II. Glu285, Asp288, Lys291, Arg296, and Lys300 were not as essential (less than 4-fold change in IC50) for potent CaMK-II inhibition. Replacement of either Arg283, Lys291, or Arg297, and Lys298 with Ala did not alter the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition although the Ki values increased 16-530-fold. However, replacement of His282 with Ala decreased the IC50 by 20-fold and altered the mechanism of inhibition to noncompetitive with respect to ATP. The non-protonated form of His282 was functionally active since decreasing the pH from 7.5 to 5.5 increased the IC50 of CaMK-(281-302, Ala286) almost 20-fold. Histidine protonation also appeared to disrupt the autoinhibitory domain of intact forms of CaMK-II since preincubation of non-proteolyzed rat brain CaMK-II with calcium/calmodulin (in the absence of ATP) at pH 5.5 generated up to 16% calcium-independent activity when assayed at pH 5.5. Similarly, the level of calcium-independent activity of a baculovirus-expressed Asp286 mutant CaMK-II ((D286)mCaMK alpha) increased to almost 80% calcium independence when assayed at pH 5.5 compared to only 20% when assayed at pH 7.5. The levels of calcium-independent activity of both the (D286)mCaMK alpha (at pH 5.5 and 7.5) and the rat brain CaMK-II (at pH 5.5) were sensitive to the concentrations of both ATP and peptide substrate (syntide-2) in the assays. These data suggest that the basic residues Arg283, Lys291, Arg297, and Lys298 are important for potent inhibition of CaMK-II and that the non-protonated form of His282 may play a unique role in the ATP-directed mechanism of inhibition by the CaMK-II autoinhibitory domain."
https://openalex.org/W1555702776,"Prior studies demonstrated that ceramide was phosphorylated by a novel Ca(2+)-dependent kinase distinct from diacylglycerol (DG) kinase in human myelogenous leukemia (HL-60) cells (Kolesnick, R. N., and Hemer, M. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10900-10904). The present studies were initiated to determine whether mammalian DG kinase purified to homogeneity possessed phosphotransferase activity toward ceramide. A high molecular weight rat brain DG kinase demonstrated Mg(2+)-(but not Ca(2+)-) dependent DG kinase activity and did not phosphorylate ceramide in the presence of either cation. In contrast, ceramide served as a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) 2-6-fold greater than the Km for DG. Inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to ATP and Mg2+. A cell-permeable ceramide, N-octanoyl sphingosine (C8-cer), was used to study effects of ceramide on DG kinase in intact HL-60 cells. C8-cer induced dose- and time-dependent increases in cellular DG levels. As little as 1 microM C8-cer increased DG from a basal level of 103 to 177 pmol.10(6) cells-1, and a maximal 2.9-fold elevation to 292 pmol.10(6) cells-1 occurred with 10 microM C8-cer. DG elevation was detected after 1 min, maximal by 7.5 min, and sustained for 30 min. The DG elevation was accompanied by a reduction in 32P incorporation in phosphatidic acid in cells short term-labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, consistent with inhibition of DG kinase. In contrast, a similar elevation in the DG level induced by exogenous phospholipase C increased 32P incorporation into phosphatidic acid. C8-cer was not metabolized to sphingomyelin, indicating that DG was not generated through the phosphatidylcholine:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase reaction. DG elevation after C8-cer or phospholipase C treatment was sufficient to redistribute protein kinase C from cytosol to membrane. These findings provide evidence that ceramide may serve as a competitive inhibitor of DG kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1518452172,"Eukaryotic topoisomerase II is capable of binding two separate nucleic acid helices prior to its DNA cleavage and strand passage events (Zechiedrich, E. L., and Osheroff, N (1990) EMBO J. 9, 4555-4562). Presumably, one of these helices represents the helix that the enzyme cleaves (i.e. cleavage helix), and the other represents the helix that it passes (i.e. passage helix) through the break in the nucleic acid backbone. To determine whether the passage helix is required for reaction steps that precede the enzyme's DNA strand passage event, interactions between Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II and a short double-stranded oligonucleotide were assessed. These studies employed a 40-mer that contained a specific recognition/cleavage site for the enzyme. The sigmoidal DNA concentration dependence that was observed for cleavage of the 40-mer indicated that topoisomerase II had to interact with more than a single oligonucleotide in order for cleavage to take place. Despite this requirement, results of enzyme DNA binding experiments indicated no binding cooperativity for the 40-mer. These findings strongly suggest a two-site model for topoisomerase II action in which the passage and the cleavage helices bind to the enzyme independently, but the passage helix must be present for efficient topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1536498570,"The Eg1 gene in Xenopus laevis is related in sequence to the cdc2+ gene. We show here that the Eg1 gene product (cdk2) possesses histone H1 protein kinase activity and binds to PSTAIR antibodies as well as to Sepharose beads linked to the 13-kDa product of the suc 1 gene (p13suc1). Eg1 protein kinase is active only in an Mr approximately 200,000 complex with other proteins but is not associated with any of the three known Xenopus mitotic cyclins or with any newly synthesized protein in egg extracts that exhibit cell cycle oscillations in vitro. The protein kinase activity of Eg1 oscillates in the mitotic cell cycle, being high in M-phase and low in interphase. Hyperactivation of cdc2 kinase by the addition of cyclin A has no effect on the activity or oscillatory behavior of Eg1. Inhibition of cdc2 kinase activation by emetine or RNase treatment of oscillating extracts does not inhibit the activation of Eg1 but does block deactivation normally seen during exit from mitosis. These results indicate that Eg1 is regulated by a cell cycle clock independently of cyclin and cdc2 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1598829883,"Many neural and endocrine cells possess two pathways of secretion: a regulated pathway and a constitutive pathway. Peptide hormones are stored in granules which undergo regulated release whereas other surface-bound proteins are externalized constitutively via a distinct set of vesicles. An important issue is whether proper function of these pathways requires continuous protein synthesis. Wieland et al. (Wieland, F.T., Gleason, M.L., Serafini, T.A., and Rothman, J.E. (1987) Cell 50, 289-300) have shown that a tripeptide containing the sequence Asn-Tyr-Thr can be glycosylated in intracellular compartments and secreted efficiently from Chinese hamster ovary and HepG2 cells, presumably via the constitutive secretory pathway. Secretion is not affected by cycloheximide, suggesting that operation of this pathway does not require components supplied by new protein synthesis. In this report we determined the effects of protein synthesis inhibitor on membrane traffic to the regulated secretory pathway in the mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells. We examined transport of glycosaminoglycan chains since previous studies have shown that these chains enter the regulated secretory pathways and are packaged along with the hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). We found that cycloheximide treatment severely impairs the cell's ability to store and secrete glycosaminoglycan chains by the regulated secretory pathway. In marked contrast, constitutive secretion of glycosaminoglycan chains remains unhindered in the absence of protein synthesis. The differential requirements for protein synthesis indicate differences in the mechanisms for sorting and/or transport of molecules through the constitutive and the regulated secretory pathways. We discuss the possible mechanisms by which protein synthesis may influence trafficking of glycosaminoglycan chains to the regulated secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1575801965,"Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in a variety of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and secretion. We assessed the role of PKC in the mitogenic effects of gastrin-releasing peptide (in a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line. Using antisera that specifically recognize the PKC isoforms alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon, we determined that PKC epsilon is the major isoform in the SCLC cell line NCI-N417, followed by PKC alpha and delta. In addition to the 90-kDa PKC epsilon, our anti-PKC epsilon antiserum specifically detected a 40-kDa immunoreactive protein. Treatment of the cells with either 20 nM phorbol myristate acetate or 50 nM GRP enhanced significantly the level of the 40-kDa protein in a time-dependent (1-8 h), cycloheximide-sensitive fashion. Subcellular fractionation revealed that 90% of PKC epsilon was in particulate form, while the 40-kDa immunoreactive protein was cytosolic. To test the hypothesis that the 40-kDa soluble protein represented a catalytically independent PKC epsilon fragment, cytosolic extracts were assayed for kinase activity. 45-50% of the activity was apparent in the absence of the PKC activators phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol. This effector-independent kinase activity was further purified by affinity chromatography using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKC epsilon (ERMRPRKRQGAVRRRV) coupled to Sepharose. The partially purified protein, recognized by the anti-PKC epsilon antiserum, exhibited histone kinase activity with kinetics similar to those of the tryptically generated catalytic fragment of brain PKC epsilon. This activity was inhibited by staurosporine (IC50 = 1 x 10(-8) M) and by the pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide (IC50 = 7.7 x 10(-8) M). The SCLC kinase and the brain PKC epsilon catalytic fragment were similar as indicated by the relative sizes of the PKC epsilon immunoreactive peptides generated with protease V8 from Staphylococcus aureus (Mr approximately 37,000, 34,000, 28,000, 26,000, and 25,000). Taken together, we conclude that a variant SCLC cell line expresses a constitutively active catalytic fragment of PKC epsilon. Regulation by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate or GRP via de novo protein synthesis suggests a novel mechanism of control of PKC diversity with implications for small cell lung cancer and possibly other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1641277135,"Abstract Regulation of Na+/H+ exchange by fetal bovine serum was studied in Caco-2 cells, an established cell line derived from a human colon carcinoma. Cells were grown as polarized monolayers on collagen-coated filters and intracellular pH measured fluorometrically with 2',7'-bis(2-carboxymethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Na+/H+ exchange was reduced 64% when cells were deprived of serum for 4 h. In contrast to other cell types, readdition of serum for 10 min did not activate Na+/H+ exchange; however, readdition of serum for 4 h restored Na+/H+ exchange to control values. This long-term effect of serum on Na+/H+ exchange activity could not be explained by changes in intracellular buffering capacity or intracellular [Na+]. 4-h serum deprivation reduced the K(t) of the exchanger for external Na+ from 21 to 6 mM, and reduced the V(max) by 57%, but did not alter the IC50 for amiloride in the presence of 140 mM Na+. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (5 microM) did not alter the effect of serum removal or readdition on Na+/H+ exchange. Low temperature (13 degrees C) completely prevented the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange caused by the removal of serum. In addition, once Na+/H+ exchange was inhibited by serum removal at 37 degrees C, maintaining cells at 13 degrees C also blocked the recovery of Na+/H+ exchange caused by serum readdition. Conversely, cytochalasin D (0.1-20 microM) blocked the reduction of Na+/H+ exchange which occurred due to 4-h serum deprivation, but did not block the restoration of Na+/H+ exchange when the cells were re-exposed to serum for a further 4 h. Colchicine (20 microM) did not alter the effect of serum removal or readdition. These data suggest that serum regulates Na+/H+ exchange activity by a posttranslational mechanism which is dependent on F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1651610655,"Peroxidatic substrates, catechol (CAT) and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) were used as probes of thechloride dependent reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase (CPO). TMP is consumed only in the presence of chloride. TMP is a competitive inhibitor versus CAT, but CAT is a noncompetitive inhibitor versus TMP in chloride-dependent CPO-catalyzed peroxidation reactions. The ratio of TMP versus CAT consumed by the chloride-dependent CPO reaction in direct competition studies increases as the chloride concentration is increased from 1.0 to 400 mM. Ratios of non-enzymatic HOCl reactions under conditions otherwise similar to those of the CPO reactions are relatively insensitive to changes in chloride concentration and are experimentally indistinguishable from the values attained by the enzyme system at high chloride concentrations. Comparison of enzymatic ratios with those of the HOCl reactions indicate that the proportion of the enzymatic reaction involving a freely dissociable, enzyme-generated, oxidized halogen species varies from 10% at low chloride concentrations to essentially 100% at high chloride concentrations. All data are consistent with a mechanism in which chloride competes with CAT for binding to both CPO compound I and the CPO chlorinating intermediate (EOCl). Chloride binding to CPO compound I leads to the formation of EOCl and initiates the CPO chloride-dependent pathway. When CAT binds to either compound I or EOCl, it is directly oxidized to product. When chloride binds to EOCl, it either induces release of HOCl or reacts with EOCl to produce Cl2, which is released from the enzyme. TMP and CAT compete for reaction with the free oxidized halogen species. This is the first direct evidence for kinetically significant involvement of a free oxidized halogen species as an intermediate in any CPO-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1532065950,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin. Alternative exon splicing is responsible for two forms of the PDGF A-chain which differ at the carboxyl terminus by a highly basic region consisting of 18 amino acids. To clarify the function of the region, we synthesized an octadecapeptide corresponding to this extension (A194-211), incorporated a tyrosine residue at the amino terminus, and used the radioiodinated construct in binding studies with Balb/c3T3 cells and a variety of human cell lines. 125I-(Y)A194-211 bound specifically, reversibly, saturably, and with low affinity to a large population of binding sites on these cells. In addition, (Y)A194-211 markedly reduced the binding of its parent protein, 125I-PDGF-AAL, to its receptor. (Y)A194-211 also attenuated the binding of epidermal growth factor and several other isoforms of PDGF, but did not interfere with the binding of transferrin to its receptor. These observations were not due to competitive binding of peptide directly to known receptors for the respective growth factors, but was likely due to interaction of (Y)A194-211 with extracellular glycosaminoglycan. Thus, A194-211 may represent an additional heparin binding domain on mature PDGF-AAL, and as an isolate, is capable of modulating interactions between several potent growth factors and their respective receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1583063134,"Many eukaryotic surface glycoproteins, including the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei, are synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic peptide extension that is cleaved and replaced by a complex glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor within 1-5 min of the completion of polypeptide synthesis. We have reported the purification and partial characterization of candidate precursor glycolipids (P2 and P3) from T. brucei. P2 and P3 contain ethanolamine-phosphate-Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-GlcN linked glycosidically to an inositol residue, as do all the GPI anchors that have been structurally characterized. The anchors on mature VSGs contain a heterogenously branched galactose structure attached alpha 1-3 to the mannose residue adjacent to the glucosamine. We report the identification of free GPIs that appear to be similarly galactosylated. These glycolipids contain diacylglycerol and alpha-galactosidase-sensitive glycan structures which are indistinguishable from the glycans derived from galactosylated VSG GPI anchors. We discuss the relevance of these galactosylated GPIs to the biosynthesis of VSG GPI anchors."

The purified RecBCD-K177Q enzyme has ATP-dependent nuclease activity on double-stranded or denatured DNA which is reduced (4-14-fold less) compared with the wild type. The kcat and Km(ATP) for ATP hydrolysis stimulated by double-stranded DNA are both reduced in RecBCD-K177Q, so that kcat/Km(ATP) is relatively unaffected. The mutant enzyme is impaired in its ability to unwind DNA in an assay where single-stranded DNA is trapped by the single-stranded DNA binding protein and subsequently degraded by S1 nuclease. The mutant enzyme also produces fewer acid-soluble DNA nucleotides per ATP hydrolyzed than does the wild type, at low ATP concentrations (less than 20 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1521226665,"The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica contains two genes, SCR1 and SCR2, encoding a 7SL RNA associated with a signal recognition particle (SRP). To study 7SL RNA function in vivo we have systematically substituted the two conserved nucleotides G128 and A130 in loop 1 of SCR2-encoded 7SL RNA. All single mutations in either nucleotide have no effect. All double mutations are lethal except for one which results in temperature-sensitive growth. We have studied the synthesis and secretion of an alkaline extracellular protease (AEP) in both wild-type and temperature-sensitive mutant strains. Pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of this protein show that: 1) total protein synthesis is not affected in the mutant strain; 2) levels of AEP precursors in the mutant strain are 60% less than in the wild-type strain; 3) for both strains there is no accumulation of the AEP precursors in the cytoplasm; 4) the kinetics of secretion is similar. These results suggest that mutated SRP is deficient in membrane targeting but still performs translational arrest. This is consistent with the functions of SRP observed in vitro and represents the first demonstration of such roles in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1532225933,"During postnatal life, many contractile and electrophysiological properties of the rat heart undergo changes. Among the changes is a switch in the expression of Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit isoforms. Thyroid hormone has been postulated to play an important role in the postnatal transformation of the heart, and its effect on myosin heavy chain isoform gene transcription is well documented. To test whether it controls Na,K-ATPase gene switching in vivo, we made neonatal rats hypothyroid by maternal treatment with methimazole. The expression of Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit isoforms in cardiac and skeletal muscle membranes was measured with specific antibodies at time points from birth to 4 weeks of age. Postnatal changes in Na,K-ATPase isoform expression in cardiac ventricle and hind limb skeletal muscle were similar in control and hypothyroid animals. In the same hypothyroid animals, the postnatal switch from the V3 (beta) isoform of myosin heavy chain to the V1 (alpha) isoform was blocked. The conclusion is that thyroid hormone may have a modulatory role in Na,K-ATPase gene expression, but it is not the developmental signal that dominates gene switching."
https://openalex.org/W1525272057,"Two GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) have been detected in extracts from bovine brain: GAP-1, which is specific for the activation of ras GTPases, and GAP-3, which is specific for the activation of the rap1 GTPases. We present a strategy for the purification to homogeneity of a cytosolic form of GAP-3 from bovine brain. The 100,000 x g supernatant from homogenized brains was chromatographed sequentially on DEAE Fast Flow, green H-E4BD Sepharose, Bio-Gel A1.5, hydroxyapatite, and phenyl-Sepharose prior to high resolution separation on Mono Q HR 5/5, phenyl-Superose HR 5/5, Mono Q PC 1.6/5, and Superose 12 PC 3.2/30. This procedure resulted in an approximately 18,000-fold purification, yielding 50 micrograms of GAP-3 from 1.6 kg of tissue. Purified cytosolic GAP-3 migrated as a single band of apparent Mr 55,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, on gel filtration cytosolic GAP-3 chromatographed as a dimer with an apparent Mr 92,000. Purified GAP-3 does not activate ras or rho GTPases and possesses no intrinsic GTPase activity. Amino acid sequence data indicated a proline-rich N terminus. The amino acid sequences of peptides generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 digestion of reduced and pyridine-ethylated GAP-3 showed no similarity to the predicted primary structure of GAP-1 or any other proteins in the nucleic acid or protein data bases. By comparison with the data of Rubinfeld et al. (Rubinfeld, B., Munemitsu, S., Clark, R., Conroy, L., Watt, K., Crosier, W.J., McCormick, F., and Polakis, P. (1991) Cell 65, 1033-1042), it appears that the membrane-associated (Mr 85,000-95,000) and cytosolic forms of GAP-3 are derived from equivalent, or closely related, genes."
https://openalex.org/W1551249741,"Abstract In streptomyces, low molecular weight compounds termed have been isolated as primary signal molecules for triggering secondary metabolism and/or cytodifferentiation. Streptomyces virginiae produces a set of autoregulators termed virginiae butanolide A-E which trigger virginiamycin production, and possesses a high-affinity virginiae butanolide receptor (Kim, H.S., Nihira, T., Tada, H., Yanagimoto, M., and Yamada, Y. (1989) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 42, 769-778). The virginiae butanolide receptor has now been purified to apparent homogeneity with 14,000-fold purification and an 8.6% activity yield. The purified receptor showed a Mr of 36,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a maximum ligand binding of 33.0 nmol/mg protein, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (1.18 mol of virginiae butanolide/36 kDa of protein) between virginiae butanolides and the receptor. Due to a blockage at the amino terminus, fragment peptides were generated by lysyl endopeptidase and five partial amino acid sequences were determined. The gene (vbrA) encoding the virginiae butanolide receptor was identified on a 5.0-kbp BamHI fragment by hybridization to synthetic oligonucleotide probes, cloned, and sequenced. Nucleotide-sequence analysis predicted a 319-amino acid open reading frame (vbrA) in which all the partial amino acid sequences of the receptor appeared, and 166 bp downstream from it another open reading frame for a 144-amino acid protein which was designated as a ribosomal protein L11 from its high homology (62-64%) to the amino acid sequences of ribosomal protein L11 of several origins, and thus denoted as rplK. The C-terminal half of VbrA showed 36% overall homology to the amino acid sequence of an essential protein (NusG) of Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the gene assembly of vbrA-rplk of S. virginiae closely resembled that of nusG-rplK of E. coli, suggesting that vbrA may constitute a part of an essential gene cluster encoding components of transcriptional and translational apparatuses."
https://openalex.org/W1589961435,"We have screened various alkyl- and arylguanidinium derivatives as possible competitors of Na+ or Rb+ for the cation sites on renal Na+,K(+)-ATPase. Alkyl-monoguanidinium or alkylbisguanidinium (BisG) compounds (chain lengths of C3 to C10) competitively inhibit the occlusion of Rb+ and Na+ with an order of affinities C10 greater than C8 greater than C6 greater than C4 greater than C3. BisG compounds are approximately twice as effective as the equivalent alkylmonoguanidinium compounds. In media of high ionic strength, affinities of tens of micromolar are observed, e.g. 26 microM for BisG 8. m-(mXBG)- and p-xylylenebisguanidinium were synthesized and were found to compete with Rb+ or Na+ with intrinsic affinities of 7.7 and 8.2 microM, respectively. The hydrophobicity rather than the degree of proximity of the guanidinium groups in all BisG compounds appears to determine the binding affinity. A systematic search has been made of conditions in occlusion assays for which the inhibitor affinities are highest. When the pH is raised from 7.0 to 8.5, a 5-fold increase in affinity is observed, suggesting that the guanidinium derivatives compete with protons at sites of pKa approximately 7.5. Replacing Tris-HCl with choline chloride-containing media raised apparent affinities approximately 2-fold. All guanidinium derivatives stabilize the E1 conformation of fluorescein-labeled Na+,K(+)-ATPase, acting as competitive Na+ analogues. In media containing only 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.55, very high affinities were observed for binding to the fluorescein-labeled enzyme (e.g. 0.08 microM for mXBG). In very low ionic strength medium, the inhibition was still competitive with Rb+ ions. However, there was also evidence for nonspecific adsorption to the membranes. The following findings show that mXBG, a typical guanidinium derivative, behaves as a Na(+)-like antagonist. (a) It inhibits Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity, competing strongly with Na+ but only weakly with K+ ions. (b) It inhibits phosphorylation from ATP, competing with Na+ ions. (c) Like Na+ ions, it blocks phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate. Based on these results, we propose that the guanidinium group binds to a relatively wide vestibule at the cytoplasmic surface; but, unlike Na+ or K+ ions, it cannot pass into a narrower region of the cation transport path within the membrane. Therefore, it blocks the occlusion and active transport of cations. In the future, high affinity guanidinium derivatives may serve the purpose of locating cation-binding domains of the pump protein after being converted to reactive affinity or photoaffinity covalent labels."
https://openalex.org/W1532995690,"Phosphorylase kinase is a calcium-regulated multimeric enzyme of composition (alpha beta gamma delta)4, which contains calmodulin as the integral delta subunit and also is activated further by addition of extrinsic calmodulin. Previous studies by Dasgupta, M., Honeycutt, T., and Blumenthal, D.K. ((1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17156-17163) have identified gamma 302-326 and gamma 342-366 as two calmodulin binding regions. Using peptides that were synthesized based on alpha and beta primary structure and that were predicted to contain the basic amphiphilic alpha-helix motif thought important for calmodulin binding, four additional potential calmodulin binding domains have now been identified: one of high affinity, beta 770-794; two of intermediate affinity, beta 5-28 and beta 920-946; and one with marginally low affinity, alpha 1070-1093. Peptide beta 770-794 was of higher calmodulin affinity than either gamma 302-326 or gamma 342-366; it was of higher affinity than the model synthetic peptide IV defined by O'Neil, K.T., and DeGrado, W.F. ((1990) Trends Biochem. Sci. 15, 59-64); and it is currently the most potent calmodulin-binding peptide so far described. Correlated with their affinity for calmodulin, all six phosphorylase kinase-derived peptides and several other established calmodulin-binding peptides inhibited phosphorylase kinase previously activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, reducing its activity to the level of the nonactivated enzyme. However, these peptides did not inhibit (and some peptides slightly activated) the nonphosphorylated enzyme. Even in the presence of these peptides both activated and nonactivated enzyme remained fully Ca(2+)-dependent. The beta 770-794 peptide has at least a 5-fold greater calmodulin binding affinity than the holo-phosphorylase kinase. This, and its higher affinity for calmodulin than either of the sites on the gamma subunit, raises the possibility that in the native enzyme it may be involved in binding the intrinsic delta subunit. Further, inhibition of activated but not nonactivated enzyme by calmodulin-binding peptides would suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent activation of phosphorylase kinase may be mediated by changes in the binding interactions of the intrinsic calmodulin delta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1565753092,"The N-terminal residues preceding the alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix motif on the Tn10 Tet repressor protein were probed by oligonucleotide-directed deletion mutagenesis for their role in protein activity. All deletion mutants showed decreased repression in vivo, emphasizing the importance of the N terminus for tet operator binding. Only two of the mutants, TetR delta 2-23 and TetR delta 3-8 displayed a reduced intracellular protein level. The remaining deletion mutants showed either reduced binding to tet operator and inducibility by tetracycline or transdominance. We conclude that these deletions do not affect stability and overall protein structure. DNA binding activities of residue-wise increasing deletions, TetR delta 9 through TetR delta 9-13, reveal a pattern consistent with an alpha-helical structure of the affected residues. This conclusion is supported by the helical wheel projection and the hydrophobic moment profile calculated for the protein segment ranging from residues S7-V20. We propose that these residues form an amphipathic alpha-helix which packs closely against the alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix motif and is essential for Tet repressor activity. The residues preceding this putative alpha-helix contribute to DNA binding, but no direct interactions with base pairs of tet operator were revealed in a loss of contact analysis. Individual mutation of the 4 charged residues to alanine at the N terminus shows that no single residue can account for the reduction in repression observed for the deletion mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1589149823,"The influence of cations on the capacity of five oligopurine.oligopyrimidine mirror repeat sequences to adopt intramolecular triplexes (the usual H-y3 isomer and/or the rare H-y5 isomer) in recombinant plasmids was investigated. Unexpectedly, the presence of certain metal ions (magnesium, zinc, manganese, and calcium) stabilized the (GAA)4TTCGC(GAA)4 insert in the rare H-y5 when cloned into either of two different sequence backgrounds. Alternatively, either shortening or lengthening the sequence at the central interruption, which becomes the loop of the triplex, led to the formation of the canonical H-y3 under all conditions tested. Similarly, other oligopurine.oligopyrimidine mirror repeat sequences (i.e. (GAA)8 or (GGA)8) formed only the H-y3 under all experimental conditions. All triplexes were stabilized by negative supercoiling at pH 5.0; chemical probe and primer extension analyses served as critical structural tools. Hence, the nature of the central interruption sequence (the loop) of the mirror repeat is important for the stabilization of the H-y5. This region may be important for metal ion binding in the initial stages of triplex formation and thus may play a critical role in determining which isomer is formed. The possible biological role of a DNA sequence adopting three different conformations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1535480850,"Complex formation between the human papilloma virus type 16 E7 protein (HPV-16 E7) and the retinoblastoma growth suppressor protein (RB) is believed to contribute to the process of cellular transformation that leads to cervical carcinoma. Genetic analysis of the HPV-16 E7 protein has shown that the segment of E7 homologous to the conserved region 2 of adenovirus 5 E1A protein is involved in both RB binding and E7-mediated cell transformation. We have previously shown that a peptide colinear with HPV-16 E7 residues 21-29 was able to block immobilized species of E7 from binding to RB protein. The current study reports the effects of different chemical modifications of this peptide. One type of modification, methylation of the alpha-amino nitrogens contributed by Leu22, Tyr25, and Leu28, resulted in a 45-fold increase in E7/RB binding antagonist activity. This increased antagonist activity is sequence-specific since methylation of the amino groups contributed by Tyr23, Cys24, or Glu26 resulted in a profound loss of binding antagonist activity. Using a newly developed binding assay we determined that the apparent dissociation constant for recombinant HPV-16 E7 protein binding to recombinant human RB protein is 1.3 nM. The peptide Ac[N-MeLeu22,N-Me-Tyr25,N-MeLeu28]-(21-29)-E7 amide was determined to be a competitive inhibitor of HPV-16 E7 binding to RB with a Ki value of 32 nM."
https://openalex.org/W1543417146,"To assess whether receptor binding is sufficient to initiate vasopressin receptor endocytosis in cells expressing the vasopressin V1 or V2 receptors, we synthesized a novel fluorescent-labeled vasopressin analog, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-ethyl)-D-tyrosine, 4-valine, 8-lysine-N6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine] vasopressin (R-CLVP), that binds to vasopressin receptors but does not activate intracellular events such as the mobilization of intracellular calcium or the activation of adenylate cyclase. We compared the manner in which this analog was endocytosed in cells expressing V1 (A-10, rat smooth muscle cells) or V2 (LLC-PK1, porcine kidney cells) receptors with that of a full agonist, [1-(beta-mercaptopropionic acid), 8-lysine-N6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine] vasopressin (R-MLVP) [Lutz et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4657-4663; Lutz et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87,6507-6511]. We showed that R-CLVP bound to both types of receptors with good affinity. It failed to increase cyclic AMP concentrations in LLC-PK1 cells and did not increase the mobilization of intracellular calcium in A-10 cells. It bound to the surface of both these cell types in a diffuse manner and it did not undergo receptor endocytosis in either cell type. In contrast, R-MLVP, an agonist that bound to both receptor subtypes and elicited changes in intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium, bound to the surface of these cells in a diffuse manner at early times after exposure, and rapidly underwent endocytosis. We conclude that binding of vasopressin to its receptors alone is insufficient to cause receptor endocytosis, and other events distal to the receptor are required to initiate endocytosis. R-CLVP should be a useful analog in determining the factors responsible for initiating receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1595041052,"The structural domains of protein C involved in its interaction with thrombin-thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface have been investigated using isolated intact domains of bovine protein C produced from controlled proteolytic digests of the protein. The fragments investigated include the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-rich module, the two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, and a fragment consisting of the Gla and the two EGF-like modules. The effects of these fragments on the catalytic efficiency (Km and Vmax) of activation of protein C by the endothelial cell surface thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (IIa-TM) have been evaluated in vitro using a stirred microcarrier cell culture of bovine aortic endothelial cells and purified proteins. Neither the Gla nor the two EGF-like modules alone had any discernible effect on protein C activation. The intact Gla-EGF fragment, however, inhibited protein C activation. The results are consistent with a rapid equilibrium competitive inhibition model, in which the Gla-EGF fragment competes with protein C for binding to IIa-TM, and indicate that the Gla-EGF fragment alone accounts for most of the binding energy of intact protein C for IIa-TM. In addition, a requirement for the Gla residues of protein C for binding is implied by the observation that heat-decarboxylated Gla-EGF fragment was not an inhibitor of protein C activation. In addition, chloromethyl ketone-inactivated activated protein C was found to bind to IIa-TM with the same affinity as protein C, suggesting that the changes which occur in protein C upon activation do not affect that part of the protein responsible for binding to IIa-TM, that is the Gla-EGF region. The Gla-EGF region from factor X also weakly inhibited the IIa-TM activation of protein C."
https://openalex.org/W1670233224,"During its infectious cycle, vaccinia virus expresses a virus-encoded ribonucleotide reductase which is distinct from the host cellular enzyme (Slabaugh, M.B., and Mathews, C.K. (1984) J. Virol. 52, 501-506; Slabaugh, M.B., Johnson, T.L., and Mathews, C.K. (1984) J. Virol. 52, 507-514). We have cloned the gene for the small subunit of vaccinia virus ribonucleotide reductase (designated VVR2) into Escherichia coli and expressed the protein using a T7 RNA polymerase plasmid expression system. After isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction, accumulation of a 37-kDa peptide was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and this peptide reacted with polyclonal antiserum raised against a TrpE-VVR2 fusion protein. The 37-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity, and gel filtration of the purified protein revealed that the recombinant protein existed as a dimer in solution. Purified recombinant VVR2 protein was shown to complement the activity of purified recombinant ribonucleotide reductase large subunit, with a specific activity that was similar to native VVR2 from a virus-infected cell extract. A CD spectrum of the recombinant viral protein showed that like the mouse protein, the vaccinia virus protein has 50% alpha-helical structure. Like other iron-containing ribonucleotide reductase small subunits, recombinant VVR2 protein contained a stable organic free radical that was detectable by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectrum of purified recombinant VVR2 was identical to that of vaccinia virus-infected mammalian cells. Both the hyperfine splitting character and microwave saturation behavior of VVR2 were similar to those of mouse R2 and distinct from E. coli R2. By using amino acid analysis to determine the concentration of VVR2, we determined that approximately 0.6 radicals were present per R2 dimer. Our results indicate that vaccinia virus small subunit is similar to mammalian ribonucleotide reductases."
https://openalex.org/W1856953040,"Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells convert 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [( 3H]alkylacylGPC) to a product tentatively identified as an ethanolamine-containing phosphoglyceride (PE) (Daniel, L. W., Waite, B. M., and Wykle, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9128-9132). In the present study, analysis of the radiolabeled phosphoglycerides as diradylglycerobenzoate derivatives indicated that [3H] alkylacylGPC was initially converted to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [( 3H]alkylacylGPE) which was subsequently desaturated to 1-O-[3H]alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [( 3H]alkenylacylGPE). The conversion of [3H]/[32P]alkyl-lysoGPC to [3H]alkenylacylGPE indicated that base exchange enzymes were not involved in this pathway. A phosphono analog of alkyl-lysoGPC, resistant to phospholipase D hydrolysis and radiolabeled in the 1-O-alkyl chain was readily incorporated, acylated, and subsequently metabolized to [3H]alkylacylGPC and [3H]alkenylacylGPE. Therefore, the involvement of phospholipase D in the conversion pathway was ruled out. The conversion of [3H]alkylacylGPC or its phosphono analog to [3H]alkenylacylGPE was significantly enhanced by the addition of 100 microM ethanolamine to the culture media, suggesting that [3H]alkylacylglycerol is an intermediate in the cytidine-dependent pathway of PE synthesis. MDCK cell cytosol and microsomes contained no detectable phospholipase C activity. However, incubation of microsomes with CMP resulted in the degradation of [3H]alkylacylGPC and accumulation of [3H]alkylacylglycerol. Furthermore, the addition of CDP-ethanolamine to microsomes following preincubation with CMP, resulted in a decrease in [3H]alkylacylglycerol with a concomitant increase in [3H]alkenylacylGPE. Overall, these results suggest that the reverse reaction of choline phosphotransferase may be responsible for the conversion of alkylacylGPC to alkylacylGPE."
https://openalex.org/W1595262732,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c was conjugated with ubiquitin (Ub) in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte extract (Fraction II). By N-terminal protein sequencing, it was found for both the mono- and diubiquitinated products that the major Ub attachment site is on Lys4 (residue 9) of the cytochrome c. Thus, the residue ubiquitinated in iso-1-cytochrome c is identical with that previously determined for the yeast iso-2 form (Sokolik, C. W., and Cohen, R. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9100-9107). For both cytochromes c, the proportions of diubiquitinated and higher order conjugates are drastically reduced when Ub is replaced with a Lys48→Arg variant, suggesting that the Ub-Ub moieties are linked predominantly through Lys48. Despite close similarities in structure and ubiquitination sites, conjugation to iso-2-cytochrome c is approximately 5-fold faster than for the iso-1 form; vertebrate cytochromes c are even poorer substrates, being ubiquitinated at only approximately 5 of the rate of the iso-2 protein. Comparison of several cytochrome c variants excludes alpha-N-acetylation or the identity of the N-terminal amino acid as the important recognition determinants in these reactions. The results, which include the finding that ferro and ferri-iso-2-cytochromes c are ubiquitinated equally, also are evidence against a simple correlation between ubiquitination efficiency and thermodynamic stability. Rather, the presence of a pair of lysines (Lys4-Lys5) within the relatively unstructured N-terminal extension of the yeast cytochromes c may be responsible for their preferential ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1596631696,"In the presence of hexokinase, vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle are able to accumulate Ca2+ in a medium containing ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. No significant Ca2+ uptake is observed if one of these components is omitted from the assay medium. Due to its high affinity for ATP, the Ca(2+)-ATPase can use the very low concentrations of ATP formed from glucose 6-phosphate and ADP to form a Ca2+ gradient. This finding indicates that glucose 6-phosphate and hexokinase can be used as an ATP-regenerating system. The Ca2+ uptake supported by glucose 6-phosphate and ADP is inhibited by glucose and D-xylose. Half-maximal inhibition is observed in the presence of 0.4 mM glucose and 100 mM D-xylose. The transport ratio (Ca2+ transported:substrate utilized) is the same for glucose 6-phosphate and ATP. The Ca2+ gradient formed when glucose 6-phosphate and ADP are the substrates can be used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. The concentration of ATP formed after reversal of the Ca2+ pump is much higher than that expected from direct equilibration of the reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1497073903,"We demonstrate here that ethanol, in contrast to heat shock (Chousterman, S., Chelbi-Alix, M.K., and Thang, M.N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4806-4811), induces interferon (IFN) synthesis and its related activities in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. The induced IFN is secreted maximally at 6 h, whereas the induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA peaks between 9 and 12 h and its activity at 15 h. The appearance of both 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity and the antiviral state upon ethanol treatment is prevented by anti-bovine recombinant IFN-beta antibodies. Bovine diarrhea virus infection-free MDBK cells cultured in medium supplemented with serum substitute also gave similar results, thus indicating that IFN synthesis induced by ethanol is not mediated by the activation of bovine diarrhea virus. Together, these results show that: 1) ethanol induces the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and antiviral activities through IFN-beta production; and 2) the IFN produced does not act directly from inside the cells, but has to be first secreted to bind to its receptor. In MDBK cells, ethanol induces the synthesis of the 70-kDa protein, which precedes the expression of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase; moreover, the transient nature of the synthesis of the hsp 70 in these cells is similar after both heat shock and ethanol treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1603406449,"Abstract Two cytosolic components, which cooperate with a 63-kDa cytosolic factor (Tanaka, T., Imajoh-Ohmi, S., Kanegasaki, S., Takagi, Y., Makino, R., and Ishimura, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18717-18720) in activation of the O(2-)-generating NADPH-oxidase in neutrophil membrane, were isolated and characterized from porcine neutrophils. One, which was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, was a 47-kDa protein cross-reactive to an antibody raised against a portion of human 47-kDa cytosolic factor, a component of the human NADPH-oxidase activation system. Another one, designated here as the third component, was partially purified and found to contain 49- and 55-kDa proteins as the major constituents. No colored prosthetic group such as heme, flavin, and non-heme iron was detected in both cytosolic components. In a reconstituted assay system with a solubilized membrane preparation containing the dormant oxidase and with oleate as a stimulus, the 47-kDa protein together with the 63-kDa factor was essential for activating the dormant oxidase, while the third component was not essential for the activation of but enhanced the O(2-)-generation evoked by the former two components. Thus, the 47- and 63-kDa cytosolic proteins are the principal constituents of the activation system, while the other factors such as those contained in the third component may regulate the activity induced by the essential components."
https://openalex.org/W1508252865,"We have identified an activity in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, based upon its ability to hydrolyze native reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA, isolated from polyribosomes, and N-acylaminoacyl-tRNA, and its inability to hydrolyze aminoacyl-tRNA, precisely the same substrate specificity previously reported for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from bacteria or yeast. The physiological role of the reticulocyte enzyme may be to hydrolyze and recycle peptidyl-tRNA that has dissociated prematurely from elongating ribosomes, as suggested for the bacterial and yeast enzymes, since reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is completely incapable of hydrolyzing peptidyl-tRNA that is still bound to polyribosomes. We have purified reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase over 5,000-fold from the postribosomal supernatant with a yield of 14%. The purified product shows a 72-kDa band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that has co-purified with enzyme activity and comprises about 90% of the total stained protein, strongly suggesting that the 72-kDa protein is the enzyme. Sucrose density gradient analysis indicates an apparent molecular mass for the native enzyme of 65 kDa, implying that it is a single polypeptide chain. The enzyme is almost completely inactive in the absence of a divalent cation: Mg2+ (1-2 mM) promotes activity best, Mn2+ is partly effective, and Ca2+ and spermidine are ineffective. The hydrolase shows a Km of 0.60 microM and Vmax of 7.1 nmol/min/mg with reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA, a Km of 60 nM and Vmax of 14 nmol/min/mg with Escherichia coli fMet-tRNA(fMet), and a Km of 100 nM and Vmax of 2.2 nmol/min/mg with yeast N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA(Phe). The enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.0-7.25, it is inactivated by heat (60 degrees C for 5 min), and its activity is almost completely inhibited by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide or incubation with 20 mM phosphate. The fact that the enzyme hydrolyzes E. coli but not yeast or reticulocyte fMet-tRNA(fMet) may be explained, at least in part, by structural similarities between prokaryotic tRNA(fMet) and eukaryotic elongator tRNA that are not shared by eukaryotic tRNA(fMet)."
https://openalex.org/W1605242233,"Calcium influx is an important aspect of receptor-mediated signal transduction, yet limited information is available regarding the pathways of calcium influx into nonexcitable cells. We show that treatment of oocytes from Xenopus laevis with cholera toxin, a potent activator of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, specifically stimulates a sustained inward whole cell flux of calcium through a novel membrane transporter. The calcium is distributed into a mobilizable pool. The flux is voltage-independent and is completely and specifically blocked by microinjection of oocytes with an antiserum directed against Gs alpha. The flux is not activated by treatment of the cells with forskolin or 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate indicating that the effect of Gs alpha on the transporter occurs independently of adenylylcyclase activation. Transporter activity is insensitive to benzyl amiloride, does not require a sodium gradient, and is not stimulated by external calcium, indicating that it is not a sodium-calcium exchanger. The Gs-activated flux is dramatically potentiated by lanthanum ion and other trivalent cations but not by any of six divalent cations that were tested; all other known calcium channels and exchangers are, in contrast, potently blocked by lanthanum. The divalent cation cadmium inhibited transporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This novel calcium transporter may be important for receptor-mediated calcium influx in the oocyte and perhaps other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1594096980,"Abstract Modulation of phosphoenzyme forms of the Na/K pump by Na+ and K+ was studied by measuring the rate of Pi-promoted ouabain binding to resealed ghosts made from human red cells. This system permits distinguishing the effects of the ions at intracellular and external binding sites. Internal K+, Ki, inhibited the rate of Pi-promoted ouabain binding, contrary to a prediction based on a current model of the pump. External K+, Ko, failed to inhibit ouabain binding in the absence of Ki. However, Ko enhanced the inhibition by Ki. Nai also inhibited ouabain binding; this inhibition was much less affected by Ko than was inhibition by Ki, suggesting that Ki and Nai affect ouabain binding at different internal sites. Nao inhibited ouabain binding in the absence of Ki or Ko, so Nao and Ko also act at different sites. With Nao present, Ki stimulated ouabain binding. Thus a condition was found in which the predicted stimulation of binding by Ki was observed. The results of this study are interpreted in terms of three phosphoenzyme forms of the pump: E1P, E*P, and E2P. E*P is the form binding ouabain with highest affinity. Ki promotes E*P----E2P, thereby inhibiting ouabain binding. Ko binds only to E2P, therefore Ki is required for inhibition by Ko, and there is little E2P present with no Ki. Nao inhibits binding by stabilizing E1P whereas Nai inhibits by stabilizing E1. The stimulation by Ki with Nao present means that Ki and Nao together favor formation of E*P. Furthermore, Ki and Nao may bind to the pump simultaneously. Ki may play a role in the normal pump cycle, binding at allosteric sites to promote E*P----E2P."
