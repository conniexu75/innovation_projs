https://openalex.org/W2902477192,"Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in mediating motivated behaviors, but the circuitry through which they signal positive and negative motivational stimuli is incompletely understood. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we simultaneously recorded activity in DA terminals in different nucleus accumbens (NAc) subnuclei during an aversive and reward conditioning task. We find that DA terminals in the ventral NAc medial shell (vNAcMed) are excited by unexpected aversive outcomes and to cues that predict them, whereas DA terminals in other NAc subregions are persistently depressed. Excitation to reward-predictive cues dominated in the NAc lateral shell and was largely absent in the vNAcMed. Moreover, we demonstrate that glutamatergic (VGLUT2-expressing) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus represent a key afferent input for providing information about aversive outcomes to vNAcMed-projecting DA neurons. Collectively, we reveal the distinct functional contributions of separate mesolimbic DA subsystems and their afferent pathways underlying motivated behaviors. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2953085940,"The brain is a massive neuronal network, organized into anatomically distributed sub-circuits, with functionally relevant activity occurring at timescales ranging from milliseconds to years. Current methods to monitor neural activity, however, lack the necessary conjunction of anatomical spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and long-term stability to measure this distributed activity. Here we introduce a large-scale, multi-site, extracellular recording platform that integrates polymer electrodes with a modular stacking headstage design supporting up to 1,024 recording channels in freely behaving rats. This system can support months-long recordings from hundreds of well-isolated units across multiple brain regions. Moreover, these recordings are stable enough to track large numbers of single units for over a week. This platform enables large-scale electrophysiological interrogation of the fast dynamics and long-timescale evolution of anatomically distributed circuits, and thereby provides a new tool for understanding brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W2903493397,"Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells were found to frequently express the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, particularly in immune-reactive environments and after therapeutic cancer vaccination. High-dimensional cluster analysis demonstrated that NKG2A marks a unique immune effector subset preferentially co-expressing the tissue-resident CD103 molecule, but not immune checkpoint inhibitors. To examine whether NKG2A represented an adaptive resistance mechanism to cancer vaccination, we blocked the receptor with an antibody and knocked out its ligand Qa-1b, the conserved ortholog of HLA-E, in four mouse tumor models. The impact of therapeutic vaccines was greatly potentiated by disruption of the NKG2A/Qa-1b axis even in a PD-1 refractory mouse model. NKG2A blockade therapy operated through CD8 T cells, but not NK cells. These findings indicate that NKG2A-blocking antibodies might improve clinical responses to therapeutic cancer vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2902678964,"Cas12a, also known as Cpf1, is a type V-A CRISPR-Cas RNA-guided endonuclease that is used for genome editing based on its ability to generate specific dsDNA breaks. Here, we show cryo-EM structures of intermediates of the cleavage reaction, thus visualizing three protein regions that sense the crRNA-DNA hybrid assembly triggering the catalytic activation of Cas12a. Single-molecule FRET provides the thermodynamics and kinetics of the conformational activation leading to phosphodiester bond hydrolysis. These findings illustrate why Cas12a cuts its target DNA and unleashes unspecific cleavage activity, degrading ssDNA molecules after activation. In addition, we show that other crRNAs are able to displace the R-loop inside the protein after target DNA cleavage, terminating indiscriminate ssDNA degradation. We propose a model whereby the conformational activation of the enzyme results in indiscriminate ssDNA cleavage. The displacement of the R-loop by a new crRNA molecule will reset Cas12a specificity, targeting new DNAs."

Here we provide evidence that injured peripheral nerves provide a reservoir of mesenchymal precursor cells that can directly contribute to murine digit tip regeneration and skin repair. In particular, using single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing, we identify transcriptionally distinct mesenchymal cell populations within the control and injured adult nerve, including neural crest-derived cells in the endoneurium with characteristics of mesenchymal precursor cells. Culture and transplantation studies show that these nerve-derived mesenchymal cells have the potential to differentiate into non-nerve lineages. Moreover, following digit tip amputation, neural crest-derived nerve mesenchymal cells contribute to the regenerative blastema and, ultimately, to the regenerated bone. Similarly, neural crest-derived nerve mesenchymal cells contribute to the dermis during skin wound healing. These findings support a model where peripheral nerves directly contribute mesenchymal precursor cells to promote repair and regeneration of injured mammalian tissues.

Peripheral nerves are essential for regeneration in organisms like amphibians (Kumar and Brockes, 2012Kumar A. Brockes J.P. Nerve dependence in tissue, organ, and appendage regeneration.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 691-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas in non-regenerative mammals, they promote repair of tissues like the heart (Mahmoud et al., 2015Mahmoud A.I.

These pro-regenerative effects are in part due to regulation of tissue-resident stem cells in two ways. First, terminal axons secrete ligands that positively influence the local microenvironment. Second, local nerve injury causes dedifferentiation of nerve-associated Schwann cells, which then secrete growth factors such as newt anterior gradient protein in amphibian limbs (Kumar and Brockes, 2012Kumar A.

Previous studies have focused on neural components of peripheral nerves, but nerves also contain mesenchymal cells (Figure 1A). Peripheral nerves have an epineurial connective tissue sheath, and within this sheath are nerve fascicles that are each enclosed by a specialized mesenchymal perineurium. Each fascicle also contains endoneurial mesenchymal cells closely intermingled with axons and Schwann cells (Joseph et al., 2004Joseph N.M. Mukouyama Y.-S. Mosher J.T. Jaegle M. Crone S.A. Dormand E.-L. Lee K.-F. Meijer D. Anderson D.J. Morrison S.J.

Cytochem. 2014; 62: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following nerve injury, these mesenchymal cells collaborate with dedifferentiated Schwann cells to repair nerve structure and provide a supportive axon outgrowth environment (Cattin and Lloyd, 2016Cattin A.L. Lloyd A.C. The multicellular complexity of peripheral nerve regeneration.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 39: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The robust regenerative capacity of the injured nerve is exemplified by studies showing that transplanted nerve grafts promote CNS regeneration (Richardson et al., 1980Richardson P.M. McGuinness U.M. Aguayo A.J. Axons from CNS neurons regenerate into PNS grafts.Nature. 1980; 284: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Here we have examined nerve mesenchymal cells in the context of tissue injury. Our data support a model where tissue damage induces a local nerve injury response that results in nerve mesenchymal precursor-like cells migrating into adjacent damaged mesenchymal tissues, where they directly contribute to tissue repair. These results explain, in part, the nerve dependence of mammalian tissue repair and, because nerves innervate virtually every tissue in the body, have broad implications. To find out more about peripheral nerve mesenchymal cells, we characterized sciatic nerves of mice with an EGFP reporter knocked into the Pdgfra gene (PdgfraEGFP/+ mice) (Hamilton et al., 2003Hamilton T.G. Klinghoffer R.A. Corrin P.D. Soriano P. Evolutionary divergence of platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor signaling mechanisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4013-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) because PDGFRα marks diverse mesenchymal precursors (Farahani and Xaymardan, 2015Farahani R.M. Xaymardan M. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha as a marker of mesenchymal stem cells in development and stem cell biology.Stem Cells Int. 2015; 2015: 362753Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many EGFP-positive cells were found in the nerve endoneurium, and these expressed immunodetectable PDGFRα protein (97.4% ± 0.5%, n = 3), the nerve mesenchymal cell marker CD34 (Richard et al., 2014Richard L. Védrenne N. Vallat J.-M. Funalot B. Characterization of endoneurial fibroblast-like cells from human and rat peripheral nerves.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2014; 62: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (98.7% ± 0.6%; n = 3), and Thy1, which is also found on axons (Joseph et al., 2004Joseph N.M. Mukouyama Y.-S. Mosher J.T. Jaegle M. Crone S.A. Dormand E.-L. Lee K.-F. Meijer D. Anderson D.J. Morrison S.J. Neural crest stem cells undergo multilineage differentiation in developing peripheral nerves to generate endoneurial fibroblasts in addition to Schwann cells.Development. 2004; 131: 5599-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar; Figures 1A–1C, S1A, and S1B). The epineurial and perineurial sheaths also contained Pdgfra-EGFP-positive mesenchymal cells (60.5% ± 6.0% of total positive cells, n = 3) that were positive for PDGFRα protein (100.0% ± 0.0%, n = 3) and CD34 (99.1% ± 0.6%, n = 3) (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1C). All Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells were negative for the Schwann cell and axon markers S100β (Figure S1A) and p75. To find out whether Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells were altered by injury, we unilaterally resected the sciatic nerve and analyzed distal nerve segments 9 days later. Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells were present in all injured nerve compartments and were positive for PDGFRα protein (endoneurium and epi-perineurium: 99.2% ± 0.3% and 100.0% ± 0.0%, respectively; n = 3), CD34 (endoneurium and epi-perineurium: 99.6% ± 0.2% and 99.2% ± 0.8%, respectively; n = 3) and Thy1 but negative for S100β (Figures 1D, 1E, S1D, and S1E). Intriguingly, following injury, the density of Pdgfra-EGFP-positive endoneurial cells was increased about 3-fold (Figures 1F, S1C, and S1F). There were also many Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells at the distal nerve stump (Figure 1G) that likely correspond to previously described bridge or repair fibroblasts (Parrinello et al., 2010Parrinello S. Napoli I. Ribeiro S. Wingfield Digby P. Fedorova M. Parkinson D.B. Doddrell R.D.S. Nakayama M. Adams R.H. Lloyd A.C. EphB signaling directs peripheral nerve regeneration through Sox2-dependent Schwann cell sorting.Cell. 2010; 143: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We assessed whether this expansion was due to injury-induced proliferation by resecting sciatic nerves and injecting EdU 2 days post-injury. Nine days post-injury, Pdgfra-EGFP-positive, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)-positive cells comprised 13.3% ± 1.1% and 12.6% ± 4.8% of total Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells in the endoneurium and epi-perineurium, respectively (n = 5) (Figure 1H). Most double-labeled cells were in the endoneurium (67.8% ± 4.4%, n = 5). By contrast, uninjured contralateral nerves contained no Pdgfra-EGFP-positive, EdU-positive cells (n = 5). Thus, Pdgfra-expressing nerve mesenchymal cells proliferate and expand following injury. To characterize nerve mesenchymal cells, we performed high-throughput, droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We resected adult sciatic nerves, isolated distal nerves 9 days later, and used Drop-seq to sequence 4,300 single-cell transcriptomes to an average depth of more than 70,000 reads per cell, as confirmed by knee-plot histograms of the cumulative fraction of total reads contributed by each cell. The average numbers of genes and transcripts, respectively, were (± SD) 1,138 ± 968 and 2,526 ± 3,078 per cell. We analyzed these single-cell transcriptomes using a pipeline that incorporates extensive low-level data quality analysis with visualization and clustering methods, as described previously (Yuzwa et al., 2017Yuzwa S.A. Borrett M.J. Innes B.T. Voronova A. Ketela T. Kaplan D.R. Bader G.D. Miller F.D. Developmental emergence of adult neural stem cells as revealed by single-cell transcriptional profiling.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 3970-3986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This resulted in 3,599 single-cell transcriptomes for further analysis. We removed genes seen in 3 or fewer cells, normalized the data, and, using genes with high variance, computed principal components for projecting cells in two dimensions using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). To identify distinct cell types, we performed clustering using the shared nearest neighbors-cliq (SNN-cliq) varying resolution parameters until differentially expressed genes in each cluster reached a lower limit of 10 (p < 0.01 FWER, family-wise error rate). This analysis resulted in 32 cell clusters (Figure 1I). To determine their identities, we overlaid cells in the t-SNEs with well-characterized marker genes, showing relative levels of expression as a color gradient. This approach (Figures 1I–1L and S1G–S1O) identified endothelial cells expressing Pecam1/Cd31, Plvap, and Esam (clusters 9, 11, 16, and 19); Schwann lineage cells expressing Ngfr/p75 and Sox10 (clusters 8, 14, 15, and 24); mast cells expressing Mcpt1, Mcpt4, Kit, and Itgb7 (cluster 32); B cells expressing Bank1, Cd19, and Ms4a1 (clusters 4, 13, and 27), T cells expressing Cd3e, Cd3g, Cxcr6, and Trac (clusters 18 and 22), natural killer (NK) cells expressing Ncr1, Nkg7, and Klrk1 (cluster 30); and macrophages or monocytes expressing Aif1/Iba1, Cd68, and, for macrophages, Emr1/F4-80 (clusters 2, 6, 23, and 31). The remaining clusters included two groups of mesenchymal cells (Figure 1I). One group (clusters 3 and 25) expressed Pdgfrb but not Pdgfra, as well as vasculature-associated smooth muscle and pericyte markers such as Desmin, Mylk, Acta2, and Rgs5 (Figures 1J–1L and S1H). The second group (clusters 1, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 20, 21, 26, 28, and 29) included mesenchymal cells expressing Pdgfra and Pdgfrb and high levels of genes like Col1a1 and Fn1 (Figures 1I–1K and S1G). To better characterize the injured nerve mesenchymal cells, we extracted raw single-cell transcriptomes for cells in the Pdgfra-positive clusters (1, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 20, 21, 26, 28, and 29; 1,227 cells in total) and reanalyzed them using the same approach with a lower limit of 20 differentially expressed genes. This resulted in 8 Pdgfra-positive cell clusters, all expressing the mesenchymal genes Col1a1, Fn1, P4hb, Cd44, Sparc, Prrx2, Cd34, and Thy1 (Figures 1M and S1P). Of these, cluster 6 was comprised of proliferating cells, as predicted by Cyclone (Figure 1N; 55% in G2 and M or S phase; Scialdone et al., 2015Scialdone A. Natarajan K.N. Saraiva L.R. Proserpio V. Teichmann S.A. Stegle O. Marioni J.C. Buettner F. Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data.Methods. 2015; 85: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and by expression of cell-cycle genes like Mki67 (67% of cells) and Top2a (70%) (Figure S1Q). We next performed differential gene expression analysis comparing each individual cluster with the average of all other clusters. Hierarchical clustering using the top 100 differentially expressed genes per cluster (Figure 1O) identified two distinct groups, one involving clusters 1, 3, and 6 and the other clusters 2 and 5. Clusters 4 and 7 comprised a third, more divergent group, and cluster 8 was distinct from all of the others. To understand these groups, we combined the differential gene expression analysis (Figure S2A) with t-SNE overlays. This analysis (Figures 1P and S2B) showed that clusters 2 and 5 expressed many genes associated with embryonic mesenchymal precursors, such as the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6, Sox8, Foxc2, Etv1, Etv4, Meox1, Etv5, and Foxd2 (21%, 6%, 14%, 21%, 31%, 14%, 31%, 14%, and 17% of cells in cluster 2). They also expressed Sox9 and Osr2 (57% and 52%), although these were more broadly expressed in other clusters. Clusters 2 and 5 were also enriched for precursor cell collagen genes like Col2a1, Col9a2, Col11a1, Col26a1, and Col28a1 (27%, 14%, 66%, 82%, and 84% in cluster 2) and genes associated with mesenchymal stem cells and/or the osteo-chondrogenic lineage, such as Nt5e/CD73, Alpl, Bmp7, A2m, Aldh1a2, Ccl9, Dusp6, Parm1, Spry4, Scube1, and Wif1 (51%, 24%, 27%, 44%, 26%, 83%, 56%, 45%, 22%, 32%, and 89% of cells in cluster 2). Correlation analysis confirmed that clusters 2 and 5 were very similar (rho = 0.94). A similar analysis showed that clusters 1 and 3 were enriched for several genes associated with mesenchymal cell differentiation (Figures 2A and S2C). These included genes important for preadipocytes and/or osteochondroprogenitors, including Dlk1/Pref-1, Mest, Bmpr1b, Cilp, and the transcription factors Plagl1 and Runx2 (52%, 92%, 11%, 74%, 67%, and 23% of cluster 1 cells). Clusters 1 and 3 were also enriched for Tnc and Ptn (70% and 75% in cluster 1), and some cells expressed Sox9 and Osr2 (25% and 17%). All of these genes were expressed in proliferative cluster 6 cells, consistent with the hierarchical clustering (Figure 1O) and with correlation analyses (rho ≥ 0.94 for all comparisons between clusters 1, 3, and 6). Thus, clusters 1, 3, and 6 are enriched for differentiating mesenchymal cell genes, whereas clusters 2 and 5 express genes characteristic of earlier, less-differentiated mesenchymal precursors. A similar analysis showed that the distinctive cells in cluster 8 were likely perineurial cells (Figures 2B and S2D). They expressed known perineurial genes like Slc2a1/Glut1, the tight junction genes Tjp1/ZO-1 and Tjp2/ZO-2, the desmosome protein Perp, and integrins Itgb4 and Itga6 (68%, 48%, 28%, 42%, 57%, and 72% of cells). They also expressed other highly specific genes, including the basement membrane genes Itga7, Col4a3, Col4a4, and Lama5 (51%, 9%, 14%, and 22%) and Ntng1, Casq2, Sfrp5, Krt19, Mpz12, Msln, and Lmo7 (42%, 49%, 98%, 45%, 49%, 54%, and 42%). By contrast, clusters 4 and 7 were highly enriched for connective tissue-associated genes (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2E) such as Gsn (95% and 100%), Ly6c1 (80% and 55%), Dpt (91% and 71%), and Pcolce2 (47% and 58%), suggesting that they might be epineurial cells. However, these clusters were also somewhat distinct, as shown by the hierarchical clustering (Figure 1O) and correlation analysis (rho = 0.91). Cluster 7 was enriched for the osteochondrogenesis genes Comp, Bmp4, and Gpnmb/osteoactivin (51%, 18%, and 46%) and for the tissue fibroblast genes Inmt, Clec11a, Cfh, Ogn, Fbln7, Fmod, and Crispld2 (62%, 66%, 77%, 94%, 57%, 35%, and 54%). Cluster 4 was instead enriched for stromal fibroblast and profibrotic genes like Cxcl13, Dpp4/Cd26, Cd55, and Adamts5 (25%, 28%, 36%, and 58%). We performed two analyses to ensure the validity of our computational clustering. First, to validate each cell’s cluster membership, we trained a random forest classification model using a subset of cells from the total injured nerve dataset (the data in Figure 1I) and then predicted cluster membership for the remaining cells. In this analysis, 80.9% ± 1.5% single-cell transcriptomes were reclassified to their original cluster, 17.6% ± 1.5% to a neighboring cluster of the same cell type (e.g., a Schwann cell reclassified into a neighboring Schwann cell cluster), and only 1.5% ± 0.4% were reclassified to clusters containing a different cell type. Thus, the vast majority (98.5%) of cells were appropriately classified by our pipeline. Second, we performed Drop-seq analysis of the 9-day injured sciatic nerve using flow cytometry instead of myelin beads to remove debris. We combined the raw single-cell transcriptomes of cells purified both ways and reanalyzed the mixed data. We identified 23 clusters containing the same cell types as in our original analysis (compare Figure S2F with Figure 1I). Importantly, cells from both preparations were closely mingled (Figure S2G), although immune cells were relatively reduced in the flow-sorted preparation. Thus, batch variation was low. We asked about the location of the clusters 2 and 5 mesenchymal precursor-like cells by immunostaining 9 day post-axotomy PdgfraEGFP/+ distal sciatic nerves for Sox5 and ALPL (alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney isozyme), which were specific to clusters 2 and 5, and for Sox9, which is somewhat more broadly expressed (Figures 2E and 2F). Almost all Pdgfra-EGFP-positive endoneurial cells were positive for nuclear Sox9 and cytoplasmic ALPL (87.7% ± 1.8% and 91.3% ± 1.5%, respectively; n = 3). Some EGFP-positive, ALPL-positive cells also expressed Sox5. By contrast, very few Pdgfra-EGFP-positive epi-perineurial cells expressed ALPL (2.1% ± 0.4%, n = 3), and only 13.5% ± 1.4% expressed Sox9 (n = 3). We also performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for two highly enriched clusters 2 and 5 collagen mRNAs, Col2a1 and Col9a2, using Sox9 mRNA as a positive control (Figures 2G, S2H, and S2I). As predicted by the immunostaining, Pdgfra-EGFP-positive endoneurial cells expressed Sox9 mRNA. A similar pattern of positive cells was observed for Col2a1 and Col9a2 mRNAs but not for negative control probes. Thus, clusters 2 and 5 cells are Pdgfra-positive endoneurial mesenchymal cells. We also localized the other nerve mesenchymal populations by immunostaining 9-day post-axotomy PdgfraEGFP/+ distal sciatic nerves for Slc2a1/Glut1 and ITGB4 (cluster 8), Dlk1/Pref-1 (clusters 1, 3, and 6), and Ly6C (clusters 4 and 7). This analysis (Figures 2H–2J, S3A, and S3C) showed that Slc2a1/Glut1 and ITGB4 were specifically localized to the perineurium, whereas immunodetectable Dlk1/Pref-1 was localized to Pdgfra-EGFP-positive, Sox9-positive cells at the injured nerve stump and adjacent nerve sheath. By contrast, Ly6C was detectable in the epineurial connective tissue and in Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells in that compartment. As predicted by scRNA-seq (Figure S3D), Ly6C was also detected in endothelial cells and in round Pdgfra-EGFP-negative cells, presumably immune cells. Thus, the injured nerve contains four Pdgfra-expressing mesenchymal populations, cluster 4/7 epineurial cells, cluster 8 perineurial cells, clusters 1 and 3 differentiating nerve stump cells, as well as clusters 2 and 5 precursor-like endoneurial cells (as in Figure 1M). To determine whether the injured nerve mesenchymal cells derive from resident cells in the uninjured nerve, we performed Drop-seq on the control sciatic nerve. We prepared cells as for the injured nerve and sequenced 2,000 cells to an average depth of more than 70,000 reads per cell, obtaining 1,027 ± 588 and 2,257 ± 2,855 average detected genes and transcripts per cell, respectively. We analyzed the data using the same parameters as for the injured nerve and identified clusters containing Pdgfra-positive mesenchymal cells. We then extracted the raw single-cell transcriptomes for cells in the Pdgfra-positive clusters (854 in total) and reanalyzed them with a lower limit of 10 differentially expressed genes. This analysis (Figure 3A) identified 5 clusters of uninjured nerve Pdgfra-positive cells, all containing cells expressing Pdgfrb, Col1a1, Fn1, Cd34, Thy1, P4hb, Cd44, and Prrx2 (Figures 3B and S3E). Almost no cells were predicted to be dividing based on expression of cell cycle genes like Top2a (Figure S3F), consistent with the EdU analysis. To identify these cells, we performed differential gene expression (Figure S3G) and t-SNE overlays. This analysis showed that cluster 5 contained perineurial cells expressing Slc2a1/Glut1, Msln, Itga7, Itga6, Itgb4, Casq2, Col4a3, Krt19, Lmo7, Sfrp5, and Ntng1 (72%, 46%, 54%, 68%, 82%, 48%, 12%, 42%, 42%, 95%, and 68%) (Figures 3C and S3H). We confirmed that these were perineurial cells by immunostaining the uninjured PdgfraEGFP/+ sciatic nerve for ITGB4 and Slc2a1/Glut1 (Figures 2K and S3B). A similar analysis (Figures 3D and S3I) showed that the closely grouped clusters 2 and 4 included epineurial cells. Both clusters were highly enriched for Dpt, Pcolce2, and Ly6c1 (98%, 85%, and 90% for cluster 4) but were somewhat distinct because cluster 2 was specifically enriched in Comp, Bmp4, Gpnmb/osteoactivin, Clec11a, Cfh, Ogn, Fbln7, Fmod, and Crispld2 (41%, 28%, 26%, 52%, 59%, 97%, 27%, 24%, and 52%), whereas cluster 4 was instead enriched for Cxcl13, Dpp4/Cd26, Cd55, Adamts5, and Cd248 (42%, 63%, 53%, 67%, and 86%). Ly6C immunostaining confirmed that these cells were located in the uninjured epineurium (Figure 2L). The remaining closely grouped clusters 1 and 3 included endoneurial cells (Figures 3E and S3J). As for the injured nerve, clusters 1 and 3 cells expressed the precursor-associated transcription factors Sox5, Sox6, Sox8, Foxc2, Etv1, Etv4, Meox1, Osr2, and Sox9 (13%, 6%, 17%, 10%, 24%, 8%, 12%, 62%, and 54% for cluster 1) and were enriched for Col2a1, Col9a2, Col11a1, Col26a1, Col28a1 Nt5e/CD73, Alpl, Bmp7, A2m, Ccl9, Dusp6, Parm1, and Spry4 (16%, 17%, 16%, 27%, 17%, 9%, 13%, 49%, 15%, 33%, 11%, and 22% for cluster 1). However, some injured nerve endoneurial cell genes like Wif1 were expressed in very few uninjured nerve cells (Figure S3J). We confirmed that these were endoneurial cells by immunostaining control PdgfraEGFP/+ sciatic nerves for Sox9 and ALPL (Figure 2M). In total, 48.2% ± 9.3% and 35.3% ± 5.8% of Pdgfra-EGFP endoneurial cells expressed detectable Sox9 and ALPL, respectively (n = 3). By contrast, almost no epi-perineurial Pdgfra-EGFP-positive cells expressed ALPL (0.5% ± 0.5%), and only 9.6% ± 0.6% expressed Sox9 (n = 3). Intriguingly, some endoneurial cells also expressed Dlk1/Pref-1 (Figure 2N), which, in the injured nerve, was expressed in nerve stump cells. We ensured the accuracy of the mesenchymal cell clustering by training a random forest classification model using a subset of cells from the Pdgfra-positive cell dataset (the data in Figure 3A) and then predicting cluster membership for the remaining cells. In total, 92.5% ± 1.8% of single-cell transcriptomes were reclassified to their original cluster, 7.1% ± 1.8% to a neighboring cluster of the same group (clusters 2 and 4, or clusters 1 and 3 were considered groups), and only 0.4% ± 0.4% were reclassified to a different mesenchymal cell type cluster. Thus, essentially all cells (99.6%) were appropriately classified. To find out whether injury alters nerve mesenchymal cells, we combined the raw single-cell transcriptomes from control and injured nerve Pdgfra-positive clusters and reanalyzed them together. This combined analysis (Figures 3F and 3G) identified 7 Pdgfra-positive cell clusters that expressed Col1a1, Fn1, P4hb, and Sparc. Three clusters (3, 5, and 6) included closely mingled control and injured nerve cells, one cluster (2) contained only control nerve cells, and three (1, 4, and 7) contained almost exclusively injured nerve cells. Differential gene expression analysis (Figure 3H) together with t-SNE overlays showed that mixed cluster 6 included control and injured perineurial cells expressing Casq2, Col4a3, Col4a4, Itga6, Itga7, Itgb4, Krt19, Lama5, Lmo7, Lypd2, Mpzl2, Msln, Ntng1, Perp, Sfrp5, Slc2a1, and Tjp1 (Figure 3J). The other two mixed cell clusters (3 and 5) included the control and injured epineurial cells expressing Dpt, Gsn, and Pcolce2, with cluster 3 enriched for Comp, Bmp4, and Gpnmb/osteoactivin and cluster 5 for Dpp4, Cd55, Adamts5, and Cxcl13 (Figure 3K). Correlation analyses confirmed the similarities between control and injured nerve perineurial and epineurial cells (rho ≥ 0.95 in all cases). The remaining injured nerve mesenchymal cells clustered independently. Cluster 1 contained the injured nerve stump cells and cluster 7 the related proliferative cells (Figure 3I) (clusters 1/3 and 6, respectively, in Figure 1M), identified by their expression of Dlk1/Pref-1, Mest, Plagl1, Runx2, Bmpr1b, Cilp, Tnc, and Ptn (Figure 3L). There was no similar cluster in the control nerve, indicating that a transcriptionally distinct nerve stump mesenchymal population appears after injury. The other injured nerve-only cluster (4) contained endoneurial cells. These clustered away from the control nerve endoneurial cells, which were found in cluster 2 (Figures 3F and 3G). Both endoneurial clusters were highly enriched for genes like Col2a1, Meox1, Dusp6, Sox5, A2m, and Parm1 (Figure 3M). However, differential gene expression identified many genes upregulated in the injured endoneurial cells, including Aldh1a2, C3, Ccl2, Ccl9, Cfh, Col11a1, Col26a1, Col28a1, Cthrc1, Inhbb, Kng2, and Wif1 (Figure 3N). Conversely, some connective tissue-associated genes were downregulated by injury, including Bmp4, Clec3b, Crispld2, Enpp2, and Myoc (Figure 3O). We validated the differences between control and injured cells using the mutual nearest neighbors batch effect correction method (Haghverdi et al., 2018Haghverdi L. Lun A.T.L. Morgan M.D. Marioni J.C. Batch effects in single-cell RNA-sequencing data are corrected by matching mutual nearest neighbors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In the corrected dataset (Figures S3K and S3L), control and injured nerve perineurial and epineurial cells were co-clustered, whereas injured and control endoneurial cells clustered away from each other. Thus, endoneurial cells are transcriptionally altered by nerve injury, perhaps becoming more precursor-like. We tested the idea that nerves contain mesenchymal precursor-like cells by performing differentiation assays. We cultured and expanded postnatal day 3 (P3)–P5 sciatic nerve cells and plated them under osteogenic, adipogenic, or chondrogenic conditions. After 14–21 days we stained them, as appropriate, with alizarin red S, oil red O, or Alcian blue (Figures 4A–4C). This analysis identified many alizarin red-positive mineralized nodules under osteogenic conditions, large cells with oil red O-positive droplets under adipogenic conditions, and very large Alcian blue-positive masses under chondrogenic conditions (Figures 4A–4C). Under osteogenic conditions, extracellul"
https://openalex.org/W2902663240,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons provide an opportunity to model Parkinson’s disease (PD), but neuronal cultures are confounded by asynchronous and heterogeneous appearance of disease phenotypes in vitro. Using high-resolution, single-cell transcriptomic analyses of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons carrying the GBA-N370S PD risk variant, we identified a progressive axis of gene expression variation leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Pseudotime analysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) along this axis identified the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as an upstream regulator of disease progression. HDAC4 was mislocalized to the nucleus in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and repressed genes early in the disease axis, leading to late deficits in protein homeostasis. Treatment of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons with HDAC4-modulating compounds upregulated genes early in the DE axis and corrected PD-related cellular phenotypes. Our study demonstrates how single-cell transcriptomics can exploit cellular heterogeneity to reveal disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2903103803,"Trypanosome parasites control their virulence and spread by using quorum sensing (QS) to generate transmissible ""stumpy forms"" in their host bloodstream. However, the QS signal ""stumpy induction factor"" (SIF) and its reception mechanism are unknown. Although trypanosomes lack G protein-coupled receptor signaling, we have identified a surface GPR89-family protein that regulates stumpy formation. TbGPR89 is expressed on bloodstream ""slender form"" trypanosomes, which receive the SIF signal, and when ectopically expressed, TbGPR89 drives stumpy formation in a SIF-pathway-dependent process. Structural modeling of TbGPR89 predicts unexpected similarity to oligopeptide transporters (POT), and when expressed in bacteria, TbGPR89 transports oligopeptides. Conversely, expression of an E. coli POT in trypanosomes drives parasite differentiation, and oligopeptides promote stumpy formation in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of secreted trypanosome oligopeptidases generates a paracrine signal that accelerates stumpy formation in vivo. Peptidase-generated oligopeptide QS signals being received through TbGPR89 provides a mechanism for both trypanosome SIF production and reception."
https://openalex.org/W4238339008,"Csm, a type III-A CRISPR-Cas interference complex, is a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided RNase that also possesses target RNA-dependent DNase and cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) synthetase activities. However, the structural features allowing target RNA-binding-dependent activation of DNA cleavage and cOA generation remain unknown. Here, we report the structure of Csm in complex with crRNA together with structures of cognate or non-cognate target RNA bound Csm complexes. We show that depending on complementarity with the 5' tag of crRNA, the 3' anti-tag region of target RNA binds at two distinct sites of the Csm complex. Importantly, the interaction between the non-complementary anti-tag region of cognate target RNA and Csm1 induces a conformational change at the Csm1 subunit that allosterically activates DNA cleavage and cOA generation. Together, our structural studies provide crucial insights into the mechanistic processes required for crRNA-meditated sequence-specific RNA cleavage, RNA target-dependent non-specific DNA cleavage, and cOA generation."
https://openalex.org/W2902676103,"Nervous system function depends on proper myelination for insulation and critical trophic support for axons. Myelination is tightly regulated spatially and temporally, but how it is controlled molecularly remains largely unknown. Here, we identified key molecular mechanisms governing the regional and temporal specificity of CNS myelination. We show that transcription factor EB (TFEB) is highly expressed by differentiating oligodendrocytes and that its loss causes precocious and ectopic myelination in many parts of the murine brain. TFEB functions cell-autonomously through PUMA induction and Bax-Bak activation to promote programmed cell death of a subset of premyelinating oligodendrocytes, allowing selective elimination of oligodendrocytes in normally unmyelinated brain regions. This pathway is conserved across diverse brain areas and is critical for myelination timing. Our findings define an oligodendrocyte-intrinsic mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal specificity of CNS myelination, shedding light on how myelinating glia sculpt the nervous system during development."
https://openalex.org/W2902120147,"The importance of integrating research findings is incontrovertible and procedures for coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) such as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) have become a popular approach to combine results of fMRI studies when only peaks of activation are reported. As meta-analytical findings help building cumulative knowledge and guide future research, not only the quality of such analyses but also the way conclusions are drawn is extremely important. Like classical meta-analyses, coordinate-based meta-analyses can be subject to different forms of publication bias which may impact results and invalidate findings. The file drawer problem refers to the problem where studies fail to get published because they do not obtain anticipated results (e.g. due to lack of statistical significance). To enable assessing the stability of meta-analytical results and determine their robustness against the potential presence of the file drawer problem, we present an algorithm to determine the number of noise studies that can be added to an existing ALE fMRI meta-analysis before spatial convergence of reported activation peaks over studies in specific regions is no longer statistically significant. While methods to gain insight into the validity and limitations of results exist for other coordinate-based meta-analysis toolboxes, such as Galbraith plots for Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) and funnel plots and egger tests for seed-based d mapping, this procedure is the first to assess robustness against potential publication bias for the ALE algorithm. The method assists in interpreting meta-analytical results with the appropriate caution by looking how stable results remain in the presence of unreported information that may differ systematically from the information that is included. At the same time, the procedure provides further insight into the number of studies that drive the meta-analytical results. We illustrate the procedure through an example and test the effect of several parameters through extensive simulations. Code to generate noise studies is made freely available which enables users to easily use the algorithm when interpreting their results."

Here, using a radial eight-arm maze, we examined how the combined demand on these memories influenced CA1 place cell assemblies while reference memories were partially updated. This was contrasted with control tasks requiring only working memory or the update of reference memory. Reference memory update led to the reward-directed place field shifts at newly rewarded arms and to the gradual strengthening of firing in passes between newly rewarded arms but not between those passes that included a familiar-rewarded arm. At the maze center, transient network synchronization periods preferentially replayed trajectories of the next chosen arm in reference memory tasks but the previously visited arm in the working memory task. Hence, reference memory demand was uniquely associated with a gradual, goal novelty-related reorganization of place cell assemblies and with trajectory replay that reflected the animal’s decision of which arm to visit next."
https://openalex.org/W2903249677,"Recent advances in the efficacy and tolerability of hepatitis C treatments and the introduction of a universal access scheme for the new Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapies in March 2016, has resulted in a rapid increase in the uptake of hepatitis C treatment in Australia. Despite these positive developments, recent data suggest a plateauing of treatment numbers, indicating that more work may need to be done to identify and address ongoing barriers to hepatitis C treatment access and uptake. This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the ongoing barriers to DAA therapies, with a focus on people who inject drugs. The paper draws on participant interview data from a qualitative research study based on a participatory research design that included a peer researcher with direct experience of both hepatitis C DAA treatment and injecting drug use at all stages of the research process. The study's findings show that residual barriers to DAA treatment exist at personal, provider and system levels and include poor venous access, DAA treatments not considered 'core-business' by opioid substitution treatment (OST) providers, and patients having to manage multiple health and social priorities that interfere with keeping medical appointments such as childcare and poor access to transport services. Further, efforts to increase access to and uptake of DAA hepatitis C treatment over time will require a focus on reducing stigma and discrimination towards people who inject drugs as this remains as a major barrier to care for many people."
https://openalex.org/W2903258063,"Increases in sodium concentrations ([Na+]) in body fluids elevate blood pressure (BP) by enhancing sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). However, the mechanisms by which information on increased [Na+] is translated to SNA have not yet been elucidated. We herein reveal that sympathetic activation leading to BP increases is not induced by mandatory high salt intakes or the intraperitoneal/intracerebroventricular infusions of hypertonic NaCl solutions in Nax-knockout mice in contrast to wild-type mice. We identify Nax channels expressed in specific glial cells in the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) as the sensors detecting increases in [Na+] in body fluids and show that OVLT neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are activated via acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) by H+ ions exported from Nax-positive glial cells. The present results provide an insight into the neurogenic mechanisms responsible for salt-induced BP elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2903322254,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), whose expression is frequently dysregulated in cancer, promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by multiple mechanisms, including extracellular matrix remodeling and growth-factor and cytokine activation. We developed a monoclonal antibody against murine MMP-9, which we found decreased growth of established primary tumors in an orthotopic model of HER2-driven breast cancer (HC11-NeuT) in immunocompetent mice. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) profiling of NeuT tumors and additional mouse model tumors revealed that anti-MMP-9 treatment resulted in upregulation of immune signature pathways associated with cytotoxic T-cell response. As there is a need to boost the low response rates observed with anti-PDL1 antibody treatment in the clinical setting, we assessed the potential of anti-MMP-9 to improve T-cell response to immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PDL1 in NeuT tumors. Anti-MMP-9 and anti-PDL1 cotreatment reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality and increased TCR diversity, as detected by TCR sequencing of NeuT tumors. Flow cytometry analyses of tumors showed that the combination treatment increased the frequency of CD3+ T cells, including memory/effector CD4 and CD8 T cells, but not regulatory T cells, among tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Moreover, in vitro enzymatic assays corroborated that MMP-9 cleaves key T-cell chemoattractant CXC receptor 3 ligands (CXC ligand [CXCL] 9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) and renders them inactive in T-cell migration assays. Consistent with our in vitro experiments, analysis of NeuT tumor protein lysates showed that anti-MMP-9 treatment increases expression of CXCL10 and other T cell–stimulating factors, such as interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-18. We show that inhibition of MMP-9, a key component of the tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive myeloid inflammatory milieu, increases T-helper cell 1 type cytokines, trafficking of effector/memory T cells into tumors, and intratumoral T-cell diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2902867997,"Understanding transcription factor navigation through the nucleus remains critical for developing targeted therapeutics. The GLI1 transcription factor must maintain maximal Hedgehog pathway output in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and we have previously shown that resistant BCCs increase GLI1 deacetylation through atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (aPKC) and HDAC1. Here we identify a lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) isoform-dependent nuclear chaperoning system that regulates GLI1 movement between the nuclear lamina and nucleoplasm to achieve maximal activation. LAP2β forms a two-site interaction with the GLI1 zinc-finger domain and acetylation site, stabilizing an acetylation-dependent reserve on the inner nuclear membrane (INM). By contrast, the nucleoplasmic LAP2α competes with LAP2β for GLI1 while scaffolding HDAC1 to deacetylate the secondary binding site. aPKC functions to promote GLI1 association with LAP2α, promoting egress off the INM. GLI1 intranuclear trafficking by LAP2 isoforms represents a powerful signal amplifier in BCCs with implications for zinc finger-based signal transduction and therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2902713708,"Preeclampsia is the most frequent pregnancy-related complication worldwide with no cure. While a number of molecular features have emerged, the underlying causal mechanisms behind the disorder remain obscure. Here, we find that increased complex formation between angiotensin II AT1 and bradykinin B2, two G protein-coupled receptors with opposing effects on blood vessel constriction, triggers symptoms of preeclampsia in pregnant mice. Aberrant heteromerization of AT1-B2 led to exaggerated calcium signaling and high vascular smooth muscle mechanosensitivity, which could explain the onset of preeclampsia symptoms at late-stage pregnancy as mechanical forces increase with fetal mass. AT1-B2 receptor aggregation was inhibited by beta-arrestin-mediated downregulation. Importantly, symptoms of preeclampsia were prevented by transgenic ARRB1 expression or a small-molecule drug. Because AT1-B2 heteromerization was found to occur in human placental biopsies from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, specifically targeting AT1-B2 heteromerization and its downstream consequences represents a promising therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2903279811,"Human intestinal transplantation often results in long-term mixed chimerism of donor and recipient blood in transplant patients. We followed the phenotypes of chimeric peripheral blood cells in 21 patients receiving intestinal allografts over 5 years. Donor lymphocyte phenotypes suggested a contribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the graft. Surprisingly, we detected donor-derived HSPCs in intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. Human gut HSPCs are phenotypically similar to bone marrow HSPCs and have multilineage differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of circulating post-transplant donor T cells suggests that they undergo selection in recipient lymphoid organs to acquire immune tolerance. Our longitudinal study of human HSPCs carried in intestinal allografts demonstrates their turnover kinetics and gradual replacement of donor-derived HSPCs from a circulating pool. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of functioning HSPCs in human intestines with implications for promoting tolerance in transplant recipients."

However, the underlying mechanisms that would fully explain IDP antioxidant effects remain obscure. Here, using HPLC–electrospray ionization–tandem MS analyses, we comprehensively investigated carnosine and its related small peptides in the soluble fractions of mouse tissue homogenates and ubiquitously detected 2-oxo-histidine–containing dipeptides (2-oxo-IDPs) in all examined tissues. We noted enhanced production of the 2-oxo-IDPs in the brain of a mouse model of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Moreover, in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably expressing carnosine synthase, H2O2 exposure resulted in the intracellular production of 2-oxo-carnosine, which was associated with significant inhibition of the H2O2 cytotoxicity. Notably, 2-oxo-carnosine showed a better antioxidant activity than endogenous antioxidants such as GSH and ascorbate. Mechanistic studies indicated that carnosine monooxygenation is mediated through the formation of a histidyl-imidazole radical, followed by the addition of molecular oxygen.

Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) are ecologically important and diverse members, living from the shallow waters to the hadal trench. In this study, we present the mitochondrial genome sequence of the sea cucumber Benthodytes marianensis collected from the Mariana Trench. To our knowledge, this is the first reported mitochondrial genome from the genus Benthodytes. This complete mitochondrial genome is 17567 bp in length and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes (duplication of two tRNAs: trnL and trnS). Most of these genes are coded on the positive strand except for one protein-coding gene (nad6) and five tRNA genes which are coded on the negative strand. Two putative control regions (CRs) have been found in the B. marianensis mitogenome. We compared the order of genes from the 10 available holothurian mitogenomes and found a novel gene arrangement in B. marianensis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that B. marianensis clustered with Peniagone sp. YYH-2013, forming the deep-sea Elasipodida clade. Positive selection analysis showed that eleven residues (24 S, 45 S, 185 S, 201 G, 211 F and 313 N in nad2; 108 S, 114 S, 322 C, 400 T and 427 S in nad4) were positively selected sites with high posterior probabilities. We predict that nad2 and nad4 may be the important candidate genes for the further investigation of the adaptation of B. marianensis to the deep-sea environment."
https://openalex.org/W2902989700,"Background Contextual factors (CFs) represent a potential therapeutic tool to boost physiotherapy outcomes, triggering placebo effects. Nevertheless, no evidence about the use of CFs among physical therapists is currently available. Objective To investigate the use of CFs and the opinion of Italian physical therapists specialized in Orthopaedic Manual Therapy (OMTs) on their therapeutic benefits. Design An exploratory cross-sectional online survey. Methods A 17-item questionnaire and 2 clinical vignettes assessed the perspective of OMTs on the adoption of CFs in daily clinical practice. The target population was composed of 906 OMTs. An online survey was performed in 2016 using SurveyMonkey Software. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results A total of 558 volunteers (61.6% of the target OMT population) participated in the study. Half of the participants (52.0%) claimed to use CFs frequently in their practice. More of 50% of OMTs valued the therapeutic significance of CFs for different health problems as determined by a combined psychological and physiological effect. OMTs considered the use of CFs ethically acceptable when they exert beneficial therapeutic effects and their effectiveness has emerged in previous clinical experiences (30.6%). They disagreed on the adoption of CFs when they are deceptive (14.1%). Moreover, OMTs did not communicate the adoption of CFs to patients (38.2%), and CFs were usually used in addition to other interventions to optimize clinical responses (19.9%). Psychological mechanisms, patient’s expectation and conditioning were believed to be the main components behind CFs (7.9%). Limitations Considering that the data collected were self-reported and retrospective, recall and response biases may limit the internal and external validity of the findings. Conclusions OMTs used CFs in their clinical practice and believed in their therapeutic effect. The knowledge of CFs, placebo and nocebo mechanisms and their clinical effects should be included in physical therapists’ university studies."

This has generated disagreement about the limits and existence of different biogeographic units. In this study, the distribution of rocky-shore macrobenthic communities were recorded over 41 sites along the Peruvian coastline (3.5°S-13.5°S) and analyzed together with historic abiotic data in order to quantitatively evaluate the biogeographic zonation of rocky intertidal communities throughout the region and its relationship with environmental variables to propose an update bioregionalization. Clusters and non-metric multidimensional scaling were performed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices from abundance data to evaluate biogeographic patterns of dissimilarities of rocky-shore communities. Significant turnover of taxa among defined biogeographical units was tested using permutational multivariate dispersion. Relationships between of the biogeographical community's structure and environmental factors were examined using Random Forest analysis on datasets available at Bio-Oracle and Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology. Variation of community structure of 239 taxa depicted three biogeographical units along the region matching Panamic, transitional and Humboldt provinces. Beta diversity analysis indicated a significant turnover of taxa within the transitional unit. Random forest analysis showed a strong correlation between biogeographic units with phosphate, sea surface temperature, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, cloud fraction, and silicates. Our results set the putative limits of three biogeographic units for rocky-shore communities along the coast of Peru, providing base-line information for understanding further biogeographic changes on communities associated with the ongoing regional coastal cooling and impacts of El Niño events."
https://openalex.org/W2902068869,"Subgroups of patients with severe asthma are insensitive to inhaled corticosteroids and require novel therapies on top of standard medical care. IL-13 is considered one of the key cytokines in the asthma pathogenesis, however, the effect of IL-13 was mostly studied in rodents. This study aimed to assess IL-13 effect in human lung tissue for the development of targeted therapy approaches such as inhibition of soluble IL-13 or its receptor IL-4Rα subunit. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from lungs of rodents, non-human primates (NHP) and humans. Direct effect of IL-13 on human lung tissue was observed on inflammation, induction of mucin5AC, and airway constriction induced by methacholine and visualized by videomicroscopy. Anti-inflammatory treatment was evaluated by co-incubation of IL-13 with increasing concentrations of IL-13/IL-13 receptor inhibitors. IL-13 induced a two-fold increase in mucin5AC secretion in human bronchial tissue. Additionally, IL-13 induced release of proinflammatory cytokines eotaxin-3 and TARC in human PCLS. Anti-inflammatory treatment with four different inhibitors acting either on the IL-13 ligand itself (anti-IL-13 antibody, similar to Lebrikizumab) or the IL-4Rα chain of the IL-13/IL-4 receptor complex (anti-IL-4Rα #1, similar to AMG 317, and #2, similar to REGN668) and #3 PRS-060 (a novel anticalin directed against this receptor) could significantly attenuate IL-13 induced inflammation. Contrary to this, IL-13 did not induce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in human and NHP PCLS, although it was effective in rodent PCLS. Overall, this study demonstrates that IL-13 stimulation induces production of mucus and biomarkers of allergic inflammation in human lung tissue ex-vivo but no airway hyperresponsiveness. The results of this study show a more distinct efficacy than known from animals models and a clear discrepancy in AHR induction. Moreover, it allows a translational approach in inhibitor profiling in human lung tissue."

The purpose of this study was to describe national trends in gastric acid suppressant use over a 7-year period. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2015. Gastric acid suppressant use was defined as any outpatient visit with a documented prescription for a proton pump inhibitor or histamine-2 receptor antagonist documented during the outpatient visit. Sample data weights were used to extrapolate to national estimates. Use was calculated as the number of prescriptions per total outpatient visits per year. Appropriateness of prescribing was assessed using FDA-approved indications listed in each visit. Results These data represent 6.8 billion patient outpatient visits between 2009 and 2015, of which nearly 600 million (8.8%) had documented gastric acid suppressant use. The median (IQR) age of gastric acid suppressant users and non-gastric acid suppressant users was 62 (50–73) and 49 (25–65), respectively. Gastric acid suppressant use decreased from 9.0% in 2009 to 7.7% in 2012, and then increased to 9.7% in 2015. Proton pump inhibitor use was slightly higher in the Midwest (8.3%). Only 15.8% of gastric acid suppressant users had a documented indication. Conclusions Proton pump inhibitor use increased after 2012, and the majority of gastric acid suppressant users did not have a documented indication. Judicious gastric acid suppressant prescribing needs to be exercised, especially in the context of new safety data regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor use."

The experiment consisted of a 2 × 2 factorial design where main factors included provision of analgesia and local anaesthesia. Analgesia consisted of: no-meloxicam (N; n = 24) single s.c. administration of lactated ringer's solution and meloxicam (M; n = 24) single dose of 0.5 mg/kg of s.c. meloxicam. Local anesthesia consisted of: no-lidocaine (R; n = 24) ring block administration of lactated ringer's solution or lidociane (L; n = 24) ring block administration of lidocaine. To yield the following treatments: no meloxicam + no lidocaine (N-R; n = 12), no meloxicam + lidocaine (N-L; n = 12), meloxicam + no lidocaine (M-R; n = 12) and meloxicam + lidocaine (M-L; n = 12). Salivary cortisol concentrations were lower (lidocaine × time effect; P < 0.01) in L calves than R calves 0.5 and 1 hours after castration, while concentrations were lower (meloxicam × time effect; P = 0.02) in M calves than N calves at 2, 4 and 48 hours. The serum amyloid-A concentrations were greater (lidocaine × time effect; P < 0.01) in R calves than L calves on days 1, 3, 21 and 28 after castration. Haptoglobin concentrations were greater (meloxicam × time effect; P = 0.01) in N calves than M calves 24 and 48 hours after castration. Lower (lidocaine effect; P < 0.01) visual analog scale (VAS) scores, leg movement frequencies and head movement distance were observed in L calves than R calves at the time of castration. Escape behaviour during castration was lower (lidocaine effect; P < 0.05) in L calves than R calves based on data captured with accelerometer and head gate devices. Scrotal circumference had a triple interaction (lidocaine × meloxicam × time; P = 0.03), where M-R calves had greater scrotal circumference than M-L calves 28 d after castration, but no differences were observed between both groups and N-R and N-L calves. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed for average daily gain (ADG), weights or feeding behaviour. Overall, both lidocaine and meloxicam reduced physiological and behavioural indicators of pain. Although there was only one meloxicam × lidocaine interaction, lidocaine and meloxicam reduced physiological and behavioural parameters at different time points, which could be more effective at mitigating pain than either drug on its own."
https://openalex.org/W2903030190,"Maternal mentalization refers to a mother’s capacity to understand mental-states of herself and her child and to regard her child as a psychological agent. In mother-infant interactions, this capacity is commonly conceptualized as maternal mind-mindedness, which can be divided into two dimensions: appropriate and nonattuned interpretations of the infants’ mental-states. Appropriate mind-mindedness refers to interpretations that seem to be compatible with the infant’s behaviors, whereas nonattuned mind-mindedness refers to noncompatible interpretations. The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive mechanisms that contribute to mind-mindedness. Specifically, we investigated the role of executive functions in appropriate and nonattuned mind-mindedness, and the moderating roles of two infant-related factors, prematurity (as a stressful context) and child temperament (as a context of unpredictability and negative emotionality). To this end, mother-infant free play interactions were coded for mind-mindedness in a sample of 102 mothers and their 6-month-old infants (61 preterm, 41 full-term). When children were 66-months old, mothers completed cognitive tasks that assessed working memory updating, resistance to interference, response inhibition, and shifting. Appropriate mind-mindedness was positively associated with updating, and this link was stronger when infant temperament was rated as more difficult. Furthermore, among mothers of full-term infants, mothers’ resistance to interference was negatively associated with nonattuned mind-mindedness. This link was not evident in the stressful context of premature birth. Mothers’ response inhibition and shifting were not associated with either of the mind-mindedness dimensions. Implications on understanding variability in maternal mentalization during mother-infant interactions and the roles of executive functions in parenting are discussed."

Although much is known about the antifungal spectrum of phenamacril, the exact mechanism behind the phenamacril-mediated inhibition remains to be resolved. Here, we describe the characterization of the effect of phenamacril on purified myosin motor constructs from the model plant pathogen and phenamacril-susceptible species Fusarium graminearum, phenamacril-resistant Fusarium species, and the mycetozoan model organism Dictyostelium discoideum.

This allowed us to demonstrate that phenamacril acts as a reversible effector of motor function. Finally, we used an NADH-coupled ATPase assay and stopped-flow measurements to establish a nanomolar IC50 value for the phenamacril-mediated inhibition of F. graminearum class I myosin (FgMyo1) (30Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Modulation of actin affinity and actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase by charge changes in the myosin motor domain.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9572846): 6317-632610.1021/bi972851yCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and to demonstrate that phenamacril is a specific and noncompetitive inhibitor of myosin ATPase activity. Fusarium graminearum calmodulin F. graminearum class I myosin motor domain construct F. avenaceum myosin head construct including 2 IQ-motifs F. graminearum myosin head construct including 2 IQ-motifs F. solani myosin head construct including 2 IQ-motifs actomyosin complex l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone tobacco etch virus. Using the baculovirus expression system, we produced and purified myosin constructs from F. graminearum, F. avenaceum, and F. solani in Sf9 insect cells. Myosin heavy chain constructs encompassing two IQ-motifs were coproduced with FgCaM. Partial loss of FgCaM during the final size-exclusion chromatography step (Fig. S1) did not affect the solubility and stability of the purified protein. However, motor activity was greatly reduced. The protein could be stored at −80 °C in buffer 30% trehalose in this form. Motor activity was restored when recombinant FgCaM produced in Escherichia coli was added to FaMyo1IQ2, FgMyo1IQ2, or FsMyo1IQ2 after thawing. Typically, substoichiometric additions of FgCaM were sufficient for maximal activation. To assess if phenamacril-mediated inhibition of F. graminearum class I myosin is reversible, we conducted in vitro motility assays, where F-actin filaments move in an ATP-dependent manner on nitrocellulose-coated glass slides decorated with FgMyo1IQ2. More than 600 rhodamine-phalloidin–labeled F-actin filaments were tracked, both before and after the infusion of phenamacril, as well as after inhibitor washout. The resulting trajectory-associated velocities could be fitted to Gaussian distributions (Fig. 2). Specifically, we found that phenamacril inhibits the movement of F-actin filaments. In the absence of the inhibitor, actin filaments moved with an average velocity of 436 ± 165 nm·s−1. In the presence of 1 μm and 10 μm phenamacril, we observed average velocities of 234 ± 100 nm·s−1 and 133 ± 64 nm·s−1, respectively. Washout of the inhibitor restored the average sliding velocity to 389 ± 201 nm·s−1. To further characterize the inhibitory potential of phenamacril, we established the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) by using a steady-state NADH-coupled ATPase assay in the presence of 20 μm F-actin and increasing concentrations of phenamacril in the range from 0.1 nm to 100 μm. To simplify the assay, we used motor domain construct FgMyo1, which lacks both IQ-motifs. FgMyo1 displays the same ATPase activity as FgCaM-saturated construct FgMyo1IQ2. Consistent with the data from the in vitro motility assay, phenamacril inhibited the ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. By nonlinear regression, we determined the relative IC50 value of the phenamacril-mediated inhibition of FgMyo1 to 365 ± 39 nm with 0–10% residual ATPase activity at ∼10 μm phenamacril (Fig. 3). To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we measured the inhibited and noninhibited steady-state ATPase activity of FgMyo1 as a function of the F-actin and ATP concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). Fitting the data with hyperbolic functions demonstrated that the effect of phenamacril on the actin-activated ATPase activity was a lowering of kcat,actin (maximum ATP turnover in the presence of saturating concentrations of F-actin) and an increase in the value for Kapp,actin (apparent F-actin affinity in the presence of ATP). Specifically, in the presence of 300 and 600 nm phenamacril, Kapp,actin increased from 4.8 ± 0.5 μm to 11.7 ± 0.9 μm and 24.9 ± 3.5 μm, respectively. kcat,actin decreased from 0.72 ± 0.04 s−1 in the noninhibited state to 0.51 ± 0.03 s−1 and 0.49 ± 0.05 s−1 in the presence of 300 and 600 nm phenamacril, respectively. ATP titration in the presence of phenamacril further demonstrated that although phenamacril reduces kcat,basal (maximum ATP turnover in the absence of F-actin), it does not significantly affect the apparent affinity of FgMyo1 for ATP (Kapp,basal) (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2). This result confirms that phenamacril is a noncompetitive inhibitor of FgMyo1. We used stopped-flow experiments to probe the impact of phenamacril on the population of the weak actin-binding myosin states. In the absence of ATP, the association of pyrene-labeled fluorescent F-actin with the myosin motor (rigor state) results in quenching of the fluorescence signal. We measured the rate of the ATP-induced increase in fluorescence that results from actomyosin dissociation (Fig. 4C). Exponential fits to the fluorescence transients yielded kobs values that were plotted against the respective ATP concentration (Fig. 4D). Linear fitting of the data gave the second-order rate constant (K1k+2), which in the absence and presence of 10 μm phenamacril was 0.37 ± 0.02 μm−1·s−1 and 0.35 ± 0.01 μm−1·s−1, respectively. This shows that phenamacril, like blebbistatin and the halogenated pseudilins, does not inhibit or interfere with ATP-induced dissociation of the actomyosin complex. In line with the steady-state ATPase experiments, it further shows that phenamacril does not compete with ATP for the nucleotide-binding site. To characterize the specificity of phenamacril, we initially modeled the pre–power stroke state of FgMyo1 and docked phenamacril into 20 conformers covering a 500-ps molecular dynamics trajectory. In line with the noncompetitive mode of inhibition, the best-ranking docking poses clustered at the apex of the actin-binding cleft (Fig. 5, A–C and Fig. S3), in the immediate vicinity of residues that have been associated with resistance development (Fig. 5D). Residues define the allosteric binding pocket and are predicted to pack tightly around phenamacril. In particular, the aliphatic ethyl-ester chain of phenamacril is predicted to make close contact with residues at the rear of the binding pocket. In contrast, the aromatic moiety of the inhibitor occupies a more solvent-exposed position. Most of the interactions are hydrophobic in nature. Hydrogen-bond interactions are contributed by main-chain residues Ser-217, Lys-537, and Cys-423 and the side chain of Cys-423 (Fig. S3). When compared to F. graminearum, F. avenaceum and F. solani show reduced susceptibility and resistance (respectively) to Phenamacril on Phenamacril-amended agar plates (Fig. 6A). To further assess whether natural resistance in F. solani can be attributed to myosin sequence divergence (Fig. S4) or whether other mechanisms of resistance are involved, we examined the effect phenamacril on actin-activated turnover of ATP by F. solani myosin head construct FsMyo1IQ2 (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the amended agar assay, our results show that the growth-inhibitory effect on F. avenaceum correlates with the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of FaMyo1IQ2 in vitro. Conversely, although phenamacril also significantly inhibits FsMyo1IQ2 (p < 0.005), it still retained 78% ATPase activity at the extreme of 100 μm phenamacril. FsMyo1IQ2 has two S217T and M375K substitutions in the immediate vicinity of the proposed phenamacril-binding pocket of F. graminearum. Introduction of either or both substitutions into the docked homology model resulted in a spatial overlap of phenamacril with the exchanged side chains (Fig. S4), suggesting this to be the resistance-conferring mechanism in F. solani. To further assess the proposed species-specificity of phenamacril for Fusarium, we decided to include a selection of important and well-characterized myosin constructs in our study. These included human myosin-1c (Myo1c) and D. discoideum myosin-1E, myosin-1B (M1B), and myosin-2 (M765) (an amino acid alignment is shown in Fig. S5). Human Myo1c is involved in insulin uptake (12Münnich S. Taft M.H. Manstein D.J.

We measured the effect of 100 μm phenamacril on their actin-activated motor domain steady-state ATPase activities but found no statistically significant difference between the controls and the phenamacril-amended samples for the D. discoideum myosins (Fig. 6C). Human Myo1c activity is inhibited to a similar extent as FsMyo1IQ2. Overall our results indicate that phenamacril is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of F. graminearum class I myosin but that further studies are warranted in regard to its environmental impact. We purified active Fusarium myosin motor domain constructs and characterized the mechanism and parameters underlying the phenamacril-induced inhibition of myosin ATPase and motor activity.

https://openalex.org/W2902208492,"Long recognized as a threat to wildlife, livestock grazing in protected areas has the potential to undermine conservation goals, via competition, habitat degradation, human-carnivore conflict and disruption of predator-prey relationships. In the Strictly Protected Area Zorkul in Tajikistan (Zorkul Reserve), grazing is commonplace despite official prohibition, with potentially detrimental effects on local fauna, in particular, snow leopard Panthera uncia, wolf Canis lupus, brown bear Ursus arctos, argali sheep Ovis ammon, Asiatic ibex Capra sibirica, and long-tailed marmot Marmota caudata. To understand the impacts of grazing and associated human pastoralism on the large mammal community in Zorkul Reserve we used data from camera traps to build models of ungulate and carnivore site use intensity, and we investigated carnivore summer diets using microscopic scat analysis. While sample sizes limited our inference for several species, we found that site use of the most common ungulate, argali, decreased with proximity to herder's camps, indicating possible displacement into sub-optimal habitats. However, no such pattern was present in carnivore site use. For wolf and snow leopard, the most frequently encountered prey items were argali and marmot, while bear depended almost exclusively on marmot. While current pastoralist practices in the reserve may not be incompatible with wildlife presence, our findings suggest that pastoralism may negatively impact ungulates by displacing them from otherwise suitable habitats, with unknown fitness consequences for ungulates or the predators that depend upon them. Managing Zorkul Reserve and other actively grazed protected areas to meet potentially competing demands of local pastoralist communities and conservation will require careful consideration of such interactions to minimize the risk of cascading negative impacts on wildlife."

Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) cause immunodeficiency in cats; no association has been identified with critical cases of sporotrichosis. Moreover, the cytokine profile in Sporothrix-infected cats and a potential impact of retrovirus co-infections on their immunity is unknown. This study assessed immunological parameters in cats with sporotrichosis with and without FIV or FeLV co-infection. FeLV infection was detected by antigen ELISA and by provirus PCR. FIV infection was investigated through ELISA and Western blot. Cytokine transcription (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α) was quantified using RT-qPCR and lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4, CD8, CD5 and CD21) were assessed by flow cytometry. Thirty cats with sporotrichosis were recruited to the study, including three FIV-positive and five FeLV-positive (progressive infection) cats. One cat with regressive FeLV infection was excluded from statistics. In comparison to retrovirus-negative cats, FIV-positive cats and FeLV-positive cats had higher IL-10 levels, FeLV-positive cats had lower IL-4 levels and FIV-positive cats had lower IL-12 levels and a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Remarkably, all cats with poor general condition were FeLV (progressive infection) or FIV-positive, but the retrovirus status was not associated with the sporotrichosis treatment length or outcome. The immunological changes and the more severe clinical presentation observed in cats with retrovirus co-infections encourage future prospective studies that address the impact of these changes on prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis and the development of new therapy strategies that control disease spread."

Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiological agent of melioidosis, has been studied using mouse models to investigate pathogenesis and efficacy of novel medical countermeasures to include both vaccines and therapeutics. Previous characterization of mouse models of melioidosis have demonstrated that BALB/c mice present with an acute infection, whereas C57BL/6 mice have shown a tendency to be more resistant to infection and may model chronic disease. In this study, either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were exposed to aerosolized human clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei. The bacterial strains included HBPUB10134a (virulent isolate from Thailand), MSHR5855 (virulent isolate from Australia), and 1106a (relatively attenuated isolate from Thailand). The LD50 values were calculated and serial sample collections were performed in order to examine the bacterial burdens in tissues, histopathological features of disease, and the immune response mounted by the mice after exposure to aerosolized B. pseudomallei. These data will be important when utilizing these models for testing novel medical countermeasures. Additionally, by comparing highly virulent strains with attenuated isolates, we hope to better understand the complex disease pathogenesis associated with this bacterium."

Historically, most research has not focused on autosomal recessive ID (ARID), which is a significant cause of ID, particularly in areas where parental consanguinity is common. Identification of genetic causes allows for precision diagnosis and improved genetic counseling. We performed whole exome sequencing to 21 Turkish families, seven multiplex and 14 simplex, with nonsyndromic ID. Based on the presence of multiple affected siblings born to unaffected parents and/or shared ancestry, we consider all families as ARID. We revealed the underlying causative variants in seven families in MCPH1 (c.427dupA, p.T143Nfs*5), WDR62 (c.3406C>T, p.R1136*), ASPM (c.5219_5225delGAGGATA, p.R1740Tfs*7), RARS (c.1588A>G, p.T530A), CC2D1A (c.811delG, p.A271Pfs*30), TUSC3 (c.793C>T, p.Q265*) and ZNF335 (c.808C>T, p.R270C and c.3715C>A, p.Q1239K) previously linked with ARID.

Each of these variants, except for those in MCPH1 and PQBP1, have not been previously published. Additionally in one family, two affected children were homozygous for the c.377G>A (p.W126*) variant in the FAM183A, a gene not previously associated with ARID.

Riverine populations represent one of the typical populations of the Amazon region. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of dental caries and periodontal disease on the quality of life of adolescents and young adults from an urban area and from two riverine communities of the Amazon region located at different distances from the urban area. The occurrence of dental caries and periodontal disease was examined through the Decayed, Missing, Filled (DMFT) Index and the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). The impact of oral health conditions on quality of life was examined through the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The data were collected from 564 individuals (15–25 years old): 212 residents of the urban area of Abaetetuba-Pará-Brazil, were compared to 186 inhabitants of the nearest riverine community (Maracapucu) and 166 of another riverine community (Tucumanduba River) located further from the city. The OHIP-14 was analyzed as a dependent outcome, while dental caries, bleeding, calculus, the presence of periodontal pockets, as well as sex and age were analyzed as independent variables through Poisson analysis in a multilevel model. The worst indicators of OHIP-14 and the highest DMFT scores were found in the riverine populations, especially those from the riverine community farthest from the urban area. Based on the adjusted multivariate model, variables such as the contextual variable (location, RR 1.31), and individual demographic variables (sex and age), DMFT (RR 1.53), and the presence of periodontal pockets (RR 1.15) were significantly related to the OHIP (p<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2903130518,"Cholera toxin, an 84-kDa multimeric protein and a major virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae, uses the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of its A subunit to intoxicate host cells. ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins, in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ is transferred to an acceptor. In mammalian cells, ADP-ribosylation of acceptors appears to be reversible. ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) catalyze the modification of acceptor proteins, and ADP-ribose-acceptor hydrolases (ARHs) cleave the ADP-ribose-acceptor bond. ARH1 specifically cleaves the ADP-ribose-arginine bond. We previously demonstrated a role for endogenous ARH1 in regulating the extent of cholera toxin-mediated fluid and electrolyte abnormalities in a mouse model of intoxication. Murine ARH1-knockout (KO) cells and ARH1-KO mice exhibited increased sensitivity to cholera toxin compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In the current report, we examined the sensitivity to cholera toxin of male and female ARH1-KO and WT mice. Intestinal loops derived from female ARH1-KO mice when injected with cholera toxin showed increased fluid accumulation compared to male ARH1-KO mice. WT mice did not show gender differences in fluid accumulation, ADP-ribosylarginine content, and ADP-ribosyl Gαs levels. Injection of 8-Bromo-cAMP into the intestinal loops also increased fluid accumulation, however, there was no significant difference between female and male mice or in WT and KO mice. Female ARH1-KO mice showed greater amounts of ADP-ribosylated Gαs protein and increased ADP-ribosylarginine content both in whole intestine and in epithelial cells than did male ARH1-KO mice. These results demonstrate that female ARH1-KO mice are more sensitive to cholera toxin than male mice. Loss of ARH1 confers gender sensitivity to the effects of cholera toxin but not of cyclic AMP. These observations may in part explain the finding noted in some clinical reports of enhanced symptoms of cholera and/or diarrhea in women than men."

Specifically, the proposed latent segmentation based mixed models segment population to different classes with their own decision rules while also incorporating unobserved heterogeneity within the segment level models. In our analysis, we choose to consider both random utility and random regret theories. Further, instead of assuming the number of segments (as 2), we conduct an exhaustive exploration with multiple segments across the two decision rules. The model estimation is conducted using a stated preference data from 695 commuter cyclists compiled through a web-based survey. The probabilistic allocation of respondents to different segments indicates that female commuter cyclists are more utility oriented; however, the majority of the commuter cyclist’s choice pattern is consistent with regret minimization mechanism. Overall, cyclists’ route choice decisions are influenced by roadway attributes, cycling infrastructure availability, pollution exposure, and travel time. The analysis approach also allows us to investigate time based trade-offs across cyclists belonging to different classes. Interestingly, we observe that the trade-off values in regret and utility based segments for roadway attributes are similar in magnitude; but the values differ greatly for cycling infrastructure and pollution exposure attributes, particularly for maximum exposure levels."

The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD– www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources–such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB–with 10 ontologies–such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD’s objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach."

To evaluate the role of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the diagnosis of measles cases, 46,363 suspected measles cases with rash and 395 suspected measles cases without rash were analyzed in this study; the cases were obtained from the Chinese measles surveillance system (MSS) during 2014-2017 and simultaneously detected by measles-specific IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time RT-PCR. However, some IgM-negative measles cases were identified by real-time RT-PCR. The proportion of these IgM-negative and viral nucleic acid-positive measles cases was high among measles cases with measles vaccination history, cases without rash symptoms, and cases within 3 days of specimen collection after onset. The proportion of IgM-negative and viral nucleic acid-positive measles cases in the 0-3 day group was up to 14.4% for measles cases with rash and 40% for measles cases without rash. Moreover, the proportions of IgM-negative and nucleic acid-positive measles cases gradually increased with the increase in the measles vaccination dose. Therefore, integrated with IgM ELISA, real-time RT-PCR would greatly improve the accurate diagnosis of measles cases and avoid missing the measles cases, especially for measles cases during the first few days after onset when the patients were highly contagious and for measles cases with secondary vaccine failure. In conclusion, our study reconfirmed that IgM ELISA is the gold-standard detection assay for measles cases confirmation. However, real-time RT-PCR should be introduced and used to supplement the laboratory diagnosis, especially in the setting of pre-elimination and/or elimination wherever appropriate."

The species has wild and domestic forms, which are in constant interaction. The aim of our study was to characterize the genetic structure of domestic and wild reindeer populations, using a genome-wide bovine genotyping array (BovineHD BeadChip). The wild reindeer samples were obtained from the western Taymyr Peninsula population and from the taiga and tundra populations in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). The domestic populations included the Evenk, Even, and Chukotka-Khargin breeds of Yakutia and the Nenets breed from the Nenets Autonomous district and Murmansk region. The level of genetic diversity was higher for the wild population. Analyzing Neighbor-Net tree, multidimensional scaling, and Structure results, we observed strong genetic population structure and clear differentiation between domestic and wild populations. All regional populations of domestic reindeer were clearly separated, while wild reindeer showed similar genetic backgrounds. Nevertheless, we found contrasting patterns in the genetic structure of the tundra and taiga reindeer, in accordance with their morphological and ecological differences. Thus, our study revealed a clear genetic differentiation between domestic and wild reindeer populations. It provides novel insights into the genetic diversity and structure of reindeer populations, to support resource utilization and aid in the development of genetic improvement strategies and conservation programs for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2903504014,"Venomous snakes have endogenous proteins that neutralize the toxicity of their venom components. We previously identified five small serum proteins (SSP-1-SSP-5) from a highly venomous snake belonging to the family Viperidae as inhibitors of various toxins from snake venom. The endogenous inhibitors belong to the prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) family. SSP-2 interacts with triflin, which is a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family that blocks smooth muscle contraction. However, the structural basis for the interaction and the biological roles of these inhibitors are largely unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the SSP-2-triflin complex at 2.3 Å resolution. A concave region centrally located in the N-terminal domain of triflin is fully occupied by the terminal β-strands of SSP-2. SSP-2 does not bind tightly to the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of triflin; this domain is thought to be responsible for its channel-blocker function. Instead, the cysteine-rich domain is tilted 7.7° upon binding to SSP-2, and the inhibitor appears to sterically hinder triflin binding to calcium channels. These results help explain how an endogenous inhibitor prevents the venomous protein from maintaining homeostasis in the host. Furthermore, this interaction also sheds light on the binding interface between the human homologues PSP94 and CRISP-3, which are up-regulated in prostate and ovarian cancers."

Learning and memory are tightly regulated processes that require the activity of hundreds of genes to orchestrate the proper development of neural circuits and the underlying physiological changes necessary for cellular and synaptic plasticity. While many genes are known that define mechanisms required for the formation and consolidation of memory (Alberini and Kandel, 2014Alberini C.M. Kandel E.R.

Memory suppressor genes, named so by analogy to tumor suppressor genes (Abel et al., 1998Abel T. Martin K.C. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R.

Several dozen and novel memory suppressor genes were recently identified in a large RNAi screen for effects on 3 hr aversive olfactory memory expression in Drosophila (Walkinshaw et al., 2015Walkinshaw E.

They were classed as such because knockdown of these genes led to increased memory expression. A cohesin complex member, stromalin, was one such gene identified in the screen. The highly conserved cohesin complex is comprised of Stromalin (STAG1/2 in mammals) and three other subunits named structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (SMC1), SMC3, and Rad21 (Dorsett, 2011Dorsett D.

Elegant studies from two research groups have clearly shown that members of the complex have a post-mitotic role in the proper pruning of axons in Drosophila mushroom body neurons (Pauli et al., 2008Pauli A.

It is notable that absent from this list are clear and specific roles for the complex in learning and memory processes, other than the general cognitive disturbances observed in humans with cohesinopathies (see Discussion). We report here that RNAi knockdown of Stromalin in mushroom body and dopamine neurons leads to enhanced aversive olfactory memory in adult flies. We show that stromalin functions during development as a negative regulator of both synaptic and dense core vesicle (DCV) number in the nervous system, limiting the strength of synaptic connections to suppress memory acquisition. Reducing Stromalin levels specifically increases the number of vesicles in neurons without detectably altering other features of the targeted neurons in adult flies, including synapse number, synapse volume, or neurite branching. These observations offer evidence that the size of the synaptic vesicle pool is regulated independently of other structural features of the neuron. Western blot analyses on fly head lysates confirmed that pan-neuronal expression of an RNAi against stromalin (SA) from a targeted insertion site in the genome resulted in an ∼50% decrease in Stromalin protein levels in the adult head compared to control flies, which contain an empty landing site (Figures 1A and S1A). Interestingly, we find that pan-neuronal expression of stromalinRNAi resulted in an increase in 3-hr aversive olfactory memory scores compared to control flies (Figure 1B), which was also replicated by a second independently derived stromalinRNAi fly line (stromalinRNAi2; Figure S1B). Moreover, we found no difference in odor and shock avoidance behavior of the knockdown (KD) flies that could account for the increased memory performance (Figure S1C). Using a panel of GAL4 drivers, flies expressing stromalinRNAi in specific subpopulations of neurons previously shown to be important for aversive olfactory conditioning were tested for 3-hr memory performance. We found that Stromalin KD in both mushroom body neurons (MBn) and dopaminergic neurons (DAn) led to enhanced 3-hr-memory scores, while expression elsewhere in the olfactory circuit had no effect (Figure 1C). Because DAn are critical mediators of learning and memory in Drosophila (Davis, 1993Davis R.L. Mushroom bodies and Drosophila learning.Neuron. 1993; 11: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Davis, 2011Davis R.L. Traces of Drosophila memory.Neuron. 2011; 70: 8-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), we chose to focus on Stromalin effects in DAn in subsequent experiments. The TH-GAL4 driver expresses—in a subset of Drosophila DAn, including the PPL1 cluster that innervates the vertical lobe, heel, and junction neuropil of the MB—a structure known to be important for the formation of aversive olfactory memory (Davis, 2011Davis R.L. Traces of Drosophila memory.Neuron. 2011; 70: 8-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Behavioral testing of flies carrying a TH-GAL4/+ driver with UAS-Dicer2/+ or flies carrying UAS-SARNAi/+ alone revealed that the behavioral effect was not due to leaky expression of stromalinRNAi, as flies only displayed an increased memory score when the GAL4 driver and UAS-SARNAi (along with UAS-Dicer2) were present in the same fly (Figure 1D). Interestingly, overexpression of Stromalin in DAn using a UAS-SA construct did not alter memory expression (Figure 1E) despite experimental results showing that expression of the UAS-SA construct significantly increases Stromalin abundance (Figures 1G and S1D). Thus, wild-type levels of Stromalin are not limiting for memory performance. We also tested the KD of SMC1, another subunit of the cohesin complex, using TH-GAL4 and discovered that this mimicked the enhanced memory phenotype of Stromalin KD flies (Figure S1E). This observation suggests that the cohesin complex itself, or major components of it, is responsible for the increased memory when expressed at less than normal abundance levels. Then, we attempted to rescue the enhanced memory phenotype in Stromalin KD flies using the overexpression construct. Replicating our previous results, Stromalin KD in DAn increased, while overexpression of Stromalin in DAn did not alter, 3-hr-memory scores (Figure 1F). However, flies containing both UAS-SARNAi and UAS-SA transgenes had memory scores indistinguishable from control flies, effectively rescuing the enhanced memory phenotype of Stromalin KD flies. These behavioral results are consistent with Stromalin protein levels in these transgenic fly lines measured by western blotting. Pan-neuronal Stromalin KD reduced and overexpression increased Stromalin protein levels (Figures 1G and S1D). Flies expressing both UAS-SARNAi and UAS-SA transgenes had protein levels similar to control flies. Thus, normalizing Stromalin protein levels in KD flies rescued aversive olfactory memory expression. Several distinct operations underlie the formation of behavioral memory (Davis, 1993Davis R.L. Mushroom bodies and Drosophila learning.Neuron. 1993; 11: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Davis, 2011Davis R.L. Traces of Drosophila memory.Neuron. 2011; 70: 8-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), which include acquisition, consolidation, retrieval, and forgetting. To dissect the operations of learning and memory that are altered by Stromalin KD in DAn, we performed memory acquisition and retention experiments. Memory retention was examined by varying the time between training and testing (3 min–24 hr). Flies with Stromalin KD in DAn displayed significantly higher memory scores 1–6 hr after training compared to control flies (Figure 2A), although there remained a trend toward elevated performance at 12 hr. Memory scores at 24 hr after conditioning are very low and it is difficult to extract true differences. Similarly, it is often difficult to extract true differences between groups at 3 min after conditioning because ceiling levels of performance are reached at this time point. Overall, these results suggest a general increase in memory performance after conditioning. We then probed acquisition in these flies by varying the number of electric shock pulses they received and testing their performance immediately after training. We found that flies expressing stromalinRNAi in DAn had significantly higher rates of memory acquisition compared to controls when they received an intermediate number of electric shock pulses during training (5–6 shock pulses; Figure 2B). Ceiling levels of performance were reached with 12 shock pulses. These results indicate that Stromalin KD flies appeared to learn just as well as control flies when given only half the number of training associations. Because reduction of Stromalin in DAn enhanced both acquisition and retention, it raised the question of whether the increased memory retention scores are a consequence of enhanced acquisition or whether both acquisition and retention of memory are enhanced independently. We distinguished between these two possibilities by normalizing for the genotype differences in memory acquisition. Control flies were presented with 12 electric shock pulses while stromalinRNAi flies were presented 6 electric shock pulses during training before testing for memory retention. When trained in this manner, the genotype differences in memory retention disappeared (Figure 2C). Thus, Stromalin KD in DAn appears to specifically enhance memory acquisition, with increased memory retention occurring as a consequence of increased acquisition. To unravel the time course for Stromalin’s limiting effects on olfactory memory, we employed the TARGET system, a temperature-sensitive repressor of GAL4 (tub-gal80ts; McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), to temporally control stromalinRNAi expression in DAn by manipulating incubation temperatures. Using this system, we surprisingly found that Stromalin KD in DAn during development, but not during adulthood, led to an enhanced memory phenotype in adult flies (Figure 2D). Drosophila development consists of several well-defined stages: embryo, first-, second-, and third-instar larval stages (L1, L2, L3) followed by the pupal stage (divided into two halves for this experiment; P1, P2). We limited Stromalin expression in DAn during increasingly narrow developmental stages and tested adult flies for aversive olfactory memory performance. This allowed us to determine that Stromalin KD in DAn specifically during the third-instar larval stage was both necessary and sufficient for the enhanced memory scores displayed by these flies as adults (Figure 2E). Remarkably, KD of Stromalin only during the third-instar produced enhanced memory during adulthood, whereas KD at all developmental stages except for the third-instar was without effect (Figure 2E). To further delimit Stromalin’s spatial role in memory beyond the PPL1 DAn in the TH-GAL4 expression pattern (Figure 1C), we employed a series of GAL4 drivers exhibiting more limited expression across the PPL1 DAn cluster (Figure S2). However, our initial results based on the known adult expression patterns of these GAL4 drivers were inconsistent. For example, two GAL4 drivers, c061-GAL4 and c150-GAL4, expressed in adult PPL1 DAn innervating the MB heel gave inconsistent results. Since Stromalin KD during the third-instar larval stage is critical for its behavioral effects, we examined the GAL4 expression patterns during the third-instar larval stage using a membrane-GFP label. In doing so, we found that most GAL4 drivers for DAn PPL1 subpopulations have different expression patterns during development compared to adult flies (Figure S2). This developmental analysis of GAL4 expression patterns and the enhanced memory performance with the ΔTH-D′-GAL4 and c061-GAL4 drivers led us to conclude that stromalinRNAi expression in the DAn innervating the heel of the MB was sufficient to produce enhanced memory scores in adult flies. We wondered whether the enhanced memory due to Stromalin KD in the TH-GAL4 subset of DAn might occur from increased functional connections between the PPL1 DAn and the axons of MBn in the lobes, since this connection is known to be important for aversive olfactory memory (Davis, 2011Davis R.L. Traces of Drosophila memory.Neuron. 2011; 70: 8-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To test for this possibility, we performed ex vivo experiments using adult brains in which the ATP-gated ion channel, P2X2, was expressed in DAn neurons, allowing us to artificially activate the neurons with increasing concentrations of ATP by bath application. We simultaneously expressed the cAMP sensor Tepacvv in the MBn (Boto et al., 2014Boto T. Louis T. Jindachomthong K. Jalink K. Tomchik S.M. Dopaminergic modulation of cAMP drives nonlinear plasticity across the Drosophila mushroom body lobes.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 822-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Klarenbeek et al., 2011Klarenbeek J.B. Goedhart J. Hink M.A. Gadella T.W. Jalink K. A mTurquoise-based cAMP sensor for both FLIM and ratiometric read-out has improved dynamic range.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e19170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), since DA is known to increase cAMP in the MB lobes (Tomchik and Davis, 2008Tomchik S.M. Davis R.L. Cyclic AMP imaging sheds light on PDF signaling in circadian clock neurons.Neuron. 2008; 58: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Increasing the ATP concentrations produced the predicted increase in Tepacvv fluorescence. When stromalinRNAi was expressed in DAn, ATP-induced DAn activation produced an ∼2-fold increase in cAMP response over the control (at 1 mM ATP) in the MB heel, junction, and upper stalk regions (Figures 3A and S3). These experiments confirmed that the PPL1 DAn to MB synaptic communication was strengthened in Stromalin KD flies. This observation provided a sound explanation for how reducing Stromalin in the DAn increases acquisition and memory, since current evidence indicates that DAn activation represents the unconditioned stimulus (US) of electric shock for aversive olfactory conditioning (Davis, 2011Davis R.L. Traces of Drosophila memory.Neuron. 2011; 70: 8-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The increased synaptic communication between DAn and MBn would lead to an increase in potency of the US to produce an enhancement in acquisition and memory. Nevertheless, the ex vivo conditions and artificial stimulation methods might not accurately reflect the neuronal responses in flies during behavioral training. Therefore, we developed an in vivo, under the microscope, electric foot shock apparatus that mimics behavioral training conditions. Through a window in the fly head, cAMP responses in the MB heel region were imaged during the delivery of electric shock pulses to the fly in the absence of any odor presentation. We were able to see clear peaks of cAMP increases for each electric shock pulse delivered to the fly (12 × 90 V at 5 s intervals). Interestingly, control flies showed the largest cAMP response to the first shock, while subsequent shock pulses produced steadily decreasing cAMP responses thereafter (Figure 3B). In contrast, while DAn Stromalin KD flies showed a similar amplitude peak at the first electric shock pulse, cAMP responses to subsequent shock pulses remained elevated (Figure 3B). Calculations of the area under the response profile during shock pulse delivery (from 30 to 90 s) revealed that Stromalin KD in DAn significantly increased the cAMP signal generated in the MB heel in response to shock. These data argue that Stromalin KD in DAn during a critical developmental period enhances memory acquisition by potentiating the shock-induced DAn to MB communication. How does Stromalin alter synaptic communication between the DAn and MBn? One possibility is that it may affect the number of PPL1 DAn in the Drosophila brain during development, changing the potency of the US. This possibility was attractive because of the role for the cohesin complex in proper cell division (Peters et al., 2008Peters J.M. Tedeschi A. Schmitz J. The cohesin complex and its roles in chromosome biology.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3089-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To visualize and count PPL1 DAn, we expressed membrane- or nuclear-localized GFP in these neurons using TH-GAL4. Stromalin KD in DAn did not significantly alter the numbers of PPL1 neurons in adult flies (Figures 4A and 4B ). Therefore, differences in DAn numbers do not account for Stromalin’s effects on learning. A second possibility is that Stromalin KD increases the excitability of the DAn and/or their responsiveness to shock stimuli. To test this, we expressed the cytoplasmic Ca2+ reporter GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar) in the DAn and quantified the Ca2+ responses to electric shock pulses. Interestingly, we found that the Ca2+ responses in the axons of DAn innervating the MB heel region were slightly reduced in stromalinRNAi flies, although this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 3C). Even if this difference were real, it does not account for the increased synaptic communication between DAn and MBn (Figures 3A and 3B). Knockout (KO) of the cohesin complex genes SMC1 and stromalin have previously been reported to cause axon-pruning deficits during development in a subset of Drosophila MBn (Schuldiner et al., 2008Schuldiner O. Berdnik D. Levy J.M. Wu J.S. Luginbuhl D. Gontang A.C. Luo L. piggyBac-based mosaic screen identifies a postmitotic function for cohesin in regulating developmental axon pruning.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether stromalinRNAi expression in DAn resulted in neuroanatomical defects using membrane-localized GFP. We were unable to detect any obvious morphological changes of DAn projections to the MB in adult fly brains upon visual inspection of confocal images. We then measured membrane-localized GFP fluorescence intensity of DA projections innervating the MB lobes as a surrogate for axon ramification. We again failed to find any differences between the control and Stromalin KD brains, suggesting that Stromalin reduction does not alter the innervation of the MB lobes by DAn axons (Figure 4C). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle morphological differences exist using this methodology, large changes in the morphology of DAn do not appear to underlie enhanced memory acquisition. Our inability to detect Stromalin KD-induced neuroanatomical changes in the DAn and the observation of increased communication between DAn and MBn led us to wonder whether Stromalin might instead affect presynaptic proteins or structures. We initially tested this idea by expressing a presynaptic marker localized to synaptic vesicles, Synaptotagmin:GFP (Syt:GFP), in DAn and examining the fluorescence intensity in the regions where PPL1 DAn innervate the MB neuropil (Figure 4A). Remarkably, we discovered that Stromalin KD in DAn resulted in significantly elevated levels of this presynaptic marker in all MB neuropil regions measured (Figure 4D). These results suggested that increased presynaptic function might be at play in Stromalin KD neurons, a result consistent with our increased memory acquisition and increased MB responsiveness detected by functional imaging. If correct, this hypothesis predicts that the difference in presynaptic marker staining should emerge in the KD animals during the third-instar larval stage, co-mapping to the critical developmental period for Stromalin KD effects on behavior (Figure 2E). Therefore, we examined DAn Syt:GFP expression during the second-instar, as well as the early, middle, and late stages of the third-instar, larvae. As we predicted, larval DAn expressing stromalinRNAi had Syt:GFP levels similar to control larvae during the second- to early-third-instar stages (Figures 4E, S4A, and S4B). However, significantly higher levels of Syt:GFP were detected during the middle to late-third-instar stages in DAn axons innervating the heel and upper stalk regions of the MB (Figures 4E and S4). Furthermore, repression of stromalinRNAi expression during development using the TARGET system, or during the critical third-instar stage, resulted in no significant increases in Syt:GFP expression in the MB heel (Figure S4C). These Syt:GFP developmental results nicely mirror our behavioral data, strongly suggesting that these processes are related and assigning a critical developmental window in DAn during which Stromalin acts to set baseline levels of adult synaptic strength. Our aforementioned behavioral data showed that both pan-neuronal and MBn KD of Stromalin produces enhanced olfactory memory (Figure 1C), suggesting that the effects of Stromalin on presynaptic function are not specific to DAn. Therefore, we probed the effect of Stromalin KD on Syt:GFP in the adult brain using the nSyb-GAL4 and R13-GAL4 drivers. We observed elevated levels of the presynaptic marker across the entire brain and in MBn (Figures 4F and 4G) indicating that Stromalin regulates these markers across multiple types of neurons and therefore is likely to affect a wide range of behaviors. We considered three possible explanations for the increased levels of the Syt:GFP presynaptic marker: first, Stromalin KD increases the number of dopaminergic synapses on their axonal processes; second, Stromalin KD increases the volume of dopaminergic presynaptic sites; and third, Stromalin KD increases the number of synaptic vesicles at dopaminergic synapses. To probe the first two possibilities, we used the synapse-labeling tool, GFP reconstituted across synaptic partners (GRASP; Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

Using GRASP, we found no differences in GFP fluorescence intensity between control and DAn Stromalin KD fly brains (Figure 5A), indicating that Stromalin does not dramatically alter the number or size of PPL1 DAn to MBn connections in the MB neuropil. While the GRASP fluorescence intensity signal provides a valuable initial indication of structural connectivity, it offers only an indirect measure of number, and to som"
https://openalex.org/W2902590374,"Over the past few years, high step-up dc-dc converters have been drawn substantial attention because of their wide-ranging application not only in the renewable energy sector but also in many other applications. To acquire a high voltage gain in photovoltaic (PV) and other renewable energy applications, a high step-up dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter structure consists of a full-bridge (FB) module along with an input boost inductor and a voltage multiplier based on the Cockcroft-Walton (CW) principle with a parallel inductor. The key features of the proposed converter are: 1) high voltage gain with lower voltage stress on the switches, diodes and other passive elements without affecting the number of cascaded stages, 2) a minimum size of boost inductance and cascaded stage capacitance that ensures its compactness and low cost, and 3) a minimal number of major components. Circuit operation, steady-state analysis and various design parameters of the proposed converter are explained in details. In order to prove the performance of the theoretical analysis, a laboratory prototype is also implemented. The peak voltage gain and the maximum efficiency obtained are 11.9 and 94.6% respectively with very low input current ripple and output voltage ripple generated."

Early diagnosis of chronic hepatitis in dogs would thus be beneficial. The identification of proteins that are differentially expressed in dogs with chronic hepatitis could contribute to the development of novel diagnostic markers for this disease and provide insight into its pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to identify novel proteins that are differentially expressed in the liver of dogs with chronic hepatitis. Hepatic tissue was collected from 8 healthy dogs during ovariohysterectomy and from 8 dogs with histologically confirmed chronic hepatitis. The proteome of the liver samples was extracted by mechanical disruption and detergent-based cell lysis and differentially labeled prior to analysis by 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Spots with an absolute fold change value > 2.0 were selected for further analysis. Protein identification was achieved by nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differential expression of select proteins was validated by Western blot. Five protein spots were differentially expressed between patients with chronic hepatitis and healthy control dogs. From these 5 protein spots 11 proteins were identified. Differential expression of cytokeratin 18 and annexin 5 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Differential protein expression was shown between dogs with chronic hepatitis and healthy control dogs. Upregulation of cytokeratin 18 in chronic hepatitis may suggest increased hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis, whereas upregulation of annexin 5A suggests increased hepatocellular apoptosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether either protein has diagnostic utility."
https://openalex.org/W2903335566,"Social norms promote cooperation in everyday life because many people are willing to negatively sanction norm breakers at a cost to themselves. However, a norm violation may persist if only one person is required to sanction the norm breaker and everyone expects someone else to do it. Here we employ the volunteer’s dilemma game (VOD) to model this diffusion of responsibility in social norm enforcement. The symmetric VOD is a binary choice game in which all actors have the same costs of and benefits from cooperation and only one actor’s cooperation is required to provide the collective good for the group. The asymmetric VOD differs from the symmetric VOD in one (strong) actor having lower costs of cooperation. In a laboratory experiment, we find that, in line with the diffusion of responsibility hypothesis, subjects’ propensities to sanction the norm breaker decrease with group size in the symmetric VOD. In the asymmetric VOD, groups tacitly coordinate on the strong subject to sanction the norm breaker alone. Although at first lower in larger groups, strong subjects’ sanctioning rates increase over time and reach equally high levels across different group sizes. Our results show that heterogeneous groups can be more effective in achieving norm compliance than groups of all equals because they naturally evade diffusion of responsibility in social norm enforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2902037010,"The liver and pancreas are two major digestive organs, and among the different cell types in them, hepatocytes and the insulin-producing β cells have roles in both health and diseases. Accordingly, clinicians and researchers are very interested in the mechanisms underlying the development and regeneration of liver and pancreatic β cells. Gene and enhancer traps such as the Tol2 transposon-based system are useful for identifying genes potentially involved in developmental processes in the zebrafish model. Here, we developed a strategy that combines a Tol2-mediated enhancer trap and the Cre/loxP system by using loxP-flanked reporters driven by β cell– or hepatocyte-specific promoters and the upstream activating sequence (UAS)-driving Cre. Two double-transgenic reporter lines, Tg(ins:loxP-CFPNTR-loxP-DsRed; 10×UAS:Cre, cryaa:Venus) and Tg(fabp10:loxP-CFPNTR-loxP-DsRed; 10×UAS:Cre, cryaa:Venus), were established to label pancreatic β cells and hepatocytes, respectively. These two double-transgenic lines were each crossed with the Tol2-enhancer trap founder lines to screen for and identify genes expressed in the β cell and hepatocytes during development. This trap system coupled with application of nitroreductase (NTR)/metronidazole (Mtz)–mediated cell ablation could identify genes expressed during regeneration. Of note, pilot enhancer traps captured transiently and weakly expressed genes such as rab3da and ensab with higher efficiencies than traditional enhancer trap systems. In conclusion, through permanent genetic labeling by Cre/loxP, this improved Tol2-mediated enhancer trap system provides a promising method to identify transiently or weakly expressed, but potentially important, genes during development and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2902718094,"Persons with severe mental illness are more prone to victimization and experience more difficulties regarding societal participation than other community members. These experiences vary greatly among individuals. Community mental health care should offer more individualized support by addressing these differences in experience. Therefore, this study aimed to identify subgroups of outpatients with severe mental illness based on their experiences of social participation and victimization.Data from patients with severe mental illness from eight outpatient teams in the Netherlands were used to perform latent class analysis. From the total caseload, 395 patients agreed to participate. Classes were based on: i) criminal victimization incidents, ii) criminal perpetration incidents (Dutch Safety Monitor), iii) experienced discrimination (DISC-12), and iv) social functioning (Social Functioning Scale). Also, to investigate differences between the classes, socio-demographic, clinical, and person-related variables were examined.Three classes were identified. The Victimized and Perpetrating class (34.4%) had the highest prevalence of discrimination, victimization, and perpetration, and intermediate scores on social functioning subscales. This class also experienced the most problems in other domains, such as psychosocial functioning and quality of life. The Discriminated and Avoiding class (36.4%) had moderate scores for discrimination, victimization and perpetration, and the lowest scores for social functioning and social support. The General Difficulties class (28.8%) had the lowest prevalence of discrimination, victimization, and perpetration, and the highest scores on social functioning.These distinct classes offer new insights to mental health professionals in outpatient teams in in their aim to positively influence the patient's social context during rehabilitation; this includes addressing the role of victimization, and indicates the relevance of distinctive approaches and the support needed for each class. Professionals may need to focus more on the impact of difficulties in their patients' social context to adequately support them in the rehabilitation process."
https://openalex.org/W2902886862,"Background In recent years, researchers have illuminated many non-skeletal actions of vitamin D including host defense against various pathogens and vaccine immunology. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential association between serum vitamin D levels and measles antibody titers. Methods The biochemical profiles and de-identified information were accessed from the 2001 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were divided into quartiles according to their measles antibody titers. Results A total of 5,681 participants were analyzed in our study. Participants in the highest quartile of measles antibody titer had significantly lower serological levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] than those in the lower quartiles (53.90 vs. 58.70 nmol/L, a decrease of 8.18%) (p < 0.001). After full adjustment of confounders, the adjusted ß coefficient of 25(OH)D was -0.006 (p<0.001). A decreasing tendency of 25(OH)D among quartiles of measles antibody titers was obvious (p for trend <0.001). The negative association in seropositive subjects remained statistically significant only in non-Hispanic black population before adjustment for age, gender, and other covariates (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study highlights the negative association between serum 25(OH)D levels and measles antibody titers."
https://openalex.org/W2903345023,"The bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii can produce significant volumes of solid precipitation in the presence of specific chemical environments. These solid precipitate particles can enter a network of microscale pores and cause long-range clogging. As a result, the medium gains strength and exhibits superior mechanical properties. This concept is also known as Microbiologically Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP). In this study, we have used sponge blocks as surrogate porous media mimics and analyzed several aspects of MICP. A synergistic approach involving electron microscopy (SEM), computerized X-Ray tomography (μCT), quasi-static compressive load testing and chemical characterization (EDX) has been used to understand several physical and chemical aspects of MICP."
https://openalex.org/W2902590770,"Background and aim The progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is believed to be the driver for future development of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Nevertheless, there remains a clear deficit in non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of NASH. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of portal lymphadenopathy (PL) in biopsy- proven NAFLD patients and to determine whether PL correlates with NAFLD stage and severity. Methods A retrospective study included biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with up to date (within one year) abdominal imaging by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients were clustered into three groups based on their NAFLD Activity Score (NAS): NAS1-2 (mild), NAS3-4 (moderate) and NAS≥5 (advanced). We Assessed for association between PL and other clinical and laboratory findings with NAS, NAS components and fibrosis. Results Seventy-five patients with NAFLD and no other competing etiologies for liver diseases or PL were included. The mean age was 50.7±14.84 years with male predominance (N = 47, 62.7%). Twenty-five (33.3%), 37 (49.3%) and 13 (17.3%) patients had mild, moderate and advanced NAS, respectively. PL significantly correlated with advanced NAS ≥ 5 (Fisher’s (F) 9.5, P = 0.009). Correlation was driven mainly by a link to hepatocytes ballooning (F of 5.9, P = 0.043). In addition, PL significantly correlated with portal inflammation (F 4.29, P = 0.038). As for hepatic fibrosis, the F test wasn’t significant, though spearman’s coefficient (SC) was significant (0.277, P = 0.012). On multivariate analysis, PL was identified as a sole predictor of advanced NAS score (Odds ratio of 2.68, P = 0.002). Incorporation of PL into noninvasive fibrosis scores improved their diagnostic yield. Conclusion PL predicts severity of NAFLD. Its presence may serve as a novel radiological marker for NAFLD/NASH differentiation and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2902069451,"We aim to assess the similarities of proportional, phenotypic, and molecular characteristics between the school environment and schoolchildren on methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates.A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2016 and August 2016 in eight elementary schools in Guangzhou, China. Nasal swabs from students and environmental swabs from school environments were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses under a multistage stratified cluster cross-sectional survey design were performed to access the prevalence relationship and influencing factors, respectively. Phenotypic and molecular characterizations of MSSA isolates were conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and polymerase chain reaction assays, respectively.In total, 1705 schoolchildren and 1240 environmental samples from 40 classes in eight elementary schools obtained between March and August 2016 were include in this study. The rates of MSSA prevalence among schoolchildren and the environment were 11.44% (195/1705) and 4.60% (57/1240), respectively. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the prevalence of MSSA isolates were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.05-1.29; P = 0.010) and 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = 0.003) for the school or class environment and students, respectively. Similar phenotypic and molecular characteristics were identified between schoolchildren and the environment. A cause and effect relationship could not be established because the study design was cross-sectional.Because of the cross-sectional design, we can reveal the association between school environment and schoolchildren on MSSA, but it is not a cause and effect relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2903147291,"In the current study, we characterized the expression and histone modification profiles of the alternative promoters found within imprinted Igf2r, Mest, Zac1, Peg3, Snrpn and non-imprinted Myc loci. In terms of expression pattern, the alternative promoters are highly tissue-specific, which is in a stark contrast to the ubiquitous expression of the corresponding main promoters. The alternative promoters are associated with the histone modification mark H3K4me1, but not with H3K4me3, which is frequently associated with the main promoters. Phylogenetic analyses also indicated that the majority of the alternative promoters are unique to the mammalian lineage, further suggesting the recent formation of these promoters during mammalian evolution. Overall, this study suggests that the alternative promoters of imprinted loci may have been derived from enhancers in recent evolutionary times and co-evolved with the genomic imprinting mechanism."
