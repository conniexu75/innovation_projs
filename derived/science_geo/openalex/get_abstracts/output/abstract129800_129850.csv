https://openalex.org/W2088764696,"We have cloned and characterized a new member of the p38 group of mitogen-activated protein kinases here termed p38δ. Sequence comparisons revealed that p38δ is approximately 60% identical to the other three p38 isoforms but only 40–45% to the other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members. It contains the TGY dual phosphorylation site present in all p38 group members and is activated by a group of extracellular stimuli including cytokines and environmental stresses that also activate the other three known p38 isoforms. However, unlike the other p38 isoforms, the kinase activity of p38δ is not blocked by the pyridinyl imidazole, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2–2(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole (identicalto SB202190). p38δ can be activated by MKK3 and MKK6, known activators of the other isoforms. Nonetheless, in-gel kinase assays provide evidence for additional activators. The data presented herein show that p38δ has many properties that are similar to those of other p38 group members. Nonetheless important differences exist among the four members of the p38 group of enzymes, and thus each may have highly specific, individual contributions to biologic events involving activation of the p38 pathways.

Comparative studies revealed similarities among this group of enzymes; each is activated by MKK3 and MKK6 and inhibited by FHPI (14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D.

For example, p38β phosphorylates and up-regulates the transactivation activity of ATF2 more than 20-fold more effectively than does p38 (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J.

Like the other p38 isoforms, p38δ has the TGY dual phosphorylation site. A variety of studies show that many of the properties of p38δ are very similar to those of the other three p38 isoforms. In contrast we have noted some important differences between p38δ and other p38 isoforms including a lack of sensitivity to the inhibitory properties of pyridinyl imidazoles and the existence of MKKs with properties distinct from MKK3 or MKK6 which can activate p38δ. The information provided herein establishes the basis for further studies of the function of this important group of enzymes. Mitogen-activated protein kinases have been shown to play an important role in transducing extracellular signals into cellular responses (1Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem.

For example, p38β phosphorylates and up-regulates the transactivation activity of ATF2 more than 20-fold more effectively than does p38 (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J.

Like the other p38 isoforms, p38δ has the TGY dual phosphorylation site. A variety of studies show that many of the properties of p38δ are very similar to those of the other three p38 isoforms. In contrast we have noted some important differences between p38δ and other p38 isoforms including a lack of sensitivity to the inhibitory properties of pyridinyl imidazoles and the existence of MKKs with properties distinct from MKK3 or MKK6 which can activate p38δ. The information provided herein establishes the basis for further studies of the function of this important group of enzymes. We thank Dr. J.-D.

PKC-ζ, is ubiquitously expressed, but little is known about its activation or actions. This ignorance partly derives from the fact that PKC-ζ is not activated by membrane-associated diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters, generally does not translocate appreciably from cytosol to membrane when activated, and is not depleted by prolonged phorbol ester treatment. Consequently, methods used to evaluate DAG-sensitive conventional (α, β, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) PKCs are not relevant to PKC-ζ and other DAG-insensitive, atypical PKCs. Although not activated by DAG, PKC-ζ is activated in vitro by phosphatidylserine and polyphosphoinositides, including D3-PO4 derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (1Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A.

Because of its activation by polyphosphoinositides, PKC-ζ has been suspected to operate downstream of PI 3-kinase; however, direct experimental evidence for this suspicion is lacking, particularly in intact cells.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that insulin activates PKC-ζ by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. To this end, we assayed immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ (a) following treatment of intact adipocytes with insulin in the presence and absence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors; (b) following PI 3-kinase activation in vitro by a pYXXM-containing peptide; and (c) in response to polyphosphoinositides added directly to the assay of PKC-ζ in vitro. Also, since PI 3-kinase appears to be required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and subsequent glucose transport, we questioned whether PKC-ζ, as an effector of PI 3-kinase, may play a role in this process. To this end, we used PKC-ζ inhibitors and examined the effects of transiently transfected wild-type, constitutive, and dominant-negative PKC-ζ in adipocytes co-transfected with hemagglutinin antigen (HA)-tagged GLUT4. As described (8Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), rat adipocytes were prepared from epididymal fat pads of 200–250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats. For acute incubations, the cells were suspended and incubated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin with or without insulin (Elanco), tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma), wortmannin (Sigma), LY294002 (Biomol), RO 31-8820 (Alexis), and/or myristoylated PKC-ζ or PKA pseudosubstrate peptides (Quality Controlled Biochemicals) as indicated in the text. For overnight incubations, the cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glucose, and other indicated treatments; after overnight incubations, the cells were transferred to glucose-free KRP for acute treatments. Following acute treatments, glucose transport was assayed by measurement of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG; 0.1 mm; NEN Life Science Products) uptake over 1 min as described (8Standaert M.L. Avignon A.

This treatment was performed using anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.) and 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (second) antibody (Amersham Corp.) to measure cell surface content of expressed GLUT4 containing the exofacial HA epitope. To measure PKC-ζ enzyme activity, as described previously (11Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.M. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min to remove nuclei, debris, and the fat cake. Triton X-100 (1%), Nonidet (0.5%), and 150 mm NaCl were then added to the total cell lysate, and, after 30 min equilibration at 4 °C, preimmune antiserum or polyclonal anti-PKC-ζ antiserum (obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., or Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (both antisera were raised against a nearly identical C-terminal sequence and gave comparable results) was added to samples containing 500 μg of lysate protein. After overnight equilibration at 0–4 °C, immunoprecipitates were collected on protein AG-Sepharose beads by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in Buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Suspensions were then incubated for 8 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of Buffer B containing 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 50 μm ATP, 4 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 40 μm[159Ser]PKC-ε(AA153–164)-NH2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), a preferred substrate for PKC-ζ (12Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 296-307Google Scholar). In some experiments, PI-3,4-(PO4)2 or PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3 (Matreya) or PI-4,5-(PO4)2 (Fluka) was added as a sonicated suspension to the assay. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 5% acetic acid. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were spotted on p81 filter paper, washed in 5% acetic acid, and counted for32P radioactivity. Blank values (approximately 10–15%) were determined from precipitates obtained with preimmune serum or from incubations conducted in the presence of 100 μm PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate and were subtracted from total cpm to determine PKC-ζ-specific cpm. Reaction rates were linear with respect to time (see Fig. 1, inset) and were markedly dependent upon addition of phosphatidylserine but not Ca2+ or diolein. Insulin treatment did not influence either the amount of PKC-ζ recovered in immunoprecipitates or the blank values. Approximately 50% of total cellular PKC was recovered in the immunoprecipitates, and this recovery was not improved by the addition of a 2-fold excess of antibody. As reported previously (11Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.M. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates contained no detectable PKC-α, β, δ, or ε, which are known to be present in rat adipocytes (13Avignon A. Standaert M.L. Yamada K. Mischak H. Spencer B. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The dependence of enzyme activity on phosphatidylserine suggested that protein kinase B and protein kinase N were absent from PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates, since immunoprecipitable PKB and PKN activities are independent of phosphatidylserine. 2M. L. Standaert, L. Galloway, P. Karnam, G. Bandyopadhyay, J. Moscat, and R. V. Farese, unpublished observations. In all experiments, control and treated cells were derived from the same batch of adipocytes, and all samples were subsequently assayed in parallel; consequently, results of each treatment were expressed relative to the corresponding mean control value, arbitrarily set at 1. An example of absolute cpm typically observed in control and insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates in an individual experiment is shown in theinset of Fig. 1. In some assays of immunoprecipitated PKC-ζ, exogenous substrate was omitted, and 32P labeling of PKC-ζ itself was determined after its resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrolytic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and analysis in the Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst phosphorimager. PKC isoforms were immunoblotted as described (11Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.M. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), except that polyclonal antibodies used for PKC-β1 and PKC-β2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blots were quantified in a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst Chemiluminescence Imager. PI 3-kinase activity in adipocyte homogenates was measured as described previously (8Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Insulin provoked rapid increases in the enzyme activity recovered in PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates prepared from total adipocyte lysates (Fig. 1). Increases were observed throughout a 20-min treatment period with 10 nm insulin, but the increases appeared to be biphasic, with peaks at 0.5–1 and 10 min, and were maximal at insulin concentrations of 1–10 nm(see Fig. 1, inset). In general, increases in immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ enzyme activity at 10 min of 10 nm insulin treatment were approximately 2–3-fold, although they varied from 1.5-fold to 10-fold. This variability appeared to primarily reflect differences in basal activity, but in addition, the timing of the insulin-induced stimulatory peaks may have varied slightly in individual experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, insulin-induced increases in immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ were observed, not only in acutely incubated adipocytes but also in adipocytes that were incubated overnight prior to acute insulin treatment. As expected, the marked down-regulation of DAG-sensitive PKCs (α, β1, β2, δ, and ε) by overnight TPA (1 μm) treatment failed to influence basal or insulin-stimulated immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ enzyme activity and interestingly, at least in some experiments (e.g. see Fig. 2), 2-DOG uptake. (In other experiments (not shown), insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake was partly diminished, perhaps by alterations in the activity of the insulin receptor or other signaling factors caused by persistent activation of residual DAG-sensitive PKCs that in some cases (and for uncertain reasons) better survived overnight TPA treatment (e.g. see more substantial PKC-ε retention in experiments reported in Ref. 13Avignon A. Standaert M.L. Yamada K. Mischak H. Spencer B. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).) These findings, along with the fact that PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates contained little or no detectable immunoreactive PKC-α, -β, -δ, or -ε (see Ref. 11Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.M. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), (a) provided further evidence for the specificity of the presently used PKC-ζ enzyme assay; (b) showed that PKC-α, -β1, -β2, -δ, and -ε can be dissociated from glucose transport effects of insulin in the rat adipocyte (also see below); and (c) documented that PKC-ζ is activated by acute insulin treatment in adipocytes that are either used directly or first placed into primary culture and incubated overnight with or without TPA (see below). To determine whether PKC-ζ may be activated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism, we used three approaches. First, we used two relatively specific, but structurally different, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. In concentrations that inhibit PI 3-kinase and insulin effects on glucose transport, both LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited insulin effects on PKC-ζ activation in intact adipocytes (Fig. 3); in contrast, these inhibitors did not inhibit PKC-ζ enzyme activity when added directly to PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates (not shown). Second, we used a peptide (DADS(pY)ENMDNP-NH2) that, by virtue of its pYXXM motif, activates the SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase (see Ref. 14Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of this peptide with control adipocyte homogenates, there was a dose-related activation of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ (Fig. 4); moreover, this activation was blocked by 100 nm wortmannin, confirming that it was caused by PI 3-kinase activation (Fig. 4). Note that PI 3-kinase activity in these homogenates was increased nearly 2-fold by pYXXM-containing peptide and was fully blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 4). Third, we added polyphosphoinositides (PI-3,4-(PO4)2, PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3, and PI-4,5-(PO4)2) directly to control and insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig.5, each of these polyphosphoinositides, in doses found to be optimal in other experiments, stimulated enzyme activity of control PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates but had a relatively small or no significant effect on insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates; accordingly, these polyphosphoinositides obliterated or narrowed the difference in enzyme activity between control and insulin-stimulated immunoprecipitates. These findings suggested that PI 3-kinase is not only required for insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ in rat adipocytes but, through its lipid products, can account for this activation.Figure 4Activation of PI 3-kinase in vitro by pYXXM-containing peptide provokes a wortmannin-inhibitable increase in immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ enzyme activity. Postnuclear homogenate was prepared by sonicating control adipocytes in Buffer A containing supplemental 20 mm Na3V04 to minimize phosphatase-dependent hydrolysis of pY and incubated for 10 min with indicated concentrations of peptide (DADS(pY)ENMDNP-NH2) in the presence of 58 μmATP, 14 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm EDTA, 0.13 mm EGTA, and 250 μg/ml PI, with (+) or without (−) 100 nm wortmannin as indicated. After incubation, PKC-ζ was immunoprecipitated and assayed for enzyme activity. Values are mean ± S.E. of 3 determinations.

Insulin effects on these processes are sensitive to PKC inhibitors but, in general, the required concentrations of these inhibitors (8Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V.

Along these lines, it may be noted that bisindolemaleimides are potent inhibitors of conventional PKCs but inhibit PKC-ζ only at relatively high concentrations (18Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G.

J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and this was presently found to be the case for the bisindolemaleimide derivative RO 31-8220, which inhibited recombinant forms of PKC-α, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, -ε, -η, and -ζ with EC50 values of approximately 40, 20, 15, 15, 30, 100, 20, and 1000 nm, respectively (Fig.6). Presently, we also found that the inhibition of enzyme activity in adipocyte PKC-ζ immunoprecipitatesin vitro closely matched the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport observed in intact adipocytes in response to increasing doses of RO 31-8220 (Fig.7); EC50 values for inhibition of both processes were approximately 4 μm. (The differences between EC50 values of RO 31-8220 for inhibiting soluble preparations of recombinant PKC-ζversus PKC-ζ immobilized in immunoprecipitates (or, for that matter, contained in intact, lipid-laden adipocytes) may reflect differences in effective local concentrations of RO 31-8220 at catalytic enzyme sites under these different conditions.) In other studies, we found that RO 31-8220 did not inhibit insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase (8Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB or glycogen synthase.2 Thus, RO 31-8220 does not inhibit basic insulin signaling mechanisms that involve PI 3-kinase. We have also found that Go 6976, another bisindolemaleimide derivative that potently inhibits conventional PKCs (α, β, γ) but not novel or atypical PKCs, did not inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport in concentrations up to 100 μm (data not shown).Figure 7Inhibition of PKC-ζ enzyme activity and insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake by RO 31-8220 and the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (PS) in rat adipocytes. To study basal and maximal 2-DOG uptake in steady-state conditions, adipocytes were equilibrated for 15 min with RO 31-8220 or for 150 min (except inB, where this time was varied) with myristoylated PKC-ζ (myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL) or PKA (myr-GRTGRRNAI) pseudosubstrates, prior to treatment with 10 nm insulin for 30 min. Uptake of 2-DOG over 1 min was then measured. Effects of inhibitors on PKC-ζ enzyme activity (C and D) were measured in PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates prepared from insulin-treated adipocytes. In C and D, dose-related inhibitory effects of RO 31-8220 and PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate on insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (filled circles) and PKC-ζ enzyme activity (open circles) are depicted as percentage of the maximal insulin effect (2-DOG) or value (PKC-ζ activity).

Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL) but not the myristoylated PKA pseudosubstrate (myr-GRTGRRNAI) inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in intact adipocytes (Fig.7). Full inhibition was achieved at 90–150 min of treatment with 100 μm PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (Fig. 7 B), and the EC50 was 10–20 μm (note that similar treatment times and concentrations were reported in studies of PKC inhibition by a myristoylated PKC pseudosubstrate in HF cells (see Ref.20Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Of particular interest, enzyme activity of immunoprecipitated PKC-ζ in vitro was inhibited by concentrations of PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate that were nearly identical to those required for inhibition of glucose transport in intact cells (Fig. 7). Of further interest, in other studies,2 we have found that the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate does not inhibit immunoprecipitated PKB, and PKB is clearly not the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate-sensitive protein kinase that is required for glucose transport. As another approach to test the possibility that PKC-ζ may play a role in insulin stimulation of glucose transport, we co-transfected HA-tagged GLUT4 and various forms of PKC-ζ into rat adipocytes. After overnight incubation to allow time for expression (documented by transfecting HA-tagged PKC-ζ along with HA-tagged GLUT4 in some experiments; see Fig. 8), we found that wild-type PKC-ζ and, to a greater extent, point-mutated constitutive PKC-ζ increased HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation (Fig.9 and TableI). Stimulatory effects of insulin on HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation were still observed in cells expressing wild-type and constitutive PKC-ζ, although the percent increases, because of relatively greater increases in basal HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation, were diminished in these cells. In contrast to consistently observed stimulatory effects of wild-type and constitutive PKC-ζ, a kinase-inactive, dominant-negative form of PKC-ζ (see Ref.11Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.M. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) failed to significantly alter basal HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation, but in about half of the experiments, it inhibited insulin-stimulated HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 9 and Table I) by 53 ± 4% (mean ± S.E.; n = 4; p < 0.005; paired t test); this inhibition was only slightly less than that observed in adipocytes transfected with dominant-negative Δp85,viz., 61 ± 10% (n = 4;p < 0.01), which was also clearly inhibitory in about half of the experiments. Results from an experiment in which all forms of PKC-ζ and Δp85 were used in parallel (i.e. in the same batch of adipocytes) are shown in Fig. 9; results from multiple experiments are summarized in Table I. Relative increases in HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation owing to expression of wild-type and point-mutated constitutive PKC-ζ were 67 ± 18% (n = 6;p < 0.025) and 86 ± 28% (n = 7;p < 0.05), respectively; this may be compared with insulin-stimulated increases of 107 ± 24% (n = 13; p < 0.001). (Note that alterations in the translocation of HA-tagged GLUT4 could not be explained by changes in its expression in cells co-transfected with various forms of PKC-ζ or Δp85; see examples in Fig. 8.) Of further interest, as with point-mutated PKC-ζ, increases (60 ± 14%; n = 5; p < 0.025) in HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation were also observed in adipocytes expressing a constitutive form of PKC-ζ in which AA 1–241 (i.e. the inhibitory regulatory domain) was deleted. Although it was not possible to examine directly in transiently transfected cells, we presume (from observed stimulatory effects of transfected wild-type PKC-ζ on co-transfected HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation) that a significant fraction of expressed transfected wild-type PKC-ζ was enzymatically active, even without insulin addition.Figure 9Effects of transiently expressed wild-type (WT), constitutive (Constit), and dominant-negative (Dom-Neg) PKC-ζ on control and insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes. Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and co-transfected with pCIS2 containing cDNA encoding HA-tagged GLUT4 and with pCDNA3 alone (vector (V)) or pCDNA3 containing cDNA encoding wild-type, constitutive, or dominant-negative PKC-ζ or dominant-negative Δp85. After overnight incubation, the cells were equilibrated for 15 min in glucose-free KRP medium with or without 100 nm wortmannin, and then incubated for 30 min with or without 10 nm insulin, as indicated. KCN (2 mm) was then added, and samples were examined for cell count and cell surface content of HA-tagged GLUT4 (reflected by specific binding of 125I-labeled second antibody).

Similar results were observed in other experiments, except that there was some variability in absolute values and relative effects of insulin. See Table I for absolute values of HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation observed in multiple experiments.

See text for statistical evaluation of relative changes owing to various treatments in these experiments. Since PKC-ζ would be expected to operate downstream of PI 3-kinase in the activation of glucose transport, it was of interest to see whether wortmannin altered GLUT4 translocation. As shown in Fig. 9, 100 nm wortmannin blocked insulin effects on HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation but did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of constitutive PKC-ζ. Thus, the activated form of PKC-ζ appeared to operate independently or downstream of PI 3-kinase. In addition to increases in enzyme activity, insulin provoked rapid increases in 32P labeling of immunoprecipitable 70-kDa PKC-ζ in cells that had been incubated in the presence of32PO4 for 2 h prior to insulin addition (Fig. 10) (ATP is labeled to constant specific activity during a 2-h period (21Arnold T.P. Standaert M.L. Hernandez H. Watson J. Mischak H. Kazanietz M.G. Zhao L. Cooper D.R. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). This observation provided confirmatory evidence that the activation of PKC-ζ observed in vitro truly reflected an activation of PKC-ζ in intact cells. On the other hand, it may be noted that maximal increases in32P labeling of PKC-ζ occurred at 5 min, and this was different from the timing of maximal increases in PKC-ζ enzyme activity (compare Figs. 10 and 1). In addition to increasing 32P labeling of PKC-ζ in intact adipocytes, insulin provoked increases in 32P labeling of PKC-ζ that occurred during the in vitro assay of immunoprecipitated PKC-ζ (Fig. 11); this suggested that PKC-ζ autophosphorylated in vitro in response to insulin treatment in intact cells, and this postulation was confirmed by the finding that the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate markedly inhibited 32P labeling of PKC-ζ in vitro (Fig.11). Of further note, PI-3,4-(PO4)2 and, to a lesser extent, PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3 increased32P labeling of PKC-ζ in control but not insulin-treated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 11). These findings suggested that both insulin and D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides enhanced both the enzyme activity and autophosphorylation of PKC-ζ. The requirement for PI 3-kinase in insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ in intact adipocytes and the direct activating effects of both pYXXM-stimulated PI 3-kinase and D3-PO4polyphosphoinositides on PKC-ζ enzyme activity in vitrosuggested that PI 3-kinase is both necessary and sufficient for PKC-ζ activation. The precise mechanism for insulin-induced PKC-ζ activation is not entirely certain, but since added polyphosphoinositides stimulated control but not insulin-treated immunoprecipitates and since added polyphosphoinositides narrowed or obliterated the difference in enzyme activity between control and insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates, it follows that polyphosphoinositides may have largely accounted for increases in enzyme activity observed in insulin-stimulated PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates. In this scenario, insulin-induced increases in either D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides themselves and/or other presently uncertain stimulatory processes or factors that are induced in response to increases in these polyphosphoinositides (e.g. autophosphorylation of PKC-ζ) apparently were carried over into the PKC-ζ immunoprecipitate. Studies are currently in progress to evaluate these possibilities. In keeping with the possibility that PI 3-kinase may have been responsible for insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ, both PI-3,4-(PO4)2 and PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3stimulated the enzyme activity of control PKC-ζ immunoprecipitates. However, PI-4,5-(PO4)2 was equally effective in this regard, and indeed, maximal effects of PI-4,5-(PO4)2 were observed at a concentration of 1 μm, whereas PI-3,4-(PO4)2and PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3 were maximally effective at a higher concentration, viz., 10 μm. It is therefore important to note that insulin provokes rapid increases in the absolute levels of total polyphosphoinositides (3Farese R.V. Larson R.E. Sabir M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4042-4045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Farese R.V. Barnes D.E. Davis J.S. Standaert M.L. Pollet R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 11039-11045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this largely reflects increases in D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides, with little or no change in (and therefore not at the expense of) PI-4,5-(PO4)2 (22Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the possibility that phosphorylation may have modified PKC-ζ enzyme activity during insulin treatment, it should be noted that the peak of 32P labeling of PKC-ζ in intact adipocytes seemed to occur at a time when enzyme activity had temporarily receded, i.e. at the 5-min nadir of the biphasic activation sequence. This raises the possibility that some phosphorylation sites on PKC-ζ may have either no effect or an inhibitory effect on PKC-ζ enzyme activity. Accordingly, it is possible that there are multiple insulin-sensitive phosphorylation sites on PKC-ζ, with various effects on enzyme activity. Further studies on specific PKC-ζ phosphorylation sites will be required to evaluate this possibility and identify the kinase(s) responsible for these phosphorylations in intact adipocytes. The findings that the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate and RO 31-8220 provoked similar dose-dependent inhibitory effects on immunoprecipitated PKC-ζ enzyme activity and insulin-stimulated glucose transport suggested that PKC-ζ or a closely related kinase may be required for glucose transport effects of insulin. Along these lines, DAG-sensitive PKCs, despite being targets for the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate and RO 31-8220, can be excluded as being required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport, as suggested by the fact that phorbol ester-dependent depletion of PKC-α, -β1, -β2, -δ, and -ε and the conventional PKC inhibitor Go 6976 did not inhibit insulin stimulation of glucose transport; this conclusion was also supported by the fact that inhibitory effects of RO 31-8220 on insulin-stimulated glucose transport more closely matched the inhibition of PKC-ζ and occurred at considerably higher concentrations than those required to inhibit PKC-α, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -η. As alluded to above, PKB does not appear to be the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate-sensitive protein kinase that is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. This does not imply that PKB is not required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport, but it seems clear that at least one PKC or a closely related protein kinase is required, perhaps along with PKB. In this regard, as discussed above, DAG-sensitive PKCs appear to be ruled out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that PKC-ζ and/or another atypical PKC is the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate-sensitive kinase that is required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate, as well as RO 31-8220, may bind to and thus inhibit catalytic sites of other relevant, but presently unknown, non-PKC protein kinases. The activation of GLUT4 translocation by wild-type PKC-ζ, and even more so by constitutive PKC-ζ, in transiently transfected adipocytes provided further evidence that PKC-ζ may participate in the activation of GLUT4 translocation by insulin or other agonists. Indeed, two forms of constitutive PKC-ζ, one point-mutated in the pseudosubstrate region (see above) and one in which the regulatory domain was deleted, were nearly as effective as insulin in stimulating HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation. However, as with inhibitor studies, the finding that transient transfection of wild-type and constitutive PKC-ζ led to increases in HA-tagged GLUT4 translocation must be interpreted cautiously, as these increases reflect slowly developing responses (i.e. over 16–24 hours) that could be due to activation of a variety of factors and other non-PKC-ζ signaling pathways. Similarly, the partial inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by dominant-negative PKC-ζ suggested that PKC-ζ may be required for this stimulation, but this inhibition may also reflect nonspecific alterations in other signaling components in cells transfected with this interfering PKC-ζ mutant. Obviously, other experimental approaches will be needed to further evaluate the importance of PKC-ζ in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. It may be noted that the present findings on insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ and its potential role in the activation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in rat adipocytes are in keeping with findings in 3T3/L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, in which stable transfection with pCDNA3 containing cDNA encoding wild-type and dominant-negative PKC-ζ led to increases and decreases, respectively, of glucose transport (11Bandyopadhyay B.

Of further interest, we have found that PKC-ζ is activated by insulin in L6 myotubes (23Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and rat skeletal muscles;2 it is therefore tempting to suggest that PKC-ζ is activated by insulin and may participate in regulating glucose transport in a variety of insulin-sensitive cell types. In summary, our findings suggest that insulin activates PKC-ζ in rat adipocytes largely through PI 3-kinase-dependent increases in polyphosphoinositides. Our findings also suggest that PKC-ζ may be required for and may participate in the translocation of GLUT4 and the activation of glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Further studies are needed to test these hypotheses."

Renal organic anion transport has been widely studied for more than a century, both as a prototypic transport process and as a primary means for removal of xenobiotics from the body. Because many foreign chemicals, including plant and animal toxins, drugs, and pesticides, are organic anions or are metabolized to organic anions, the renal organic anion secretory system plays a critical role in limiting or preventing their toxicity. Over the last decade, a great deal of progress has been made toward understanding the physiology of this system, particularly its coupling to metabolic energy. Thus, it is now well established that organic anion secretion is a complex process involving distinctly different proteins at the apical and basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule (Fig. 1; for review, see Ref. 1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Transport across the basolateral membrane is energetically uphill. It is accomplished by a tertiary active process in which (a) Na+,K+-ATPase establishes the out > in Na+ gradient, (b) Na+/α-ketoglutarate cotransport driven by the movement of Na+ down its concentration gradient, in concert with intracellular metabolic α-ketoglutarate generation, sustains an out < in dicarboxylate gradient, and (c) dicarboxylate/organic anion exchange moves the organic anion substrate into the cell (2Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar). This cascade of events indirectly links organic anion transport to metabolic energy and the Na+ gradient, allowing entry of negatively charged substrate against both its chemical concentration gradient and the electrical potential of the cell. Once inside the cell, organic anions are subject to intracellular binding and to sequestration within vesicular structures (4Holohan P.D. Pessah N.I. Ross C.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1975; 195: 22-33PubMed Google Scholar, 5Miller D.S. Stewart D.E. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: R882-R890PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, luminal exit is thought to occur by anion exchange and/or facilitated diffusion (6Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 419-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Werner D.

However, considerable progress has recently been made for a variety of other transport proteins through the application of expression cloning techniques, leading to increased understanding of the regulation of their expression, identification of substrate binding sites, and a much more complete appreciation of their mechanisms of action (9Coady M.J.

We report here the successful isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the organic anion transporter from rat kidney, ROAT1.RESULTSScreening of cDNA LibraryTotal poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from rat kidney and size-fractionated on a linear sucrose gradient (14Wolff N.A. Philpot R.M. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to 12.3% and 11.1% sucrose were shown to support probenecid-sensitive uptake of 50 μm[3H]PAH that was 2–3-fold higher than that observed for the original unfractionated starting material when injected intoX. laevis oocytes (Fig.2 A). The 11.1% sucrose fraction mRNA was used as template for the construction of a cDNA library, which was screened by expression cloning inXenopus oocytes, yielding a single purified clone that supported PAH uptake (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of 1 mm probenecid, PAH uptake by oocytes expressing the cloned transporter was always reduced to the level observed for water-injected oocytes. Electrophoresis of the in vitro cRNA synthesis product showed a band ∼2.3 kb in size, which corresponds with the previously reported size range for kidney mRNA that supported PAH uptake (14Wolff N.A. Philpot R.M. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We refer to this cDNA clone as renalorganic anion transporter1, or ROAT1.Figure 2Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding an organic anion transporter. A rat kidney cDNA library was screened for the ability to support PAH uptake. cRNA transcribed from library plasmid DNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes (20 ng/oocyte) and allowed to express. Two days after injection, the oocytes were incubated for 1 h in 50 μm[3H]PAH in the absence (No Inhibitor) or presence (+ Probenecid) of 1 mm probenecid.

The ROAT1 cDNA is 2,227 bp long, including 253 bp of 5′-untranslated region, a single, large open reading frame 1,656 bp long, and 318 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The ATG at position 254 has the strongest correlation with Kozak's consensus sequence for translation initiation (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), giving a predicted protein length of 551 amino acids (Fig. 3 A). Hydropathy analysis with five different modeling programs yielded four different profiles for potential α-helical membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 3 B). Several regions were identified by all the modeling algorithms, and a few less well defined regions identified by some. However, all predictions agree that there is a large extracellular loop at approximately amino acid residues 40–136. Within this domain are several potential modification sites, including possible N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-39, Asn-56, Asn-92, and Asn-113; four cysteine residues at positions 49, 78, 105, and 128 that could participate in disulfide bond formation; and a possible protein kinase C site at Ser-129. In addition, there are four more protein kinase C consensus sites located at Ser-271, Ser-278, Thr-284, and Thr-334 and potential casein kinase II sites at Ser-325, Thr-515, and Ser-544. These latter consensus sites may or may not be located intracellularly, depending on the model used.Figure 3DNA and predicted amino acid sequence of ROAT1.

No obvious regions of highly conserved sequence were identified, even in the putative membrane-spanning domains. Rather, the peptides seem to share a low level of identity throughout their sequence. There are, however, three motifs conserved among ROAT1, NKT, OCT1, OCT2, and NLT: the positioning of four cysteine residues and a protein kinase C consensus site within the extracellular loop between predicted membrane-spanning domains 1 and 2, and two casein kinase II consensus sites (TableI).

Subsequent reprobing of the same blot with a 1,368-bp ROAT1 probe confirmed that the ROAT1 probe bound only to the library fractions known to support PAH uptake, and did not bind to oatp (Fig. 5,right panel). Therefore, ROAT1 was determined to be unique from oatp. This was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (see above).Figure 5Southern blot of cDNA library fractions. Left panel, the blot was probed with a 643-bp fragment from the liver organic anion transporter oatp (22Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Right panel, the same blot was probed with a 1,368-bp ROAT1 fragment, demonstrating that it does not recognize the liver transporter, nor any library fractions that did not support PAH transport (i.e. ALf1, ALf9.2.4.3.2, and ALf9.2.4.3.3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The same ROAT1 probe was used for a Northern blot and detected a strong signal in rat kidney (Fig. 6).

The luminal facilitated diffusion system is markedly dependent upon membrane potential (7Werner D. Martinez F. Roch Ramel F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 792-799PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martinez F. Manganel M. Montrose Rafizadeh C. Werner D. Roch Ramel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1145-F1153PubMed Google Scholar), whereas both the basolateral and luminal exchangers are not (3Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar, 31Blomstedt J.W. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Potential was altered by raising external K+, a condition previously shown to depolarize the plasma membrane of the oocyte (11Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). When ROAT1-expressing oocytes were incubated in OR-2 with a high potassium ion concentration (102.5 mm), there was no reduction in PAH transport (Fig.7). As a positive control, oocytes injected with OCT2 cRNA, an organic cation transporter known to have a large potential-sensitive transport component (32Sweet D.H. Walsh R.C. Pritchard J.B. FASEB Abstr. 1996; 10: A127Google Scholar), showed a 67% drop in transport of [14C]TEA when exposed under the same conditions (Fig. 7). Water-injected oocytes showed no uptake under either condition. Therefore, ROAT1-mediated PAH transport is independent of membrane potential.Figure 7Effect of membrane potential on substrate uptake. The 60-min uptake of 50 μm[3H]PAH by water- or ROAT1 cRNA-injected oocytes was compared under normal (2.5 mm K+) and membrane depolarizing conditions (102.5 mm K+; (11Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar)), in the absence (No Inhibitor) or presence (+ Probenecid) of 1 mm probenecid. We have documented the influence of potential on both ROAT1 and OCT2 in 6 animals; however, the data presented here are from a representative animal because the experiment has only been done with both transporters in the same animal on two occasions. Columns represent mean values ± S.E. from 10 oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition ProfileThe effects of various compounds and reduced temperature on PAH uptake were also examined (Fig.8). Incubation at 4 °C reduced uptake to just 3% of that seen at room temperature. The organic anions probenecid (1 mm), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG; 1 mm), bromcresol green (1 mm), and excess unlabeled PAH (1 mm) each reduced [3H]PAH uptake by 80–90%. In addition, like basolateral PAH/α-KG exchange (3Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar, 33Werner D. Roch-Ramel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F265-F272PubMed Google Scholar), but in contrast with luminal exchange (31Blomstedt J.W. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), ROAT1-mediated PAH uptake was not inhibited by urate (1 mm).Figure 8ROAT1 substrate specificity. cRNA from ROAT1 was injected into oocytes and [3H]PAH transport was measured after 60 min in the presence of several organic anions and cations, and at reduced temperature.

BCG, bromcresol green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transport was also unaffected by the P-glycoprotein inhibitor cyclosporin A (CSA; 10 μm). Unlike urate and CSA, which gave values essentially identical to control, the cation TEA appeared to inhibit slightly, albeit at a high concentration (5 mm). Lower concentrations of TEA were not inhibitory and, at concentrations from 0.05 to 1 mm, actually stimulated uptake 20–40% (data not shown). To establish whether these modest effects might indicate that TEA was a substrate for ROAT1, the uptake of 200 μm [14C]TEA by ROAT1 cRNA and water-injected oocytes was measured. No difference in uptake between the two groups was observed (data not shown).The ability of α-KG to cis-inhibit PAH uptake (Fig. 8) is potentially diagnostic in that the basolateral dicarboxylate/organic anion exchanger should be inhibited by external α-KG, whereas luminal PAH carriers should not be inhibited by α-KG. Glutarate is also an effective counterion for this exchanger (3Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar). When ROAT1 cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in OR-2 containing 0–1 mmglutarate, a clear, dose-dependent inhibition of PAH uptake was observed, with significant inhibition at 200 μmglutarate and above (Fig. 9).Figure 9Effect of external glutarate on PAH uptake. Two days after injection, oocytes were incubated for 60 min in OR-2 with 50 μm [3H]PAH and 0–1 mm glutarate. Uptake is expressed as percent of uptake when no compound was present, i.e. 0 mm glutarate.

For this determination, glutarate is the preferred counterion since, in contrast to α-KG, it is not extensively metabolized (34Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 969-975PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed substantial accumulation of 1 mm[14C]glutarate within uninjected Xenopusoocytes over time (170 pmol/oocyte after 90 min; data not shown). Incubating the oocytes in 1 mm glutarate for 90 min before exposure to PAH (i.e. preloading) significantly stimulated PAH uptake in ROAT1-expressing oocytes, as compared with non-preloaded oocytes (Fig. 10). Moreover, glutarate preloading had no effect on water-injected oocytes. Thus, glutarate induced trans-stimulation of ROAT1-mediated PAH uptake.Figure 10trans-Stimulation of PAH uptake.Water-injected or ROAT1 cRNA-injected oocytes, either non-preloaded (control) or preloaded by a 90-min incubation in 1 mm glutarate, were washed with glutarate-free medium and exposed to 50 μm [3H]PAH for 60 min in the absence (No Inhibitor) or presence (+ Probenecid) of 1 mm probenecid. Data are mean ± S.E. values from a representative animal (10 oocytes/treatment). The experiment was repeated four times and data calculated as percent of control uptake. Uptake by preloaded, cRNA-injected oocytes was 204 ± 19% (p ≤ 0.01). * denotes p ≤ 0.05, using paired Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specificity of trans-stimulation was assessed by comparing the effects of glutarate with the poorly metabolized dicarboxylate methylsuccinate, which cannot substitute for α-KG or glutarate on the α-KG/PAH exchanger (35Chatsudthipong V.

Pflugers Arch. 1984; 400: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.11, increasing the preloading concentration of glutarate from 0 to 5 mm increased glutarate's stimulatory effect on PAH uptake in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching an impressive 250% increase over non-preloaded oocytes at 5 mm. In contrast, methylsuccinate failed to stimulate PAH uptake over the same concentration range. Indeed, at 5 mm, methylsuccinate inhibited PAH uptake by 70% (p ≤ 0.01).Figure 11Dose response of glutaratetrans-stimulation. Oocytes injected with ROAT1 cRNA were preloaded for 90 min in 0–5 mm glutarate or methylsuccinate, washed briefly in dicarboxylate-free medium, and incubated with 50 μm [3H]PAH for 60 min.

Using 10 min to approximate initial rate, the kinetics of ROAT1-mediated PAH transport were assessed by incubating oocytes expressing ROAT1 in medium containing 0.05–1 mm PAH (Fig.12 A). A double-reciprocal plot of the saturation data was constructed and linear regression analysis was performed to obtain estimates for K m of 70 μm and for V max of 6 pmol/oocyte/10 min (Fig. 12 B). It should be noted that, in the oocyte expression assay system, V maxreflects the degree of cRNA expression rather than a true measure of maximal uptake rate for a transporter in its native tissue.Figure 12Kinetic analysis of ROAT1-mediated PAH uptake. ROAT1 cRNA-injected oocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations of PAH for 10 min. A, saturation analysis. Total PAH uptake was corrected for diffusion by subtracting a diffusion correction factor of 9.18 ± 0.85 pmol/μm PAH.

This system has been actively investigated for more than 100 years, in part because of its effectiveness, which can clear the renal plasma of a good substrate like PAH in a single pass, and in part because of its critical role in protecting against the toxic effects of anionic xenobiotics through their rapid excretion via the urine (1Pritchard J.B.

Recent reports have demonstrated that cytochromec is released from mitochondria during apoptosis and have suggested that this release may be a critical step in the activation of proapoptotic caspases and subsequent cell death. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Bcl-2 can prevent the release of cytochromec from mitochondria in cells triggered to undergo apoptosis. This has led to the hypothesis that the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-2 family members are due specifically to their ability to prevent cytochrome c release thus preventing subsequent cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation. In the present report, we use microinjection techniques to investigate the relationship between cytochromec release, induction of apoptosis, and Bcl-xLactivity in intact cells. We demonstrate that microinjection of cytochrome c into the cytosol of human kidney 293 cells results in a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis. In contrast, MCF7 breast carcinoma cells (stably transfected to express the Fas antigen CD95, and denoted MCF7F) that lack detectable levels of caspase 3 (CPP32), are totally resistant to microinjection of cytochrome c. However, transfection of MCF7F cells with an expression plasmid coding for pro-caspase 3, but not other pro-caspases, restores cytochrome c sensitivity. Although MCF7F cells are insensitive to cytochrome c microinjection, they rapidly undergo apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner in response to either tumor necrosis factor or anti-Fas plus cycloheximide, and these deaths are strongly inhibited by Bcl-xL expression. Furthermore, microinjection of cytochrome c does not overcome these antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-xL. Our results support the concept that the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm can promote the apoptotic process in cells expressing pro-caspase 3 but that cytochromec release is not sufficient to induce death in all cells. Importantly, the ability of Bcl-xL to inhibit cell death in the cytochrome c-insensitive MCF7F cells cannot be due solely to inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

Virtually all cells in such organisms have the capacity to undergo this form of death, and thus the onset of the process must be under tight physiological control. Genetic studies in lower organisms have identified several genes that control the onset and execution of programmed cell death (3Hengartner M.E. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar,4White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and additional studies have shown that apoptosis in mammalian cells is controlled by homologous genes that have been conserved throughout evolution (5Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that apoptosis requires the action of the caspases, a set of death effector cysteine proteases with specificity for Asp-x bonds (6Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S.

Another set of proteins, the Bcl-2 family, control the activation of caspases (8Armstrong R. Aja T. Xiang J. Gaur S. Krebs J. Hoang K. Bai X. Korsmeyer S. Karanewsky D. Fritz L. Tomaselli K. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are localized to the intracellular membranes of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope (11Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 12González-Garcia M. Pérez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Núñez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, many questions remain concerning the molecular mechanism by which these membrane-bound Bcl-2 family members exert their control over caspase activation. Recent reports have demonstrated that the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c can promote caspase activation in a cell-free apoptosis system (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in cells undergoing apoptosis and that this release is prevented by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL expression (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K.

Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 has also been shown to regulate cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that cytochromec release is an obligate step in the apoptotic pathway and that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members function primarily to regulate cytochrome c release (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I.

However, to date, no data has been presented concerning a causative apoptotic role for cytochromec in intact cells. Here, we utilize cellular microinjection techniques to analyze the effects of cytochrome c on the initiation of apoptosis in living cells and to assess the relationship between cytochrome c release and Bcl-xLfunction. MCF7 cells (17Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) stably transfected to express the Fas antigen alone (denoted MCF7F) or both Fas and Bcl-xL (denoted MCF7F/Bcl-xL) (gifts of Dr. V. Dixit, University of Michigan) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Human embryonic kidney 293 and HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated on glass cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf) at a density of 40,000/well in 24-well plates for 17–20 h prior to microinjection or cytokine treatment. For experiments utilizing cytokines as death stimuli, cells were treated with either 500 ng/ml anti-Fas (clone CH-11, PanVera Labs, Madison, WI) plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, 100 ng/ml TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; amc, aminomethylcoumarin. (R & D Systems) plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, or cycloheximide alone. Following microinjection or cytokine treatment, flat cells (normal) and round/shrunken cells with condensed nuclei (apoptotic) were counted and are presented as percent apoptotic cells. In microinjection experiments, 100–150 cells were counted for each condition; in experiments using cytokines as the death stimulus without microinjection, at least 300 cells were counted for each condition. Cell microinjection was performed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope using an Eppendorf pressure injector (model 5246) and micromanipulator (model 5171). Microinjection needles (about 0.1-μm inner diameter) were pulled from glass capillaries using a horizontal electrode puller (Sutter Instrument, model P-97) and loaded using Eppendorf microloaders. MCF7F or MCF7F/Bcl-xL cells were plated on glass cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf) 24 h prior to injection. To identify injected cells, the injectate contained 0.3% dextran-conjugated Texas Red dye (M r 10,000, lysine fixable, Molecular Probes) in H2O. Dye alone or dye plus cytochromec (Sigma; C7752 from horse heart, diluted in H2O and freshly prepared for each experiment) were injected into the cytoplasm of cells (pressure, 80–100 hPa; time, 0.3 s). Cells were switched into fresh medium immediately after injection. The intracellular concentrations of microinjected proteins are estimated to represent a 10–100-fold dilution of the pipette concentration based on previous calibrations using similar microinjection apparatus and an estimated cellular volume of 4–5 pl (18Minaschek G. Bereiter-Hahn J. Berthold G. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, we estimate that the amount of cytochrome c injected is proportional to the pipette concentration and that 40–400 fg are delivered when the pipette concentration is 1 mg/ml. Accordingly, with a pipette concentration of 30 mg/ml (our maximal concentration) we estimate that 1.2–12 pg per cell are delivered. At various times, injected cells were scored for apoptosis as described above. After scoring for apoptosis, Hoechst dye 33342 (Sigma) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. In some experiments, caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-aldehyde (Bachem) or zVAD-fmk (8Armstrong R. Aja T. Xiang J. Gaur S. Krebs J. Hoang K. Bai X. Korsmeyer S. Karanewsky D. Fritz L. Tomaselli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16850-16855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) were diluted with H2O, added to the injection solution at a final concentration of 1 mm, and co-injected with cytochrome c. Myoglobin (from horse skeletal muscle), hemoglobin (human and horse), and histone proteins (Type VI-S and VIII-S) were from Sigma. MCF7F cells were plated on glass cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf) at a density of 60,000/coverslip and placed in single wells of a 24-well plate. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pCMV-green lantern protein (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 μg of either empty pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3 engineered to express pro-caspase 3, mutated pro-caspase 3 (C163G) (in which cysteine 163 was mutated to glycine using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturers protocol), pro-caspase 9, or pro-caspase 10, using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each pro-caspase expression vector, full-length coding sequence was subcloned by polymerase chain reaction utilizing Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Each construct was sequenced in its entirety before use. 24 to 48 h after transfection, green fluorescent cells were microinjected with Texas Red dye alone or dye plus cytochromec, with or without 1 mm caspase inhibitor. At various times, injected cells were scored for apoptosis as described above. 293, HeLa, and MCF7F cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended with 5 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 250 mm sucrose. The cells were homogenized with 75–100 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were centrifuged twice at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting mitochondrial pellets were discarded. The supernatants of the 10,000 × g spin were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants (designated S100) were used for caspase activity assays. To determine the amount of cytochrome c per cell, various concentrations of horse heart cytochrome c(standards) and total postnuclear cell lysates derived from 500,000 MCF7F, MCF7F/Bcl-xL, or 293 cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 16% gels (Novex, La Jolla, CA) and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 + 0.4% casein (I-block, Tropix, Bedford, MA) and probed with monoclonal antibody 7H8.2C12 that recognizes denatured cytochrome c (PharMingen). Blots were washed, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and developed by incubation with chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix). Cytochromec concentration in the extracts was estimated by comparison to band intensity of the standards. To evaluate the ability of cytochrome c to activate caspases in cytoplasmic extracts, 10 μg of S100 fraction from each cell preparation was incubated with 0.16 μm cytochrome c and 1 mm dATP at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 10 μl of buffer A. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate and DEVD-amc was added to a final concentration of 10 μm in 190 μl of buffer B (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 3 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Fluorescent amc production was measured at excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm using a Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (PerSective Biosystems). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the activity was expressed as change in fluorescence units per hour per 10 μg S100. To determine a physiologically relevant dose of cytochromec for cellular microinjection, we determined the total amount of cytochrome c per cell in the 293 and MCF7F cell lines, since this amount would represent the upper bound for endogenous releasable cytochrome c in an intact cell. Using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes denatured human and horse cytochrome c, Western blots were performed on extracts prepared from known numbers of cells, and band intensity was compared with measured amounts of horse heart cytochrome c. The results indicated that 293, MCF7F, and MCF7F/Bcl-xL cells each contain comparable amounts of cytochrome c ranging between 40 and 100 fg/cell (data not shown). Under our experimental conditions we estimate that 40–400 femtoliters of pipette solution is microinjected per cell, and thus with a 3 mg/ml cytochrome cpipette solution, a minimum of 120 fg cytochrome c is delivered. This amount represents more than the total cytochromec content per cell for 293 and MCF7F cells. We then analyzed the effects of cytochrome c injection into the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. Cells were microinjected with solutions of 0.1–3.0 mg/ml of cytochrome c together with Texas Red (to mark injected cells) and analyzed for the onset of apoptosis (Fig. 1, A andB). We observed a dose-dependent induction of cell death with a threshold at 0.3 mg/ml. The onset of apoptosis was rapid, with half-maximal effects seen between 2 and 3 h postinjection. Significant apoptosis was observed as early as 1 h following the injection of 3 mg/ml cytochrome c (data not shown). The cytochrome c-induced apoptosis of 293 cells was dependent upon caspase activity, since it was inhibited by co-injection of the caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-aldehyde (7Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) or zVAD-fmk (8Armstrong R. Aja T. Xiang J. Gaur S. Krebs J. Hoang K. Bai X. Korsmeyer S. Karanewsky D. Fritz L. Tomaselli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16850-16855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,A and B). The induction of apoptosis was specific for cytochrome c microinjection since no effect was seen when equivalent amounts of other heme-containing proteins, myoglobin or hemoglobin, were injected (data not shown). It was also possible that the cytochrome c effects were due to its highly basic character. However, microinjection of the basic histone VI-S and VIII-S proteins did not induce apoptosis (data not shown), further indicating that the cytochrome c effect was specific. Having demonstrated that cytochrome c microinjection was sufficient to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in 293 cells, we then analyzed the effects of cytochrome cmicroinjection into two other cell types; the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 stably transfected to express Fas on its surface (MCF7F cells) and the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa. Surprisingly, MCF7F cells were completely inert to 3 mg/ml cytochrome cmicroinjection (Fig. 2 A). HeLa cells showed a response intermediate between that seen with 293 cells and MCF7F cells. We also evaluated the ability of cytochromec, in the presence of 1 mm dATP (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar), to activate DEVD-amc cleaving activity in cytoplasmic extracts made from 293, MCF7F, and HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B). The ability of cytochrome c plus dATP to activate DEVD-amc cleaving activity in these extracts correlated precisely with the sensitivity of the respective intact cells to microinjected cytochrome c. These data suggested that the cytochrome c-induced death of intact 293 and HeLa cells was due to activation of endogenous caspases that were either absent or inhibited in MCF7F cytoplasm. To further analyze the basis for the resistance of MCF7F cells to cytochrome c, we microinjected it into MCF7F cells that had been transiently transfected with expression vectors for various pro-caspases. MCF7F cells do express caspases and can undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis (17Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 19Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Tomaselli, unpublished observations. Thus, we first determined if expression of pro-caspase 3 in MCF7F cells would render them sensitive to cytochrome c microinjection. The results indicate that whereas MCF7F cells transfected with a control vector remain insensitive to cytochrome c, microinjection of cells transfected with the pro-caspase 3 vector led rapidly to apoptosis (Fig. 3, A andB). This death was due to activation of the expressed caspase since death was inhibited by co-injection of Ac-DEVD-aldehyde. Furthermore, expression of a catalytically inactive pro-caspase 3, mutated at the active site cysteine, did not render the cells sensitive to cytochrome c. Transfection with pro-caspase 3 alone was not sufficient to induce apoptosis, and cells remained viable unless microinjected with cytochrome c (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, cytochrome c sensitivity was conferred only by expression of pro-caspase 3 but not by expression of either pro-caspase 10 (Mch-4) (7Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J.

Under our conditions, expression of pro-caspases 9 and 10 did not cause apoptosis in these cells (but see Duan et al., Ref. 22Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Poirier G.G. Froelich C.J. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16720-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The fact that MCF7F cells were not killed by cytochrome cinjection but are capable of undergoing apoptosis in response to other stimuli (17Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 23Clarke M.F. Apel I.J. Benedict M.A. Eipers P.G. Sumantran V. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Doedens M. Fukunaga N.

A. 1995; 92: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) presented an opportunity to challenge the hypothesis that Bcl-2 family members function primarily to regulate cytochromec release. First, we confirmed that treatment with cycloheximide plus either TNF or anti-Fas antibody induced a robust level of apoptosis over an 8-h period in MCF7F cells (17Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 19Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and that this was effectively inhibited by expression of Bcl-xL(Fig. 4). However, microinjection of cytochrome c, even at levels estimated to be at least 10-fold greater than the total cytochrome c content of the cell (30 mg/ml pipette concentration) failed to induce apoptosis in cycloheximide-treated MCF7F or Bcl-xL-transfected MCF7F cells. Because these cells were insensitive to injected cytochromec, these results suggested that the Bcl-xLeffects were unlikely to be due to cytochrome csequestration. It remained possible, however, that anti-Fas or TNF treatment could have caused cellular events that induced cytochrome csensitivity in MCF7F cells. If so, Bcl-xL could still function by blocking endogenous cytochrome c release in these death paradigms even though untreated MCF7F cells remained cytochrome c resistant. To evaluate this possibility we tested whether cytochrome c microinjection could overcome the inhibition by Bcl-xL of cycloheximide/anti-Fas-induced death. As shown in Fig. 5, Bcl-xL transfected MCF7F cells were insensitive to cycloheximide plus anti-Fas treatment with or without cytochromec microinjection. In contrast, cycloheximide plus anti-Fas treatment killed the control MCF7F cells, and this death was enhanced only slightly by microinjection of cytochrome c. The fact that microinjection of cytochrome c could not overcome the Bcl-xL inhibition of apoptosis demonstrates that the Bcl-xL protection observed in this model was not due to blocking cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We have used microinjection techniques to characterize the effects of cytoplasmic cytochrome c in intact cells. Normally, cytochrome c is localized exclusively in mitochondria but is released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis; we used microinjection to mimic this release. First, we analyzed three cell lines all of which can undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis in response to certain stimuli but that differ dramatically in their response to microinjection of cytochrome c. Whereas microinjection was sufficient to induce rapid cell death in 293 cells, MCF7F cells were inert; HeLa cells showed intermediate sensitivity. The ability of cytochrome c to induce apoptosis in a cell correlated with its ability to induce caspase activity in cytoplasmic extracts derived from that cell type. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis by cytochrome c was reconstituted in the insensitive MCF7F cells by transfection of pro-caspase 3 (CPP32) but not by two other caspases. At the highest concentrations used, the amount of exogenous cytochromec microinjected into cells (1.2–12 pg/cell with 30 mg/ml pipette solution) greatly exceeded the estimated total amount of endogenous cytochrome c (40–100 fg/cell). These estimates were based on Western blots comparing the band intensity of cell extracts to horse cytochrome c standards. Although the extracts were derived from human cells while the standards were derived from horse, this was unlikely to have underestimated the cytochromec content per cell. The 7H8.2C12 antibody used in the Western blots was raised against pigeon cytochrome c and shown to react with a 12 amino acid peptide that is identical between horse and human (24Jemmerson R. Johnson J.G. Burrell E. Taylor P.S. Jenkins M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Borden D. Margoliash E. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Proteins. III. The Chemical Rubber Company, Cleveland, Ohio1976: 268Google Scholar). In addition, quantitative assays demonstrated that the antibody bound with equivalent affinity to pigeon and horse cytochrome c, although they differ at three positions in the relevant 12 amino acid peptide (24Jemmerson R. Johnson J.G. Burrell E. Taylor P.S. Jenkins M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus we believe that our Western analysis provides an accurate estimate of cytochrome ccontent in 293 and MCF7 cells. Our values are lower than those derived from mitochondrial counts in primary hepatocytes where cytochromec content may be 2–4 pg/cell (26DeRobertis E.D.P. Saez F.A. DeRobertis E.M.F. Cell Biology. Sixth Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1975: 200-230Google Scholar). However, at the highest pipette concentrations used in our experiments, we delivered amounts of cytochrome c comparable to those present even in the mitochondion-rich primary hepatocyte. Thus, we conclude that MCF7F cells do not undergo apoptosis even when injected with supraphysiological amounts of cytochrome c. Note, however, that the cytochrome c microinjected in these experiments was derived from horse muscle. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that microinjection of human cytochrome c might have demonstrated different effects, horse and human cytochrome cmolecules are highly homologous, differing in only 6 out of 104 amino acid residues (25Borden D. Margoliash E. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Proteins. III. The Chemical Rubber Company, Cleveland, Ohio1976: 268Google Scholar). Our results support a model in which cytochrome c can promote and accelerate apoptosis in cells expressing pro-caspase 3, but they cast doubt on the broader hypothesis (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar) that cytochromec release is necessary for apoptosis to occur in general. Apoptosis in thymocytes does not require pro-caspase 3 activity, as evidenced by a normal response to apoptotic stimuli in thymocytes derived from caspase 3 knockout mice (27Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). In addition, most organs with the exception of the brain have a normal histology in caspase 3 knockout mice, suggesting that apoptosis in most cell types is not dependent on caspase 3 (27Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although MCF7F cells lack pro-caspase 3,2 they are fully capable of undergoing rapid apoptosis in response to cytokines plus cycloheximide (Figs. 4 and 5). Although we did not analyze all pro-caspases, our data suggest that cytochrome c has specificity for pro-caspase 3 as compared with pro-caspases 9 and 10 or the endogenous caspases expressed in MCF7F cells (that include pro-caspases 7 (Mch-3) (19Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and 8 (Mch-5, FLICE)2). The apparent specificity of cytochromec for pro-caspase 3 together with the observation that apoptosis can occur independently of this caspase suggests that cytochrome c release is not necessary for the induction of apoptosis. However, we have observed that cytochrome cis, in fact, released from mitochondria in MCF7F cells following anti-Fas/cycloheximide treatment.2 Our data favors the interpretation that this mitochondrial release is a consequence of apoptotic events rather than a cause of caspase activation, however, experiments with Xenopus extracts and U937 cells have suggested that cytochrome c release is not blocked by caspase inhibitors (15Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Isreals S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A.

Further experiments in which cytochromec activity is blocked or inactivated will be necessary to prove whether or not this mitochondrial protein plays a necessary causative role in apoptosis. Cytochrome c is synthesized in cells from cytoplasmic mRNA molecules and specifically imported into the mitochondrion where it resides in the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (28Gonzales D.H. Neupert W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 753-768PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are localized to intracellular membranes including the outer mitochondrial membrane (11Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar,12González-Garcia M. Pérez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Núñez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized that these proteins exert their antiapoptotic effects by preventing cytochrome c from being released into the cytoplasm (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R.

Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In support of this view, Bcl-2 expression does inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cells and from isolated organelles (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, from these experiments it is difficult to distinguish between a direct effect of Bcl-2 on cytochrome c release and an indirect effect whereby Bcl-2 inhibits other proapoptotic events thus preventing mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, the adenovirus-derived Bcl-2 homologue E1B-19K is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis but is largely excluded from the mitochondrial membrane (29White E. Blose S. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30White E. Cipriani R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9886-9890Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of mechanisms that are not specific to mitochondria. Similarly, engineered Bcl-2 molecules targeted to non-mitochondrial intracellular membranes retained activity in certain models of apoptosis (31Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. EMBO. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used the cytochromec-insensitive MCF7F cell line to study the relationship between the activity of Bcl-xL and cytochrome crelease. The fact that MCF7F cells were not sensitive to cytochromec microinjection allowed us to separate Bcl-xLactivity from cytochrome c activity. We reasoned that if Bcl-xL only served to inhibit cytochrome crelease, then it was unlikely that Bcl-xL would demonstrate activity in a cytochrome c-resistant cell. However, our data clearly showed that Bcl-xL inhibits apoptosis induced by cycloheximide/cytokine treatment in these cells. Furthermore, if Bcl-xL only inhibited cytochrome c release, then cytochrome c microinjection would specifically overcome the Bcl-xL protective effect and induce apoptosis in MCF7F/Bcl-xL cells treated with cycloheximide/anti-Fas. However, even under these conditions, microinjection of cytochromec did not induce death in these cells. We conclude, therefore, that the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-xL cannot be explained solely by inhibition of cytochrome c release. Although our data cannot exclude the possibility that Bcl-xL also has direct effects on cytochrome crelease, this cannot be the only mechanism by which it inhibits apoptosis. If sequestration of cytochrome c is inadequate to explain the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-xL, what other mechanisms may be relevant? One likely mechanism involves Bcl-xLinteractions with a functional homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-4 protein (32Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans, theced-4 gene is required for caspase-dependent cell death and may be a target for the inhibitory effects of thebcl-2 homologue, ced-9 (33Shaham S. Horvitz H.R.

Due to its role in pathogenesis, NF-κB is considered a key target for drug development. In the present report we show that sanguinarine (a benzophenanthridine alkaloid), a known anti-inflammatory agent, is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Treatment of human myeloid ML-1a cells with tumor necrosis factor rapidly activated NF-κB, this activation was completely suppressed by sanguinarine in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

The reversal of inhibitory effects of sanguinarine by reducing agents suggests a critical sulfhydryl group is involved in NF-κB activation. Sanguinarine blocked the tumor necrosis factor-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB, and inhibited translocation of p65 subunit to the nucleus. As sanguinarine also inhibited NF-κB activation induced by interleukin-1, phorbol ester, and okadaic acid but not that activated by hydrogen peroxide or ceramide, the pathway leading to NF-κB activation is likely different for different inducers.

Sanguinarine (13-methyl[1,3]benzodioxolo[5,6-c]-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-i]phenanthridinium) is derived from the root of Sanguinaria canadensis and other poppy-fumaria species (for references, see Ref. 1Shamma M. Guinaudeau H. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1986; 3: 345-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This benzophenanthridine alkaloid is a structural homologue of chelerythrine, which is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (2Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys.

NF-κB is a nuclear transcription factor that resides in its inactive state in the cytoplasm as a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκBα subunits. On activation of the complex, IκBα sequentially undergoes phosphorylation, ubiquinitation, and degradation, thus releasing the p50-p65 heterodimer for translocation to the nucleus (for references, see Ref. 10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with various inflammatory and stress stimuli including lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-1, interleukin-1; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; OA, okadaic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; NE, nuclear extracts; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. interleukin (IL)-1, ceramide, hydrogen peroxides, ultraviolet light, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and okadaic acid (OA) activates the transcription factor. NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the expression of various cytokines, their receptors, major histocompatibility complex genes, cell adhesion proteins, and other gene products involved in inflammation, septic shock, atherosclerosis, cell proliferation, and viral replication including human immunodeficiency virus-1.

Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of sanguinarine on activation of NF-κB induced by a wide variety of agents including TNF. The results show that sanguinarine is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation that blocks the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thus suggesting that sanguinarine is a potential candidate for intervening in NF-κB-dependent pathological responses. A highly purified preparation of sanguinarine was kindly provided by Dr. Ken Godowski of ATRIX Laboratories Inc. (Fort Collins, CO). OA was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Ouabain and chelerythrine chloride were obtained from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). Ceramide (C2) was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Berberine, bovine serum albumin, and PMA were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP with a specific activity of 7000 Ci/mmol was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Bacteria-derived recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, and IL-1 were kindly provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Antibodies against IκBα, cyclin D1, the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65, and c-Rel were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Histiocytic lymphoma (U937), myeloid (ML-1a), normal human foreskin fibroblast (FS4), and T (Jurkat) cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and fetal bovine serum (10%). The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105cells/ml in T25 flasks (Falcon 3013, Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing 10 ml of medium and grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cultures were split when cell density reached 1–2 × 106/ml. EMSA were carried out as previously described in detail (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar, 22Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared from 2 × 106cells after different treatments and then either used immediately or stored at −70 °C. EMSA was performed by incubating 4 μg of NE for 15 min at 37 °C with 8 fmol of 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB-binding site (5′-TTGTTACAA GGGACTTTC CGCTG GGGACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. The DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 5% native polyacrylamide gels, and the gel was then dried. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with mutated NF-κB sites (5′-TTGTTACAA CTCACTTTC CGCTG CTCACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, NE prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with the antibodies against either p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibody against cyclin D1 was included as a negative control. Western blotting was carried out essentially as described previously (23Reddy S.A.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cytoplasmic extracts from treated cells were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for IκBα. To determine p65 levels, NE and cytoplasmic extracts were resolved on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to Immobilon P membranes, probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p65, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL-Amersham). The structures of sanguinarine and its analogues are shown in Fig.1. Chelerythrine, a near homologue of sanguinarine, is a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (2Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Both berberine and sanguinarine interact with DNA (24Saran A. Srivastava S. Coutinho E. Maiti M. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 74-77PubMed Google Scholar). Our tests of these agents showed that, under the conditions we used, they had no effect on cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). ML-1a cells were pretreated with different concentrations of sanguinarine (up to 50 μm) for 30 min, incubated either with or without TNF (10 pm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then examined for NF-κB activation by EMSA. Fig.2 A shows that sanguinarine inhibited the TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum effect occurring at 10 μm. The IC50 of sanguinarine for the inhibition of TNF-dependent NF-κB was calculated to be approximately 3 μm (data not shown). Sanguinarine by itself did not activate NF-κB at 1, 10, 20, and 50 μmconcentrations; however, a very low but reproducible activation of NF-κB was observed at 2 and 5 μm (Fig. 2 A). TNF activated NF-κB within 10 min and reached maximum at 15–40 min (Fig. 2 B). No activation of NF-κB by TNF was observed in cells pretreated with sanguinarine. To gain further insight into the kinetics of inhibition, we preincubated the cells with sanguinarine for 30, 15, and 5 min and then exposed them to TNF. Sanguinarine was also added at the same time as 0 min and 5, 15, and 30 min after TNF. In every case, TNF was present for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2 C, coincubation of cells with sanguinarine and TNF was as effective as preincubation in blocking the activation of NF-κB. Sanguinarine could also block, although only partially, the NF-κB activation even when added 5 min after TNF. It had no effect when added 10 min or later after TNF. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that a high concentration of TNF (10 nm) induces more robust and rapid (within 5 min) activation of NF-κB (22Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether sanguinarine could also inhibit a robust response to TNF, sanguinarine-pretreated cells were challenged with increasing concentrations of TNF (up to 10 nm) for 30 min and then examined for NF-κB (Fig.3 A). Although the activation of NF-κB by 10 nm TNF was very strong, sanguinarine inhibited it just as effectively as it did the 0.01 nmconcentration. These results show that sanguinarine is a very potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Since NF-κB is a family of proteins, various combinations of Rel/NF-κB protein can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to a specific sequence in DNA (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). To show that the retarded band visualized by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, we incubated NE from TNF-activated cells with antibody to either p50 (NF-κB1) or p65 (Rel A) subunits and then conducted EMSA. Antibodies to either subunit shifted the band completely to a higher molecular weight (Fig. 3 B). Antibody against c-Rel or unrelated antibody, like antibody to cyclin D1, did not shift the NF-κB band, thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consists of p50 and p65 subunits. The activation of NF-κB by TNF, as indicated by the band on EMSA, was quite specific since the band disappeared when unlabeled oligo was added. Also no binding took place when we used a mutant oligonucleotide in which CTC was substituted for GGG at the NF-κB-binding site (Fig. 3 B). It has been shown that both TPCK, a serine protease inhibitor, and herbimycin A, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, down-regulate NF-κB by chemical modification of the NF-κB subunits, thus preventing its binding to DNA (25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 26Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether sanguinarine also modifies NF-κB proteins, we incubated NE prepared from TNF-activated cells with different concentrations of sanguinarinein vitro. EMSA (Fig. 3 C) showed that sanguinarine at a concentration as high as 100 μm did not modify the ability of NF-κB to bind to the DNA. We also examined the ability of sanguinarine to block TNF-induced NF-κB activation in another myeloid line (U937) and in lymphoid (Jurkat) and diploid fibroblast (FS4) cells. The results of these experiments (Fig. 4) indicate that sanguinarine inhibited NF-κB in all three cell types. Almost complete inhibition was observed with 5 μm sanguinarine, thus suggesting that this effect of sanguinarine is not cell type specific. Interestingly, a strong constitutive band was observed in Jurkat cells that bound specifically to the NF-κB site, as is shown by the abrogation of binding by a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. Formation of this band was not inhibited by sanguinarine, suggesting that sanguinarine inhibited only the TNF-inducible form of NF-κB (p50-p65 heterodimer). The composition of this constitutive band in Jurkat cells as determined by supershift analysis was found to be entirely p50 homodimer (data not shown). Several reports indicate that sanguinarine can inhibit Na/K-ATPase (6Seifen E. Adams R.J. Riemer R.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 60: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Cohen H.G.

Commun. 1975; 62: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine if sanguinarine blocks NF-κB activation by inhibiting this ATPase, we tested the ability of ouabain, a well known, potent inhibitor of Na/K-ATPase (27Akera T. Science. 1977; 198: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Schwartz A. Lindenmayer G.E. Allen J.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1975; 27: 3-134PubMed Google Scholar), to block TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Ouabain had no effect on TNF-induced activation of this transcription factor (Fig. 5, upper panel). Thus it appears that sanguinarine blocks NF-κB activation through some other mechanism. As shown in Fig. 1, chelerythrine and berberine have a strong structural similarity to sanguinarine. Therefore, we investigated their ability to block NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 5, neither chelerythrine (middle panel) nor berberine (lower panel) had any effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. As chelerythrine is known to inhibit protein kinase C (2Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) and berberine mediates its effects by binding to DNA (24Saran A. Srivastava S. Coutinho E. Maiti M. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 74-77PubMed Google Scholar), the results indicate that sanguinarine does not block NF-κB activation by either of these mechanisms. Besides TNF, NF-κB is also activated by wide variety of other agents including OA, PMA, ceramide-C2, H2O2, and IL-1. However, whether activation by these agents occurs by the same mechanism as that by TNF is not clear. Therefore, we examined the ability of sanguinarine to block NF-κB activation induced by different agents. As shown in Fig.6, sanguinarine completely blocked the activation of NF-κB by PMA, IL-1, and OA. Interestingly, it only partially blocked the effect of ceramide and had no effect on H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest that the pathway leading to NF-κB activation by TNF, PMA, IL-1, and OA is different from that induced by ceramide and H2O2. The biological effects of phenylarsine oxide,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), herbimycin A, and caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) phenethyl ester on suppression of NF-κB activation can be reversed by reducing agents (25Finco T.S.

A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Also, sanguinarine contains an iminium ion that can form a pseudobase with thiol groups of the proteins (31Wolff J. Knipling L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13334-13339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of DTT to reverse the inhibitory effect of sanguinarine on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Cells were treated with sanguinarine in the presence and absence of DTT and then examined for the activation of NF-κB by TNF. As shown in Fig. 7, DTT by itself did not have any effect on TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB, but it completely reversed the inhibition induced by sanguinarine. These results demonstrate the critical role of sulfhydryl groups in the TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB. Sanguinarine contains a thiol-reactive iminium group, and if the thiol groups of NF-κB were already blocked by DTT in the NE and EMSA buffers, sanguinarine could not have modified the NF-κB proteinsin vitro. However, the results remained the same when the NE were prepared in DTT-free buffer and when the DTT was omitted from EMSA buffer (data not shown). Therefore, sanguinarine inhibits NF-κB activation through a mechanism different from that of TPCK or herbimycin A. The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκBα (for review, see Ref. 10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). To determine whether sanguinarine affected IκBα degradation, the kinetics of activation of NF-κB by TNF under the influence of sanguinarine was studied. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared for EMSA and IκBα Western blot analysis, respectively. Activation of NF-κB by 10 pm TNF occurred as early as 10 min of treatment, peaked between 15 and 40 min, and declined by 60 min (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment with sanguinarine inhibited NF-κB activation at all the time points of TNF treatment. Western blot analysis of IκBα protein in cytoplasmic extracts revealed that TNF treatment of cells caused a slower migrating band of IκBα to appear within 5 min; by 15 min IκBα mostly disappeared, and by 60 min it reappeared (Fig.8 A). The disappearance and reappearance of IκBα corresponded with the peak and decline of NF-κB, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with sanguinarine abolished the appearance of the TNF-induced slower migrating band, and the degradation of IκBα. The appearance of the slower migrating band has been shown to be induced by phosphorylation of IκBα at serine 32 and 36 (25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 32DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because NF-κB activation also requires nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we examined the cytoplasmic and nuclear pool of p65 protein by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the TNF-induced appearance of p65 in the nucleus was blocked by sanguinarine. These results indicate that sanguinarine prevented phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, and hence the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In our study, sanguinarine completely blocked the activation of NF-κB induced by TNF, IL-1, phorbol ester, and OA but not that activated by H2O2 and ceramide (Fig.9). Furthermore, the effect was not cell type specific. Chelerythrine and berberine, structural analogues of sanguinarine, had no effect on NF-κB activation. Sanguinarine's inhibitory effects were not due to inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase. Rather, sanguinarine blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. How sanguinarine inhibits the activation of NF-κB is not clear at present. It enters the cells rapidly without altering membrane fluidity and localizes in the nucleus (5Agarwal S. Reynolds M.A. Pou S. Peterson D.E. Charon J.A. Suzuki J.B. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 6: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the nucleus it intercalates with DNA, preferring GC-rich sequences (24Saran A. Srivastava S. Coutinho E. Maiti M. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 74-77PubMed Google Scholar, 33Maiti M. Nandi R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1987; 5: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Nandi R. Maiti M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but this is not how it inhibits NF-κB activation in as much as in vitrosanguinarine treatment did not inhibit binding of NF-κB to the DNA. Likewise, berberine, which is also known to intercalate into DNA (24Saran A. Srivastava S. Coutinho E. Maiti M. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 74-77PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on NF-κB activation. Nor did sanguinarine directly chemically modify NF-κB. In contrast, herbimycin A and TPCK (25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 26Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), both of which inhibit NF-κB activation, can modulate the RXXRXRXXC sequence present in NF-κB proteins (25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 35Kumar S. Rabson A.B. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that sanguinarine inhibits a Na/K-ATPase (6Seifen E. Adams R.J. Riemer R.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 60: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Cohen H.G. Seifen E.E. Straub K.D. Tiefenback C. Stermitz F.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2555-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Straub K.D. Carver P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 62: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since ouabain, a potent Na/K-ATPase inhibitor had no effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, sanguinarine must not inhibit NF-κB activation by blocking this ATPase. Our results show that sanguinarine inhibits NF-κB activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. Two observations also suggest that sanguinarine targets an early step in the activation of NF-κB, the most likely being either IκB kinase or a step that modulates IκB kinase. 1) It inhibits NF-κB when pre- or coincubated with TNF, but not when added 10 min after the addition of TNF. 2) It inhibits only inducible NF-κB, and not the constitutive p50 homodimer. Also, it inhibits activation of NF-κB in human foreskin fibroblast cells, FS4, where inducible NF-κB is known to be regulated via IκBβ (46Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The activation of inducible NF-κB requires phosphorylation of IκBα at serine 32 and 36 and of IκBβ at serine 19 and 23 (32DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both IκBs have been postulated to be phosphorylated by either the same kinase or by similar kinases (32DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBs results in ubiquinitation at lysines 21 and 22 in IκBα and lysine 22 in IκBβ (32DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyubiquinitated IκBs are targeted to proteasomes and quickly degraded (37Chen Z.A. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Inhibition of phosphorylation results in inhibition of IκB degradation. Indeed, sanguinarine inhibits inducible phosphorylation of IκBα and its subsequent degradation. How protein kinase is activated by the inducers of NF-κB activation is not certain, but the production of reactive oxygen intermediates upstream from protein kinase has been suggested (38Siebenlist U. Franzo G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 39Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). In human peripheral blood neutrophils, sanguinarine has been shown to inhibit PMA-induced oxidative bursts and generation of superoxide anions (5Agarwal S. Reynolds M.A. Pou S. Peterson D.E. Charon J.A. Suzuki J.B. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 6: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17Vavreckova C. Ulrichova J. Hajduch M. Grambal F. Weigl E. Simanek V. Acta Univ. Palacki. Olomuc. Fac. Med. 1994; 138: 7-10PubMed Google Scholar). Also, sanguinarine has been shown to have antioxidative activity against spontaneous oxidation (40Firatli E. Unal T. Onan U. Sandalli P. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1994; 21: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that sanguinarine suppresses NF-κB activation by inhibiting reactive oxygen intermediate generation. This is consistent with our findings that sanguinarine inhibited, besides TNF, NF-κB activation induced by PMA, okadaic acid, and IL-1. Interestingly, however, sanguinarine did not block ceramide or H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest a difference in the signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation by different agents. Recently, the putative IκBα kinase has been shown to be regulated by ubiquinitation (41Chen Z.A. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Whether sanguinarine can directly interfere with any of these processes is not known. However, sanguinarine has a reactive iminium group that has been shown to form pseudobases with thiol groups of several proteins (31Wolff J. Knipling L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13334-13339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 42Lombardini L.B. Props C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43Luhova L.

Enzyme Inhibition. 1995; 9: 295-302Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 44Fadeeva M.D. Beliaeva T.N Tsitologiya. 1988; 30: 685-690PubMed Google Scholar, 45Fadeeva M.D. Beliaeva T.N. Sokolovskaia E.L. Tsitologiya. 1987; 29: 576-581PubMed Google Scholar), including some kinases (42Lombardini L.B. Props C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); it is likely that it modifies some reactive thiol groups of some protein(s) required for the phosphorylation of IκB. Reducing agents like DTT form a complex with the iminium ion of sanguinarine, thus neutralizing its thiol-reactive properties (42Lombardini L.B. Props C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since pretreatment of cells with DTT and coincubation of DTT and sanguinarine abolished the inhibitory effect of sanguinarine on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, it is possible that sanguinarine acts by directly modifying either IκB kinase or some other intermediate upstream to the kinase. These intermediates must be common to the activation pathway of a number of inflammatory agents tested here (Fig. 9). Overall our results presented provides a novel mechanism by which sanguinarine may exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects."

Brain cholesterol is characterized by a very low turnover with very little exchange with lipoproteins in the circulation. Very recently we showed that there is a continuous age-dependent flux of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol from the human brain into the circulation (Lütjohann, D., Breuer, O., Ahlborg, G., Nennesmo, I., Sidén, Å., Diczfalusy, U., and Björkhem, I. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 9799–9804). Here we measured the rate of synthesis of cholesterol as well as the conversion of cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in rat brain in vivo with use of an18O2 inhalation technique and mass isotopomer distribution analysis. Cholesterol synthesis was found to correspond to 0.03 ± 0.01% of the pool per h. Conversion of cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was of a similar magnitude, about 0.02% of the pool per h. Brain microsomes converted endogenous cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at a similar rate when incubated in the presence of NADPH. When incubated with whole homogenate and subcellular fractions of rat brain, there was no significant conversion of tritium-labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol into more polar products. Plasma from 18O2-exposed rats contained 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol with an enrichment of 18O similar to that in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in the brain.The results suggest that the present 24(S)-hydroxylase mediated mechanism is most important for elimination of cholesterol from the brain of rats. There is a slow conversion of brain cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol with a rapid turnover of the small pool of the latter oxysterol due to leakage to the circulation (half-life of brain 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol is about 0.5 days as compared with 2–4 months for brain cholesterol). It is evident that the 24(S)-hydroxylation greatly facilitates transfer of cholesterol over the blood-brain barrier and that this hydroxylation may be critical for cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body. Brain cholesterol is characterized by a very low turnover with very little exchange with lipoproteins in the circulation. Very recently we showed that there is a continuous age-dependent flux of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol from the human brain into the circulation (Lütjohann, D., Breuer, O., Ahlborg, G., Nennesmo, I., Sidén, Å., Diczfalusy, U., and Björkhem, I.

It is evident that the 24(S)-hydroxylation greatly facilitates transfer of cholesterol over the blood-brain barrier and that this hydroxylation may be critical for cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. The largest pool and concentration of cholesterol in the body is found in the brain. Being a constituent of myelin and cell membranes cholesterol is important for the function of this organ and an inborn defect in cholesterol synthesis is associated with serious neurological and mental dysfunctions (1Tint G.S. Irons M. Elias E.R. Batta A.K. Frieden R. Chen T.S. New Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Brain cholesterol is efficiently protected from exchange with circulating lipoproteins by the blood-brain barrier (2Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1637-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with this, most recent studies have favored the view that the majority of brain cholesterol is synthesized locally although at a low rate (for a review, see Ref. 3Snipes G.J. Suter U. Bittman R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 28. Plenum Press, New York1997: 173-204Google Scholar). Using in vivo and in vitrotechniques the estimated half-life of cholesterol has been found to be 4–6 months in rats (4Serougne-Gautheron C. Chevallier F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Andersson M. Elmberger P.G. Edlund C. Kristensson K. Dallner G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The protection of brain cholesterol from exchange with circulating lipoprotein by the blood-brain barrier is not absolute (6Gordion E.L. Danielsson P.E. Ngvyen T.S. Winn H.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7.De Vries, H. (1995) Characteristics of Blood-Brain Barrier Endothelial Cells in Response to Inflammatory Stimuli. Thesis, Costar Europe Ltd., Badhoevededorp, The Netherlands.Google Scholar) but this exchange seems to be low in relation to the local synthesis of cholesterol. To what extent there is a flux of unmetabolized cholesterol in the opposite direction from the brain into the circulation, is not known. If the blood-brain barrier is equally effective in both directions to prevent flux of cholesterol, there is a need for another more specific mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the brain to compensate for the synthesis under steady-state conditions. Very recently we described an age-dependent net flux of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol from the human brain into the circulation (8Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and suggested that it could be of importance for cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. The concentration of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was found to be 30–1500 times higher in the brain than in any other organ except the adrenals, consistent with the possibility that most circulating 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol originates from the brain. To evaluate the importance of this new mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the brain, we have now used an animal model for studies on synthesis of cholesterol and oxysterols in vivowith use of an 18O2 inhalation technique (9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This technique utilizes the fact that synthesis of cholesterol as well as subsequent oxidation of cholesterol into oxysterols involves participation of a mixed function oxidase that incorporates one oxygen atom into the product. Conversion of cholesterol into 24-hydroxycholesterol has previously been demonstrated in vitro in microsomal preparations of ox and rat brain (10Lin Y. Smith L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Dhar A.K. Teng J.I. Smith L.L. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The extremely low degree of conversion prevented, however, a detailed characterization of the enzyme. Using microsomes from rat brain and NADPH as cofactor Lin and Smith reported a conversion of 1,2-[3H]cholesterol into 24-hydroxycholesterol of only 0.15–0.18% during a 15-h incubation (10Lin Y. Smith L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dhar et al. (11Dhar A.K. Teng J.I. Smith L.L. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported a similar or somewhat higher conversion of added labeled cholesterol when incubated with bovine brain microsomes under the same conditions. Since neither the time course of the reaction, nor the degree of equilibration of the added labeled cholesterol with the endogenous cholesterol could be established, it was not possible to evaluate the capacity of the enzyme system from these studies. We report here that it is possible to assay the very low cholesterol 24-hydroxylase in rat brain microsomes under enzymological conditions with use of the above18O2 technique. In theory, the primary product of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase in the brain might be eliminated from the brain as such or as a metabolite. To evaluate the latter possibility we have prepared tritium labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol and incubated it with preparations of rat brain under different conditions. Reagents and solvents used were of analytical or high performance liquid chromatography grade. Unlabeled and deuterium-labeled oxysterols were those used in previous work from this laboratory (8Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl.

[4-14C]Cholesterol with a specific radioactivity of 55–60 mCi/mmol was obtained from The Radiochemical Center (Amersham, United Kingdom) and was purified by aluminum oxide chromatograpy before use. 18O2 (95% isotopic and 98% chemical purity) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA, in break-seal ampoules of atmospheric pressure. 3α-3H-Labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol was prepared from unlabeled cholesterol as described previously for preparation of other tritium-labeled 3β-hydroxy 5-unsaturated steroids (12Aringer L. Eneroth P. Steroids. 1971; 18: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The material obtained was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, using toluene/ethyl acetate as moving phase. The material was pure as judged by gas chromatography, as trimethylsilyl ether (cf. below) and was diluted with unlabeled 24-hydroxycholesterol to have a specific radioactivity of 40 × 106 cpm/mg. Male rats of an outbred Sprague-Dawley strain weighing 200–250 g were used. In some in vitro experiments a rat weighing 750 g and several rats weighing 50 g were used. The animals were given free access to a standard chow and water. The experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee at the Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital. The rats were decapitated and their brains (including cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, and medulla) were removed. After removal of the meninges and rinsing several times with 0.9% saline, the brains were homogenized in 2.5 volumes of 0.15 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA with a loosely fitting Teflon pestle in a glass homogenizing tube. The microsomal fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 800 × g, 20,000 ×g, and 100,000 × g. The microsomal pellet obtained after the last centrifugation was resuspended in the homogenizing buffer. In some experiments a crude mitochondrial fraction was obtained by recentrifugation of the above 20,000 ×g infranatant at 6,500 × g for 20 min and resuspending the pellet in the homogenizing buffer. Acetone powder of some brain microsomal preparations was prepared as described by Sheferet al. (13Shefer S. Cheng F.W. Hauser S. Batta A.K. Salen G. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 532-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction obtained as above was found to contain 0.21 ± 0.04 mg of cholesterol/ml and 0.63 ± 0.04 μg of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol/ml. The mitochondrial fraction contained about 0.50 mg of cholesterol/ml and 1.2 μg of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol/ml. The acetone powder contained about 25 μg of cholesterol in an equivalent corresponding to 1 ml of the above microsomal fraction. Under standard conditions, 1.5–3 ml of microsomal or mitochondrial fractions were incubated in a total volume of 3 ml of the homogenizing buffer for 2 h at 37 °C together with 3 μmol of NADPH. In some incubations with mitochondrial fractions, isocitrate, 7 mm, was also added to the incubation mixture. In some specific experiments [4-14C]cholesterol was added to the incubation mixture, 1.5 × 106 cpm, dissolved in 20 μl of acetone, 1 mg of Tween 80, or 4.5 μmol of cyclodextrin. In some specific experiments, 50 μg of 3H-labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol dissolved in 20 μl of acetone was incubated with brain microsomes, mitochondria, or whole homogenate under the same conditions as above. All incubations were terminated and extracted with chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v). In several experiments the incubations were performed in a closed system containing about 20% oxygen in nitrogen. The oxygen contained about 70% 18O2 (varying between 60 and 80% in different experiments). The closed tube containing the incubation mixture was first equilibrated with nitrogen under atmospheric pressure. Two syringes were connected to the closed system, one of which contained the appropriate 18O2-containing gas mixture. The 18O2 was then injected into the closed tube and a corresponding volume of gas was collected by the other syringe. By fluxing the gas mixture from one syringe through the tube with the incubation mixture to the other syringe several times, a mixing of the gases and an equilibrium with the incubation mixture was obtained. Samples of the gas were taken through a septum during and after incubation by another syringe and analyzed for content of18O2 by mass spectrometry (9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The enrichment of 18O was found to be 69 ± 11% under the conditions employed. The inhalation experiments were performed essentially as described previously (9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but with a modification allowing the rats to be exposed to a relatively constant concentration of 18O2. A pump and filter device was used that continuously freed the18O2-containing gas from carbon dioxide and water vapor. The volume of the system was allowed to decrease in parallel with the consumption of oxygen and elimination of CO2 and water by the filters. Under these conditions it was possible to keep a relatively constant ratio between16O2 and 18O2 during the experiment despite a continuous drop in the O2/N2 ratio. The absolute concentration of oxygen (18O2 + 16O2) thus varied in these experiments between 45 and 16%. In most of these experiments the relative content of 18O2 varied between 60 and 65%. After evaporation of the organic solvent, the material in the chloroform phase obtained in the extraction of the above incubations was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis and solid phase extraction as described previously (14Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The oxysterol fractions were converted into trimethylsilyl ether derivatives and analyzed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an HP 5970 quadropole type mass specrometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Helium was used as carrier gas with a column pressure of 75 kiloPascal. Samples (2 μl) dissolved in hexane were injected in a splitless mode. Electron impact ionization at 70 eV was applied. The column temperature was kept at 180 °C for 1 min, subsequently raised at a rate of 35 °C/min to 270 °C, and finally increased 20 °C/min to 310 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in a selective ion monitoring mode using the molecular ions atm/z 546 and 548 for registration of trimethylsilyl ether of unlabeled and 18O-labeled 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, respectively. In the in vivo experiments, also the ion at m/z 550 was followed to exclude the possibility of incorporation of two atoms of18O in the product. No such incorporation was seen in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. In the analysis of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in serum, the ions atm/z 546 and 548 gave signals too low to allow for accurate analysis, and in these cases the ions at m/z 413 and 415 were used (M-90–43). In other experiments with 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol with an 18O label at C-24, it was ascertained that the same result was obtained regardless of whether the fragment at m/z 415 or the molecular ion was used for determination of the amount of 18O. Also in the in vivo experiments in which incorporation of18O in plasma 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol was measured, the molecular ions atm/z 546 and 548 were used. In the case of circulating 7α-hydroxycholesterol, a small fraction of the material (about 4%) had incorporated two molecules of 18O after 12 h of exposure to 18O2 (see Ref. 9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the analysis of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol obtained after exposure of a subcellular fraction or a living rat to18O2, the contribution from the natural isotopomer cluster of unlabeled 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was subtracted from the monitored intensity at m/z 548 or 415 (see Ref. 9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sensitivity and precision in the analysis of enrichment of 18O in the above measurements are dependent upon the amount and purity of material analyzed and the amount of data collected from each chromatographic peak. The calculations were based on the computer-derived areas of the recordings of the intensities of the different ions. Under the conditions employed the “background noise” in the analysis was found to have an amplitude of approximately ± 0.3% in the case of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol isolated from whole brain or subcellular fractions from brain and about ±2% in the case of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol isolated from plasma. The unlabeled 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol used in the above subtraction was isolated from the appropriate control microsomes or control rat exposed to air. In the determination of the very low enrichment of 18O in cholesterol in the brain of rats exposed to 18O2 in vivo, relatively high amounts of material (micrograms) were isolated and purified by C18chromatography after alkaline hydrolysis. The material was analyzed as trimethylsilyl ether with the mass spectrometer focused on the M + 1 ion at m/z 459 and on the M + 2 ion at m/z 460. Each cholesterol extract was analyzed in quadruplicate. In separate recordings the ratio between the intensities at m/z 458 and 459 was measured (which is not affected by the content of18O in the molecule). Due to the high amounts of pure material analyzed and the great number of data collected it was possible to determine the 18O enrichment in cholesterol with a background noise of only ±0.02%. Unlabeled 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, as well as cholesterol, was assayed by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry with use of deuterium-labeled standards as described previously (14Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,15Björkhem I. Blomstrand R. Svensson L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 54: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The extract obtained after incubation of3H-labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol was subjected to thin-layer chromatography using toluene/ethyl acetate, 1:4 (v/v), as solvent. Radioactivity in the different zones was assayed with a Berthold Tracemaster 20TLC scanner. The extract obtained after incubation of [4-14C]cholesterol was assayed by the same method. Exposing three rats to oxygen enriched with 60–70% 18O2 for 12–40 h resulted in a significant incorporation of 18O into brain cholesterol (0.1–1.3%). Since the brain homogenates must have been contaminated by blood to some extent (possibly a few percent) the possibility must be considered that part of the above small incorporation of 18O could have been due to contamination by circulating cholesterol. The latter had an enrichment of18O of 1–3%. In the experiment with the rat exposed to18O2 for 40 h, the enrichment was found to be 1.3% in brain cholesterol and 3.1% in circulating cholesterol. Since the total concentration of cholesterol in the brain is 1–1.5% (w/w) and the corresponding concentration in the blood is less than 10% of this in a rat, it is evident that a small contamination with blood cholesterol cannot have a significant effect on the results. A contamination by 2% blood would give a contribution of 18O in brain cholesterol by less than 0.01% under these specific conditions. Due to the very low turnover of brain cholesterol (4Serougne-Gautheron C. Chevallier F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Andersson M. Elmberger P.G. Edlund C. Kristensson K. Dallner G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the accumulation of newly synthesized cholesterol could be assumed to reflect cholesterol synthesis. When taken into account the enrichment of 18O in the inhalation atmosphere and the time of exposure in each experiment, the synthesis rate was calculated to be 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05%, respectively, of the cholesterol pool per h in the three rats. This is consistent with a half-life of 2–4 months. In one previously published single experiment (8Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we found that a Sprague-Dawley rat exposed to 18O2 in atmosphere (isotopic purity about 80%) for 3.5 h had incorporated about 11% 18O in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in its brain. This would correspond to a turnover of the brain 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at a rate of at least 4% per h. This is a minimum figure since part of the labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol formed during the time of exposure might have been eliminated. The above experiment was repeated with another Sprague-Dawley rat that was exposed for 3 h to an atmosphere containing oxygen enriched to about 80% with 18O2 In this case the incorporation of 18O in brain 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was found to be about 9%, which also corresponds to a turnover of the brain 24-hydroxycholesterol at a rate of at least 4% per h. In another set of experiments rats were exposed to18O2 for varying periods of time up to 12 h. The enrichment of 18O in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in the brain of these rats was found to increase about linear with time (results not shown). To calculate true synthesis and turnover of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in the brain, the disappearance rate of this steroid must be known. Fig.1 shows an experiment allowing calculation of this. Two rats were exposed to an atmosphere enriched to about 60% with 18O2 for 12 h and one of the rats was then sacrificed. The other rat was exposed to normal air for additional 15 h prior to sacrifice. 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol isolated from the brain of the first rat had an 18O content of 21% while that isolated from the brain of the second rat had an 18O content of 9%. From the results of the experiment with the first rat the accumulation of newly synthesized 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was calculated to be about 35% of the pool during the 12-h exposure to18O2 (taking into account that the enrichment of 18O2 in the atmosphere was 60% rather than 100%). Considering that part of the newly synthesized18O-labeled 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol is eliminated during this period of time, the rate of synthesis must exceed 3% of the pool per h. From the finding that the 18O content in brain 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol had decreased to less than half as a consequence of 15-h exposure to16O2 in the second rat, it is evident that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol disappears from the brain at a rate of about 4% of the pool per h (T 1/2 = 11 h). Assuming steady-state conditions, the rate of synthesis of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol would then correspond to about 4% of the pool per h. This would correspond to elimination of cholesterol by this mechanism in the second rat in Fig. 1 at a rate of about 0.015% per h. It should be noticed that the rate of incorporation of 18O in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in the previous two experiments was somewhat higher than that obtained in the experiment shown in Fig.1. Assuming the same ratio between accumulation of newly synthesized 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and turnover, the elimination of cholesterol by the 24(S)-hydroxylase mechanism would be about 0.02% per h in the previous two experiments. It is of interest to compare the rate of elimination of cholesterol by the 24-hydroxylase mechanism with the rate of synthesis of cholesterol in the same rat. This rate was 0.02% of the pool per h in the first rat and 0.03% of the pool per h in the second rat in Fig. 1. Cholesterol was thus eliminated by the 24-hydroxylase mechanism at a rate about half or more of its synthesis in the rats studied. To study the flux of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol from the brain into the circulation, plasma samples were collected from all of the rats and analyzed with respect to enrichment of 18O in 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and in the major circulating oxysterols (see Ref. 9Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20278-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, enrichment of 18O in plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was similar to that of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol isolated from the brain of the same animal. The enrichment of 18O in 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in plasma was found to vary between 44 and 64% in all the above experiments in which the rats were exposed to18O2 only (enrichment calculated as (M + 2)/(M + M + 2). In the experiment in which a rat was exposed to18O2 for 12 h and for16O2 for 15 h, a plasma sample collected after 12 h contained 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol with an 18O content of 56 and 64%, respectively (Fig. 1). A plasma sample collected 15 h later from the same rat contained 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol with an 18O content less than 1%. It is evident that there is a much higher rate of elimination of newly synthesized 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol than newly synthesized 24(S)- hydroxycholesterol. Incubations of brain microsomes with highly purified [4-14C]cholesterol and NADPH under the conditions described by Dhar et al. (11Dhar A.K. Teng J.I. Smith L.L. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) gave negligible conversions into labeled product with chromatograpic properties as 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, in general, considerably less than 0.2%. In our hands the small extent of conversion of the labeled cholesterol varied considerably in different sets of experiments, regardless of the time of incubation and the mode of addition of the cholesterol (acetone, cyclodextrin, or Tween 80). If it would be possible to remove most of the endogenous cholesterol from brain microsomes with retention of enzymatic activity, a higher conversion of exogenous labeled cholesterol would be expected. Acetone extraction (13Shefer S. Cheng F.W. Hauser S. Batta A.K. Salen G. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 532-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the brain microsomes gave preparations containing less than 10% of the original content of cholesterol. All these preparations were, however, completely inactive. Since the microsomal 24(S)-hydroxylase system is likely to be saturated with substrate cholesterol, the possibility was tested to assay the production of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol by measuring this steroid in brain microsomes before and after incubation without adding substrate. Using the sensitive and accurate method based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry and a deuterium-labeled internal standard (14Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), the initial amount of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was found to be 0.72 μg/ml of the brain microsomal fraction in a typical experiment. After 2 h of incubation this amount had expanded to 0.82 μg and was further increased to 0.86 μg after 20 h of incubation. The increase in amount of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (about 50 ng/h/ml) appeared to be approximately linear with time during the first 2 h of incubation. This was confirmed in another experiment in which the amount of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol increased from 0.64 to 0.72 μg during 2 h of incubation. This increase corresponds to a conversion of about 0.02% of the endogenous cholesterol per h under the conditions employed. Addition of exogenous cholesterol to the brain microsomes, dissolved in acetone or cyclodextrin, did not further increase the yield of the product in this assay. It is evident that the enzyme system was saturated with substrate under the conditions employed. Due to the very low degree of conversion and the small expansion of the relatively large endogenous pool of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, the above assay was, however, less reproducible. In some experiments there was no linear increase in the amount of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. Another more successful strategy for assay of cholesterol 24(S)-hydroxyla"

It is required for embryonic development of the pancreas and transactivates theGlut2, glucokinase, insulin, and somatostatin genes. Here we show that exposure of isolated rat pancreatic islets to palmitic acid induced a ∼70% decrease in IDX-1 mRNA and protein expression as well as 40 and 65% decreases in the binding activity of IDX-1 for its cognate cis-regulatory elements of theGlut2 and insulin promoters, respectively. The inhibitory effect of palmitic acid required its mitochondrial oxidation since it was prevented by the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor bromopalmitic acid. The palmitic acid effect on IDX-1 was correlated with decreases in GLUT2 and glucokinase expression of 40 and 25%, respectively, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Insulin and somatostatin mRNA expression was also decreased by 40 and 60%, whereas glucagon mRNA expression was not modified. After 48 h of exposure to fatty acids, total islet insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon contents were decreased by 85, 55, and 65%, respectively. At the same time, total hormone release was strongly stimulated (13-fold) for glucagon, whereas its was only marginally increased for insulin and somatostatin (1.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively). These results indicate that elevated fatty acid levels 1) negatively regulateIdx-1 expression; 2) decrease the expression of genes transactivated by IDX-1 such as those for GLUT2, glucokinase, insulin, and somatostatin; and 3) lead to an important increase in glucagon synthesis and secretion. Fatty acids thus have pleiotropic effects on pancreatic islet gene expression, and the negative control ofIdx-1 expression may be an initial event in the development of these multiple defects.

Fatty acids thus have pleiotropic effects on pancreatic islet gene expression, and the negative control ofIdx-1 expression may be an initial event in the development of these multiple defects. One of the metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes mellitus in both human and animals is a pronounced hyperlipidemia with an increase in plasma free fatty acids (1McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 2Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1996; 44: 863-870Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar). These defects may already be observed in the prediabetic state, and the increase in circulating free fatty acids may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes. For instance, in male Zucker diabetic (fa/fa) rats, plasma free fatty acids levels become elevated before the onset of diabetes, whereas in female rats, which do not develop diabetes, no such elevation occurs even though they display the same hypertriglyceridemia as male rats (3Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). High levels of free fatty acids have been shown to induce a state of insulin resistance in cardiac and skeletal muscles by inducing a decrease in glucose metabolism via a fatty acid/glucose inhibitory cycle (4Randle P.J. Kerbey A.L. Espinal J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In pancreatic beta cells, fatty acids have been shown to have a stimulatory effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion over short-term exposure (1–3 h), but an inhibitory effect after longer periods of treatment (6–24 h) (5Sako Y. Grill V.E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 6Zhou Y.-P. Grill V.E. J. Clin.

Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The long-term effects correlate with a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity, which together lead to impaired glucose oxidation (9Zhou Y.-P. Östenson C.-G. Ling Z.-C. Grill V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Zhou Y.-P. Berggren P.-O. Grill V. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In INS-1 insulinoma cells, fatty acids induce a decrease in acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene expression (11Brun T. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase I gene expression (12Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Roche E. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), leading to an increase in long-chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidation. The mechanisms by which fatty acids modify gene expression in beta cells, either directly or following their metabolism, is not yet known, but may rely on activation of fatty acid-regulated transcription factors such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (13Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Fatty acids can also have a direct inhibitory effect on insulin secretion by activating ATP-sensitive K+ channels, as recently shown in HIT-T15 insulinoma cells (14Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Branstrom R. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Islet/duodenum homeobox-1 is an homeobox gene that was simultaneously cloned from different species and called IUF-1 (insulinupstream factor-1) in man (15Boam D.S. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), STF-1 (somatostatin-transactivatingfactor-1) or IDX-1 (islet/duodenum homeobox-1) in rat (16Leonard J. Peesrs B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), and IPF-1 (insulin promoterfactor-1) in mouse (18Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). It is a 283-amino acid transcription factor protein that contains a central homeodomain implicated in IDX-1/DNA interaction and two N- and C-terminal proline-rich regions (19Lu M. Miller C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2959-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) implicated in gene transactivation. The IDX-1 C terminus may be involved in homodimerization with another IDX-1 molecule (19Lu M. Miller C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2959-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the N terminus may participate in synergistic transactivation of genes by interacting with othertrans-acting factors such as E47, which binds to the E1 region of the insulin promoter (20Peers B. Leonard J. Sharma S. Teitelman G. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IDX-1 was first described as a transactivator of the insulin (18Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 22Petersen H.V. Serup P. Leonard J. Michelsen B. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, it was also shown to transactivate the Glut2 (23Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes by recognizing similar cis-regulatory elements present in the promoters of these genes. Idx-1 gene expression is restricted to the duodenum and pancreatic beta and delta cells. During embryogenesis, it is expressed starting at embryonic day 8.5 in the duodenum and pancreatic bud, before the appearance of glucagon or insulin cells (18Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). IDX-1 importance in pancreas development was further highlighted when IDX-1−/− homozygous knockout mice were shown to fail to develop pancreases, leading to early postnatal death (25Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund E. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 26Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L.M. Wright C.V.E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, identification of mutations in the human IDX-1gene was also shown to be responsible for lack of pancreas organogenesis in man (27Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). It was therefore hypothesized that, during development, all endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells originate from IDX-1-expressing cells and that only beta and delta cells would retained its expression in mature islets. We previously reported that dexamethasone and palmitic acid treatments of isolated rat pancreatic islets lead to a decrease inGlut2 expression and a decrease in glucose-induced insulin secretion (28Gremlich S.

Whereas the dexamethasone effect was due to increased post-translational degradation of GLUT2, the fatty acid effects took place at a pretranslational stage. We now report that, following palmitic acid treatment, IDX-1 mRNA and protein expression is also markedly reduced. The reduction in protein expression is correlated with a decrease in IDX-1 binding activity for its cognatecis-regulatory sequence of the insulin and Glut2gene promoters. The expression of the Glut2, glucokinase, insulin, and somatostatin genes, but not that of the glucagon gene, is also reduced under these conditions. Moreover, incubation of islets in the presence of fatty acids leads to a 13-fold increase in total glucagon release, with little change in insulin or somatostatin secretion. These data show that fatty acids can modulate the expression of the Idx-1 gene, which correlates with a reduced level of expression of pancreatic genes under the control of IDX-1. This phenomenon may be important in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Biological Research Laboratories Ltd., palmitic acid (sodium salt) and bromopalmitic acid (free acid) from Fluka, collagenase (type IV) from Worthington, and Ficoll DL-400 and bovine serum albumin (BSA 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. ; fraction V, essentially fatty acid-free) from Sigma. For RNA analysis, GeneScreen nylon membranes were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and the random-primed DNA labeling kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. For protein analysis, Protran nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell, the BCA protein assay was from Pierce, and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit for Western blotting (ECL) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody were from Amersham Corp. Finally, antibodies used in the insulin radioimmunoassay as well as the radioimmunoassay for glucagon detection were from Linco Research Inc. The Somatostatin radioimmunoassay was purchased from Incstar Corp. Islets were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats weighting ∼200 g by collagenase digestion of the total pancreas and subsequent separation on discontinuous Ficoll DL-400 gradients as described previously by Gotoh et al. (29Gotoh M. Maki T. Satomi S. Porter J. Bonner-Weir S. O'Hara C.J. Monaco A.P. Transplantation (Baltimore). 1987; 43: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Islets were kept in culture in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of the isolation step, islets in batches of 150–200 were placed in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 11 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. On the next day, the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.8 mm glucose, and the culture was continued for another 24 h. Finally, islets were incubated with different concentrations of palmitic acid in the presence of 2.8, 5.6, or 30 mm glucose for different periods of time. Palmitic acid (sodium salt) was prepared as an 8 mmsolution in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% BSA (essentially fatty acid-free; final fatty acid/BSA molar ratio = 5.7). Fatty acid was then allowed to equilibrate overnight with BSA at 37 °C and filtered before use. Bromopalmitic acid (free acid) was first submitted to saponification by addition of a final 0.1 n concentration of NaOH to a 100 mmbromopalmitic acid solution. The precipitated bromopalmitic acid sodium salt was then recovered by filtration, lyophilized, and prepared as described above for palmitic acid. In every experiment, control islets were exposed only to glucose plus 500 μl of palmitic acid vehicle (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10% BSA). Total RNA was extracted from 80 islets (120 islets for glucokinase mRNA detection) by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of yeast tRNA as carrier. Total RNA was separated on 1.4% agarose gels containing 2% formamide and transferred to nylon membranes. After transfer, the membranes were UV-cross-linked and prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC (SSC = 150 mm NaCl and 17 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution (Denhardt's solution = 0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% polvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin), and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The buffer was then changed, and hybridization was conducted overnight with 106 cpm of a32P-labeled probe/ml. cDNAs fragments used as probes for GLUT2, γ-actin, and insulin mRNA detection were as described previously (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment used as probe for IDX-1 mRNA detection was a 1.4-kilobase BamHI fragment from IDX-pBJ5 (31Miller C.P. McGhee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); that for rat glucokinase was a 1-kilobaseEcoRI-SphI fragment from the glucokinase-pGEM4z plasmid (gift from C. B. Newgard); that for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was a polymerase chain reaction fragment obtained with primers corresponding to 5′-CGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGA-3′ (sense; base pairs 294–313 of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene) and 5′-CGGCCATCACGCCACAGTTT-3′ (antisense; base pairs 593 to 574 of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene); that for rat somatostatin was a 0.4-kilobase HindIII-KpnI fragment from the pGEM-4-ss plasmid (gift from J. Philippe); and finally, that for rat glucagon was a 1.1-kilobasePstI-SacI fragment from the pGEM-3-gluc plasmid (32Heinrich G. Gros P. Lund P.K. Bentley R.C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 150–200 islets were lysed in 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated for 1.5 min in the cup of a sonicator. Proteins were quantitated with the BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and 50 μg of proteins were loaded on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of GLUT2 was performed as described previously (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). IDX-1 was detected with a rabbit antibody generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 164–283 of the rat IDX-1 protein (31Miller C.P. McGhee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, both this and a polyclonal anti-mouse IDX-1 antibody (gift from H. Edlund) (25Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund E. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) were used. Glucokinase was detected with a sheep anti-glucokinase antibody generated against a glutathioneS-transferase-glucokinase fusion protein (gift from M. Magnuson). The α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase was detected using an antibody directed against the protein fromBufo marinus as described (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The second antibodies used were a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for the IDX-1 protein and a rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulin antibody (1:5000 dilution) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (1:8000 dilution) for glucokinase. Detection of the signal was performed using the ECL technique. Nuclear extracts and the sequences of the oligonucleotides used to assess, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), the binding activity of GTII and IDX-1 in the Glut2 promoter were as described previously (23Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). For insulin, the IDX-1-binding sequence corresponded to the A1 box of the rat insulin I promoter: RI1PTAAT (sense), 5′-AGAGCCCTTAATGGGCCAAA-3′; and RI1PTAAT (antisense), 5′-CGCGTTTGGCCCATTAAGGG-3′. For the adenovirus type 2 major late transcription factor, the oligonucleotides were 5′-TAGGTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGGTGTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTACA-3′ (antisense). For supershift assays, 1 μl of preimmune or anti-IDX-1 serum was added to the reaction before the EMSA. For pulse-labeling experiments, 150–200 islets were incubated for 48 h in 30 mm glucose in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm palmitic acid. After washing twice with PBS, the islets were incubated for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium depleted of methionine and supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Pulse labeling was for 5 min at 37 °C with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine. Islets were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS in PBS containing 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and further diluted with 400 μl of 1.25% Triton X-100 in PBS plus the same protease inhibitors. For pulse-chase experiments, islets were first labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine and, after washing twice with PBS, either lysed as described above or returned to normal medium supplemented with 2 mm unlabeled methionine for 23.5 h before being lysed. GLUT2 was then immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of proteins and analyzed as described previously (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon were quantitated using radioimmunoassays. The effect of fatty acids on IDX-1 mRNA levels was first investigated by Northern blot analysis. For this purpose, islets were cultured for different periods of time in the presence of 30 mm glucose and in the absence or presence of different concentrations of palmitic acid. Total RNA was then extracted from 80 islets and analyzed by Northern blotting. The results are shown in Fig.1 A and are expressed as the IDX/actin mRNA ratio. Normalization was also done relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and gave similar results (data not shown). In dose-response experiments, IDX-1 mRNA levels were maximally decreased to 43 ± 6% of the control value (n = 5) in the presence of 0.6 mm palmitic acid. In time-course experiments, in the presence of 0.6 mm palmitic acid, the maximal effect was already reached after 10 h of incubation. At that time, IDX-1 mRNA levels were decreased to 50 ± 7% of the control value (n = 3) (Fig. 1 B), which was not significantly different from the level reached at the end of the 48-h incubation (39 ± 6%). To evaluate whether oxidation of fatty acids was needed for the negative effect on IDX-1 mRNA to be observed, islets were exposed for 24 h to 0.6 mm bromopalmitic acid in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm palmitic acid. In islets exposed to bromopalmitic acid alone, the IDX-1 mRNA level was increased to 162 ± 13% of the control value, whereas in the presence of equimolar concentrations of bromopalmitic and palmitic acids, IDX-1 mRNA levels were similar to the control value (99 ± 14%) (Fig. 1 C). To investigate whether the palmitic acid effect on IDX-1 mRNA was glucose-dependent, islets were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 2.8, 5.6, or 30 mm glucose in the presence or absence of palmitic acid. At a low glucose concentration (2.8 mm), no significant effect of palmitic acid on IDX-1 mRNA was observed (128 ± 23% of the control value (n = 3)). The same negative effect of palmitic acid on IDX-1 mRNA levels was observed, however, in the presence of 5.6 or 30 mm glucose (58 ± 11% versus 54 ± 7% of control values, respectively (n = 3 for each experiment)) (Fig. 2). Regulation of the IDX-1 protein level by fatty acids was determined by Western blot analysis. The results of Fig.3 show that IDX-1 protein expression in islets exposed to palmitic acids was decreased to 29 ± 5% of the control value (n = 6). To determine whether the decrease in IDX-1 protein expression was correlated with a decrease in the binding activity of the transcription factor for its cis-regulatory elements of the insulin andGlut2 gene promoters, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts of palmitic acid-treated and control islets. Fig.4 (A and B) shows the results of the EMSA measurements, and Fig. 4 C shows the quantitation of these results. The binding activity for the IDX-1cis-element of the Glut2 promoter was decreased to 35 ± 8% of control values in nuclear extracts of palmitic acid-treated islets. In the same extracts, the binding activity for the IDX-1 cis-element of the insulin promoter was reduced to 63 ± 3% of control values. The binding activity of nuclear extracts of palmitic acid-treated islets for the GTII sequence of theGlut2 promoter or for the major late transcription factor-binding sequence was not altered. To determine that the bands observed in these EMSAs using the IDX-1 oligonucleotides were indeed due to binding to IDX-1, supershift assays were performed with antibodies to rat and mouse IDX-1. Fig. 4 D shows the almost complete disappearance of the shifted band in the presence of both antisera, but not in the presence of preimmune serum. Similar data were obtained using the IDX-1-binding oligonucleotides of theGlut2 promoter sequence (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), exposure of isolated rat pancreatic islets to palmitic acid induced a decrease in GLUT2 mRNA expression to 52 ± 6% of the control value (n = 6) (Fig.5 A). Fig. 5 B shows that GLUT2 protein steady-state levels were decreased to 63 ± 10% of the control value (n = 6). The effect of palmitic acid on GLUT2 protein biosynthesis and stability was also analyzed. Five-minute pulse-labeling experiments performed with islets preincubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm palmitate showed a reduction in the GLUT2 translation rate to 58 ± 5% of the control value (n = 3) (Fig. 5 C), consistent with the extent of decrease in GLUT2 mRNA. To assess the GLUT2 degradation rate, islets were pulse-labeled for 2 h and then either directly lysed or lysed after an additional 23.5-h chase period, and GLUT2 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and scanning densitometry of the autoradiograms. The GLUT2 protein half-life was similar in palmitic acid-treated and control islets, ∼20 h (data not shown). This value is as previously reported (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Regulation of glucokinase expression in palmitic acid-treated islets was investigated by Northern and Western blot analyses. Fig.6 A shows that glucokinase mRNA levels were decreased to 76 ± 7% of the control value in treated islets (n = 3). Fig. 6 B shows that the glucokinase protein level was decreased to 76 ± 7% of the control value (n = 8) in palmitic acid-treated islets. As a control, the level of expression of the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase in control or palmitic acid-treated islets was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Fig.7 shows that the level of expression of this membrane protein was not affected by the treatment. The effect of palmitic acid treatment on the expression of insulin and somatostatin was first analyzed by Northern blotting. Fig. 8 shows that the presence of palmitic acid for 48 h induced a decrease in insulin and somatostatin mRNA levels to 59 ± 7% (n = 7) and 41 ± 4% (n = 5) of the control values, respectively. In contrast, glucagon mRNA levels were not significantly affected (110 ± 15% of the control value (n = 9)). Total islet hormone content and secretion following a 48-h incubation with or without palmitic acid were then analyzed (TableI). In the presence of palmitic acid, insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon islet contents were decreased to 14 ± 7, 45 ± 13, and 54 ± 19% of the control values, respectively (n = 8). Insulin and somatostatin release in the medium was only marginally, although significantly, increased (1.5 ± 0.4-fold (p < 0.05) and 1.7 ± 0.4-fold, respectively). In contrast, under the same conditions, glucagon secretion was strongly stimulated (13 ± 3-fold (n = 8)). The total of intracellular plus secreted insulin and somatostatin was slightly increased over the 48-h incubation period in the presence of palmitic acid. For glucagon, this was more than doubled (Table I). When measured only in the second 24-h period of the 48-h incubation, secreted glucagon was increased by 8 ± 3-fold.Table IInsulin, glucagon, and somatostatin islet secretion and content in the presence and absence of palmitic acidControl0.6 mm palmitatePalmitate effect% of controlSecretion1-aSecretion of 10 islets over a 48-h incubation period.

The sphingolipid intermediate ceramide is thought to be particularly important for activating and coordinating signaling pathways during mammalian stress responses. Here we present the first evidence that ceramide and other sphingolipid intermediates are signaling molecules in the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeheat stress response. Our data show a 2–3-fold transient increase in the concentration of C18-dihydrosphingosine and C18-phytosphingosine, more than a 100-fold transient increase in C20-dihydrosphingosine and C20-phytosphingosine, and a more stable 2-fold increase in ceramide containing C18-phytosphingosine and a 5-fold increase in ceramide containing C20-phytosphingosine following heat stress. Treatment of cells with dihydrosphingosine activates transcription of the TPS2 gene encoding a subunit of trehalose synthase and causes trehalose, a known thermoprotectant, to accumulate. Dihydrosphingosine induces expression of aSTRE-LacZ reporter gene, showing that the global stress response element, STRE, found in many yeast promoter sequences can be activated by sphingolipid signals. TheTPS2 promoter contains four STREs that may mediate dihydrosphingosine responsiveness.

Key elements in the response of an organism to stress are intracellular signal transduction pathways whose role is to transmit a signal from stress-activated sensors to, for example, the nucleus where the signal activates transcription of genes necessary for mounting a defense response. Evidence obtained primarily from cultured mammalian cells suggests that ceramide, an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism, is a key signaling molecule generated in response to a variety of stresses that mediates growth arrest, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, or an immune response (1Hannun Y.A.

The physiological importance and molecular mechanism(s) of ceramide signaling wait to be established and quantified in most cases, and the task of doing so appears daunting because mammalian signaling pathways are complex and interactive. To better understand the roles of sphingolipid signaling during stress, we have focused attention on the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present evidence for sphingolipid signaling during heat stress in this organism.The proposed pathway for S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis, up to the formation of IPC, 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, aureobasidin A; DHS, dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine); HSP, heat shock protein; PHS, phytosphingosine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, aureobasidin A; DHS, dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine); HSP, heat shock protein; PHS, phytosphingosine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is diagrammed in Fig. 1(5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). Not shown in Fig. 1 is the conversion of IPC to mannose IPC by the addition of mannose and the conversion of mannose IPC to the terminal sphingolipid mannose-(inositol phosphoryl)2-ceramide by the addition of inositol-phosphate. The early steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis up to the synthesis of DHS are similar in mammals and inS. cerevisiae (5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). During biosynthesis, the ceramides inS. cerevisiae contain phytosphingosine (4-hydroxy dihydrosphingosine) amide linked primarily to a OH-C26-fatty acid, whereas mammalian ceramides contain dihydrosphingosine amide linked to a C16-fatty acid. The dihydrosphingosine in mammalian ceramides is rapidly desaturated to yield ceramides with a 4,5-trans double bond (sphingosine, reviewed in Ref. 6Merrill A.H.J. Liotta D.C. Riley R.E. Bell R.M. Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Press, New York1996: 205-237Google Scholar).Organisms have evolved complex mechanisms for surviving higher than normal temperatures (heat stress). One universal survival mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 7Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar) is the induction of a group of proteins, the heat shock proteins (HSPs), many of which serve as molecular chaperones necessary for folding proteins denatured by high temperatures. Another protective mechanism in S. cerevisiae is the accumulation of the disaccharide trehalose, which occurs rapidly following a shift from 25 to 37 °C (Ref. 8De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and references therein). Trehalose is known to protect proteins and biological membranes from heat denaturation (9Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar,10Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mutant strains deleted for tps1 or tps2encoding subunits of trehalose synthase have reduced thermotolerance, indicating that trehalose is a thermoprotectant (8De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Heat treatment also induces transcription of genes in S. cerevisiae whose promoters contain an element termedSTRE (stress responseelement, reviewed in Ref. 11Ruis H. Schuller C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). STREs are responsible for what has been called cross-resistance, in which one type of stress, such as heat shock, gives partial protection against other stresses such as osmotic and oxidative stress. STREshave been found to be functional in the promoters of several yeast genes (12Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F.

Here we present evidence that ceramide and other sphingolipid metabolites accumulate during heat stress and signal S. cerevisiae cells to activate transcription of the TPS2gene and to accumulate trehalose. Key elements in the response of an organism to stress are intracellular signal transduction pathways whose role is to transmit a signal from stress-activated sensors to, for example, the nucleus where the signal activates transcription of genes necessary for mounting a defense response. Evidence obtained primarily from cultured mammalian cells suggests that ceramide, an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism, is a key signaling molecule generated in response to a variety of stresses that mediates growth arrest, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, or an immune response (1Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R.N. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The physiological importance and molecular mechanism(s) of ceramide signaling wait to be established and quantified in most cases, and the task of doing so appears daunting because mammalian signaling pathways are complex and interactive. To better understand the roles of sphingolipid signaling during stress, we have focused attention on the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present evidence for sphingolipid signaling during heat stress in this organism. The proposed pathway for S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis, up to the formation of IPC, 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, aureobasidin A; DHS, dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine); HSP, heat shock protein; PHS, phytosphingosine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, aureobasidin A; DHS, dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine); HSP, heat shock protein; PHS, phytosphingosine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is diagrammed in Fig. 1(5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). Not shown in Fig. 1 is the conversion of IPC to mannose IPC by the addition of mannose and the conversion of mannose IPC to the terminal sphingolipid mannose-(inositol phosphoryl)2-ceramide by the addition of inositol-phosphate. The early steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis up to the synthesis of DHS are similar in mammals and inS. cerevisiae (5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). During biosynthesis, the ceramides inS. cerevisiae contain phytosphingosine (4-hydroxy dihydrosphingosine) amide linked primarily to a OH-C26-fatty acid, whereas mammalian ceramides contain dihydrosphingosine amide linked to a C16-fatty acid. The dihydrosphingosine in mammalian ceramides is rapidly desaturated to yield ceramides with a 4,5-trans double bond (sphingosine, reviewed in Ref. 6Merrill A.H.J. Liotta D.C. Riley R.E. Bell R.M. Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Press, New York1996: 205-237Google Scholar). Organisms have evolved complex mechanisms for surviving higher than normal temperatures (heat stress). One universal survival mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 7Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar) is the induction of a group of proteins, the heat shock proteins (HSPs), many of which serve as molecular chaperones necessary for folding proteins denatured by high temperatures. Another protective mechanism in S. cerevisiae is the accumulation of the disaccharide trehalose, which occurs rapidly following a shift from 25 to 37 °C (Ref. 8De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and references therein). Trehalose is known to protect proteins and biological membranes from heat denaturation (9Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar,10Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mutant strains deleted for tps1 or tps2encoding subunits of trehalose synthase have reduced thermotolerance, indicating that trehalose is a thermoprotectant (8De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Heat treatment also induces transcription of genes in S. cerevisiae whose promoters contain an element termedSTRE (stress responseelement, reviewed in Ref. 11Ruis H. Schuller C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). STREs are responsible for what has been called cross-resistance, in which one type of stress, such as heat shock, gives partial protection against other stresses such as osmotic and oxidative stress. STREshave been found to be functional in the promoters of several yeast genes (12Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 13Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) including TPS2, whose transcription is inducible by heat (14De Virgilio C. Burckert N. Bell W. Jeno P. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Sur I.P. Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. Yeast. 1994; 10: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Gounalaki N. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies of mutant strains of S. cerevisiae that lack sphingolipids have demonstrated a necessary but uncharacterized role for these lipids in resisting heat, osmotic, and low pH stresses (17Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that ceramide and other sphingolipid metabolites accumulate during heat stress and signal S. cerevisiae cells to activate transcription of the TPS2gene and to accumulate trehalose.

The overexpression of ACR3 induced high level arsenite resistance. The presence of ACR3 together withACR2 on a multicopy plasmid was conducive to increased arsenate resistance. The function of ACR3 gene has now been investigated. Amino acid sequence analysis of Acr3p showed that this hypothetical protein has hydrophobic character with 10 putative transmembrane spans and is probably located in yeast plasma membrane. We constructed the acr3 null mutation. The resulting disruptants were 5-fold more sensitive to arsenate and arsenite than wild-type cells. The acr3 disruptants showed wild-type sensitivity to antimony, tellurite, cadmium, and phenylarsine oxide. The mechanism of arsenical resistance was assayed by transport experiments using radioactive arsenite. We did not observe any significant differences in the accumulation of76AsO33− in wild-type cells, acr1 and acr3 disruptants. However, the high dosage of ACR3 gene resulted in loss of arsenite uptake. These results suggest that arsenite resistance in yeast is mediated by an arsenite transporter (Acr3p).

Arsenicals are toxic compounds, which are commonly present in the environment at increasing concentrations as a result of industrial pollution (1Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The pentavalent arsenate is a phosphate analog which interferes with phosphorylation reactions and competes with phosphate in transport (2Chang E.C. Kosman D.J. Willsky G.R. J.

The more potent trivalent arsenite reacts with the sulfhydryl groups of proteins and inhibits many biochemical pathways (3Bröer S. Ji G. Bröer A. Silver S. J.

Both arsenic salts were observed to induce morphological transformation and some cytogenetic effects (6Lee T.C. Oshimura M. Barrett J.C.

Resistance to arsenate, arsenite, and antimonite in prokaryota is mediated by a plasmid-encoded transport system (14Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ji G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 176: 3684-3694Crossref Google Scholar, 16Rosenstein R. Peschel A. Wieland B. Götz F.

The products ofarsA and arsB genes are the two subunits of an ATP-coupled oxyanion pump (14Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ArsA protein is the catalytic subunit exhibiting an ATPase activity (19Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ArsB protein is an inner membrane component of the pump (20San Francisco M.J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which acts as an anion channel and an anchor for the ArsA protein (21Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arsCgene was shown to encode an arsenate reductase (22Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similarars operons were identified in Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus (pI258) (15Ji G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 176: 3684-3694Crossref Google Scholar) and Staphylococcus xylosus (pSX267) (16Rosenstein R. Peschel A. Wieland B. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3676-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In staphylococcal ars operonsarsR, -B, -C genes are conserved butarsD and arsA are absent. In this case arsenite efflux is mediated only by the ArsB protein coupled to the protonmotive force (23Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arsenical resistance in eukaryotic cells is also transport-mediated (4Huang R.N. Lee T.C. Toxicol. App. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Papadopoulou B.

Recently we have reported the isolation of three S. cerevisiae genes,ACR1, 1The abbreviations used are: ACR, arsenic compounds resistance; ORF, open reading frame; PSORT, prediction of protein localization sites; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); MFS, major facilitator superfamily. 1The abbreviations used are: ACR, arsenic compounds resistance; ORF, open reading frame; PSORT, prediction of protein localization sites; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); MFS, major facilitator superfamily. ACR2, ACR3, conferring the increased resistance to arsenic compounds when present on a multicopy plasmid (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The putative product of the ACR1 gene shows similarity to the yeast transcriptional regulatory proteins, encoded by YAP1and YAP2 genes, and the acr1 null mutant exhibits arsenate and arsenite hypersensitivity phenotype (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). TheACR2 gene is required for high level arsenate resistance but not for arsenite resistance (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The hypothetical product of theACR3 gene shows high similarity to the hypothetical membrane protein encoded by Bacillus subtilis ORF1 namedyqcl, a putative element of chromosomal copy ofars operon (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 27Takemaru K. Mizuno M. Sato T. Takeuchi M. Kobayashi Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The overexpression of ACR3confers the resistance to high concentrations of arsenite but not arsenate but if this gene is overproduced together with theACR2 gene, the hyper-resistance to arsenate is also observed (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here we report the disruption of ACR3 gene and the phenotypic analysis of acr3 null mutants, including transport experiments with radioactive arsenite. Our results suggest that Acr3p is a putative membrane protein, involved in arsenite transport.

Alternatively, the minimal YNB medium with 2% glucose supplemented with auxotrophic requirements was used (30Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Sporulation medium contained 0.5% Difco yeast extract, 2% potassium acetate, and 0.5% Difco peptone. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium supplemented when necessary with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Media were solidified by addition of 1.5% Difco Bacto-agar. Cloning procedures (plasmid purification, endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, ligation, dephosphorylation, E. coli transformation, and DNA transfer to nylon membrane) were carried out as described previously (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast cells was performed by the lithium acetate method (32Ito H. Fukuda K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA was isolated by the method of Kaiseret al. (30Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). DNA probe was labeled with biotin-7-dATP using Bionick 228 Labeling System, Life Technologies, Inc. Hybridization and chemiluminescent detection of biotinylated DNA on nylon membrane were performed with Southern-Light System, TROPIX. Disruption of the ACR3 gene was carried out by the “one-step” method according to Rothstein (33Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). A 1141-bp BamHI-KpnI fragment was excised from the ACR3 gene, located on the pA1031 plasmid, and replaced by the URA3 gene (Fig. 2). The resulting construct was dubbed as pRW2. The URA3 gene was removed from the pAF101 plasmid (29Thierry A. Fairhead C. Dujon B. Yeast. 1990; 6: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as a 1211-bp BglII-KpnI fragment. The pA1031 plasmid was constructed by deleting a 106-bpPvuII-SmaI fragment to abolish KpnI restriction site from the polylinker of pA103 plasmid. The 5206-bpBglII-BglII fragment of pRW2 plasmid was used for the transformation of yeast cells. Verification of ACR3disruption was obtained by Southern analysis. Micromanipulation and dissection of asci were done according to Sherman and Hicks (34Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by the methylene blue exclusion method (35Pierce J. J. Inst. Brew. 1970; 76: 442-443Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Strains were grown overnight in liquid YPD medium, previously described (30Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar), and diluted to the optical density of 0.45 at 600 nm. In the growth inhibition experiments (Fig. 4), 10 μl of these cell suspensions were added to 20 ml of fresh liquid YPD containing increasing concentrations of arsenite and arsenate. The cultures were incubated at 28 °C with vigorous shaking, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h. To determine the maximum non-inhibitory concentration of arsenic salts, 5 μl of the cell suspensions, prepared as described above, were placed on solid YPD medium with various concentrations of arsenicals (0–4 mm sodium arsenite and 0–25 mm sodium arsenate). Plates were incubated for 4 days at 28 °C. Strains were grown in SD medium supplemented with auxotrophic requirements (lacking uracil in the case of strains bearing plasmids) at 28 °C with vigorous shaking for 16 h to the concentration of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were induced with 0.1 mmarsenite at 28 °C for 1.5 h without shaking, washed twice in cold distilled water, and suspended in 1 ml of 10 mmphthalic acid buffer (pH 5.5) with 100 mm glucose. The uptake of arsenite was carried out on 1-ml samples containing 0.l ml of cells, 0.1 ml of 1 m glucose, 0.2 ml of 50 mmphthalic acid buffer (pH 5.5), and 0.6 ml of distilled water. After 20 min of preincubation at 28 °C, radioactive arsenite in the form of76AsO33− was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. Aliquots (0.1 ml each) were withdrawn at intervals, filtered, washed with ice-cold water, and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. The protein sequence analysis was performed using the software PC/GENE (IntelliGenetics, Inc.). The ACR3gene was cloned as a multicopy plasmid-borne DNA fragment capable of conferring arsenical resistance in S. cerevisiae cells (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This fragment occurred to be a part of XVI chromosome containing three unknown ORFs named ACR1, ACR2, andACR3 (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We had also shown that the high dosage ofACR3 gene led to arsenical hyper-resistance phenotype (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The hypothetical product of ACR3 gene is a 45.8-kDa protein with the expected isoelectric point of 8.9. According to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (36Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar), the Acr3p is predicted to have 10 potential membrane-spanning segments with 64.1% membrane-buried residues of a total of 404 amino acids. This prediction was confirmed by the method of Klein et al. (37Klein P. Kanehisa M. De Lisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) which detected 8 integral transmembrane spans and 2 possibly integral spans (Fig.1). A computer program PSORT (Prediction of Protein Localization Sites, version 6.3b) (38Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) classified the Acr3p as a plasma membrane protein with the certainty of 0.6. The Acr3p also comprises 3 potential N-glycosylation sites, 4 putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and 4 potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (Fig. 1). The codon bias index is 0.116 for the ACR3 gene, indicating a moderate level of expression (39Bennetzen J.H. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3026-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the effect of the loss of ACR3, the gene was disrupted in S. cerevisiae strain FY73. For this purpose, the BglII fragment of plasmid pRW2, containing theACR3-disrupted allele, was used to transform yeast cells. One of the integrative Ura+ transformants DN6 showing arsenical hypersensitivity phenotype was crossed with the isogenic strain FY23. The resulting diploid strain FD236 was sporulated, and 14 tetrads were isolated. Two tetrads, numbers 6 and 7, were randomly chosen to present phenotypes, although all 14 tetrads shared the following features. The progeny of every spore was viable (Fig. 3). All tetrads indicated 2:2 segregation ratio for Ura phenotype (two spores showed Ura+ and two Ura− phenotypes). The Ura+ cells were also hypersensitive to arsenite and arsenate. Southern blot analysis of tetrad number 6 demonstrated that Ura− segregants which grew at a wild-type rate in the presence of arsenic salts had a wild-type restriction profile, whereas Ura+ cells showing hypersensitivity to arsenicals possessed a profile of the disrupted gene (Fig.2 C). These results demonstrate the monogenic character of the disruption and that the arsenical sensitivity segregates with the null mutation of ACR3 gene. To ensure that the increased arsenical sensitivity is caused only by the lack of ACR3 gene, we transformed a few of the above disruptants with the centromeric plasmid pRW3 bearing theACR3 gene. After transformation we observed that the wild-type copy of ACR3 present on the plasmid in cytoplasm restored arsenical resistance to wild-type level (Fig.3). To study more thoroughly the phenotypic differences between the disruptants and the wild-type strains, we determined the highest non-inhibitory concentrations of arsenicals (Table II) and the rate of growth in the presence of various amounts of arsenic salts (Fig.4, A–D). On the medium containing glucose the acr3 null mutants were 5-fold more sensitive to both arsenate and arsenite than wild-type cells (TableII). When the only source of energy was glycerol or ethanol, both the disruptants and wild-type cells were about 10 times more sensitive to arsenicals (data not shown). We have also tested other metals; however, the acr3 mutants showed wild-type sensitivity to potassium antimonyl tartrate, phenylarsine oxide, potassium tellurite, and cadmium chloride (Table II). Besides we noticed that yeast cells tolerated very high concentrations of antimony salt (up to 60 mm) on glucose, whereas yeast sensitivity to antimony increased about 60 and 6 times on the medium with glycerol or ethanol, respectively (data not shown).Table IIMetal sensitivity phenotypes resulting from the disruption of the ACR3 geneCompound testedMNC2-aMaximum non-inhibitory concentration (MNC) is the highest drug concentration tested at which normal growth occurred.

Open table in a new tab In the growth inhibition experiment (Fig. 4, A–D) we noticed that after 24 h of incubation the acr3disruptants were unable to grow even in the presence of the lowest concentration of arsenite and arsenate (0.25 mm) tested. The growth of cells expressing the wild-type ACR3 gene was not inhibited by this concentration of arsenicals (Fig. 4, Aand B). After 48 h wild-type cells could tolerate 1 mm arsenite and arsenate, while the acr3disruptants did not grow in the presence of 0.5 mm arsenite and 1 mm arsenate (Fig. 4, C and D). However, after 3 days of incubation the null mutants were able to recover from the inhibition at 0.5 mm arsenite and 1 mm arsenate (data not shown). We also investigated the viability of cells incubated at arsenical concentrations indicated in Fig. 4. After 24 h the survival rate was similar for all strains and conditions tested. Within next 24 h we did not observe any differences in cell viability either in the case of wild-type cells treated with arsenite and arsenate or in disruptants treated with arsenate. Nevertheless, 48 h of incubation with 0.75 mm and 1 mm arsenite led to the dramatic death of 50% acr3 mutant cells (data not shown). The ACR3 gene product is a putative membrane protein with significant identity and similarity to the hypothetical protein encoded by the element of putative chromosomal ars operon fromB. subtilis (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Acr3p protein also shares 36.6% identity with Mycobacterium tuberculosis potential membrane protein of unknown function (accession number Z80225) and 26.2% identity with hypothetical protein from cyanobacteriumSynechocystis (accession number S76146). Cells with the disrupted copy of ACR3 gene are hypersensitive to arsenate and arsenite. So, we assume that Acr3p may be an oxyanion transporter conferring resistance to arsenic salts. To verify this hypothesis, transport experiments using radioactive arsenite first developed forE. coli (5Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and then for Leishmania (24Dey S. Papadopoulou B. Haimeur A. Roy G. Grondin K. Dou D. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were adapted to S. cerevisiae. The uptake of 76AsO33− was observed in acr1 disruptants, acr3 null mutants, and wild-type cells bearing no plasmid, control vector (pFL44L), and multicopy plasmids (pA10, pA123 and pA1031) comprising ACRgenes (Table I, Fig.5). Under our experimental conditions there was no significant difference in the accumulation of76AsO33− in wild-type andacr mutant cells. On the other hand the presence of multicopies of ACR genes, which were previously shown to confer high level arsenic salts resistance (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), resulted in lack of arsenite accumulation, whereas cells containing the empty vector exhibited arsenite uptake at the wild-type level. Besides we did not observe any differences in arsenite accumulation of cells harboring pA10 (ACR1,-2, -3), pA123 (ACR2, -3), and pA103 (ACR3) clones. These results indicate that the product of the ACR3 gene itself is sufficient to decrease uptake of arsenite. On the basis of these findings, the ACR3 gene of S. cerevisiaeseems to encode an arsenite transporter. We have previously shown the isolation and initial characterization of the cluster of three genes, ACR1,ACR2, and ACR3, involved in yeast arsenical resistance (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The ACR3 gene seems to encode a putative membrane protein which confers high level arsenite resistance when present in multicopies. Resistance phenotype is expanded into arsenate when ACR3 is accompanied by ACR2 on the same high-copy plasmid. We have suggested that the role of Acr3p in arsenical resistance is crucial and related to cell membrane (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). There are many yeast proteins (Pdr5p, Snq2p, Sge1p etc.) which were proposed to be integral membrane proteins and conducive to resistance phenotypes when present in multicopies (40Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Servos J. Hasse E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen.

These proteins belong to either the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family or the MFS (major facilitator superfamily) family (43Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.L. De Wachter R. Goffeau A.

Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The putative Acr3p, lacking ATP-binding cassette, may belong to the MFS superfamily. However, the Acr3p is not present in the group of 100 S. cerevisiaetransport proteins classified as the MFS proteins (43Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.L. De Wachter R. Goffeau A.

Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MFS proteins comprise 500–600 amino acids with 12 transmembrane helices and share sequence similarities suggesting the common ancestral origin (43Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.L. De Wachter R. Goffeau A.

Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Acr3p possesses only 10 transmembrane spans and shows amino acid similarities only to the hypothetical membrane protein encoded by B. subtilis ORF1 (yqcl) (36.7% identity, 19.4% similarity) and to the ArsB protein of S. aureus ars operon (16% identity) (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The product of ORF1 (yqcl) was suggested to be the ArsB protein of chromosomalars operon since it shows weak similarity to S. aureus ArsB protein and ORF1 (yqcl) is located on the chromosome between high homologs of S. aureus arsR andarsC genes (27Takemaru K. Mizuno M. Sato T. Takeuchi M. Kobayashi Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Besides the Acr3p, the product of ORF1 and the ArsB possess many similar features like molecular weight, amino acid composition, isoelectric point (Table III). We propose that the Acr3p is a novel type transporter of new family and resembles the prokaryotic ArsB proteins.Table IIIComparison of the putative product of the ACR3 gene and similar bacterial proteinsArsBYqclAcr3pDescriptionArsenite transporter-S. aureusPutative ArsB-B. subtilischromosomeArsenite transporter-S. cerevisiaeNon-polar aa3-aaa, amino acids.

Open table in a new tab The acr3 null mutant was found to be hypersensitive only to sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite. This fact shows that arsenicals are unique substrates transported by the Acr3p. Furthermore, in both wild-type and acr3 null mutant cells, we observed a dramatic increase of sensitivity to arsenic and antimony compounds on nonfermentable carbon sources. This observation is consistent with previously reported inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase as the central target for arsenicals (46Szinicz L. Forth W. Arch. Toxicol. 1988; 61: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Disruption of many drug resistance yeast genes (PDR5, SGE1, for example) increased the sensitivity of S. cerevisiae cells when tested for drug resistance phenotype (42Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Wurgler F.E. Sengstag C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 47Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the chromosomalars operon by MudI insertion in thearsB gene was shown to decrease resistance of E. coli cells to arsenate and arsenite (48Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Phenotype of theacr3 disruption is identical with the acr1 null mutation (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Both mutant strains are 4–5 times more sensitive to arsenite and arsenate than the wild-type isogenic strain. The Acr1p is similar to the yeast transcriptional regulatory proteins: yAP1, yAP2, pap1 involved in the multidrug and oxidative stress resistance phenotypes (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The yAP-1 protein was shown to regulate the transcription of YCF1 gene, encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter (49Wemmie J.H. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of either the YCF1 orYAP1 gene is conducive to the same cadmium hypersensitivity phenotype (49Wemmie J.H. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So in the case of ACR genes the disruption of positive regulatory gene (ACR1) or the regulated target gene (ACR3) by analogy would lead to the same arsenical sensitivity phenotype, as a result of the lack of expression of a gene encoding an oxyanion transporter. Reduced accumulation of arsenite from bacterial cells bearing multicopies of the arsA and/or the arsB elements was shown to reflect active extrusion of arsenite (3Bröer S. Ji G. Bröer A. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3480-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huang R.N. Lee T.C. Toxicol. App. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results obtained in uptake experiments with multicopies of the ACR3gene are consistent with the facts mentioned above. Cells containing multicopies of ACR3 gene never accumulated radioactive arsenite. However, we did not find any significant difference in arsenite accumulation between wild-type cells and acr1 oracr3 disruptants. We assume that under our experimental conditions it is not possible to notice any disparities in arsenite uptake when we investigate strains either with one copy of theACR1 and ACR3 genes or with disrupted alleles. On the basis of these findings we conclude that the ACR3 gene encodes the protein involved in arsenite transport in yeast cells. The arsenical resistance in bacteria is mediated by an ATP-driven pump which consists of two subunits: ArsA and ArsB (14Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the ArsA protein catalytic subunit is absent, the transport of oxyanions is carried out through the ArsB protein coupled to the protonmotive force (23Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prokaryotic cells extrude arsenicals only in the form of unconjugated arsenite (23Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Ji G. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9474-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Arsenate is reduced to arsenite by the ArsC protein prior to excretion (50Ji G. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9474-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The active extrusion system of oxyanions was reported in L. tarentolae (24Dey S. Papadopoulou B. Haimeur A. Roy G. Grondin K. Dou D. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Dey et al. (25Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown the existence of an ATP-dependent As(III)-glutathione pump in membrane vesicles of L. tarentolae. They proposed a model of arsenical resistance in the Trypanosomatidae consisting of three steps: reduction of As(V) to As(III) by a hypothetical reductase, conjugation of As(III) to the thiol of reduced glutathione, and active extrusion of the complex by an ATP-driven pump (25Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An energy-dependent efflux pump mediates arsenicals resistance also in mammalian cells, but unconjugated arsenite was the only product of transport (13Wang Z.L. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Rossman T.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the human multidrug resistance protein, which is an ATP-driven pump mediating an extrusion of glutathione conjugates, was shown to confer arsenite resistance as well (51Cole S.P. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeler G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of our results and the observations from other organisms we propose the following model of arsenical resistance in the yeastS. cerevisiae which requires at least three genes:ACR1, ACR2, and ACR3. TheACR3 gene, positively regulated by the Acr1p, encodes an oxyanion transporter similar to the bacterial ArsB protein. The Acr3p probably extrudes unconjugated oxyanions of arsenite out of cells, thus reducing the intracellular concentration of toxic anions and providing resistance phenotype. This transport is probably coupled to the protonmotive force as it was suggested for the ArsB-dependent arsenite efflux which correlated to the membrane potential and not to the ATP content (3Bröer S. Ji G. Bröer A. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3480-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that As(V) is first reduced to As(III) by an arsenate reductase prior to the excretion by the Acr3p. In our opinion the ACR2 gene may encode such reductase since the hypothetical product of this gene is a small, soluble polypeptide of 130 amino acids, and the presence of theACR2 gene on a multicopy plasmid together with theACR3 gene is indispensable for high level arsenate resistance (26Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, arsenical resistance in yeast seems to be multifactorial, since the acr3 null mutants were able to recover from the inhibition of low concentrations of arsenicals (Fig. 4). Our results clearly imply that the ACR genes mediate high level arsenite and arsenate resistance but we cannot exclude other mechanisms involved only in low level arsenical resistance. We favor the hypothesis that the arsenic detoxification system based on the ACR genes may be supported by the transporters mediating transport of free arsenite or conjugated to glutathione out of cells or into cellular compartments such as the vacuole. We wish to thank Zbigniew Michalski for his help in the transport experiments."

Thereafter, four other aquaporins have been cloned in mammals. AQP2 is the vasopressin-regulated water channel, exclusively present in apical membranes of principal cells of collecting ducts in the kidney (10Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F.

AQP4 andAQP5 were cloned from brain and salivary gland, respectively, and were presumed to be implicated in the sensation of osmotic change in hypothalamus and secretion in exocrine glands (15Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar,16Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In plants, tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) is an integral membrane protein and belongs to the MIP family (17Pao G.M. Wu L.-F. Johnson K.D. Höfte H. Chrispeels M.J. Sweet G. Sandal N.N. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). γ-TIP was found in the vegetative organs of plant and not in seeds, although α-TIP and β-TIP were seed-specific (19Höfte H. Hubberd L. Reizer J. Ludevid D. Herman E.M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The previous studies showed the presence of unique aquaporins in various exocrine glands such as salivary gland and lacrimal gland (16Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Since pancreas is a secretory organ, secreting various digestive enzymes such as lipase, amylase, and protease in a volume of about 2,000 ml/day in humans (20Doubilet H. Fisherman L. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1961; 35: 499-512PubMed Google Scholar), it may be reasonable to speculate the presence of an aquaporin family in pancreas. In the present study, we attempted to isolate aquaporins expressed in pancreas by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers for the aquaporin family (15Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 16Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol.

Through the study, AQP1 and AQP4 were cloned and coincidentally a new member of the aquaporin family,AQP8, was identified as a water channel prominently expressed in pancreas and liver. Rat pancreas total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 1 h by using an oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase in a volume of 20 μl (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). Nested, degenerate primers reported previously (15Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reverse-transcribed RNA was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/50 μl, AmpliTaq, Perkin-Elmer Corp.) by PCR for 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) using 100 pmol of WCU-1 and WCD-1 in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer containing 0.2 mm dNTP and 1.5 mmMgCl2. The PCR products were re-amplified using 100 pmol of WCU-2 and WCD-2. The amplified products of ∼360 bp were subcloned into pGEM 3Z vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at theEcoRI/BamHI site and sequenced by a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer Corp.) using −21M13 and M13R dye primers (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). A clone was isolated as a novel aquaporin cDNA with 41% nucleotide sequence identity to a tonoplast aquaporin, γ-TIP (19Höfte H. Hubberd L. Reizer J. Ludevid D. Herman E.M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The plasmids inserted with the ∼360-bp PCR product and a partial sequence of the full-length cDNA described below (315 bp, 701–1015) were linearized withHindIII and EcoRI, respectively, and used as a template for in vitro transcription of32P-labeled antisense cRNA probe. To detect a housekeeping gene, a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA of 123 bp was used as reported previously (21Yamamoto T. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Ishibashi K. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Fujinaka H. Marumo F. Kihara I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F198-F204PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat systemic organs by the acid/guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method, and 10 μg of total RNA were hybridized with the 32P-labeled probes for 16 h at 48.5 °C. The unhybridized probes were digested with ribonuclease A (4 μg/ml) and ribonuclease T1 (120 units/ml) for 60 min at 30 °C, and the ribonucleases were digested with proteinase K (0.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the hybridized probes were precipitated with ethanol and heat-denatured for electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were exposed to x-ray films for 3 days. Total RNA (15 μg) isolated from rat liver, colon, kidney, and cerebrum were electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled cRNA probe (106 cpm/ml) transcribed from the cloned cDNA (315 bp, 701–1015) at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, and 5% dextran for 18 h. The membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 25 °C, twice in 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and twice in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and was exposed to an x-ray film for 36 h. Since mRNA expression was intense in liver and pancreas by a preliminary ribonuclease protection assay, ∼2 × 104 colonies of rat liver cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) transferred to nylon membranes were hybridized with the 32P-labeled antisense cRNA probe (106 cpm/ml) for 16 h at 50 °C, and the membranes were washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for autoradiography. One positive clone of ∼1.4 kb was isolated and sequenced. The 5′-end of the entire cDNA was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends by heminested PCR. Two types of oligonucleotide primer for the 5′-end sequence of the 1.4-kb cDNA were synthesized: gene-specific primers GSP-1 (5′-CCTCCAACCAGTGTGACTGC-3′) and GSP-2 (5′-GTGTCCACCGCTGATGTTCC-3′). Plasmids isolated from the rat liver cDNA library (100 pg) were amplified by PCR using 12.5 pmol of the SP6 promoter primer (5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) and the GSP-1 primer for 40 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 47 °C, 1 min at 72 °C). The products were re-amplified with 12.5 pmol of the SP6 promoter primer and the GSP-2 primer for 40 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 47 °C, 1 min at 72 °C). The heminested PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega Corp.) and sequenced. The longest cDNA obtained by 5′-RACE was ligated to the ∼1.4-kb clone to construct the full length of ∼1.45-kb cDNA. The hydrophobicity of the putative protein was analyzed by DNAsis software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Yokohama, Japan), identities to other aquaporins were searched using the FASTA program (GenomeNet), and phylogenesis was analyzed by PILEUP software (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). In vitro protein synthesis from the cloned cDNA was performed in a cell-free translation system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp.) with [35S]methionine and canine pancreatic microsomes at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction products were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and examined by autoradiography (15Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A 1.45-kbSalI/BamHI fragment containing the 5′-untranslated sequence and the entire open reading frame of the cloned cDNA was ligated into pSPORT2 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro after linearization with NotI as described previously (22Preston G.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 317-337Google Scholar).Xenopus laevis oocytes (stage V–VI) were defolliculated by collagenase and microinjected with 50 nl of water or 10 ng of the synthesized cRNA. After incubation in 200 mosm modified Barth's buffer at 20 °C for 36 h, the oocytes were transferred to 70 mosm modified Barth's buffer at 24 °C, and their swelling was monitored by videomicroscopy. The coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf) was assessed by a real-time quantitative imaging method as described recently (4Preston G.M. Carrol T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The uptake of [14C]urea or [14C]glycerol was measured by incubating oocytes in 200 mosm modified Barth's buffer for 10–20 min at 24 °C followed by washing and SDS solubilization. No increase in ion conductance was found when control oocytes were compared with cRNA-injected oocytes by the two-electrode voltage clamp method (16Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was done by a procedure as described previously (23Wilcox J.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In brief,35S-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases using a linearized cDNA template encoding 81–889 nucleotides. Cryostat sections (10 μm thickness) of rat liver, pancreas, salivary gland, and colon were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 5 μg/ml proteinase K (Promega Corp.) in 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min at room temperature and hybridized with each probe (1 × 106 cpm/section) overnight at 55 °C. After washing in 2 × SSC, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature, the sections were treated with 20 μg/ml ribonuclease A in 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by washing in 0.1 × SSC, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 4 h and washing in 0.5 × SSC at room temperature. After dehydration, the sections were exposed to photographic emulsion for 5∼7 days in the dark at 4 °C, developed, and counterstained with hematoxylin to observe under a bright or dark field microscope. AQP1 and AQP4 cDNAs were mainly amplified from rat pancreas cDNA by PCR using the degenerate primers. However, some were similar but completely different in nucleotide sequence to aquaporin family genes reported previously. Analysis of the PCR product revealed high nucleotide sequence homology to aquaporin family members: AQP1, 34%; AQP2, 40%; AQP3, 36%; AQP4, 34%; AQP5, 37%; and γ-TIP, 41%. Preliminary ribonuclease protection assay using the PCR-cloned cDNA as a template showed intense expression of the mRNA in pancreas and liver and weak expression in colon and salivary gland. The expression profile of this gene in systemic organs was apparently distinct from those of other aquaporins. The ∼1.4-kb cDNA was obtained after screening of the rat liver cDNA library at high stringency with the cRNA probe in vitro transcribed with the PCR-cloned cDNA. By the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method ∼150 bp of the 5′-end of the cDNA was isolated and ligated to the ∼1.4-kb cDNA. The cDNA sequence was composed of a 101-bp 5′-untranslated sequence preceding an initiation site (Kozak consensus) (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), a 789-bp open reading frame, and a 589-bp 3′-untranslated sequence containing a polyadenylation consensus (Fig.1 A). Analysis of the GenBank data base revealed that the cloned cDNA was a new member of the aquaporin family. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 263 amino acids (M r = ∼28,000) with homology to aquaporins: γ-TIP, 37%; AQP2, 37%; MIP, 37%; α-TIP, 35%; AQP1, 34%; AQP5, 33%; AQP4, 30%; AQP3, 26%, evaluated by identity using the FASTA program. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous with the plant aquaporin family (γ-TIP and α-TIP). Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis confirmed six putative membrane-spanning domains (I–VI) and five connecting loops containing two sites of NPA motif (Asn-Pro-Ala) preserved in other aquaporin family members (Fig. 1 B). The predicted polypeptide has an unusual structure with a longer N terminus (37 residues) and a shorter C terminus (10 residues) compared with those of other mammalian aquaporins. The long N terminus and short C terminus have been observed in plant aquaporin, γ-TIP. Near the NPA motifs, the deduced amino acid sequence contains a sequence highly conserved in other aquaporins. The gene has been designated aquaporin-8 (symbolAQP8) by the HUGO/GDB Nomenclature Committee (University College of London, London, UK) and registered in the GenBank data base (accession number AF007775). A phylogenetic analysis showed that AQP8 developed in a different branch from other aquaporins (Fig.1 C). Cell-free translation of the cloned cDNA in the presence of microsomes yielded a major band at ∼27 kDa (Fig. 2 A), corresponding to the predicted mass (28 kDa) with slightly more rapid electrophoretic mobility as described previously (16Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Helenius A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 29-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Transmembrane water flow through the protein translated from the cloned cDNA was evaluated in Xenopus oocytes. After 36 h of incubation in 200 mosm buffer at 20 °C, the oocytes were transferred in 70 mosm buffer, and swelling of the oocytes was monitored by videomicroscopy. Injection of oocytes with the cRNA synthesized from the cloned cDNA increased thePf by approximately 14-fold, qualifying the characteristics of the translated protein as a new member of the aquaporin family (Fig.2 B). The increase in Pf mediated by expression of AQP8was blocked by treatment of oocytes with 1 mmHgCl2 and restored by incubation in β-mercaptoethanol similar to most of the already known aquaporins (Fig. 2 B). Likewise, oocytes expressing AQP8 exhibited no increase in the membrane transport of [14C]urea or [14C]glycerol and no increase in the membrane conductance measured by an electrophysiological method (data not shown). Northern blot analysis using total RNA extracted from rat liver and colon showed a single band of ∼1.5 kb (Fig. 3 A), equivalent to the size of other aquaporin family members reported previously (10Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 14Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). No bands were detected in kidney and cerebrum RNA samples. The mRNA expression detected by Northern blot analysis was comparable with the finding obtained by the ribonuclease protection assay, confirming the predominant mRNA expression in pancreas and liver and weak expression in colon and salivary gland (Fig.3 B). The unique distribution of the expression suggested a crucial role(s) of this water channel in those organs. Intense AQP8 mRNA expression was demonstrated in glandular lobules but not in islets of pancreas by in situ hybridization (Fig.4 A). No significant signals were observed in pancreas with the sense probe. No aquaporin family members except AQP1 have been shown in pancreas although the presence of water channels may be presumed as pancreas secretes a large volume of water. The predominant expression of AQP8 in pancreas suggested an important role of this aquaporin in the secretion of pancreatic juice. In situ hybridization of the liver showed AQP8mRNA expression in parenchymal cells and not in the portal area, predicting the expression in hepatocytes. Previous studies showed that osmotic flow of water across hepatocyte membranes occurred mainly via a water channel-independent pathway whereas cholangiocytes transported water probably through AQP1 (26Roberts S.K. Yano M. Ueno Y. Pham L. Alpini G. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13009-13013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Yano M. Marinelli R.A. Roberts S.K. Balan V. Pham L. Tarara J.E. de Groen P.C. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6702-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The observation may be consistent with negligible mRNA expression of aquaporin family members in hepatocyte (26Roberts S.K. Yano M. Ueno Y. Pham L. Alpini G. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13009-13013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Contrasting with these studies, a new aquaporin family, AQP8, was isolated from liver cDNA, and its mRNA expression was shown to be intense in liver by ribonuclease protection assay and Northern blot analysis. Furthermore, in situ hybridization predicted the expression of AQP8mRNA in hepatocytes. The role(s) of AQP8 gene products in liver may be apparent when the subcellular localization is elucidated by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expression of AQP8 was also localized in acinal cells in the salivary gland and absorptive columnar epithelial cell layer in colon, suggesting a cooperative role of this aquaporin with other aquaporins in the secretion of saliva and in water absorption. The AQP8 mRNA expression of narrow tissue distribution may indicate important role(s) of AQP8 in these tissues. Further studies are required to elucidate the cellular and subcellular localization and function of this aquaporin.

https://openalex.org/W1963874550,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine that causes cell injury by generation of oxidative stress. Since glutathione (GSH) is a key cellular antioxidant that detoxifies reactive oxygen species, the purpose of our work was to examine the regulation of cellular GSH, the expression of heavy subunit chain of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS-HS), and control of intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rat hepatocytes treated with TNF. Exposure of cells to TNF (10,000 units/ml) resulted in depletion of cellular GSH levels (50–70%) and overproduction of hydrogen peroxide (2–3-fold) and lipid peroxidation. However, cells treated with lower doses of TNF (250–500 units/ml) exhibited increased levels of GSH (60–80% over control). TNF treatment increased (70–100%) the levels of γ-GCS-HS mRNA, the catalytic subunit of the regulating enzyme in GSH biosynthesis. Furthermore, intact nuclei isolated from hepatocytes treated with TNF transcribed the γ-GCS-HS gene to a greater extent than control cells, indicating that TNF regulates γ-GCS-HS at the transcriptional level. The capacity to synthesize GSH de novo determined in cell-free extracts incubated with GSH precursors was greater (50–70%) in hepatocytes that were treated with TNF; however, the activity of GSH synthetase remained unaltered by TNF treatment indicating that TNF selectively increased the activity of γ-GCS. Despite activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by TNF, this transcription factor was not required for TNF-induced transcription of γ-GCS-HS as revealed by deletion constructs of the γ-GCS-HS promoter subcloned in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter vector and transfected into HepG2 cells. In contrast, a construct containing AP-1 like/metal response regulatory elements increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity upon exposure to TNF. Thus, TNF increases hepatocellular GSH levels by transcriptional regulation of γ-GCS-HS gene, probably through AP-1/metal response element-like binding site(s) in its promoter, which may constitute a protective mechanism in the control of oxidative stress induced by inflammatory cytokines.

Thus, it has been shown that TNF exerts an important physiological role as a modulator of immune responses by regulating specific genes needed for the host defense against a varied repertoire of agents. TNF appears to play a role in the control of cell cycle as DNA synthesis and cell proliferation increase in cells exposed to TNF, indicating that this cytokine acts as a mitogenic stimuli (4Feingold K.

Such regulation of gene expression by TNF is mediated by induction of early responsive genes including c-jun and transcription factors, i.e.NF-κB (5Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Scott C. Herrmann F. Mol.

Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Yet, as a proinflammatory cytokine, whose production is increased in a number of stressful and pathological states, TNF promotes cell injury through several mechanisms including the overproduction of ROS (3Fiers W.

Moreover, cells that normally are insensitive to TNF cytotoxicity can be sensitized by pretreatment with inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis (11Hill D.B. Schmidt J. Shedlofsky S.I. Cohen D.A. McLain C. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1114-1119PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell.

Conversely, it has been shown that sensitive cells can be made resistant to TNF challenge by prior exposure to a sublethal dose of TNF. These findings imply that TNF leads to the induction of genes that confer protective effects on cells. Several protective genes induced by TNF have been reported including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, the zinc finger protein A20, and the Bcl-2 related family member A1 (14Dickinson J.L.

Billings R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Goosens V. Grooten J. Kurt V. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of ROS in mediating the TNF-induced injury, cellular antioxidants attenuate the damaging effects of free radicals, and hence, these compounds may modulate the sensitivity of cells against TNF toxicity (18Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 19Wong G.H. Elwell J. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V.

For instance, previous studies indicated that the antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD determined sensitivity to TNF-induced cell death as TNF treatment up-regulated Mn-SOD gene expression; furthermore, overexpression of Mn-SOD conferred resistance to TNF toxicity in a human kidney embryonal cell line (18Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 19Wong G.H. Elwell J. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). However, such a protective role of Mn-SOD may be restricted to specific cell types since studies in hepatocytes revealed that the TNF-induced expression of Mn-SOD was detected only at the mRNA level without increase in the protein level or enzyme activity (21Czaja M.J. Schizky M.L. Xu Y. Schmiedeberg P. Compton A. Ridnour L. Oberley L.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G737-G744PubMed Google Scholar).GSH, the most abundant antioxidant in cells, plays a prominent role in the defense against oxidative stress-induced cell injury. Thus, the GSH redox cycle, where reduced GSH is cofactor of GSH peroxidase, and GST downplay the consequences of a broad range of reactive species (22Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

GSH is synthesized from its constituent amino acids in two sequential enzymatic reactions catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and GSH synthetase. The reaction catalyzed by γ-GCS is the rate-limiting step in de novo GSH synthesis; γ-GCS is inhibited by GSH through a feedback mechanism (22Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5928) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that manipulation of GSH levels prior to exposure to TNF modulates the cytotoxicity of the cytokine in different cell types (7Adamson G.H. Billings R.E. Arch. Biochem.

GSH depletion induced by inhibition of GSH reductase with 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea or by incubation with BSO, a specific inhibitor of γ-GCS, prior to the exposure of cells to TNF, results in an increased susceptibility of hepatocytes and fibrosarcoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of TNF (7Adamson G.H.

Furthermore, its lethality can be ameliorated by N-acetylcysteine, a GSH precursor, which replenishes cellular GSH by providing intracellular cysteine (20Zimmerman R.J. Marafino B.J. Chan A. Landra P. Winkelhake J.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1405-1409PubMed Google Scholar).Given the importance of GSH in protecting against the oxidative stress elicited by TNF, the purpose of our work was to examine the regulation of cellular GSH, expression of γ-GCS-HS, and control of intracellular generation of ROS in cultured rat hepatocytes treated with TNF. Our results demonstrate that TNF increases cellular GSH levels, mediated by transcriptional regulation of the γ-GCS-HS gene, which attenuates the generation of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation. Our findings imply that the up-regulation of cellular GSH may represent an additional protective mechanism to control the consequences of oxidative stress induced by inflammatory cytokines.

https://openalex.org/W1977258975,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophins, promotes differentiation and survival of various types of neurons in the central nervous system. BDNF binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkB, initiating intracellular signaling and exerting its effects. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), which has been implicated in promotion of neuronal survival by neurotrophic factors, is a component in the signaling pathway of BDNF. We examined how BDNF activates PI3-K in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. We found that insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 are involved in the BDNF signaling pathway that activates PI3-K. IRS-1 and -2 were tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to PI3-K in response to BDNF. This BDNF-stimulated signaling via IRS-1 and -2 was inhibited by K-252a, an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinase. In addition, signaling via IRS-1 and -2 was markedly sustained as well as the BDNF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB. On the other hand, we observed no association of PI3-K with TrkB in response to BDNF. These results indicate that the activation of TrkB by BDNF induces the activation of PI3-K via IRS-1 and -2 rather than by a direct interaction of TrkB with PI3-K in cultured cortical neurons."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 323-345PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 1995; 6: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3zur Hausen H. de Villiers E.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of E7 contains two “Cys-X-X-Cys” motifs that can form a zinc finger. The HPV E6 oncoprotein has two zinc fingers and shares partial amino acid sequence homology with E7 (1Mansur C.P. Androphy E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 323-345PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 1995; 6: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, a recent study revealed that E6 and E7 zinc binding motifs can form different secondary structures (14Ullman C.G. Haris P.I. Galloway D.A. Emery V.C. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal sequences of E7 are also involved in dimerization of the protein (15McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction with Rb is essential for the transformation function of E7 (1Mansur C.P. Androphy E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 323-345PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 1995; 6: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Münger K. Phelps W.C. Bubb V. Howley P.M. Schlegel R.

Hildebrandt P. Lublow J. Kell B. McCance D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the Rb-binding region severely impair the transformation activity of E7. The HPV E7 protein of low risk HPV is less efficient in binding to Rb and has very weak transformation activity. However, detailed mutagenesis of E7 has revealed that Rb/E7 binding alone is not sufficient because mutations in the carboxyl-terminal sequences of E7, outside the Rb-binding site, also severely impair the transformation function (15McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jewers R. Hildebrandt P. Lublow J. Kell B. McCance D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that, aside from binding to Rb, other protein-protein interaction(s) are also necessary for E7-mediated transformation. The 26 S proteasome is a large multimeric protein complex, which catalyzes ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Ref. 17Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome controls programmed degradation of many critical cell cycle regulatory proteins. For example, programmed degradation of mitotic cyclins (18Glotzer M. Murray A. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), maturation-promoting factor (19Holloway S. Glotzer M. King R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase p27 (20Pagano M. Tam S.W Theodoras A.M Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar) by 26 S proteasome are crucial for cell cycle progression. In addition, the 26 S proteasome is responsible for signal-dependent maturation of an inactive precursor of the transcription factor NF-κB and proteolysis of its negative regulator I-κB (21Palombella V.

A. 1996; 93: 8236-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (27Hegde A. Goldberg A. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) are also regulated by the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome contains multiple ATPase subunits (19Holloway S. Glotzer M. King R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is crucial for protein degradation by 26 S proteasome and is also required for the assembly of the proteasome enzymes CF1, CF2, and CF3. The S4-ATPase is known to be important for the 26 S proteasome function because fission yeasts showed defective proteolysis due to mutation in the mts2 gene, which codes for the yeast homologue of human S4 (28Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human S4-ATPase can rescue these mts2 null alleles (28Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The S4-ATPase, together with TBP-1, MSS1, and SUG1, belongs to a recently described ATPase family (reviewed in Ref. 29Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these ATPases have an evolutionary conserved ATPase module and partially conserved carboxyl-terminal domains. In contrast, these ATPases have only limited sequence homology in the amino-terminal domains, and it is believed that the variable NH2-terminal regions of these ATPases are involved in regulation of the ATPase activity. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that deletion of the variable NH2-terminal region of the budding yeast protein Yhs4p, a homologue of human S4, resulted in 4-fold increase of its ATPase activity (30Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our present studies show that human S4-ATPase interacts with the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, but not with the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein. Mutational analysis revealed that E7 interacts with S4 through its carboxyl-terminal sequences. Most interestingly, our results demonstrate that the binding of recombinant E7 to S4 results in significant stimulation of the S4-ATPase activity. We hypothesize that the E7-mediated increase in S4-ATPase activity is important for the cell cycle regulatory function of E7. The yeast strains, HF7c (31Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and SFY526 (32Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar), used in this study were grown either in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-Peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic medium (32Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) with appropriate supplements at 30 °C. The HPV 16 E7-expressing plasmids and the various mutants have been described previously (33Arroyo M. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6537-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments from the wild type and various E7 mutants were subcloned into EcoRI/PstI sites of the yeast vector pGBT9 (34Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) in frame with GAL4 DNA-binding domain. For the PCR reactions, 5′-GC GAA TTC ATC ATG CAT GGA GAT ACA CC-3′ was used as the upstream primer and 5′-GGCG CTG CAG TTA TGG TTT CTA AGA ACA ACA GAT-3′ as the downstream primer. For subcloning of the PTLHE mutant, 5′-GGGG GAA TTC ATG CAT GGA GAT AC-3′ was used as upstream primer. The carboxyl-terminal mutant C91S was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the same upstream primer as for E7 wild type construct, but a different downstream primer 5′-GGG GGA ATT CTT ATG GTT TCT GAG AAC AGA TGG GGG ACA CAA TTC CTA G-3′, followed by subcloning into EcoRI site of pGBT9. The HPV 16 E6 was subcloned into EcoRI/PstI sites of pGBT9. To construct the GAL4-AC-Rb fusion protein, an 1.6-kilobase pair PCR fragment of the Rb cDNA containing sequences between base pairs 1146 and 2793 was subcloned into EcoRI/PstI sites of the yeast vector pGAD424 (34Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) in frame with GAL4 transcription activation domain. For this PCR reaction, 5′-GGGG GAA TTC ATC CAA CAA TTA ATG ATG ATT-3′ was used as the upstream primer and 5′-GGCG CTG CAG TCC TCA TTT CTC TTC CTT GTT-3′ was used as the downstream primer. Cloning of all the above constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST-S4 fusion construct was created by subcloning the EcoRI fragment of S4-cDNA corresponding to amino acids 72–440 into theEcoRI site of pGEX-1λT vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in frame with GST. We screened a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) representing clones of hybrid proteins between the GAL4 activation domain and random cDNA fragments in yeast pGAD10 vector. An estimated 5 × 107 transformants from the library were introduced into theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain HF7c, with the pGBT-E7 plasmid, by lithium acetate (LiAc) transformation method, as described previously (35Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20 (1425): 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformants were plated on the selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and containing 40 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT; Sigma) to isolate clones with histidine prototropy. The transformants were grown for 6 days at 30 °C. The growing clones were replated on the same selective medium and were assayed for another marker, the β-galactosidase activity. In the β-galactosidase assay, the transformants were replica-blotted on Whatman filter papers, immersed into liquid nitrogen for 20 s, and incubated for 40 min to 6 h at 30 °C in buffer (16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, 0.246 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 2.7 ml of freshly added β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.34 mg/ml X-Gal (Sigma). Thirty-eight clones that developed blue color within the first hour were examined further. These clones were grown on synthetic medium containing tryptophan but lacking leucine to separate the cDNAs from the bait, pGAL4-DB-E7 plasmid. Purified plasmid DNAs were analyzed for the size of inserts by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by partial DNA sequencing and data base analysis using the Blast program. GST, GST-E7, GST-S4, GST-E7 C91S, and GST-E6 fusion proteins were purified as described previously (33Arroyo M. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6537-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The quality of GST fusion proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Concentrations of the fusion proteins were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. The GST-S4 used in the ATPase assay was dialyzed against the ATPase reaction buffer described below. ATPase activity of GST-S4 was assayed in the reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 μmATP/[γ-32P]ATP (1,000–2,000 cpm/pmol) at 37 °C for 10 min, as described previously (30Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and 1/100 of the reaction mixture (5 μl) was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (J.T. Baker, Inc.) in 0.4 mLiCl. 1 m acetic acid buffer to separate the released [32P]phosphate from the substrate [γ-32P]ATP (36Randerath K.J. Chromatography. 1963; 10: 235-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After developing the chromatogram, the spots representing the 32P-labeled released phosphate were cut out from the chromatogram and quantitated by scintillation counting. The ATPase activities were calculated as picomoles of ATP degraded/μg of S4 protein/min. All these ATPase assays were performed in the linear range of assays. Every ATPase assays were repeated at least three times with each point in duplicate, and standard deviations were calculated. Yeast extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) with three volumes of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm) for 30 min at 4 °C (34Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, cell lysates (200 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5%) gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with monoclonal E7 antibody (Triton Diagnostics), and developed by ECL (Amersham). The GST pull-down assays were performed according to previously described procedures (37Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 368: 520-525Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly,35S-labeled S4 protein was synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The labeled S4 proteins (5 μl) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST-E7 fusion proteins (25 μg each). After extensive washing, the bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling for 3 min at 95 °C in 1 × Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. We used the yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify novel E7-binding proteins. The assay is based on the reconstitution of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 from two separate fusion proteins: one containing the DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DB) and another containing the transcription activation (GAL4-AC) domain (34Bartel P. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). When the two fusion proteins interact, the GAL4 activator is reconstituted and can initiate transcription from reporter promoters dependent on GAL4 binding. The yeast strain HF7c used in our experiments has two such reporter genes: 1) histidine synthase and 2) β-galactosidase. Expression of β-galactosidase allows screening for blue colored colonies, whereas the expression of histidine synthase allows the growth of these clones in medium lacking histidine (histidine prototrophy). The His3 reporter has a low level of transcription in absence of any GAL4 function; therefore, to eliminate yeast growth as a result of His3 reporter leakage, low level of an inhibitor of histidine synthase, 3-AT, was used in all interaction experiments. We used the GAL4-DB-E7 fusion protein as a “bait” to screen a human placenta cDNA library. The expression of the fusion protein was assayed in the transformed yeast cells (HF7c) by Western blot analysis. A 34-kDa protein of the predicted molecular size was detected with the E7 monoclonal antibody in the extracts of GAL4-DB-E7-transformed yeast cells, but not in the extracts of the untransformed control (Fig.1 A). The Gal4-DB-E7 construct by itself showed no histidine prototropy or β-galactosidase activity in the transformed HF7c yeast cells (data not shown) and was considered as a reasonable bait for the library screening. To screen for the E7-binding proteins, we introduced 5 × 107transformants from the library along with the bait Gal4-DB-E7 construct into the yeast strain HF7c, and selected for histidine prototropy. The growing colonies were isolated and further selected for expression of the β-galactosidase activity. Thirty-eight clones that developed color within 1 h were characterized further. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from these clones, and partial sequence analysis revealed that three of these clones encode cDNA for the Rb protein. Partial DNA sequence analysis of three additional cDNA clones revealed identities of these clones with the human S4 of the 26 S proteasome (38Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the S4 subunit of 26 S proteasome has cell cycle regulatory properties (28Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we carried out a detailed analysis of the interaction between E7 and S4. To determine the specificity of the interaction between S4 and E7, we analyzed the ability of S4 to interact with the HPV 16 E6 oncoprotein, as well as with another unrelated protein, lamin, by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays (Fig. 1 B). The transformants were allowed to grow in medium (−Leu/−Trp) to determine the transformation efficiencies or in the medium (−Leu/−Trp/−His/+25 mm3-AT) to analyze for histidine prototrophy. Results from these experiments showed that HPV 16 E7 interacted efficiently with S4, whereas neither HPV 16 E6 nor lamin showed any interaction with S4 (Fig. 1 B). To identify the domain of E7 involved in the S4/E7 interaction, we used several Gal4-DB-E7 constructs that encode either the wild type or mutant forms of HPV-16 E7 (Fig.2 A). The E7 mutants included: E7 PTLHE (deletion in CR1 homology domain), E7 DLYC (deletion in CR2 homology domain), E7 EDE (deletion in CR2 homology domain), E7 E26Q (substitution mutation in CR2 homology domain), and E7 C91S (substitution mutation in carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motif) (Fig.2 A). These E7 mutants have been previously characterized for the Rb/E7 interaction and transformation functions (15McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jewers R. Hildebrandt P. Lublow J. Kell B. McCance D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Münger K. Werness B.A. Dyson N. Phelps W.C. Harlow E. Howley P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). To compare the E7/S4 interaction with the E7/Rb interaction, the mutants described above were analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assays with either S4 or Rb. In agreement with results from previous biochemical analysis, the Rb/E7 interaction in yeast two-hybrid assay showed dependence on the sequences in the CR2 homology region of the HPV 16 E7 (Fig. 2 B). The deletion mutant DLYC or the substitution mutant E26Q in CR2 region were defective in Rb binding. The E7 deletion mutant, EDE, in the CR2 region outside the Rb-binding domain interacted with Rb as efficiently as wild type E7. The E7 mutant with deletion in CR1 homology region PTLHE and a substitution mutant in the carboxyl-terminal region C91S interacted efficiently with the Rb protein. When the same series of E7 mutants were used in a parallel assay to characterize the E7/S4 interaction, the carboxyl-terminal E7 mutant C91S with mutation in the Cys-X-X-Cys motif was found to be severely impaired in interaction with S4 (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, this COOH-terminal E7 mutant showed strong interaction with Rb. The other E7 mutants harboring changes in the CR1 and CR2 homology regions interacted efficiently with S4 (Fig.2 B). The E7 mutants used in this assay were expressed in equivalent amounts in yeast cells (Ref. 40Clemens K. Brent R. Gyuris J. Münger K. Virology. 1996; 214: 289-293Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar and data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal Cys-X-X-Cys motif of E7 is important for the E7/S4 interaction and the motif involved in Rb/E7 interaction is different from the motif required for S4/E7 interaction. The results from the two-hybrid assays demonstrated an interaction between the carboxyl-terminal sequences of E7 and S4 in yeast cells. To establish an interaction between S4 and E7 without possible participation of yeast proteins, we performed an in vitrobinding assay between the 35S-labeled S4 protein made in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the GST-E7 fusion proteins. The fusion protein GST-HPV 16 E7 and various mutants including GST-E7 E26Q, GST-E7 EDE, GST-E7 DLYC, GST-E7 PTLHE, and GST-E7 C91S were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. An SDS gel analysis of the purified GST fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 3 A. Equal amounts (25 μg each) of these fusion proteins immobilized onto GSH-Sepharose beads were incubated with 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled S4. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads and were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, in agreement with the specificity observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay, S4 interacted efficiently with the wild type GST-E7 but not with the GST-E7 C91S fusion protein (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3 and 8). Moreover, S4 interacted efficiently with other GST-E7 fusion proteins, including GST-E7 E26Q, GST-E7 EDE, GST-E7 DLYC, and GST-E7 PTLHE (Fig. 3 B,lanes 4–7). These results showed that E7 can bind to S4 through its carboxyl-terminal sequences independent of any yeast protein. The S4 subunit of 26 S proteasome is an ATPase; studies with yeast homologue of S4, Yhs4p, have shown that the recombinant GST-Yhs4p protein possesses in vitro ATPase activity (30Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of E7 binding on the S4-ATPase activity, we used the in vitro ATPase assay as described for the GST-Yhs4p protein. We subcloned the cDNA encoding amino acids 72–440 of the human S4 protein in the vector pGEX-1λT to make the recombinant GST-S4 protein. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The ATPase activities of the affinity-purified GST and GST-S4 fusion protein were quantitated by using [γ-32P]ATP as the substrate (Ref. 30Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; also see “Materials and Methods”). The ATPase reactions were optimized for the concentration of GST-S4, time of incubation, and the concentration of ATP; from the results, the conditions for the linear range of assay were established. Using these optimum conditions, the GST-S4 fusion protein exhibited an ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas at the same level of assay, the fusion partner GST showed no detectable ATPase activity (Fig. 4 A). To analyze the effect of E7 binding on the S4 ATPase activity, different concentrations of affinity-purified GST-E7 were incubated with GST-S4 before the ATPase assays. The results, as represented in Fig.4 B, showed that addition of E7 fusion protein significantly increased the ATPase activity of GST-S4. GST-E7 alone showed no ATPase activity (Fig. 4 B). Quantitation of ATPase activity of GST-S4 revealed that it has a K m for ATP of 5.3 μm and a V max of 6.7 pmol of ATP/min/μg of protein (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, addition of GST-E7 did not alter the K m value (5.0 μm) for the S4-ATPase, but theV max was increased to 35.7 pmol of ATP/min/μg of protein (Fig. 4 C). This finding suggests that E7 binding leads to induction of the catalytic activity of S4 in vitro. The induction of S4-ATPase activity was a specific effect of E7, because in a parallel assay, the GST-E6 fusion protein showed no detectable effect on the S4-ATPase activity (Fig.5). Furthermore, the GST-E7 C91S fusion protein (carrying a substitution in amino acid 91 from cysteine to serine) showed no stimulation of S4-ATPase activity (Fig. 5). The E7 C91S protein was impaired in interaction with S4 in both in vitro binding assay and in vivo yeast two-hybrid interaction assays; therefore, the lack of induction of the S4-ATPase activity by this mutant E7 protein strongly suggests a specific functional interaction between S4 and E7. A previous study with the yeast homologue of S4-ATPase, Yhs4p, demonstrated that the recombinant protein GST-Yhs4p had a similar ATPase activity with aK m for ATP of 5 μm and aV max of 7pmol of ATP/min/μg of protein (30Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The activity of the S4-ATPase is essential for the function of the 26 S proteasome; therefore, an increase in S4-ATPase activity by E7 is likely to have an important regulatory effect on the function of the 26 S proteasome. HPV 16 E7 protein has been shown to interact with the Rb family proteins Rb, p107, and p130, and cyclins such as cyclin A and cyclin E through the sequences in the CR2 region. However, these interactions only partially account for the oncogenic functions of E7. For example, the carboxyl-terminal and the amino-terminal regions of E7 protein are critical for its immortalization function, but no cellular targets for either of these two domains have been identified (5Hawley-Nelson P. Vousden K.H. Hubbert N.L. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3905-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L. J.

In this study, using the yeast two-hybrid screening assays, we identified the S4-ATPase of 26 S proteasome as a novel E7-binding protein. The S4/E7 interaction was specific because another HPV oncoprotein, E6, with partial sequence homology with E7 was unable to interact with S4. Furthermore, we provided evidence that S4 interacts through the carboxyl-terminal domain of E7. The S4 is the only known cellular target for the carboxyl-terminal region of E7, and further studies with S4 are likely to provide insights in the functions of this highly conserved domain of E7. The carboxyl-terminal domain is involved in dimerization of E7. and it is possible that S4 binding might interfere with the dimerization of E7 (15McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect of dimerization on the biological functions of E7 is not clear, it will be interesting to determine how the dimerization is affected by binding of the S4 subunit of 26 S proteasome. The papillomavirus oncoprotein E6 binds and degrades the tumor suppressor p53 through the 26 S proteasome pathway. E6 binds the ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and p53, which leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 by 26 S proteasome (43Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vlerstra R. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein has not been shown to participate in this p53 degradation process. Our present studies revealed that E7 binds S4 and induces the ATPase activity of S4. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the recombinant S4 revealed that E7 interaction does not change the K m value of the S4-ATPase reaction. This result suggests that E7 does not interact with the catalytic site of S4. The 4-fold increase in the V max of S4-ATPase reaction by E7 suggests that E7 can increase the rate of S4-enzyme activity without significantly altering the substrate binding. The ATPases associated with the 26 S proteasome are involved in the assembly of the 26 S proteasome enzymes and proteolysis through the 26 S proteasome. At present, it is not clear how E7 binding might affect the function of the 26 S proteasome; future studies will be necessary to determine that. 26 S proteasome has multiple ATPase subunits, and they have been suggested to be involved in targeted degradation of specific substrates. A recent study has shown that the ATPase SUG1 brings c-Fos protein for degradation to the 26 S proteasome (26Wang W. Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8236-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By analogy, S4/E7 interaction might commit specific E7-binding protein(s) for targeted proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. The levels of several regulatory proteins are changed in E7-transformed cells, and some of these proteins are known to be regulated through degradation by 26 S proteasome. Among them, the most important target for E7 protein is the retinoblastoma protein Rb. Several studies have shown that the level of the E7-binding tumor suppressor Rb protein is reduced in E7-expressing cell lines (9Wazer D.E. Liu X.-L. Chu Q. Gao Q. Band V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3687-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10White A.E. Livanos E.M. Tlsty T.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Most importantly, a recent study has shown that, in transformed breast epithelial cells, E7 induces degradation of Rb through 26 S proteasome pathway (23Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1997; 56: 4620-4624Google Scholar). Because E7 binds Rb and S4 through independent domains, it is possible that a E7/Rb/S4 ternary complex is an intermediate leading to the proteolytic degradation of Rb. The tumor suppressor Rb has been implicated as a regulator of several cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. It will be important to determine whether the S4/E7 interaction is a crucial step in E7-induced degradation of Rb through the 26 S proteasome pathway. The papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7 disrupt the functions of the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, respectively. More than 90% of the human cervical cancer tissues express high levels of these two oncoproteins but wild type Rb and p53 proteins. However, both p53 and Rb are mutated in a majority of HPV-negative human cervical carcinomas. E6 degrades p53 through the 26 S proteasome pathway. It is now reported that E7 can also target Rb degradation through the 26 S pathway (23Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1997; 56: 4620-4624Google Scholar). These results together imply that human papillomaviruses have evolved a novel mechanism for degradation of crucial tumor suppressor proteins through 26 S proteasome to induce tumor formation.

Antioxidants have been associated with a diminished risk of cancer at various anatomical sites, including the colon (1Bussey H.J.

These cell cycle perturbations were mediated by induction of p21, a powerful inhibitor of the cell cycle, through a mechanism involving activation and binding of C/EBPβ to the p21 promoter. C/EBPβ is a member of a diverse group of nuclear transcription factors that contain a leucine zipper motif required for dimer formation and a basic DNA-binding domain that facilitates interactions between these factors and the regulatory domains of promoters and/or enhancers of target genes (5Akira S.

C/EBPβ activates several acute phase protein genes through the NF-IL6 responsive elements (8Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 12Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPβ is a pleiotropic transactivator involved in a myriad of signal transduction and cell differentiation events. Control of C/EBPβ expression and activity is complex and poorly understood. It is known that C/EBPβ gene is transcriptionally activated by IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (5Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), whereas in other instances its binding to cognate DNA sequences is enhanced by cytokines (5Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Additionally, C/EBPβ can be a target for post-translational modification. Various kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (14Trautwein C. Caelles C. Van der Greer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), protein kinase C (PKC) (15Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19296-19403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), a Ras-dependent MAP kinase (16Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and a calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase (17Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have been shown to phosphorylate C/EBPβ in vitro. These phosphorylation events modulate DNA binding and transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. However, it is unknown if the phosphorylation status of C/EBPβ influences its subcellular compartmentalization. Elevation of cAMP levels in PC-12 cells or activation of tumor necrosis factor receptors in hepatocytes leads to a redistribution of C/EBPβ from the cytosolic to nuclear compartment (9Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 18Yin M. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Lane M.D. Chatterjee S. Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the antioxidant-mediated increase in C/EBPβ DNA binding activities, we evaluated the effect of the antioxidant PDTC on the post-translational modification and subcellular localization of C/EBPβ in DKO-1 cells, a human colorectal cancer cell line. Our results indicate that PDTC induces a rapid and sustained translocation of C/EBPβ protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in induction of p21. Moreover, we demonstrate that these antioxidant-mediated events are regulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser299 in C/EBPβ. DKO-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Takehiko Sasazuki (Department of Genetics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). FLAG antibodies were purchased from Amersham, and antibodies raised against p21 and the C/EBP proteins α (14AA), β (C-19), and δ (C-22) were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). C/EBPβ and p21 cDNAs were provided by Dr. Linda Sealy (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), respectively. Myristoylated PKI (mPKI) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and tamoxifen citrate and KN-93 from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Radioisotopes were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were from Sigma or J. T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). DKO-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with high glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin (100 unit/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. When cells reached about 80% confluence (time 0), cultures were treated with the appropriate agents for the indicated periods of time (5 min to 24 h). RNA was extracted by the method of Schwab et al. (19Schwab M. Alitalo K. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Poly (A)+mRNA was separated by electrophoresis through 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gels, and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (20Coffey R.J. Goustin A.S. Soderquist A.M. Shipley G.D. Wolfshohl J. Carpenter G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4590-4594PubMed Google Scholar). A human p21 cDNA probe was labeled with [α32P]dCTP by the random primer extension method. Hybridization and post-hybridization washes were carried out at 43 °C. IB15 was used as a control for equivalent loading and transfer (21Danielson P. Forss-Petter S. Brow M. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R. Sutcliffe J. DNA. 1988; 12: 261-267Crossref Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Alternatively, nuclear proteins were isolated as described (22Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Resulting extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 15 min at 4 °C. Following addition of the agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2), antibody-immune complexes were allowed to form during a 2-h rotation at 4 °C. Finally, beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Cellular extracts (50–100 μg, as determined by Bradford analysis) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were probed with anti-p21 or C/EBPβ antibodies, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescense (Amersham). EMSA was performed as described previously (22Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Each 20-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μg of nuclear protein plus a γ-32P-labeled 20-base pair oligonucleotide probe containing the C/EBPβ-binding site in the p21 promoter (5′-GTACTTAAGAAATATTGAAT-3′). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and loaded directly onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide (49:0.6 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel in a buffer of 25 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA. In some experiments, antiserum specific for unique C/EBP isoforms or a mutant C/EBP oligonucleotide (5′-GTACAAAAGAAATATTGAAT-3′) was added to reaction mixtures 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. In all experiments, proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film. Subcellular localization of C/EBPβ was examined by fluorescent immunostaining of DKO-1 cells (23Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on Transwell filters and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 and 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After quenching with 0.25% (w/v) NH4Cl and permeabilizing with 0.05% (w/v) saponin, slides were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum, immunostained with anti-FLAG or C/EBPβ antibodies, and visualized by staining with the appropriate CY3-conjugated donkey anti-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The fluorescent dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used to counterstain nuclear DNA. Immunofluorescence was recorded using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. An 8-amino acid FLAG epitope tag was introduced at the N terminus of human C/EBPβ in pBluescript by the polymerase chain reaction using 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCACGATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAATGCAACGCCTGGTGGCCT-3′ as the sense primer and an internal C/EBPβ sequence (5′-GGCTCGTAGTAGAAGTTGGCCACTTCCA-3′) as the antisense primer. The 133-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment was then exchanged with the native N-terminal C/EBPβ sequence by digestion at the flanking NcoI/Msc I sites. The 1.7-kilobase pair FLAG-C/EBPβ coding sequence was subcloned from pBluescript into pCB6. Mutagenesis of the putative PKA recognition sites (Ser277or 299 to Ala277 or 299) was performed using the Muta-Gene M13 In Vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), and the presence of the desired base pair change was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. DKO-1 cells were transfected with 3 μg of pCB6-C/EBPβ or selected mutants using CELLFECTIN according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, cells were shifted to medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) to select for transfected clones. Expression of C/EBPβ protein was determined by FLAG immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blot analysis. Transfection of DKO-1 cells and subsequent reporter assays were carried out as described previously (4Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Total DNA transfected was kept constant with the addition of pCMV-basic. pCMV-CAT was used as an internal control for gene expression (Promega). Prior to labeling, parental DKO-1 cells or stable transfectants containing an epitope-tagged C/EBPβ expression construct were grown to 50% confluence on 100-mm polysine-coated plates and washed three times with serum-free, phosphate-free minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were radiolabeled for 3 h in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (5 mCi/ml) in the presence of PDTC (70 μm), mPKI (1 μm), or forskolin (50 μm). Epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from total cell or nuclear extracts using agarose-conjugated FLAG antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Following identification of the C/EBPβ, bands were excised, and protein was eluted and analyzed as described elsewhere (24Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphotryptic peptides were analyzed in the first dimension by thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and in the second dimension by ascending chromatography in n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (75:50:15:60). Phosphopeptides eluted from thin-layer plates were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h, mixed with phosphoamino acid standards, and separated electrophoretically at pH 3.5 (25Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). DKO-1 cells were grown until 80% confluence and incubated with PDTC or forskolin for up to 24 h. At the desired time points, cells were extracted with 4 mm EDTA and boiled for 5 min, and the amount of cAMP in the cell lysates was determined using the [3H]cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham). PKA activity assays were performed on total cell lysates using the SignaTECT cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Total protein was determined as described before (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is a member of a diverse group of nuclear transcription factors that contain a leucine zipper motif and a basic DNA-binding domain (5Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). We previously have shown that p21 expression is induced by antioxidants through a mechanism involving activation of C/EBPβ (4Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which this occurs, we performed EMSA with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the p21-NF-IL6cis element and nuclear extracts from the colorectal cell line DKO-1, treated over a 24-h period with PDTC. As shown in Fig.1 A (lanes 1–9), DNA binding activity was increased 5-fold in cells treated with PDTC for 30 min. Shifted complexes were competed by a 50-fold molar excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-IL6 sequence (lane 11) but not by an oligonucleotide containing a mutated NF-IL6 consensus sequence (lane 12), indicating that the induced complex was specific for the NF-IL6 cis element. Supershift experiments confirmed that this was predominately due to increased C/EBPβ (lane 14) but not C/EBPα (lane 13) or C/EBPδ (lane 15) binding activity. We next sought to determine if the observed PDTC-induced increase in C/EBPβ DNA binding activities was due to increased C/EBPβ expression. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both C/EBPβ mRNA and whole cell protein concentrations remained relatively constant over the 24-h treatment with PDTC. These results suggest that the increased DNA binding activities are unlikely to be mediated by increased synthesis of C/EBPβ. However, in vivo[32P]orthophosphate-labeling of C/EBPβ revealed the rapid appearance and sustained elevation of a phosphorylated form of C/EBPβ in nuclear extracts following PDTC treatment (Fig.1 C). Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed that under these conditions, PDTC induces a rapid redistribution of C/EBPβ to the nucleus (Fig. 1 D), suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed increase in DNA binding activity. These findings implicate protein phosphorylation of C/EBPβ as a possible mechanism for its nuclear translocation. Previous studies have shown that C/EBPβ translocates to the nucleus following elevation of cAMP levels in PC-12 cells (9Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) or activation of tumor necrosis factor receptors in hepatocytes (18Yin M. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Lane M.D. Chatterjee S. Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PDTC does not, however, induce nuclear translocation or increase DNA binding activity of the transcription factor NF-κB in DKO-1 cells (data not shown). A reduction in H2O2 levels can activate adenylyl cyclase and hence elevate cAMP levels (27Masuda H. Kaneko M. Hong R.B. Lkegaya T. Hayashi H. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Jpn. Circ. J. 1993; 57: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because PDTC has been shown to alter the cellular oxidative status, in part by decreasing endogenous H2O2 levels (4Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), increased cAMP levels may initiate the observed post-translational effects of this antioxidant. Therefore, we measured the effect of forskolin (a known elevator of intracellular cAMP) or PDTC on cAMP levels and PKA activity in DKO-1 cells over a 24-h period. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), both PDTC and forskolin were able to rapidly increase intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity within 5 min. Interestingly, cAMP levels and PKA activity returned to base line following 24 h of treatment with forskolin, whereas PDTC induced a sustained elevation in these parameters. Cholera toxin was able to inhibit PDTC-induced PKA activity (data not shown), suggesting that PKA is activated via a cAMP-dependent pathway through Gs stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The sustained elevation in cAMP and PKA activity in response to PDTC and not in response to forskolin may be a result of modulation of phosphodiesterase activity by the antioxidant. In addition, a PDTC-induced alteration in phosphatase activity also may contribute to the observed persistence in PKA activity. We are presently exploring these potential mechanisms. We utilized DKO-1 cells constitutively expressing epitope-tagged C/EBPβ protein to further investigate whether post-translational modification (phosphorylation) of C/EBPβ is responsible for the observed increase in C/EBPβ activity. In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation revealed a 6-fold increase in epitope-tagged C/EBPβ phosphorylation in response to PDTC or forskolin (3 h) with no change in protein levels (data not shown). Truncated versions of C/EBPβ that contained only the 160 or 200 C-terminal amino acids were poor substrates for PDTC-induced phosphorylation, whereas mutant C/EBPβ that contained the 305 C-terminal amino acids was phosphorylated by PDTC as efficiently as the full-length C/EBPβ (data not shown). Closer inspection of the primary amino acid sequence between 236 and 305 revealed that this region contained a consensus PKA phosphorylation site (Arg-Xaa-Ser299-Xaa). Comparison of the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of epitope-tagged C/EBPβ from PDTC- or forskolin-treated and untreated stable transfectants showed most of the inducible phosphorylation to occur on one distinct phosphopeptide (X3; Fig.3 A). To confirm that both endogenous and FLAG-tagged C/EBPβ are subject to similar changes in their phosphorylation state in a different cell type, we repeated these experiments in differentiated 3T3 cells stably expressing PKA that additionally express high levels of C/EBPβ. As observed in DKO-1 cells, PDTC stimulated site-specific phosphorylation of both endogenous and expressed C/EBPβ (data not shown). Although the level of several phosphopeptides was increased after PDTC treatment, the only change common to both cell types was a higher level of the phosphopeptide, X3 (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). The migration position of phosphopeptide X3 appeared identical to that of a phosphopeptide that contains Ser277and Ser299 as its phosphoacceptors (data not shown), sites previously reported to be weakly phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (15Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19296-19403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To determine whether Ser277 and/or Ser299 were indeed PDTC-responsive phosphorylation site(s), we substituted either amino acid with alanine. Vectors expressing FLAG-tagged wild type (WT) C/EBPβ or C/EBPβ (Ala277 or Ala299) were stably transfected into DKO-1 cells, and the resultant proteins were isolated after in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. As shown in Fig. 3 (B andC), substitution of Ser299 but not Ser277 led to selective loss of PDTC-inducible phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ. Interestingly, the low levels of Ala299 C/EBPβ detected by [32P]orthophosphate labeling appeared as a doublet similar to the phosphorylated forms observed with endogenous protein (Fig. 1 C and 3B). Furthermore, substitution of Ser299 with alanine failed to alter the rate of C/EBPβ migration during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that these different C/EBPβ species do not represent phosphorylation at Ser299. The appearance of this doublet form in the nucleus of DKO-1 but not HCT 116 or HCT 15 colon cancer cells (4Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) may represent additional post-translational modifications, independent of the PDTC-translocational signal. Previous studies by our group have shown that overexpression of C/EBPβ leads to increased p21 expression (4Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Induction of p21 by DNA damage frequently relies on the tumor suppressor protein p53 (28El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu T. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7956) Google Scholar), presumably through interaction with p53-binding sites present in the p21 promoter region. However, many inducers of p21, including cytokines, prostaglandins, and genotoxic agents (29Gorospe M. Martindale J.L. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Holbrook N. J. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1996; 4: 47-65Google Scholar), operate to a large degree through poorly characterized p53-independent mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PDTC-mediated phosphorylation on C/EBPβ activity by comparing the ability of wild type C/EBPβ and the Ala299 mutant in stably transfected DKO-1 cells to activate p21 gene expression following nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 4 (A andB), wild type C/EBPβ (endogenous and epitope-tagged WT) was able to translocate to the nucleus and induce p21 expression following PDTC treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). PDTC treatment of these cells in the presence of a highly specific PKA inhibitor, mPKI, completely abolished these cellular changes (Fig.4 B). In contrast, co-administration of PDTC with the selective kinase inhibitors, tamoxifen citrate (PKC) or KN-93 (calcium-calmodulin-dependent), failed to inhibit nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ or its ability to induce p21 expression (data not shown). As predicted, Ala299 C/EBPβ failed to translocate to the nucleus following PDTC treatment (Fig.4 A). Surprisingly, expression of this mutant acted as a dominant-negative in these cells, preventing the ability of endogenous protein to induce p21 expression (Fig. 4 B). The dominant-negative effect of this mutation was confirmed by transient transfection analysis (Fig. 4 C). These results demonstrate that translocation of C/EBPβ to the nucleus is directly enhanced by the PKA-induced phosphorylation of Ser299, an effect inhibited by the presence of mPKI. Previous reports have demonstrated that C/EBPβ is phosphorylated by PKC (Ser105 in vivo or Ser248, Ser277, and Ser299 in vitro) (14Trautwein C. Caelles C. Van der Greer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar,15Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19296-19403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), PKA (Ser277 and Ser299 in vitro) (15Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19296-19403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), a Ras-dependent MAP kinase (Thr235 in vitro) (16Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and a calcium-calmodulindependent kinase (Ser276 in vivo and in vitro) (17Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), leading to alterations in DNA binding activities. Although these reports provide insights into the mechanisms by which the activity of C/EBPβ could be potentiated by selected agents to affect activation of genes, specific biological end points were not explored. For example, transactivation of C/EBPβ by PKC in hepatocytes may affect activation of acute phase protein synthesis, whereas phosphorylation of Thr235 by MAP kinase may lead to cell growth or inhibition. We envision that differential phosphorylation of C/EBPβ may contribute, at least in part, to the diverse signals mediated by this transcription factor. Collectively, our results demonstrate that in DKO-1 cells phosphorylation of C/EBPβ at Ser299 following activation of PKA is critical for its nuclear translocation and subsequent transactivation of genes in response to altered oxidative states. We thank Mark Gregory and Steve Hann for invaluable help with the phosphomapping studies."

This study determines the structure of murine lumican gene (Lum) and its expression during mouse embryonic developments. The mouse lumican gene was isolated from a bacterial artificial chromosome mouse genomic DNA library and characterized by polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization. The lumican gene spans 6.9 kilobase pairs of mouse genome. The gene consists of three exons and two introns. Exon 1 constitutes 88 bases (b) of untranslated sequence. Exon 2 is 883 b and contains most of the coding sequence of lumican mRNA, and exon 3 has 152 b of coding sequence and 659 b of 3′ noncoding sequence. The mouse lumican gene has a TATCA element, a presumptive TATA box, which locates 27 b 5′-upstream from the transcription initiation site. Northern hybridization and in situ hybridization indicate that in early stages of embryonic development, day 7 post coitus the embryo expresses little or no lumican. Thereafter, different levels of lumican mRNA can be detected in various organ systems, such as cornea stroma, dermis, cartilage, heart, lung, and kidney. The cornea and heart are the two tissues that have the highest expression in adult. Immunoblotting studies found that KSPG core proteins became abundant in the cornea and sclera by postnatal day 10 but that sulfated KSPG could not be detected until after the eyes open. These results indicate that lumican is widely distributed in most interstitial connective tissues.

The modification of lumican with keratan sulfates in cornea is concurrent with eye opening and may contribute to corneal transparency. Corneal strength and transparency depend upon the development and maintenance of an organized extracellular matrix, including uniformly small diameter collagen fibrils with lamellae of consistent interfibrillar spacing. The collagen fibrils of adjacent lamella sheets are perpendicular to one another (1Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Birk D.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The mechanism that governs the formation of collagen lamellae in cornea stroma is not well understood. It has been suggested, however, that the ratios of different collagen types in making up the fibrillar corneal collagen and other extracellular specialized matrix components, e.g.proteoglycans and glycoprotein are essential for the development of a transparent cornea (1Linsenmayer T.F.

Burillon C. Garrone R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1749-1760PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interaction with collagen fibrils, proteoglycans in stroma also play a role in corneal hydration due to their high negative charge of sulfated carbohydrate moieties (9Rawe I.M.

The hydrophilic properties of the stroma result from stromal proteoglycans that constitute the second most abundant biological materials in stroma, after collagen (12Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L.

Currently, three corneal KSPG core proteins have been identified, i.e. keratocan, lumican, and mimican (osteoglycin), which were previously designated 37A, 37B, and 25, respectively (13Funderburgh J.L.

These proteins are structurally and antigenically related, and each bears from one to threeN-linked keratan sulfate chains in addition to several nonsulfated oligosaccharides (14Corpuz L.M.

Lumican belongs to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan, and osteoglycin (20Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Each of these proteoglycans possesses 6–10 leucine-rich repeating units between the flanking cysteine-rich disulfide-bonded domains at the N and C termini of the core protein. The presence of a common structural motif implies that these proteoglycans may share common functional properties. Such a common function is thought to be the interaction with fibrillar collagen. The tissue distributions of each proteoglycan are distinct; therefore, it is likely that each family member fulfills a different role in connective tissues (20Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 21Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1994; 70: 73-100PubMed Google Scholar, 22Scott J.E.

The presence of sulfated lumican molecules in cornea suggests that in this tissue lumican may have unique functions, e.g. maintaining corneal transparency; however, its role serving in other noncorneal tissues remains elusive.

To examine the structure and function relationship of mouse lumican gene using transgenic mice and site-directed mutagenesis techniques; it is imperative to isolate and characterize the mouse lumican cDNA and genomic DNA and to determine the spatial-temporal expression of lumican gene during mouse development. In the present studies, we have cloned and determined the primary structure of mouse lumican gene (Lum). In situ and Northern hybridization were used to determine the temporospatial expression of Lum. Lumican isolated from eye shells (cornea plus sclera) at various developmental stages were also biochemically characterized. Our results indicate that lumican is widely expressed in a variety of connective tissues. Sulfation of the lumican in cornea occurs concomitantly with eye opening and therefore may be an essential step in providing corneal transparency. A pair of primers, sense 5′-CATGTATGGGCAAATATC and antisense 5′-TGTAGAAGGTTGTGGTCA (16Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Hevelone N.D. Stech M.E. Justice M.J. Liu C.Y. Kao W.W.-Y. Conrad G.W. Invest.

A positive clone of 200 kb was isolated. The clone was characterized with restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blot hybridization with 32P-labeled lumican cDNA. A 6-kbSalI-XbaI fragment and an 8-kbXbaI-XbaI fragment together encoding the full-length cDNA were subcloned into pBSSK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nucleotide sequence (both strands) of the lumican gene was determined with dideoxynucleotide method by the DNA core in the Department of Molecular Genetics at University of Cincinnati. A 20-base antisense primer 5′-CTCTCTTGACACTGTTTCCG-3′ complementary to exon 1 (bases 65–84) and a phosphorated universal sequence primer 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ were used to prepare a 1-kb DNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ SacI/XbaI fragment of mouse lumican genomic DNA clone as template (Fig. 1). Then the sense strand was degraded with λ exonuclease using a procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Boehringer Manneheim). The antisense strand was 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). The labeled DNA was hybridized to 100 μg of mouse poly(A)+ mRNA prepared from 1 day post natal (P1) new born mice. This reaction was then digested with 300 units of S1 nuclease (27Liu C.-Y. Zhu G.

The digested product was analyzed on an 8% denaturing acrylamide sequencing gel. To identify the transcription initiation nucleotide, a sequence reaction using the same antisense primer mentioned above and mouse lumican 5′ genomic DNA fragment as template was prepared with Sequenase® (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A 41-nucleotide antisense primer, complementary to exon 1 (bases 44–84), was 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and hybridized to 100 μg of mouse poly(A)+ mRNA.

For determination of lumican mRNA in whole embryos, a premade blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from different prenatal developmental embryos separated by electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel was purchased from CLONTECH Labs (Palo Alto, CA). The blot was probed with 32P-labeled mouse lumican cDNA as described previously (14Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

The RNAs were then transferred to Magna-Charged membranes® and hybridized with 32P-labeled lumican and mouse GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) cDNA probes in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide at 41 °C overnight as described previously (16Funderburgh J.L.

The free 32P probes were removed by stringent washing three times with 0.1 × SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm citrate buffer, pH. 7.0) and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min each. The hybridization signals were detected with a PhosphorImager. The amounts of lumican mRNA were calibrated with the GAPDH mRNA in samples. To identify the cell types that express lumican, the mouse tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin as described previously (28Moyer P.D. Kaufman A.H. Zhang Z. Kao C.W.-C.

Antisense and sense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes (Boehringer Mannheim) of lumican were synthesized and used in in situ hybridization on paraffin sections (5–7 μm) mounted on Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher). To remove nonspecifically bound probes, slides were subjected to a stringent wash in 0.5 × SSC at 65 °C and treated with 20 μg/ml of RNase (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing with 0.2 × SSC at 65 °C as described previously (28Moyer P.D. Kaufman A.H. Zhang Z. Kao C.W.-C. Spaulding A.G. Kao W.W.-Y. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The hybridization signals were visualized with anti-digoxygenin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugates using procedures recommended by Boehringer Mannheim. Proteoglycans were isolated from eye shells (cornea plus sclera) of prenatal day 18, postnatal days 1, 10, and 20, and 1 year of C57BL mice in 20 volumes of a solution containing 4m guanidine HCl and protease inhibitors as described by Funderburgh et al. (15Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Roty M.R. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37 (abstr.): S645PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue residue was collected by centrifugation and re-extracted for 12 h at 4 °C. The combined supernatants were dialyzed to 6 m urea, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 8. Proteoglycans were absorbed on a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sapharose Fast Flow (Sigma) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 0.1 m NaCl in the same buffer, and proteoglycans were eluted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8. Dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans were precipitated in 50% ethanol for 14 h at −20 °C, and keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans were precipitated by the further addition of ethanol to the supernatant to make 75% (v/v). This procedure isolated both sulfated and unsulfated forms of lumican (23Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitated proteoglycans were collected by centrifugation, rinsed in 80% ethanol, dried in vacuum, and dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1m Tris-phosphate, pH 6.8. Approximately 10 μg of protein of the corneal KSPG either untreated or digested with 0.01 unit each of endo-β-galactosidase and keratanase II for 2 h at 37 °C was separated on a 3 to 12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The gel was fixed in 25% isopropanol, 5% acetic acid, for 2 h and stained overnight in 0.025% Alcian blue in 25% isopropanol, 5% acetic acid and destained in the same solution. KSPG core proteins were released by digestion of 5 μg of KSPG protein with endo-β-galactosidase as described above and then separated on a 8–16% gel. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and KSPG proteins were detected using anti-bovine KSPG antibodies as described previously (14Corpuz L.M.

The 200-kb genomic DNA clone isolated from a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome genomic DNA library was characterized by Southern hybridization with32P-labeled 5′ and 3′ end fragments of mouse lumican cDNA. The full-length mouse lumican gene spans 6.9 kb in mouse genome. Fig. 1 illustrates that murineLum gene has three exons and two introns. The genomic DNASalI/XbaI and XbaI/XbaI fragments were subcloned, and the nucleotide sequences were determined in both strands by dideoxynucleotide method. Fig.2 shows the primary structure of lumican gene and the amino acid sequence deduced from exons. The mouseLum does not have a conventional TATA box, instead it has a TATCA element, a presumptive TATA box, that is located 27 bases 5′-upstream from the transcription initiation site. There is a stretch of 30-b GC-rich element at about −70 b 5′ to the transcription initiation site. The first translation initiation ATG codon is located at the 21st base from the beginning of exon 2. Thus, exon 1 encodes the 5′ end untranslated region of lumican mRNA. Exon 2 (883 bp) encodes most of amino acids in lumican, and exon 3 (811 bp) encodes 51 C-terminal amino acid residues and a 659-bp 3′ end untranslated region. Introns 1 and 2 are 2342 and 2797 bp, respectively. All exon-intron junctions consist of the consensus splice signal dinucleotides GT (donor) and AG (acceptor). The polyadenylation signal AATAAA is found 635 bp downstream from the termination codon TAA in exon 3. Fig.3 illustrates phosphoimages of32P-labeled products derived from primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays. Both the primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays demonstrate that the transcription initiation site is the nucleotide T located at 2450 b 5′ to the translation initiation codon ATG, and 27 b 3′ of the TATA-box like element TATCA as compared with the sequence of lumican genomic DNA was determined by using the same primer used in preparation of the probe of S1 protection assay (Figs. 2 and 3). To predict the possible phenotypes of lumican mutation mice, it is important to determine the temporal and spatial expression of mouse lumican during development. Northern hybridization and in situhybridization indicate that in early stages of embryonic development before day 7 post coitus (PC), the embryo does not express lumican or expresses only very low amounts if any (data not shown). Fig.4 A shows that the poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 7-day-old embryos contains very little lumican mRNA (lane 1). The levels of lumican mRNA in the whole embryos increase substantially at 11 days PC and maintain at a high level afterward. To further elucidate the expression of lumican mRNA by various tissues during mouse development, Northern hybridization was performed with total RNAs isolated from cornea, heart, skin, muscle, lung, and kidney. Fig. 4 B shows that levels of lumican mRNAs in proportion to that of GAPDH in cornea and skin are higher in embryonic days 16 and 18 than those of postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21, whereas in heart reversed levels of lumican expression are observed. The skeletal muscles express lumican mRNA at a lower but constant level. Lung and kidney have very low level of lumican expression through out the periods examined (data not shown). To determine the cell types that express lumican mRNA, tissue sections prepared from mouse embryos and newborn mice were hybridized with digoxygenin labeled riboprobes as described under “Materials and Methods.” The in situ hybridization shows that the stroma cells in mouse cornea start to express lumican at embryo day 12 (E12). Fig. 5 shows the lumican expression in cornea stroma cells at E14, postnatal day 1 (P1), and adult mouse. Thein situ hybridization also detected the expression of lumican mRNA in several other organs, such as skin, heart, lung, and kidney. Most of these organs start to express lumican mRNA at embryo day E12. Fig. 6 shows that the lumican mRNA is expressed by dermal fibroblasts, cardiac muscle cells, the kidney glomerular cells, alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in the lung.Figure 6In situ hybridization analysis of mouse lumican mRNA in various tissues at P5.

At day 10 PC, the skin begins to express Lum mRNA in both epidermis and dermis. From day 14 PC, the dermis expresses lumican mRNA, but the epidermis does not. At the early development stages, E12 and E14, retina also expresses lumican mRNA (Fig. 5 and Table I). It is of interest to note that almost all interstitial cells of various tissues examined express lumican mRNA after 12 days of gestation.Table IThe expression of lumican during mouse developmentOrganE10E12E14E16P1P5P10P18AdultEyeCorneal stroma−++++++++Retina−++−−−−−−Sclera−++++++++SkinEpidermis++−−−−−−−Dermis+++++++++Heart−++++++++Lung−++++++++Bone and Cartilage−++++++++Cryosections of tissues obtained from mouse embryos at different developmental stages were subjected to in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labeled cDNA probes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Cryosections of tissues obtained from mouse embryos at different developmental stages were subjected to in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labeled cDNA probes as described under “Materials and Methods.” KSPG core proteins were released by treatment with endo-β-galactosidase from extracts of cornea and sclera and then detected by Western blotting using anti-KSPG antibodies. As shown in Fig.7 A, at postnatal day 1, very little of KSPG core proteins was detected with this antibody. At day 10 and thereafter, there were increasing amounts of the KSPG core proteins. Sulfated KS-containing proteoglycans were detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels with Alcian blue, a dye that stains the sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains of the KSPG molecule. At postnatal day 1 sulfated KSPG could not be detected (Fig.7 B), but by day 10 trace amounts of KSPG smaller in size than that of adult mice was observed. A marked increase in the amount and size of KSPG occurred between days 10 and 20, with the amount at day 20 near that of 1-year-old mice. Predigestion of the KSPG fraction with keratanase II, an enzyme specific for sulfated moieties in the KS chains, results in the lack of Alcian blue staining in specimens. These observations indicate that cornea and sclera do not accumulate significant amounts of sulfated KSPG prior to 10 days after birth, a period in which the eyes are still closed in new born mice. The mouse lumican belongs to SLRPs family and has all the features of SLRPs: a central domain of leucine-rich repeats flanked by N- and C-terminal domains with highly conserved cysteines (16Funderburgh J.L.

The structure of mouse Lum gene is similar to that of fibromodulin, which has three exons, with the second exon encoding all ten leucine-rich repeats (30Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). They are different from the other two members in another class of SLRPs family, i.e. decorin and biglycan, which are composed of eight distinct exons and contain the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate chains (20Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 31Scholzen T. Solursh M. Suzuki S. Reiter R. Morgan J.L. Buchberg A.M. Siracusa L.D. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1995; 30: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mouse lumican gene does not contain a conventional TATA box; rather, an unusual TATCA box is present at 27 b 5′-upstream to the transcription initiation start site. About 5% of genes that have been characterized use this TATA box-like element for recognition of transcription initiation (33Ghyselinck N.B. Dufaure I. Lareyre J.J. Rigaudiere N. Mattei M.G. Dufaure J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 258-272PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a 30-nucleotide GC-rich stretch is located at −70 b from the transcription start site (Fig.2). It has been suggested that the presence of the GC-rich stretch may facilitate the recognition of a weak TATA box, like element TATCA, by transcription factors. For example, the DNA-binding factor SP1 recognizes GC-rich sequences, and genes lacking the TATA box may rely on these GC-rich sites and the proteins bind to them to start transcription (34Vigneron M. Barrera-Saldana H.A. Baty D. Everett R.E. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that SLRPs are regulators of tissue morphogenesis and cellular differentiation in vivo through their contribution to the organization of extracellular matrix in connective tissues (20Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 35Meier S. Hay E.D. Dev. Biol. 1973; 35: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Meier S.

The deposition of a collagenous matrix with small and uniform fibril diameters and uniform interfibrillar spacings is essential for the development and maintenance of transparent cornea (37Farrell R.A. McCally R.L. Tatham P.E. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1973; 233: 589-612Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). During corneal wound healing and the pathogenesis of corneal macular dystrophy, it has been noted that there are changes in cornea stromal proteoglycan contents that may account for the formation of opaque corneas (38Melles G.R.

J. 1996; 70: 1966-1972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the opaque corneal scar tissues, the amount of KSPG is reduced, and the amount of dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan increased. A return to normal KSPG is observed upon restoration of corneal transparency (39Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corneal macular dystrophy is characterized by the alteration of the metabolism of sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains, possibly due to a deficiency in the catabolic dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan enzyme, α-l-iduronidase, or the anabolic enzyme, sulfotransferase (41Hassell J.R.

Our data revealed that there is a marked increase of KSPG core proteins in the mouse cornea at postnatal day 10 compared with that of day 1. Lumican becomes modified with keratan sulfate side chains at postnatal day 20 (Fig. 7). This is consistent with that of previous studies showing that KSPGs exist in a polylactosamine form and become sulfated keratan sulfate proteoglycans during the embryonic development of the chick cornea at about day 15, when the cornea begins to become transparent (45Cornuet P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar, 46Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies of changes in KSPG during chick corneal development suggest that both the core protein of lumican and its keratan sulfate side chains are important to the development of corneal transparency (45Cornuet P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar, 46Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev.

Sulfation of the KS chain lags behind the core protein accumulation by about 10 days. Sulfated KSPG does not begin to accumulate until day 10, reaching near maximum levels at about day 20. During this time the mouse eyes open. This observation is consistent with the study by Cai et al. (48Cai C.X. Gibney E. Gordon M.K. Marchant J.K. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), who showed about a 2–3-fold increase of mRNA level of chicken β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the KS chain backbone, during embryonic days 8–13, the period when extracellular KS is first detected and begins an exponential accumulation in the growing stroma (46Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The chicken corneas achieve transparency during this time. Thus, our observations and others are consistent with the notion that lumican and other proteoglycans may play an important role in the development and maintenance of corneal transparency. It is of interest to note that the levels of lumican mRNA in developing corneas decrease in the new born mice and maintain a relative constant level in proportion to GAPDH mRNAs as compared with those of embryonic corneas at day 16 and 18 PC (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, the maximum accumulation of lumican protein in the tissue does not correspond with the peak of lumican mRNA. Possibly, the synthesis and secretion of lumican may be regulated at transnational and/or post-translational levels, similar to what has been reported in collagen biosynthesis (19Kao W.W.-Y. Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2234-2243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kao W.W.-Y. Mai S.H. Chou K.L. Ebert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7779-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the accumulation of lumican in tissues may be greatly enhanced due to an increased stability by the attachment of KS glycosaminoglycan chains to the core protein. Further studies are needed to examine the possibilities. Lumican containing the keratan sulfate side chains may be only limited to the cornea; it is intriguing that it is also present in a variety of noncorneal tissues, e.g. cartilage, heart, lung, skin, kidney, etc., as a smaller, more homogeneous, poorly sulfated or nonsulfated glycoprotein (11Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

This unsulfated molecule may play important roles that are yet to be identified in the maintenance of normal tissue functions. It seems likely that lumican in noncorneal tissues is a regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis, because it appears to be in cornea. Thus, in addition to cornea the ablation of lumican gene may have phenotypes involving multiple organ systems whose functions are compromised in homozygous lumican-deficient mice."

However, interactions between protein 4.1 and its binding partners in non-erythroid cell membranes are poorly understood.

The sequences LRRRY or IRRRY in band 3 mediate the interaction between band 3 and protein 4.1. The cytoplasmic domain of CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein found in erythroid as well as non-erythroid cells, has internal sequences SRRRC and QKKKL.

Furthermore, although independent binding of both protein 4.1 and ankyrin to CD44 could be documented, binding of protein 4.1 prevented subsequent ankyrin binding.

However, the identity of membrane proteins with which these structural proteins interact in non-erythroid cells and factors that modulate these protein-protein interactions have not been well defined. In contrast, we have a detailed understanding of the interactions between protein 4.1 and ankyrin with membrane proteins in erythrocyte membrane and the functional consequences of these interactions (6Bennett V.

Mechanical properties of the human erythrocyte membrane are regulated by the spectrin-based membrane skeleton that underlies the lipid bilayer and by membrane proteins that anchor the skeleton to the bilayer (for review, see Ref. 7Mohandas N.

Spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, adducin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, dematin, and p55 are the principal constituents of the membrane skeleton. Lateral interactions among these proteins constitute the composite structure designated as the membrane skeletal network.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have identified the sequence motifs LRRRY and IRRRY in the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 to be involved in binding to the sequence motif LEEDY in the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. Although neither band 3 nor glycophorin C is present in most non-erythroid cells, these cells do contain adhesion molecules such as cadherins and CD44 (19Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98PubMed Google Scholar), which have the potential to interact with the cytoskeletal components. In fact, ankyrin has been shown to associate with CD44 in T-lymphoma cells (20Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for a direct interaction between protein 4.1 and CD44. Because the cytoplasmic domain of CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein, has internal sequences SRRRC and QKKKL, we wanted to determine if protein 4.1 can bind to CD44 in a fashion analogous to its binding to band 3 and, through this interaction modulate ankyrin binding to CD44. In the present study, we showed that protein 4.1 and the recombinant 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (r30kDa) 1The abbreviations used are: r30kDa, recombinant 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl) methyloxycarbonyl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ankyrin-R, erythrocyte ankyrin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CD44cyt, cytoplasmic domain of CD44; rCD44cyt, recombinant cytoplasmic domain of CD44; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; HA, hyaluronic acid; ERM, ezrin, radixin, and moesin. bind to the cytoplasmic domain of CD44. We also documented that Ca2+and calmodulin reduced the affinity of the interaction between r30kDa and CD44. Furthermore, although we could document independent binding of both r30kDa and ankyrin to the cytoplasmic domain of CD44, binding of r30kDa prevented subsequent ankyrin binding. These studies have enabled us to identify a potentially important role for protein 4.1 in modulating ankyrin binding to CD44.

Human erythrocyte protein 4.1 and ankyrin (ankyrin-R) were purified according to methods described by Tyler et al. (24Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W.R. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The other chymotryptic fragments of protein 4.1 (16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains) were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Waters 600E system, Milford, MA).

The 72-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD44 and the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 were produced as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins inEscherichia coli. cDNA encoding for the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (CD44cyt) was amplified from a cDNA library of human keratinocytes by polymerase chain reaction, using nucleotide primers designed from the published sequence (27Kugelman L.C.

The purified fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin. The r30kDa was purified further by affinity column chromatography using calmodulin-Sepharose CL-4B (12Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Peptides corresponding to the internal sequence of the CD44cyt (27Kugelman L.C. Ganguly S. Haggerty J.G. Weissman S.M. Milstone L.M. J. Invest.

Meienhofer J. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1978; 11: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC. Protein-protein interactions and protein-peptide interactions were studied using the resonant mirror detection method (30Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J.

Recombinant CD44cyt and the synthetic peptides were immobilized on the surface of aminosilane- and BSA-coated cuvettes, respectively. The rCD44cyt was immobilized to the aminosilane-coated cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. All experimental procedures were carried out at 25 °C with constant stirring. In brief, an aminosilane-coated cuvette was washed with 0.2 ml of distilled water followed by activation with 0.2 ml of 2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl suberate) for 20 min. After extensive washing of the cuvette to remove unreactedbis(sulfosuccinimidyl suberate), 0.1 ml of rCD44cyt in 0.1 mg/ml in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl) was added to the cuvette and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. After washing with PBS, 2 mg/ml BSA was added to the cuvette to reduce nonspecific binding. The synthetic peptides were immobilized onto the cuvette surface through BSA. In brief, 0.1 ml of BSA (2 mg/ml in PBS) was added to thebis(sulfosuccinimidyl suberate)-activated aminosilane-coated cuvette and incubated for 20 min. After washing with PBS, the cuvette was rinsed three times with 20 mm HCl. After PBS washings, surface-bound BSA was activated with 200 mm EDAC and 58 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide for 10 min. Synthetic peptides in PBS (1 mg/ml) were reacted with activated BSA by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C. After the reaction, the cuvettes were washed with PBS, and the unoccupied sites on the surface were blocked with 1m ethanolamine. Cuvetts with immobilized glutathioneS-transferase alone or BSA alone were prepared to serve as negative controls for the binding studies. All the binding assays were carried out in 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.2, buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl except for those assessing calmodulin effects on binding. To determine calmodulin effects, r30kDa was preincubated with 2 μm calmodulin in 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.2, buffer containing 0.1m NaCl (buffer A) and either 0.1 mm EGTA or 1.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm EGTA at 25 °C for 30 min. The same buffers were also used during the binding assay to evaluate calmodulin effects. The binding of protein “B” from solution to protein “A” immobilized on the cuvette surface was monitored by measuring resonant mirror response in arc seconds in the IAsysTM system. The time-dependent changes in arc seconds provided information concerning real-time changes in surface concentration of protein complexes formed on the sensor surface (30Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 347-353Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 31Watts H.J. Lowe C.R. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The resulting binding curve (arc seconds versustime) was analyzed using the software package FASTfitTM(Affinity Sensors). The rate of formation of the protein complex [AB] on the surface at different concentrations of protein B added to the cuvette is given by dR/dt=ka[B]Rmax−(ka[B]+kd)RtEquation 1 where [B] is the concentration of protein B used in deriving the binding curve, Rt is the response in arc seconds at time t, R max is the maximum value of R at saturating concentrations of protein B, and ka andkd are association and dissociation rate constants, respectively. Furthermore, the association of protein B with immobilized protein A can be described by the following pseudo-first order equation, Rt=R0+Rmax(1−e−kont)Equation 2 where R 0 is the initial response andk on is given by Equation 3. kon=ka[B]+kdEquation 3 Using the above described relationships, the FASTfitTM program uses an iterative curve fitting procedure to derive values for k on as a function of [B] which best fit the arc seconds versus time binding data recorded at varying concentrations of protein B. Based on the relationship outlined in Equation 3, the slope of the plot ofk on versus [B] provides the value for ka , and the intercept provides the value for kd (32George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant from this form of kinetic analysis (termedK ( D )kin) is then calculated as shown in Equation 4. K(D)kin=kd/kaEquation 4 Dissociation rate constants can also be derived by measuring the loss of signal (arc seconds) as a function of time immediately after the replacement of the binding buffer containing protein B with a protein-free solution. The FASTfitTM program is then used to derive the value of kd by deriving the best fit of the dissociation curve data to the relationship Rt=Rmaxe−kdtEquation 5 (32George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For self-consistency, the values ofkd derived from these two different approaches must be very similar, and this criterion was met by all of the binding studies reported here. Dissociation constant by Scatchard analysis (termedK ( D) Scat) were also derived from the binding data. The maximal extent of binding (R eq) at various concentrations of [B] was derived from binding curves. Because KA(Rmax−Req)=Req/[B]Equation 6 the slope of the plot of R eq versus R eq/[B] provides the value of −K a .K ( D )Scat is then calculated as shown in Equation 7. K(D)Scat=1/−KAEquation 7 In the present study theK ( D )Scatderived under a variety of experimental conditions closely matched the correspondingK ( D)kinvalues calculated. At least two cuvettes were used to determine various binding constants, and the derived values differed by less than 10% between the two measurements. The cuvettes were reused after cleaning with HCl. Original binding curves could be replicated after HCl washes, implying that the washing procedure used did not denature the bound ligands. Human epidermal keratinocytes at passage 2 were grown on coverslips in KGM medium containing 0.15 mm Ca2+ until ∼50% confluence and then shifted to KGM medium containing 1.85 mm Ca2+for 24 h. Cell samples were rinsed twice in PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3.5% formaldehyde, permeabilized further with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and then rinsed twice in PBS. Alternatively, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 5 min. After incubation in PBS with 10% goat serum and 10 mg/ml BSA to block nonspecific protein binding, fixed cells were incubated with 5–10 μg/ml primary antibodies against protein 4.1 and 3 μg/ml anti-CD44 for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA, washed, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were washed again and the coverslips mounted on slides using Vectashield containing DAPI to stain nuclei. Controls with equivalent amounts of nonimmune IgG or with primary antibody omitted were also included in each experiment. Immunofluorescent cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a 63X, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens. The ability of the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (CD44cyt) and various synthetic peptides from the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1) to bind to either protein 4.1 or its 30-kDa domain at physiologic ionic strength was determined using the IAsysTM system. After the addition of protein 4.1 to rCD44cyt immobilized on the cuvette, the binding response (detected by the resonant mirror detection system in arc seconds) increased, reaching a plateau after 3.5 min (Fig.2 A). After washing the cuvette with protein-free buffer, the binding response signal decreased to a new plateau value that was significantly higher than base line, implying that a specific interaction had occurred between protein 4.1 and rCD44cyt. A similar binding response was observed after the addition of either the native or recombinant 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to rCD44cyt (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, heat-denatured r30kDa (5 min at 100 °C) did not bind to CD44 (data not shown). The other functional domains of protein 4.1 (16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains) also did not bind to CD44 (data not shown). Furthermore, protein 4.1 and r30kDa did not bind to either glutathioneS-transferase or BSA (data not shown). These data imply that protein 4.1 binds to CD44 through its 30-kDa domain. Analysis of the binding response curves obtained at varying concentrations of protein 4.1 and r30kDa provided kinetic rate constants for association and dissociation of these proteins from CD44 (TableI). Protein 4.1 and r30kDa bound to the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 withK ( D )kin andK ( D )Scatvalues on the order of 10−7m (Table I).Table IProtein 4.1 and r30kDa binding to CD44PeptidesProteink ak dK ( D )kinK ( D )Scatm −1 s −1s −1mmrCD44cyt4.11.04 ± 0.11 × 1053.07 ± 0.03 × 10−22.95 × 10−72.49 × 10−7 r30kDa3.03 ± 0.04 × 1041.10 ± 0.02 × 10−23.63 × 10−73.65 × 10−7CD44-(1+2) 4.19.71 ± 0.10 × 1041.00 ± 0.01 × 10−21.03 × 10−71.16 × 10−7 r30kDa3.82 ± 0.02 × 1042.10 ± 0.02 × 10−25.50 × 10−73.62 × 10−7CD44–14.19.35 ± 0.09 × 1041.01 ± 0.06 × 10−21.08 × 10−71.10 × 10−7 r30kDa5.62 ± 0.29 × 1041.62 ± 0.02 × 10−22.88 × 10−71.22 × 10−7CD44–2 4.1No bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo binding r30kDaNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingCD44–3 4.1No bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo binding r30kDaNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingCD44–4 4.1No bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo binding r30kDaNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingCD44–5 4.1No bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo binding r30kDaNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingFrom the binding curves obtained by resonant mirror detection method,k a , k d ,K ( D )kin, andK ( D )Scat were determined using the software package FASTfit™ (see “Methods”). Open table in a new tab From the binding curves obtained by resonant mirror detection method,k a , k d ,K ( D )kin, andK ( D )Scat were determined using the software package FASTfit™ (see “Methods”). Binding of the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to various synthetic peptides from the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (Fig. 1) was quantitated to define the protein 4.1 binding domain of CD44. r30kDa bound to immobilized peptides CD44-(1+2) and CD44-1 from the cytoplasmic domain of CD44.K ( D )kin andK ( D )Scatvalues were once again on the order of 10−7m(Table I). However, no binding occurred between the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 and synthetic peptides CD44-2, CD44-3, CD44-4, and CD44-5 (Table I). These findings, along with the observation that the synthetic peptide CD44-1 binds to protein 4.1 with a binding affinity similar to that of the entire cytoplasmic domain, imply that the sequence motif NSRRRCGQKKKLVI is critical for binding of CD44 to protein 4.1. To define the minimal peptide sequence involved in CD44 binding to protein 4.1, the binding capacity of four overlapping peptides spanning the CD44-1 sequence was determined. Each overlapping peptide was composed of seven amino acids. r30kDa bound to peptides CD44-1a (N628SRRRCG) and CD44-1c (Q635KKKLVI) with aK ( D )kin of 2.75 × 10−7m(ka = 2.69 × 104m−1 s−1,kd = 0.74 × 10−2s−1), and 3.03 × 10−7m(ka = 3.04 × 104m−1 s−1,kd = 0.92 × 10−2s−1), respectively. These values were similar to the value obtained with the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (Table I). On the other hand, r30kDa bound to peptides CD44-1b (R631RCGQKK) and CD44-1d (K637KLVINS) with much lower affinities,K ( D )kinvalues of 1.03 × 10−6m and 5.26 × 10−6m, respectively. Taken together these data imply that the basic amino acid clusters RRR and KKK in the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 are involved in high affinity interactions with protein 4.1. To document potential interaction between CD44 and protein 4.1 in native cell membranes, the relative localization of both these protein components in keratinocyte membranes was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies specific for CD44 and protein 4.1. Epitopes for protein 4.1 (green), detected using two different antibodies, were found in the interior of the cell as well as at the peripheral cell membrane (Fig.3). CD44 epitopes (red) localized exclusively at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). Theyellow coloration produced in areas where red andgreen signals coincide was a prominent feature of the plasma membrane, indicating colocalization of CD44 and protein 4.1 in the plasma membrane of keratinocytes. Samples with nonimmune IgG (Fig. 3) or with primary antibody omitted showed no fluorescent patterns. To determine if CD44-protein 4.1 interaction can be regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin, we quantitated the binding of the synthetic peptide CD44-(1+2) to r30kDa in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (TableII). Either 2 μm calmodulin or 100 μm Ca2+ alone had no effect on either the association or dissociation rate constants of interaction between r30kDa and CD44-(1+2) (Table II). However, in the presence of both Ca2+ and calmodulin, there was a 16-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant (kd ), with little or no effect on the association rate constant (ka ) (Table II). These changes were reflected by a 16-fold increase in theK ( D )kin value for the interaction between r30kDa and CD44-(1+2) in the presence of both Ca2+ and calmodulin. Similar effects of Ca2+ and calmodulin were seen when intact protein 4.1 was used in the binding studies (data not shown). These data imply that Ca2+-calmodulin binding to protein 4.1 can accelerate the dissociation of protein 4.1 from CD44.Table IIEffect of Calmodulin on r30kDa binding to CD44-(1+2)ConditionCalmodulink ak dK ( D )kinK ( D )Scatm −1 s −1s −1mmEGTA−5.62 ± 0.04 × 1041.61 ± 0.05 × 10−22.86 × 10−72.35 × 10−7+5.03 ± 0.05 × 1041.74 ± 0.05 × 10−23.46 × 10−71.74 × 10−7Ca2+−6.62 ± 0.04 × 1041.59 ± 0.02 × 10−22.40 × 10−72.74 × 10−7+5.13 ± 0.02 × 1042.03 ± 0.01 × 10−13.96 × 10−64.45 × 10−6K ( D ) of r30kDa for CD44-(1+2) in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin is shown.

These results indicate that one level of functional specificity between the mismatch repair and meiotic crossover MutS homologs in yeast is provided by the ability to form distinct hetero-oligomers. Much attention has been focused in recent years on the MutS family of proteins whose role in mismatch repair has been implicated in preventing the development of human cancers (for review, see Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins from bacteria to humans result in higher mutation rates and increased genomic instability. In addition, mismatch repair proteins play a role in preventing recombination from occurring between highly diverged sequences. MutS family members typically exhibit 20–30% amino acid identity throughout the length of the protein with two more highly conserved subdomains, a putative NTP binding site and helix-turn-helix structural domain, in the COOH-terminal half. Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo analyses has demonstrated that in eukaryotes, MutS proteins function as heterodimers to recognize and bind mismatched DNA base pairs that result from errors in DNA replication or from recombination, for example (2Alani E.

Once the MutS homolog heterodimer is bound to the DNA, a second heterodimer comprised of MutL homologs is recruited to the mismatch (9Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D. Liskay R.M. Nature. 1994; 265: 1091-1093Google Scholar). In analogy to the MutS-MutL system in bacteria, an endonuclease is presumably activated to allow repair of the mismatch. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains six MutS homologs (for review, see Ref. 10Crouse G.F. Hoekstra M.F. Nickoloff J.A. Mismatch Repair Systems in S. cerevisiae. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997Google Scholar). Five of these genes (MSH2–6) encode proteins that act on nuclear DNA, whereas one, MSH1, is required for stability of the mitochondrial genome (11Chi N.-W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the nuclear MutS homologs, three function to repair mismatches in both vegetatively growing and meiotic cells (10Crouse G.F. Hoekstra M.F. Nickoloff J.A. Mismatch Repair Systems in S. cerevisiae. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997Google Scholar). Specificity of mismatch recognition has been shown to occur by the formation of distinct heterodimeric complexes. Msh2p interacts with Msh6p to recognize both single base pair mismatches as well as small loops formed by insertions or deletions in the DNA (2Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Modrich P. Jiricny J. Curr.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); in addition, Msh2p can complex with Msh3p to recognize insertion/deletion loops (4Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The Msh2p-Msh6p protein-protein interaction and mismatch binding specificity are independent of the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, suggesting that ATP may be required for downstream events such as recruitment of MutL homologs (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite being highly homologous to other members of the MutS protein family, the two remaining MutS homologs in yeast, MSH4 andMSH5, play no role in mismatch repair in either vegetative or meiotic cells. Instead their role is to facilitate crossovers between homologs to ensure that chromosomes segregate to opposite poles at the first meiotic division (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This second function for MutS homologs appears to be conserved through evolution as homologs of Msh4p and Msh5p have been found in both nematodes and mammals. 1N. M. Hollingsworth, unpublished observations. 1N. M. Hollingsworth, unpublished observations., 2R. Kolodner, personal communication. 2R. Kolodner, personal communication.Mutants in MSH4 and/or MSH5 display levels of meiotic crossing over and spore viability which are 30–50% of wild type. These phenotypes are observed even in homothallic diploids where no mismatches are present, underscoring the idea that Msh4p and Msh5p, unlike the other MutS family members, do not need to recognize base pair mismatches to perform their function. Instead it has been proposed that the ability to recognize aberrant DNA structures has been modulated in these proteins through evolution to recognize recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Because MSH4 and MSH5 function in a separate process from MSH2, 3, and 6, the question exists as to whether Msh4p and Msh5p have any features in common with the mismatch repair MutS homologs. The finding thatmsh4 msh5 diploids exhibit the same level of spore viability as either single mutant (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) suggested that these two proteins might also function as heterodimers. The work presented here confirms that the Msh4 and Msh5 proteins interact, and it demonstrates as well that, similar to Msh2p-Msh6p, hetero-oligomerization between Msh4p and Msh5p can occur in the presence of mutations that presumably destroy the ability of Msh5p to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP. Finally, data are presented which show that protein-protein interactions between the mismatch repair and meiotic crossover classes of MutS proteins do not occur, indicating that at least one level of functional specificity between the two classes is regulated by who can form heterodimers with whom. The following S. cerevisiaestrains were used: NH141 MATα/MATa leu2/leu2 HIS4/his4 ura3/ura3 his3/HIS3 trp1/trp1 CAN1/can1 CYH2/cyh2 SPO13/spo13 ADE2/ade2; NH129, NH141 containingmsh5::URA3/msh5::URA3; YPP10, NH141 containing msh5::LEU2/msh5::LEU2; YPP10-66-1, YPP10 with TPIp-MSH5-3HA; L40 (18Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Isogenic diploids were derived by transformation (19Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the same haploid parents with the appropriate knockout fragment (msh5::URA3 (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar); msh5::LEU2, pCH2–6) followed by mating. YPP10 was transformed with pPAS66 linearized with XhoI to integrate TPIp-MSH5-3HAat URA3. Yeast media have been described (20Hollingsworth N.M. Johnson A.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCH2–6 contains LEU2 inserted into theBglII site of MSH5 in pNH181 (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Themsh5::LEU2 fragment is released by cutting withHindIII and SacI. The MSH5-3HA fusion gene under control of the TPIpromoter was constructed in several steps. First, a vector containing the TPI promoter and a multiple cloning site (pJAY-2) was created by digestion of pTiαO (21Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (provided by N. Dean) withSacI and religation. Then the MSH5 gene alone was placed downstream of the TPI promoter by cloning the 4.2-kilobase HpaI/HindIII MSH5fragment from pNH189 (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) into pJAY-2 cut first with EcoRI and blunt ended by T4 DNA polymerase and then HindIII to make pPAS29. To create a tagged allele of MSH5, aNotI site was first substituted for the stop codon inMSH5 by polymerase chain reaction. A polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the triple HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GAD, Gal4p activation domain. tag flanked byNotI sites was amplified using pGTEP (22Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) as a template, cut with NotI, and ligated in-frame to the end ofMSH5. A 200-base pair EcoRI/HindIII fragment containing this fusion was then substituted for the equivalent fragment in pPAS29 to generate pPAS66. pPAS65 (lexA-MSH4), pPAS58 (GAD-MSH4), pPAS64 (GAD-MSH5), and pPAS111 (GAD-MSH6) were made by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) to amplify the various genes. The resulting fragments were then ligated into either pBTM116 or pGAD424 (23Bartel P.L. Chien R. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Using the Two-hybrid System to Detect Protein-Protein Interactions. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (24Smith M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 423-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was used to introduce specific nucleotide changes in the MSH5 gene carried in pNH189. 1.2-kilobase BglII/EcoRI fragments containing the mutations were exchanged with the equivalent fragment in pPAS64 to generate pDW10 (GAD-msh5-G643D, A644V), pPAS122 (GAD-msh5-G821D), and pPAS127 (GAD-msh5-G648R). For complementation, the 1.2-kilobase BglII/EcoRI fragments were substituted in pPAS79, which carries the MSH5gene under its own promoter, to create pPAS135, pPAS136, and pPAS137, respectively. All three 1.2-kilobase fragments containing the mutations were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced during the mutagenesis (data not shown). pNH108 is described in Ref.25Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. 2μMSH4, pRDK371, and pORC15–268 were provided by P. Ross-MacDonald, D. Tishkoff, and T. Triolo, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described in Ref. 26Alani E. Chi N.-W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar using 100 ml of YPP10-66-1 carrying either pBTM116 or pPAS65 grown in SD-Trp to anA 600 of 0.8. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblots were probed using anti-lexA antibodies (CLONTECH) or the anti-HA 12CA5 ascites fluid (Babco). The presence of the antibody was detected using ECL (Amersham). Relevant plasmids were cotransformed into L40 selecting on SD-Trp,-Leu medium. The presence of the fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-lexA or anti-GAD antibodies (CLONTECH) (data not shown). To rule out potential artifacts created by polymerase chain reaction, several independent clones for each plasmid were tested. In addition, only fusion proteins that were known to give a positive signal in the two-hybrid system in combination with at least one other protein were used. Histidine prototrophy was assayed on SD-His plates, and β-galactosidase activity was monitored as described (25Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions between Msh4p and Msh5p were tested by two different methods. The first assay involved coimmunoprecipitation of Msh4p and Msh5p after ectopic expression in vegetative yeast cells. TheMSH4 gene was fused to the 3′-end of lexA under control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter, thereby allowing detection of lexA-Msh4p using anti-lexA antibodies. The MSH5gene was tagged by the addition of three HA epitopes at the end of theMSH5 coding sequence and integrated under control of theTPI promoter in amsh5::LEU2/msh5::LEU2 diploid to create YPP10-66-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Msh5-3HAp was observed using the 12CA5 antibody directed against the HA epitope. Both the lexA-MSH4 and the MSH5-3HA fusion genes under control of the heterologous promoters were able to complement the spore viability defect of msh4 and msh5 diploids, respectively (data not shown). Plasmids containing lexA alone (pBTM116) orlexA-MSH4 (pPAS65-2) were transformed into YPP10-66-1. Cell extracts derived from these strains were incubated with the 12CA5 antibody. The antibodies were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. When the immunoblots were probed with the anti-HA antibodies, the Msh5-3HA protein was found to precipitate with the beads (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and2). When the immunoprecipitates were probed with lexA antibodies, a band migrating with the expected molecular mass for lexA-Msh4p (123 kDa) was observed to coimmunoprecipitate (Fig.1 B, lane 6). This band is not seen when lexA alone is present (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), nor when the 12CA5 antibodies are omitted (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3and 5), suggesting a specific physical interaction between Msh4p and Msh5p. The second assay utilized the two-hybrid system, a genetic method for detecting protein-protein interactions that occur in vegetatively growing yeast cells (27Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This method utilizes a strain, L40, containing two reporter genes, lacZ and HIS3, which have lexA operator sites present in their promoters (18Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). When L40 is transformed with pPAS65-2, lexA-Msh4p is produced and presumably bound upstream of each reporter by virtue of the interaction between the lexA DNA binding domain and its binding sites. Introduction of the Gal4p activation domain (GAD) can result in activation of the reporter constructs when the Gadp is fused to a protein that interacts with lexA-Msh4p. Activation of HIS3 transcription makes the cells prototrophic for histidine, whereas activation of thelacZ gene can be observed using an enzymatic assay for β-galactosidase activity. The combination of lexA-MSH4 andGAD-MSH5 produces both histidine prototrophy (Fig.2) as well as substantial amounts of β-galactosidase activity (data not shown), indicating that lexA-Msh4p and Gad-Msh5p interact. This interaction is specific as no signal is observed when lex-MSH4 is combined either withGAD or with GAD fusions to HOP1,RED1537–827 , orORC15–268 (Fig. 2). LikeMSH4, HOP1 and RED1 encode meiosis-specific proteins that are localized on meiotic chromosomes inS. cerevisiae (17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 28Hollingsworth N.M. Goetsch L. Byers B.

ORC1 encodes part of a protein complex bound at origins of replication in yeast (30Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayshi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These fusions have all been observed to interact with other proteins in the two-hybrid system and therefore are known to function in this assay (25Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Triolo T. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 381: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The interaction between lexA-Msh4p and Gad-Msh5p is not being mediated by lexA, as no interaction is detected with thelexA and GAD-MSH5 combination (data not shown). A positive signal was obtained with the combination oflexA-MSH4 and GAD-MSH4, indicating that Msh4p can form homo-oligomers in vivo (Fig. 2). Whether the homo-oligomer has a function in the cell is unclear, however. The presence of MSH4 on a high copy number plasmid is unable to suppress the msh5 spore viability defect (data not shown). Furthermore, the msh4 phenotype is no more severe thanmsh5 (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), contrary to what one might expect if Msh4p homo-oligomers effect some function distinct from the Msh4p-Msh5p hetero-oligomer. Mutations in the NTP binding domain of both yeast MSH2 and bacterialMutS reduce ATPase activity and create noncomplementing alleles that are dominant negative when overexpressed in a wild type background (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Haber L.T. Walker G.C.

Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) further showed that changing a completely conserved glycine in the p-loop of the ATP binding domain of Msh2p to aspartic acid (position 693) does not affect the ability of Msh2p to interact with Msh6p, nor does it affect DNA mismatch binding specificity. To test whether mutations in the putative NTP binding domain of MSH5 have similar properties, two site-directed mutant alleles of MSH5 were generated.msh5-G648R substitutes an arginine for the glycine at position 648, which corresponds to glycine 693 in the p-loop of Msh2p (Fig. 3). The second allele,msh5-G643D, A644V, changes the absolutely conserved glycine at position 643 of the p-loop to aspartic acid as well as making a conservative change of alanine to valine at amino acid 644. Wu and Marinus (34Wu T.-H. Marinus G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown previously that mutation of the corresponding glycine in MutS (position 614) creates a nonfunctional allele. The mutant alleles were then either placed under theMSH5 promoter and assayed for complementation, or they were fused to GAD and assayed for their ability to interact withlexA-MSH4. The msh5-G643D, A644V, and msh5-G648R alleles were tested for complementation of the msh5 spore inviability defect by first transforming themsh5::URA3/msh5::URA3 diploid NH129 with the plasmids pPAS135 and pPAS137, respectively. The transformants were then sporulated and asci dissected to determine the fraction of viable spores. Both mutant alleles failed to complement and appear to be null (Table I). The msh5-G643D, A644V allele was also tested for a dominant negative effect in aMSH5/msh5 diploid, and no phenotype was observed (data not shown). This finding is most likely due to a failure to overexpress the mutant protein to a sufficient level.Table IComplementation analysis of site-directed msh5 allelesStrain/plasmidRelevant genotype% Spore viability (asci)NH129/YCplac1111-aIncludes data from NH129 dissected without vector.msh5:: URA340.1 (159)msh5::URA3NIH129/pPAS79msh5:: URA3/MSH580.8 (52)msh5::URA3NH129/pPAS135msh5:: URA3/msh5-G643D,A644V44.3 (75)msh5::URA3NH129/pPAS137msh5:: URA3/msh5-G648R49.3 (68)msh5::URA3NH129/pPAS36msh5:: URA3/msh5-G821D48.8 (71)msh5::URA3Transformants of NH129 with the appropriate plasmids were selected on SD−leu medium. Several transformants were patched onto SD−leu medium, grown overnight, and replica plated to spo plates to induce sporulation. Incubation was at 30 °C for 3 days. The resulting asci were dissected and incubated at 30 °C for several days to determine the fraction of spores able to form colonies.1-a Includes data from NH129 dissected without vector. Open table in a new tab Transformants of NH129 with the appropriate plasmids were selected on SD−leu medium. Several transformants were patched onto SD−leu medium, grown overnight, and replica plated to spo plates to induce sporulation. Incubation was at 30 °C for 3 days. The resulting asci were dissected and incubated at 30 °C for several days to determine the fraction of spores able to form colonies. Both GAD-msh5-G643D, A644V and GAD-msh5-G648Rinteract with lexA-MSH4 in the two-hybrid assay. ForGAD-msh5-G643D, A644V, the amount of both HIS3(as measured by colony size on SD−His medium) and lacZactivity observed was less than that found for GAD-MSH5(Fig. 4 A; data not shown), even though more of the mutant protein is made compared with Gad-Msh5p (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 1 and 3). The Gad-msh5-G648R protein interacted slightly less well than Gad-Msh5p, but in this case the difference may be because slightly less of the mutant protein was made (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Alani et al. (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) discovered that mutation of some of the amino acids in the helix-turn-helix domain of MSH2 gives phenotypes similar to those in the G693D mutation in the ATP binding domain. For example, substituting aspartic acid for the glycine at position 855 of Msh2p (Fig. 3 B) results in a protein that fails to complement a deletion of MSH2 and has reduced ATPase activity yet still interacts with Msh6p. This glycine is conserved in all of the yeast nuclear MutS homologs, as well as in MutS itself (Fig. 3 B). The corresponding glycine codon inMSH5 was therefore mutated to aspartic acid thereby creatingmsh5-G821D. This mutation creates a null allele ofMSH5 (Table I). In combination with lexA-MSH4, the GAD-msh5-G821D gene shows a wild type level of histidine prototrophy (Fig. 4 A) and β-galactosidase activity (data not shown) in the two-hybrid assay, indicating that these proteins interact. It therefore appears that, similar to the mismatch repair MutS proteins, ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential steps that occur downstream of hetero-oligomer formation in the meiotic crossover MutS homologs. Given the fact that all five nuclear MSH genes in S. cerevisiae are known to function during meiosis and that both sets of proteins function as hetero-oligomers, it was of interest to determine whether hetero-oligomers can form between the two functionally distinct classes. Msh2p and Msh6p have been shown previously to interact by coimmunoprecipitation (2Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We reconstituted this interaction in the two-hybrid system using a lexA-MSH2 plasmid andGAD-MSH6 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because the selectable marker on the lexA-MSH2 plasmid isHIS3, only activation of the lacZ reporter was assayed (Table II). Cross-combinations oflexA-MSH4 and GAD-MSH6, lexA-MSH2 andGAD-MSH4, and lexA-MSH2 and GAD-MSH5gave no activity even under conditions (long reaction time) where very weak interactions would be detected. These results indicate that at least one level of functional specificity of these proteins is mediated by hetero-oligomer formation.Table IITwo hybrid assays using mismatch repair and meiotic crossover MutS homologs in yeastPlasmidslex-AGAD-β-Galactosidase activitypPAS65/pGAD424MSH4——pPAS65/pPAS64MSH4MSH5+++pPAS65/pPAS111MSH4MSH6—pRDK371/pPAS111MSH2MSH6++pRDK371/pPAS58MSH2MSH4—pRDK371/pPAS58MSH2MSH4—L40 was transformed with the appropriate plasmids, and filter assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” —, no signal after 4 h at 30 °C; ++, blue color observed after 90 min at 30 °C; +++, blue color observed after 30 min at 30 °C.

Given the fact that the MutS-MutL system of mismatch repair is highly conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it was initially surprising to discover two MutS homologs in yeast, MSH4 andMSH5, which have no role in mismatch repair. Instead, these genes are required to facilitate reciprocal crossovers between homologous chromosomes (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), thereby providing the physical connection needed for proper meiosis I segregation (35Hawley R.S. Moens P.B. Exchange and Chromosomal Segregation in Eukaryotes. Academic Press, New York1987: 497-527Google Scholar). To resolve the apparent paradox between homology and function, it was proposed that Msh4p and Msh5p have evolved different DNA binding specificities so as to recognize recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions instead of mismatches (16Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Alternatively, given the recent evidence that the mismatch repair protein Msh2p can itself bind to Holliday junctions (36Hunter N. Borts R.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), Msh4p and Msh5p may recognize a similar set of substrates but act to recruit different downstream components. The assumption underlying both of these hypotheses is that the general features characteristic of eukaryotic mismatch repair MutS proteins are conserved with the meiotic crossover family members. The work presented here validates this assumption. The first of three general features of the mismatch repair MutS homologs is that the functional units are comprised of heterodimers. Genetic epistasis data comparing mutants of MSH2,MSH3, and MSH6 suggested the hypothesis that the Msh2 protein forms heterodimers with either Msh3p or Msh6p to recognize different types of mismatches (6Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7285-7288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Subsequently, heterodimerization between Msh2p and either Msh3p or Msh6p (as well as their mammalian counterparts) has been shown either by coimmunoprecipitation or copurification (2Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). One function of heterodimerization appears to be providing mismatch specificity to the DNA binding activity. This idea comes from the fact that the binding specificities of Msh2p alone compared with Msh2p complexed with Msh6p are different (2Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Alani E. Chi N.-W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and it is the Msh2p-Msh6p complex that exhibits high affinity for the substrates expected from in vivo studies. In addition, genetic and biochemical analyses of mutant msh2 proteins complexed with Msh6p provide strong evidence that the complex is required to determine substrate specificity (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two independent assays presented here, coimmunoprecipitation and two-hybrid analysis, indicate that Msh4p and Msh5p physically interact. Although the possibility exists that this interaction is being bridged by a third protein, it seems unlikely given that both assays used vegetatively growing cells, and MSH4 and MSH5 are usually only transcribed during meiosis (17Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). 4J. Engebrecht, personal communication. It has been shown recently that the Msh4 and Msh5 proteins colocalize at discrete foci on meiotic chromosomes, 5J. Novak and G. S. Roeder, personal communication. providing further evidence that these proteins function togetherin vivo. Although both the coimmunoprecipitation and two-hybrid assays indicate that Msh4p and Msh5p interact with each other in vivo, neither assay addresses the stoichiometry with which they interact. Based on analogy to the mismatch repair MutS proteins we assume that the hetero-oligomeric structure formed by Msh4p and Msh5p is a heterodimer, but this fact has not yet been demonstrated. The second general feature of the mismatch repair MutS homologs is that the ATP binding domain is essential for function. Mutagenesis of the p-loop of the ATP binding domain creates null alleles of theMutS genes in Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium, as well as the MSH2 gene of yeast (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Wu T.-H. Marinus G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When similar residues are changed inMSH5, function is lost without affecting the amount of msh5 protein in the cell. The p-loop mutations in S. typhimuriumand MSH2 were shown in vitro to decrease ATPase activity, and the assumption is that the same activity is what is affected in the msh5 mutants, but this remains to be tested. Interestingly, Alani et al. (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed that certain changes in the putative helix-turn-helix domain of MSH2 havein vivo and in vitro phenotypes similar to the p-loop mutations. Making the identical change in MSH5(G821D) as was made in MSH2 (G855D) creates a null allele of MSH5 as well. The third and final general feature is that mutations in the ATP binding domain do not affect hetero-oligomerization. Alani et al. (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) used coimmunoprecipitation and copurification to assay protein-protein interactions between Msh6p and various mutant Msh2 proteins. This work found that mutations in the p-loop and putative helix-turn-helix domains which reduced ATPase activity in vitro and created null alleles in vivo still allowed interaction with Msh6p. Using the two-hybrid system to analyzemsh5 mutants in these domains (G643D, A644V;G648R; G821D) a similar finding was obtained; that is, although these mutations created null alleles ofMSH5, there was little or no effect on the the ability of the mutant msh5 proteins to interact with Msh4p. This result suggests that, as with the Msh2p-Msh6p protein complex, ATP binding and hydrolysis are necessary for steps downstream of hetero-oligomerization such as creating a conformational change in the protein complex which allows other proteins to bind to the Msh4p-Msh5p complex (14Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Wu T.-H. Marinus G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that MLH1, an MutL homolog in yeast, is a good candidate for such a component (36Hunter N. Borts R.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The meiotic crossover MutS proteins therefore share many attributes in common with the mismatch repair proteins. Previous studies usingmsh2 mutants suggested that the mismatch repair machinery may affect the length of conversion tracts perhaps by preventing the extension of heteroduplex formation after a mismatch is recognized. Consistent with this idea, Msh2p has recently been shown to bind to Holliday junctions in vitro (37Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because Holliday junctions are a potential substrate proposed for Msh4 and Msh5, the authors speculated that Msh2 may interact with Msh4 and/or Msh5 “resulting in the formation of complexes that have different abilities to recognize structural features of recombination intermediates and/or have altered abilities to interact with different recombination pathways.” The experiments presented here indicate that such cross-hetero-oligomerization does not occur. The Msh2p-Msh6p interaction observed by others using biochemical techniques was reproduced using the two-hybrid system. It was therefore possible to make different combinations of mismatch repair and meiotic crossover MutS homologs and ask whether proteins from different functional classes could form a complex. No hetero-oligomerization was observed between Msh2p and either Msh4p or Msh5p; nor were any protein-protein interactions detected between Msh6p and Msh4p. Therefore, the functional specificity observed between the two classes of MutS homologs is due in part to the specificity of hetero-oligomerization. An interesting question that remains to be answered is how the different types of hetero-oligomers mediate their functions. Does the Msh4p-Msh5p complex recognize different substrates compared with the mismatch repair MutS proteins (which seems likely), and/or does it recruit a different set of proteins to the DNA once bound? Understanding these differences may provide important insights into how similar DNA-binding proteins can evolve to perform different types of functions in a cell.

Prenyl peptides bind to purified tubulin with a K d of 40 nm and also bind to tubulin polymerized into microtubules. Microtubule affinity chromatography of extracts from cells in which the prenyl protein pool was metabolically labeled revealed that prenyl proteins bound to the immobilized microtubules; one, a 24-kDa protein, was tentatively identified as a GTP-binding protein. Of several prenylated GTP-binding proteins tested, including Ki-Ras4B, Ha-Ras, RhoB, RhoA, and Rap1B, only Ki-Ras was found to bind significantly to microtubules, and this was in a prenylation-dependent fashion. A potential significance of the interaction of Ki-Ras4B with microtubules was indicated from analysis of the localization of newly synthesized Ki-Ras4B and Ha-Ras, each tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFP). Treatment of NIH-3T3 cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras with Taxol (paclitaxel) resulted in accumulation of the expressed protein in intracellular locations, whereas in control cells the protein was correctly targeted to the plasma membrane. Importantly, such treatment with paclitaxel did not affect the cellular localization of expressed GFP-Ha-Ras. These results indicate that an intact microtubule network may be directly involved in Ki-Ras processing and/or targeting and provide direct evidence for a physiological distinction between Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras in cells.

Post-translational addition of isoprenoid lipids via a process termed prenylation is important in the maturation of many proteins that play critical roles in signal transduction and cell growth regulation. In many cases, a requirement for the attached isoprenoid for correct cellular localization and function has been demonstrated (for reviews, see Refs. 1Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 3Der C.J. Cox A.D. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). Most prenylation events involve addition of either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid to a conserved Cys residue in a C-terminal sequence termed a “CAAX motif.” The X residue of the CAAX motif generally specifies which isoprenoid is to be attached to the protein by one of two cytosolic protein prenyltransferases, designated protein farnesyltransferase and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (4Casey P.J.

The addition of the isoprenoid lipid is followed by the proteolytic removal of the three C-terminal amino acids (the AAX) and methylation of the now C-terminal prenylated Cys residue in a process generally thought to occur in the microsomal membrane compartment of cells (7Jang G.F.

In addition to this sequence of protein modifications, many prenyl proteins contain either an upstream polybasic region or an attached palmitoyl lipid near the C terminus that influences membrane binding (11Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 12Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Several studies implicate prenylated proteins in regulation of cytoskeletal events. Two members of the Ras superfamily of G proteins, Rap1B and Rap1A, associate with the cytoskeleton during agonist-stimulated platelet activation (13Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White G.C. II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The related proteins Rac and Rho are thought to be important regulators of actin filament organization. Evidence to support this hypothesis comes primarily from studies demonstrating that Rac and Rho, respectively, are involved in regulation of growth factor-induced membrane ruffling and assembly of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells (15Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar, 16Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). Rac1 has also been found to associate with tubulin in the GTP-bound form, but the physiological significance is unknown (17Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The role of prenylation in these processes and interactions is unclear; however, association of RHO1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae equivalent of the mammalian RhoA, with cortical actin patches requires that it be prenylated for this function (18Yamochi W. Tanaka K. Nonaka H. Maeda A. Musha T. Takai Y. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1077-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There is also precedence in the literature for involvement of prenylated proteins in microtubule-dependent processes. For example, morphological changes induced by oncogenic Ras transformation can be profoundly influenced by vinca alkaloids, which promote microtubule breakdown, and Taxol (paclitaxel), which promotes formation of short bundled microtubules (19Gloushankova N.A. Lyubimova A.V. Tint I.S. Feder H.H. Vasilev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Pharmacol.

In one of these studies, epithelial cells transformed with oncogenic N-Ras exhibited a distinct polarized cell morphology that was abolished by treatment of the cells with either colcemid or paclitaxel (19Gloushankova N.A. Lyubimova A.V. Tint I.S. Feder H.H. Vasilev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for an interaction between prenylated proteins and cellular processes involving microtubules comes from studies using hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. These inhibitors, such as lovastatin and compactin, ultimately inhibit the synthesis of prenylated proteins and produce distinct changes in cell morphology (22Endo A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1569-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schmidt R.A. Glomset J.A. Wight T.N. Habenicht A.J. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In one study, the appearance of the morphological changes in epithelial cells induced by compactin was found to coincide with the retraction of the microtubules from the submembrane regions (24Bifulco M. Laezza C. Aloj S.M. Garbi C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with colchicine to depolymerize the microtubules before treatment with compactin prevented these changes, suggesting that intact microtubules were necessary for the compactin-induced morphological changes observed (24Bifulco M. Laezza C. Aloj S.M. Garbi C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is now established that mature prenylated proteins are associated with many different membrane compartments in cells, including plasma and intracellular membranes, and the cytoskeleton (12Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 25Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 26James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Acta. 1994; 1199: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, little information is available on how newly prenylated proteins are directed from the cytosol to sites for subsequent processing and, ultimately, to their final destination, and it seems likely that additional factors must be involved in the correct targeting of these proteins. In attempts to identify factors involved in this process, we initiated a search for proteins that bind prenylated peptides encompassing the C termini of known prenylated proteins. This ligand binding approach resulted in the identification of a specific binding site in a microsomal membrane fraction that recognized both farnesyl- and geranylgeranyl-modified peptides (28Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties and specificity of this binding site were consistent with those expected for a molecule involved in targeting newly prenylated proteins to the subcellular compartment where their processing is completed. We have now extended those analysis to a molecular identification of the binding protein. Surprisingly, the major cellular protein identified that specifically binds a prenylated peptide was the microtubule protein tubulin, which comprises a significant part of the cell's cytoskeletal structure. A variety of experimental approaches indicate a physiological significance for the association of a specific prenylated protein, that being Ki-Ras4B with microtubules. The relationship between these findings and specific microtubule-dependent processes and prenyl protein trafficking is discussed.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were centrifuged first at 16,900 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to collect plasma membranes and then at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosolic (supernatant) and microsomal membrane (pellet) fractions. Membrane fractions were resuspended at protein concentrations of 1–2 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Buffer A) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (29Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both the cytosolic and membrane fractions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use (28Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide corresponding essentially to the C terminus of a major G protein γ subunit (sequence: REKKFFCAIM) was enzymatically prenylated using [3H]FPP (15–22.5 Ci/mmol) and purified protein farnesyltransferase (28Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture contained 400 pmol of the peptide, 200 pmol of [3H]FPP, and 200 units of enzyme in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, and 2 mm DTT (4Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated with enzyme and incubated 20 min at 37 °C, whereupon octylglucoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (to stabilize the prenylated peptide) and the reaction allowed to continue for an additional 60 min. The 3H-farnesylated peptide product was purified on a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (Phenomenex), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until use. All GTP-binding proteins were produced in Escherichia coli. Ha-Ras and RhoB were purified as described (4Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and glutathioneS-transferase-RhoA was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturers, and (His)6-Ki-Ras and and (His)6-Rap1B were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer. Each GTP-binding protein was enzymatically prenylated by the appropriate isoprenoid as described previously (4Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Two different methods were used to chemically prenylate peptides used in this study. The first method provides a yield of ∼30–50% of the prenyl peptide product and was used in the initial part of this study, whereas the second method results in >90% product formation and was used in the latter part of this work. In the first method, peptides were chemically prenylated essentially as described (30Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16248-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Robert Deschenes (University of Iowa). 2R. Deschenes, personal communication. Briefly, 0.9 mg of peptide was dissolved in 1.26 ml of H2O:acetonitrile (1:5) on ice, followed by the addition of 210 μl of 0.5 mNaHCO3. The solution was placed under argon, and the prenylation reaction initiated by addition of farnesyl bromide in Me2SO (1.2 mol of farnesyl bromide/mol of peptide). The reaction was stirred at 4 °C for 3–4 h, and the product was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The second method involved dissolving the peptide and farnesyl bromide at a 1:1 molar ratio in methanol containing 4 m ammonia (31Brown M.J. Milano P.D. Lever D.C. Epstein W.W. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2176-3177Google Scholar). After a 3-h incubation at 4 °C, the reaction was dried under vacuum and the product purified by HPLC. Chemical cross-linking analysis was performed essentially as described (32Thissen J.A. Barrett M.G. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brain microsomal membranes or cytosol (each at 12 μg of protein) were incubated with 120–133 nm3H-labeled prenyl peptide in 150 μl of Buffer A plus 0.05% Triton X-100. After a 20-min incubation at 24 °C, BS3 cross-linking reagent was added to the indicated concentration, the incubation continued for 2 min, and the reaction quenched by the addition of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0. Protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at 15% final concentration, and the precipitated protein containing the chemically cross-linked prenylated peptide-protein complex was collected by microcentrifugation and washed with ice-cold acetone. Precipitated proteins were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), and the resulting gels processed for fluorographic analysis as described (32Thissen J.A. Barrett M.G. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A 50-nmol amount of either the farnesylated peptide or the corresponding unprenylated peptide was dissolved 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 50% dimethylformamide. To this was added 0.3 mg of activated CH-Sepharose 4B, which had been prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation with mixing at 4 °C. The resin was then poured into a 2-ml column and extensively washed using alternating pH buffers as described by the manufacturer. The column was stored in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 500 mmNaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.025% NaN3 at 4 °C until use. Tubulin was purified from extracts of freshly isolated porcine brain essentially as described (34Simon J.R. Adam N.A. Salmon E.D. Micron. Microsc. Acta. 1991; 22: 405-412Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, a porcine brain (∼220 g) was homogenized at a ratio of 0.5 ml of buffer/g of brain tissue in 100 mmPipes, pH 6.9, containing 2 mm EGTA and 1 mmMgSO4 (PEM buffer), which also contained 1 mmATP and the protease inhibitors noted above. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove membranes and organelles, and the supernatant diluted 1:1 with PEM buffer containing 60% glycerol and 0.2 mm GTP. After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C to polymerize tubulin, microtubules were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 29 °C. The pellet containing the microtubules was then processed through a second depolymerization-polymerization by cycling between 4 °C and 37 °C. The two-cycle purified tubulin was then purified to >99% homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography as described (35Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified tubulin was stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Purified tubulin (50 ng) was incubated with 3H-farnesylated peptide (8–600 nm) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% octylglucoside (Buffer B) in a volume of 50 μl. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, samples were applied to a column containing 1 ml of Sephadex G-50 and washed with 0.5-ml aliquots of Buffer B. Tubulin-bound 3H-farnesylated peptide eluted in the void fraction and was detected by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Specific binding was determined by the difference between 3H-farnesylated peptide bound to tubulin in the absence and presence of 2 μm unlabeled prenyl peptide. Microtubule affinity columns were constructed essentially as described (36Kellog D.R. Field C.M. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2977-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, tubulin (2–3 mg/ml) in 80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3EGTA was assembled into microtubules by adding 1 mm GTP, followed by the stepwise addition of paclitaxel. Immediately before applying the sample to the activated resin, the pH of the solution containing the paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules was adjusted to 7.6 with 3 m KOH and a volume of the paclitaxel-stabilized microtubule solution equivalent to one-half of the resin volume added to the resin. The mixture was left undisturbed overnight at 4 °C to allow coupling, and then washed with several column volumes of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 (Buffer C), containing 10 mm ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. The resin was then washed exhaustively with Buffer C containing 1 mm DTT and 500 mm KCl. Typical tubulin concentration obtained on the column was 6–9 μm. The column was stored at 4 °C in the assembly buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 5 μm paclitaxel, 0.02% sodium azide, and protease inhibitors. Stock cultures of the met18b-2 variant of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (37Faust J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine and supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (supplemented Ham's F-12 medium) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at 3 × 105cells/100-mm dish and grown to about 70% confluence. In preparation for [3H]mevalonic acid labeling, cells were incubated in 5 ml of supplemented F-12 medium containing 30 μmlovastatin for 60–90 min at 37 °C. After this treatment, the medium was replaced by 5 ml of supplemented F-12 medium containing 250 μCi of [3H]mevalonolactone and 20 μm lovastatin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cell were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman into Buffer C containing protease inhibitors and either used immediately or flash-frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C until use. Stock cultures of NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Sciences, Inc.), 1 mml-glutamine and 10 mg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For use in microtubule affinity chromatography analysis, cells were lysed by the addition of Triton X-100 to 1% and NaCl to 250 mm, followed by homogenization on ice for 30 min and then centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted 5-fold with Buffer C to reduce the detergent and NaCl, immediately applied to a microtubule affinity column equilibrated with Buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.05% Nonidet-40, and chromatographed as described in the figure legends. Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, RhoA, RhoA, and Rap1B proteins were enzymatically prenylated with [3H]prenyldiphosphates as described above. Initially, 3H-farnesylated Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras were produced and chromatographed through a microtubule affinity column as described above for the [3H]MVA-labeled CHO cell extracts, except that 1 mg of cytochrome c was added to the Ras sample as a carrier protein. In later analysis, the3H-prenylated proteins were incubated with 100 μl (bed volume) of the microtubule affinity resin, prepared as described above, for 30 min at room temperature in Buffer C containing 50 mmNaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. After the incubation, samples were centrifuged 4 min at 4 °C and washed twice with Buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. The washed resin was then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE/fluorography as described below. Most electrophoresis was performed essentially according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separation of the α and β subunits of tubulin was performed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel polymerized in the presence of 8m urea (38Eipper B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Several different antibodies directed against tubulin were used in immunoblot analysis. These included an α tubulin-directed monoclonal antibody from ICN, a polyclonal antibody directed against residues 428–437 of the β subunit (a gift from M. Rasenick (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL), and two polyclonal antiserum directed against C-terminal sequences (both gifts from G. Gundersen, Columbia University, New York, NY; Ref. 39Gundersen G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C. Cell. 1984; 38: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected using the alkaline phosphatase method (Promega). Immunoblot analysis of Ras proteins was performed using monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). GTP binding was determined by an overlay assay on nitrocellulose essentially as described (40Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blot was first washed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 50 μm MgCl2 and 0.3% Tween 20 (Buffer D) for 5 min. The washed blot was then incubated in Buffer D containing 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP and 10 μm ATP for 2–3 h. After the incubation, the blot was washed six times for 10 min each in Buffer D containing 5 mm MgCl2, dried, and exposed to Fuji RX film with an intensifying screen. Isoprenoids attached to proteins were determined by HPLC analysis of the methyl iodide cleavage product essentially as described (41Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 42Farnsworth C.C. Casey P.J. Howald W.N. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H.

Briefly, samples containing3H-labeled prenyl proteins were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated proteins were washed extensively with ice-cold acetone. The acetone-washed pellets were then subjected to trypsin digestion, followed by methyl iodide cleavage. Released 3H-labeled isoprenoids were then extracted and resolved by C18 reverse-phase HPLC. Ki-Ras4B was cloned into vector pHIROI byBamHI sites to obtain the resulting GFP-Ki-Ras fusion construct (43Yokoe H. Meyer T. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Ha-Ras was cloned into vector pHIRO2 byBamHI and XbaI cloning sites. pHIRO2 was constructed using pHIRO1 as a template by introducing a S65T mutation by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The orientation of Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras and the integrity of the reading frame were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of the GFP-Ras fusion constructs.In vitro transcription and RNA processing of these fusion constructs were performed according to the procedure described in Ref.43Yokoe H.

https://openalex.org/W2091885719,"The integrin beta4 has a long cytodomain necessary for hemidesmosome formation. A yeast two-hybrid screen using beta4 cytodomain uncovered a protein called p27(BBP) that represents a beta4 interactor. Both in yeast and in vitro, p27(BBP) binds the two NH2-terminal fibronectin type III modules of beta4, a region required for signaling and hemidesmosome formation. Sequence analysis of p27(BBP) revealed that p27(BBP) was not previously known and has no homology with any isolated mammalian protein, but 85% identical to a yeast gene product of unknown function. Expression studies by Northern analysis and in situ hybridization showed that, in vivo, p27(BBP) mRNA is highly expressed in epithelia and proliferating embryonic epithelial cells. An antibody raised against p27(BBP) COOH-terminal domain showed that all beta4-containing epithelial cell lines expressed p27(BBP). The p27(BBP) protein is insoluble and present in the intermediate filament pool. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation indicated the presence of p27(BBP) both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Confocal analysis of cultured cells showed that part of p27(BBP) immunoreactivity was both nuclear and in the membrane closely apposed to beta4. These results suggest that the p27(BBP) is an in vivo interactor of beta4, possibly linking beta4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2161573035,"We have recently reported (1) that two naturally occurring mutants of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain, Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu (Gln-1174 and Leu1178, respectively), both found in patients with inherited severe insulin resistance, markedly impaired receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation, with both mutant receptors being unable to mediate the stimulation of glycogen synthesis or mitogenesis by insulin when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, these mutations did not fully prevent IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to insulin in these cells, suggesting that IRS-1 alone may not be sufficient to mediate insulin's metabolic and mitogenic effects. In the present study, we have demonstrated that these mutations also impair the ability of the insulin receptor to activate the transcription factor Elk-1 and promote GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Although at low concentrations of insulin, the mutant receptors were impaired in their ability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, at higher insulin concentrations we confirmed that the cells expressing the mutant receptors showed significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with parental nontransfected cells. In addition, at comparable insulin concentrations, the association of the p85α subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) with IRS-1 and the enzymatic activity of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase were significantly enhanced in cells expressing the mutant receptors. In contrast, no significant stimulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, GTP loading of Ras, or mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was seen in cell lines expressing these mutant receptors. Thus, no activation of any measurable mitogenic or metabolic response was detectable, despite significant insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PI3-kinase in cells stably expressing the mutant insulin receptors. These findings suggest that PI3-kinase activation alone may be insufficient to mediate a wide range of the metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin. Additionally, the data provide support for the notion that insulin activation of Ras is more closely linked with Shc, and not IRS-1, phosphorylation.

Additionally, the data provide support for the notion that insulin activation of Ras is more closely linked with Shc, and not IRS-1, phosphorylation. Mutations of the insulin receptor gene have been identified in patients with a wide variety of genetic syndromes of severe insulin resistance (for reviews see Refs. 2Taylor S.I. Cama A. Accili D. Barbetti F. Quon M.J. de al Luz Sierra M. Suzuki Y. Koller E. Levy-Telodano R. Wertheimer E. Moncado V.Y. Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Endocr.

Balliere Tindal, London1996: 97-122Google Scholar). Studies of the functional properties of these mutant insulin receptors have contributed to the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in insulin signaling. The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric receptor tyrosine kinase composed of two extracellular α subunits and two β subunits. Insulin binds to the α subunit of the receptor, an event which activates the tyrosine kinase function of the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit. This results in autophosphorylation of the β subunit of the receptor itself as well as the phosphorylation of a number of cytoplasmic target proteins that include IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc (for review see Ref. 4Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules are involved in the coupling of the insulin receptor to downstream metabolic and mitogenic events. Thus, the phosphorylation of IRS-1 generates a number of recognition sites for interaction with SH2 domain-containing molecules, including the lipid kinase PI3-kinase, the phosphatase SHP-2, and the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Nck. The phosphorylation of Shc also facilitates its interaction with the SH2 domain of Grb2. Grb2, in tight association with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, is closely involved with insulin stimulation of Ras activation (5Medema R.H. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van der Zon G.C.M. Maassen A.J. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence exists to support the hypothesis that the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is an essential first step for most, if not all, of the biological effects of insulin (6Murakami M.S. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22653-22660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhang B. Tavaré J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mutant insulin receptors where the ATP binding site has been altered by site-directed mutagenesis or naturally occurring insulin receptor mutations abolishing receptor tyrosine kinase activity fail to mediate any biological effects of insulin when expressed in transfected cells (8Ebina Y. Araki E. Taira M. Shimada F. Mori M. Craig C.S. Siddle K. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 9McClain D.A. Maegawa H.

The importance of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the mediation of insulin's downstream effects has also been highlighted by several studies. Insulin receptors in which tyrosine 972 was replaced by phenylalanine were capable of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation but were markedly impaired in their interaction and phosphorylation of IRS-1 (10White M. Livingston J. Backer J. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cells expressing this mutant insulin receptor showed severely impaired insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis, thymidine incorporation, and amino acid uptake, suggesting that receptor autophosphorylationper se might be less relevant to insulin signaling than the ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates (10White M. Livingston J. Backer J. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Further support for the importance of IRS-1 phosphorylation in mediating the insulin signal comes from studies of a truncated insulin receptor lacking the 82 C-terminal amino acids (Δ82) (13Yamamoto-Honda R. Kadowaki T. Momomura K. Tobe K. Tamori Y. Shibasaki Y. Mori Y. Kaburagi Y. Koshio O. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16859-16865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor displayed severely impaired autophosphorylation, whereas insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was unaffected. Despite this receptor-impaired ligand-induced autophosphorylation, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PI3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; IR, insulin receptor. cells expressing this mutant insulin receptor were able to mediate insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA as well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Furthermore, in 32D cells, which normally do not contain either the insulin receptor or IRS-1 or -2, insulin-responsive mitogenesis cannot be conferred by transfecting either the insulin receptor or IRS-1 but only by coexpressing both molecules (14Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although the targeted deletion of IRS-1 in mice is not lethal, −/− mice show significant impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and reduced size, despite the normal phosphorylation of IRS-2 and Shc (15Araki E.

Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These data provide further support for the central importance of IRS-1 phosphorylation in the mediation of insulin action. We have recently described two insulin receptor mutations, Gln-1174 and Leu-1178, found in patients with inherited forms of severe insulin resistance (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When stably expressed in CHO cells, these receptors showed severely impaired autophosphorylation and in vitrotyrosine kinase activity toward artificial substrates but retained the ability to phosphorylate IRS-1. In contrast to findings with the Δ82 receptor (see above), these receptors were also severely impaired in their ability to mediate both the metabolic (as measured by glycogen synthesis) and mitogenic (as measured by thymidine incorporation) effects of insulin. We now present further characterization of the signaling properties of these insulin receptors. These new studies provide evidence that insulin-stimulated PI3-kinase activity, although undoubtedly important for insulin action, may not in itself be sufficient to mediate the full metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin. They also provide supportive evidence that insulin activation of Ras may be more closely related to Shc rather than IRS-1 phosphorylation. Both mutations were identified in heterozygous form in adolescent females suffering from the Type A syndrome of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was inherited in a dominant fashion in both families and co-segregated with the mutation. The identification and initial characterization of both mutations has been described previously (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol.

Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Anti-IRS-1 and anti-Shc antibodies (polyclonal) were raised against GST fusion proteins containing IRS-1 amino acids 511–860 and Shc amino acids 366–473, respectively. A monoclonal anti-p85α antibody (U2) was a gift from Dr. Mike Waterfield (University College London, UK). Phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, and anti-Ras antibody Y13-259 was purchased from Oncogene Science. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (clone 4G10). CHO.K1 cells at ∼80% confluence in 12-mm dishes were transfected for 2 h with four plasmids: (i) pCMV.hIR, the wild-type IR or mutants thereof, under the control of the nonregulated CMV promoter, (ii) pGL3.G5E4D[Δ]38, the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, which possesses five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the plasmid pGL3 (Promega Corp.), (iii) pRL.CMV, Renilla luciferase under the control of the CMV promoter, and (iv) pSG424.Elk1 (83–428), fusion of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and Elk-1 activation domain. Transfections were performed using Tfx-50 (Promega Corp.) transfection reagent (2.2 μg of Tfx-50/μg of DNA in 5% serum-free Ham's F-12). The dishes were further incubated in Ham's F-12 containing 5% fetal calf serum for 4 h, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and serum-starved for 2 h. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 16 h. The cells were then extracted using Stop and GloR lysis buffer and assayed sequentially for the firefly and Renilla luciferases according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp.). In brief, 10 μl of crude cell lysate was incubated with 50 μl of luciferin reagent (LARII). After 15 s at room temperature, the luminescence was recorded for 30 s in a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer. 50 μl of Stop and GloR reagent was added, and the specific luminescence from the Renilla luciferase was recorded for an additional 30 s. CHO.K1 cells on 22-mm-diameter glass coverslips were co-microinjected as described previously (19Dobson S.P. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. Tavaré J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with two plasmids; pCMV.hIR (or mutants thereof) at 50 μg/ml and pcDNAneoI possessing a chimera between green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of GLUT4 at 200 μg/ml. Cells were incubated in growth medium for 16–24 h before serum starvation for 2 h. The cells were subjected to fluorescence analysis in Hepes-buffered Krebs (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm NaHCO3, 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5.5 mm glucose) using a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV microscope with a 40 × oil immersion objective. GFP excitation/emission was achieved with a High Q fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Treatment with insulin (100 nm) was for 60 min. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was carried out essentially as described previously (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except blots were probed with125I-labeled secondary antibodies and proteins were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by phosphoimaging using a Fujix BAS 2000 phosphoimager. PI3-kinase activity was assayed using a protocol adapted from Jackson et al. (20Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown until confluency in 3.5-cm (6 well) plates, incubated overnight in serum-free Ham's F-12 media, and then treated with insulin (100 nm) for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and rinsing briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold freshly prepared PI3-kinase lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 500 μm NaVO3, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody (1 in 100 dilution) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50 mg/ml pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer A) by tumbling end over end at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were then washed 3 times with lysis buffer A, 2 times in buffer B (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C), once in buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, at 4 °C), and once in buffer D (20 mmHepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.6, at 4 °C). The beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of buffer E (10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2, at 4 °C). 20 μl of phosphatidylinositol/cholate solution (3 mg/ml in 1% (w/v) sodium cholate) was added to each tube, and the reaction was started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 40 μl of reaction mix (3 μm Na2ATP, 7.5 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 450 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:2 v/v). The product was then extracted by the addition of 150 μl of CHCl3 and 150 μl of 0.1 m HCl and then again by the addition of 300 μl of CHCl3 and 300 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Extracted lipid was dried down under vacuum before redissolving in 25 μl of CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.1 m HCl (200:100:1). Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography (run in a pre-equilibrated tank containing methanol:chloroform:ammonia:water, 300:210:45:75) and quantified using a Fujix Bas 2000 phosphoimager. Analysis of the GDP/GTP ratio on Ras was determined as described previously (21Ouwens D.M. van der Zon G.C.M. Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Möller W. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Maassen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33116-33122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown until confluency in 4-cm dishes, serum-starved overnight, then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate before being stimulated with insulin (100 nm, 5 min). Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-114. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the Triton X-114-soluble material was collected by a short temperature shift. The detergent phase was then used to immunoprecipitate Ras. Guanine nucleotides were eluted from the immune complex and resolved by thin layer chromatography. The plates were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a Fujix Bas 2000 phosphoimager. We have previously reported that the mutant insulin receptors Gln-1174 or Leu-1178 are unable to autophosphorylate and that CHO cells stably expressing these receptors are severely defective in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and thymidine incorporation (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, significant insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation was seen in both cell lines expressing the mutant insulin receptors using anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of total cell lysates and anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that IRS-1 phosphorylation per se may be insufficient to mediate downstream insulin signaling events. This possibility was further explored by more detailed characterization of the signaling properties of the CHO cell lines stably expressing similar numbers of wild-type, Gln-1174, or Leu-1178 insulin receptors termed wild-type, Gln-1174, or Leu-1178 cell lines, respectively. To more precisely define the dose response characteristics of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, all cell lines were treated with various concentrations of insulin for 2 min, and IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig.1). At 100 nm insulin, the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines show significant enhancement of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with parental nontransfected CHO cells, although this was somewhat reduced compared with the wild-type cell line. The levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation seen in the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines stimulated with 100 nm insulin and the wild-type cell line stimulated with 1 nm insulin were comparable. Thus, while we confirmed the ability of the mutant receptors to promote insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, these mutant receptors did so less well than wild-type receptors. In parallel immunoblotting studies, insulin ability to promote the association of the p85α subunit of PI3-kinase with IRS-1 was examined. Consistent with the studies of IRS-1 phosphorylation, association of p85α with IRS-1 in response to insulin was significantly enhanced in the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines compared with parental CHO cells (Fig. 1). Again, similar levels of IRS-1-associated p85α were seen when the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines were treated with 100 nm insulin versus 1 nm insulin treatment of the wild-type cell line. To examine whether the insulin-stimulated association of p85α seen in cells expressing the mutant receptors could result in the functional activation of PI3-kinase, IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity was measured in all cell lines. Parental CHO cells and Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cells were incubated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min, whereas wild-type cells were incubated with either 1 or 100 nm insulin for 5 min. PI3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from wild-type cells (stimulated with either 1 or 100 nm insulin) or Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cells showed a stimulation that was significantly greater (p < 0.03) than that seen in parental CHO cells (Fig.2). Also, PI3-kinase activity was comparable in wild-type cells stimulated with 1 nm insulin and Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cells stimulated with 100 nminsulin. Thus the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 mutant receptors, despite showing undetectable autophosphorylation, are capable of phosphorylating IRS-1 such that it can interact with and activate PI3-kinase. Of note, using the identical cell lines, we have previously reported that exposure of the wild-type cell line to 1 nm insulin results in a marked enhancement of glycogen synthesis (∼60% maximal), whereas no significant enhancement of glycogen synthesis was seen in the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines when studied at concentrations of 100 nm insulin or higher (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is therefore a clear discordance between the abilities of these mutant receptors to activate IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity and to stimulate glycogen synthesis. To provide additional confirmation that metabolic signaling through the mutant receptors was markedly impaired, we monitored the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in CHO cells by taking advantage of the recently described fluorescent chimera between GLUT4 and GFP (19Dobson S.P. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. Tavaré J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In CHO.T cells that stably overexpress wild-type insulin receptors, we have previously demonstrated that this chimera translocates to the cell surface in response to insulin in approximately 60% of cells (19Dobson S.P. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. Tavaré J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We confirmed this observation in CHO.K1 cells using co-microinjection to transiently overexpress wild-type insulin receptors and GFP-GLUT4 (Fig.3). Cells injected with GFP-GLUT4 and control vector mediated no significant increase in GFP-GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin. In addition, neither the Gln-1174 or Leu-1178 mutant insulin receptors mediated insulin-stimulated GFP-GLUT4 translocation. These results provide additional confirmation that metabolic signaling is severely impaired in the Gln-1174- and Leu-1178-expressing cells. However, as we did not specifically compare wild-type and mutant receptors at insulin concentrations producing comparable degrees of PI3-kinase activation, we cannot use these data to draw any direct conclusions regarding the role of PI3-kinase in the mediation of this particular process. With respect to the mitogenic effects of insulin, we have previously demonstrated that the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 mutant receptors are unable to mediate insulin stimulation of thymidine incorporation into DNA or to activate the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase (1Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To examine events relating to insulin's mitogenic actions in more detail under conditions where cells expressing mutant and wild-type receptors demonstrated comparable levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activation, the characteristics of MAP kinase phosphorylation were examined in all cell lines. Whereas cells overexpressing wild-type insulin receptors showed a 3-fold stimulation of MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation in response to 1 nm insulin and an approximate 5-fold stimulation following 100 nm insulin treatment, no such phosphorylation was seen in the Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 cell lines (Fig. 4). To provide independent confirmation of the inability of these mutant receptors to activate downstream effects related to mitogenesis, we examined the ability of these mutant receptors to activate the ternary complex factor Elk-1. This factor forms a complex with serum response factor at the serum response element within the c-fos promoter and is responsible for the observed insulin effect on c-fosinduction in CHO cells. 2M. R. Griffiths, E. J. Black, M. Dickens, P. E. Shaw, D. A. F. Gillespie, and J. M. Tavaré, submitted for publication. The activation of this transcription factor is closely associated with the proliferative response of cells to growth stimuli (23Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). A GAL4-Elk-1 fusion protein was expressed in CHO.K1 cells by transient transfection. The activity of this chimeric transcription factor was monitored with a co-transfected luciferase reporter plasmid, where the luciferase gene is placed under the control of a promoter possessing five GAL4 binding sites. A third plasmid, pRL.CMV, possessing the Renilla retinformis luciferase was included in these transfections to monitor cell transfection efficiency. Finally, a fourth plasmid was included to overexpress wild-type, Gln-1174, or Leu-1178 mutant insulin receptors. As shown in Fig. 5, parental CHO.K1 cells exhibited little or no stimulation of Elk-1 in response to insulin, as determined by luciferase activity. When the wild-type insulin receptor was overexpressed, insulin induced an approximate 2-fold increase in luciferase activity after incubation with 1 nm insulin and an approximate 5-fold increase in luciferase activity after incubation with 100 nm insulin. In contrast, neither mutant insulin receptor was capable of activating Elk-1 (Fig.5).Figure 5CHO cells expressing Gln-1174 and Leu-1178 mutant insulin receptors fail to mediate insulin stimulation of a GAL4-Elk1 transcription factor. CHO.K1 cells were transiently transfected with pRL.CMV, pSG424.Elk1(83–428), and pGL3.G5E4D[Δ]38. Also included was a fourth plasmid, either empty vector (vector), vector encoding wild-type insulin receptor cDNA (wt), or vector encoding either Gln-1174 or Leu-1178 mutant insulin receptors, as indicated. Transfected cells were then treated in the absence (open bars) or presence of 100 nminsulin (shaded bars) or 1 nm insulin (hatched bar). After 16 h, the cells were harvested, and lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferases as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results shown are the ratio of the firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase activities (i.e. corrected for transfection efficiency) and are standardized to the maximal response of insulin (in cells expressing wild-type insulin receptors).

Although endocytic internalization of EGFR may be thought to attenuate EGF-stimulated signaling, recent evidence suggests that signaling through Ras can be amplified by repeated encounters of endosome-localized, receptor·Shc·Grb2·Sos complexes with the plasma membrane, where Ras resides almost exclusively. Based on these reports, we examined EGFR trafficking behavior in a set of single and double c-Src/EGFR C3H10T½ overexpressors to determine if c-Src affects basal receptor half-life, ligand-induced internalization, and/or recycling. Our results show that overexpression of c-Src causes no change in EGFR half-life but does produce an increase in the internalization rate constant of EGF·EGFR complexes when the endocytic apparatus is not stoichiometrically saturated; this effect of c-Src on EGFR endocytosis is negligible at high receptor occupancy in cells overexpressing the receptor. In neither case are EGFR recycling rate constants affected by c-Src. These data indicate a functional role for c-Src in receptor internalization, which in turn could alter some aspects of EGFR signaling related to mitogenesis and tumorigenesis.

Binding of ligand to EGFR induces transphosphorylation on several C-terminal tyrosyl residues, which upon phosphorylation bind the SH2 domains of various signaling molecules, including Shc, Grb2, PLCγ (1Koch C.A.

Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Association of these molecules with the EGFR results in their activation, either via changes in subcellular localization (thereby bringing them into juxtaposition with their substrates) or by tyrosyl phosphorylation (inducing conformational changes and enzymatic activation). These activated molecules then initiate signaling cascades that culminate in a variety of responses, including cell division (4Carpenter G. Cohen S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 193-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).EGFR has been linked to the process of oncogenesis as well as to normal mitogenesis. The chicken proto-oncogene for EGFR was one of the first cellular genes found to be transduced by a retrovirus and shown to function as an oncogene (see for example Ref. 5Kung H.J. Chang C.M. Pelley R.J. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1994: 19-45Google Scholar). Increased expression of EGFR is seen in many human tumors, including glioblastomas/neuroblastomas and carcinomas of the breast, bladder, kidney, stomach, ovary, prostate, and lung (6Hendler F.J.

In some experimental cell systems, overexpression of EGFR by itself leads to malignant transformation when cells are grown in the continuous presence of EGF (11Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C.

A role for c-Src in EGFR-mediated responses has been demonstrated by a number of studies. First, overexpression of wild-type c-Src in C3H10T½ murine fibroblasts expressing normal levels of receptor (3–10 × 103 receptors/cell) potentiated EGF-directed mitogenesis, whereas overexpression of dominant negative variants of c-Src not only ablated the enhanced mitogenic response but also interferred with the endogenous response (13Luttrell D.K.

Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, Maa et al. (16Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J.

In fibroblasts, this association is EGF-dependent and results in the appearance of two novel tyrosyl phosphorylations on the receptor and increased phosphorylation of receptor substrates in vivo (16Maa M.-C.

These findings suggest that c-Src potentiates the action of the EGFR by binding to it and inducing its phosphorylation, resulting in hyperactivation of the receptor and enhanced downstream signaling. Several studies have attempted to localize the site of c-Src binding to the receptor, using in vitro peptide competition approaches (17Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D.

Tyr-992 is the most consistently noticed site, but other Tyr residues have also been implicated, suggesting that c-Src may bind multiple sites.

A significant fraction of c-Src in fibroblasts has been found associated with endosomes (24Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the SH3 domain of c-Src is capable of binding and activating dynamin (25Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J.

Finally, Wang and Moran (30Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) recently reported the requirement for the signal transducer, Grb2, in endocytosis of EGFR.With these factors in mind, we undertook an examination of single and double c-Src/EGFR overexpressors to determine if c-Src had an effect on endocytic internalization and recycling of EGFR. We have obtained the new finding that c-Src increases the rate of endocytosis of EGF·EGFR complexes until the endocytic apparatus is saturated and becomes rate-limiting. c-Src has no effect on EGF·EGFR complex recycling. In the context of previous findings, our results suggest that, among multiple mechanisms, c-Src may potentiate the action of EGFR by enhancing complex internalization, possibly amplifying signaling through an endosome-associated intermediate.RESULTSPrevious work has shown an association of c-Src with both EGFR (16Maa M.-C.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These associations, along with the increase in mitogenesis observed in cells overexpressing c-Src upon incubation with EGF (13Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggest a mechanism of action for c-Src in mitogenic signaling events that involves EGFR trafficking. To determine whether trafficking parameters are affected by c-Src, the basal half-life of EGFR and EGF-induced internalization and recycling rate constants were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”C3H10T½ murine fibroblasts overexpressing EGFR alone (NR) or overexpressing both c-Src and EGFR (5HR) were examined for effects of c-Src on the basal EGFR half-life by [35S]methionine pulse-chase analysis. Fig. 2 shows that EGFR in the NR cells and 5HR cells exhibit turnover half-times of approximately 20 and 22 h, respectively, in the absence of EGF. Thus, c-Src overexpression has little or no effect on intrinsic EGFR turnover.EGF-induced endocytic rate constants (k e ) for EGFR were measured for the following panel of C3H10T½ fibroblasts: neomycin-resistant only (Neo), c-Src overexpressors (5H), kinase-defective c-Src overexpressors (430), EGFR overexpressors (NR), and c-Src/EGFR double overexpressors (5HR). Representative internalization data are shown in Fig. 3. The endocytic rate constants are simply the slopes of the lines shown.Panels A and B reflect rates at a low number of surface complexes (<300/cell). It is clear that both of the cell lines overexpressing c-Src (5HR and 5H) had increased endocytosis rates compared to their respective counterparts. Panel Cdemonstrates that the c-Src effect was not seen at all levels of surface complexes. The number of surface complexes in panel C is 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in A orB. For this circumstance, the cells overexpressing c-Src had the same endocytosis rate as those with endogenous levels.Figure 3Comparison of the endocytic rate of EGFR and c-Src/EGFR overexpressors at two levels of surface complexes. A and B represent endocytic rates at lowC s (∼300/cell); C represents the endocytic rate at high C s (20,000/cell).A and C represent receptor overexpressors, NR (closed circles) and 5HR (closed squares);B represents endogenous receptor levels, Neo (open circles) and 5H (open squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The entire range of endocytic rate constants measured for the various cell lines is shown in Fig. 4. Fig.4 A shows that as the average number of surface EGF·EGFR complexes drops below 5,000, the endocytic rate constant for the 5HR cell line increased dramatically, whereas the rate constant for the NR cell line reached a plateau. Neo and 5H cell lines also exhibited a difference in internalization rate constants in this region (Fig.4 B); the average k e value for the Neo cell line was 0.042 ± 0.016, whereas the average value for the 5H cell line was 0.096 ± 0.014. These data demonstrate that c-Src can cause an increase in EGFR internalization rate. The EGFR internalization rate constant in the 430 cell line is somewhat lower than for the Neo cell line (Fig. 4 B) but not with statistical significance (k e = 0.023 ± 0.014). At high receptor occupancy levels above 5,000 surface complexes/cell, endocytic rate constants for 5HR and NR were identical due to saturation of the endocytic apparatus (35Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 36Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the low level of EGFR expressed in the 5H and Neo cell lines, we were unable to saturate the endocytic machinery.Figure 4Comparison of the endocytic behavior of (A) EGFR and c-Src/EGFR overexpressors and (B) c-Src overexpressors and wild type. A, the endocytic rate constants for NR (closed circles) and the 5HR (closed squares) are plotted as a function of average number of surface complexes. The average number of surface complexes was taken as an integral average over time for each k e . Each point represents the average of several (between 2 and 8) rate constants taken in that region. B, the data for the Neo cell line (open bar) are n = 6, for the 5H cell line (closed bar) are n = 7, and for the 430 cell line (shaded bar) are n = 4, all with average surface complexes below 3 × 104. Error bars represent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Note, comparing Fig. 4 A with 4B, that the internalization rate constants for the Neo and NR cell lines exhibit different averages at low receptor occupancy. This is most likely due to differences in the overall average C s values between the two cell lines. Since Neo therefore exhibits a larger average C s (data not shown), the internalization rate constant should be slightly lower than for NR.To check for specificity of the c-Src effect, endocytic rate constants for the 5HR and NR cell lines should be measured for a different ligand/receptor pair. The transferrin receptor has been previously shown to internalize independently of receptor occupancy and to be unaffected by the presence of saturating levels of EGF, indicating that transferrin receptor internalization follows a different mechanism than that of EGFR (35Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested the effect of c-Src on the internalization rate constant of transferrin receptor. The 5HR and NR cell lines were found to internalize transferrin similarly, exhibiting rate constants of 0.25 ± 0.03 and 0.30 ± 0.03 (n = 4), respectively. Thus, the effect of c-Src appears to be specific.To determine if other parameters of receptor trafficking are affected by c-Src, recycling rate constants (k x ) were measured using two different protocols as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first method involved pulsing the cells for 5 min in labeled ligand followed by an unlabeled ligand chase. The analysis for this protocol follows the decrease of internal receptor/ligand complexes with time. Since this analysis assumes the amount of degraded ligand is negligible, we verified that there was no significant degraded ligand within the experimental time period of 40 min (data not shown). The recycling rate constant showed no significant trends either within or between cell lines (Fig.5 A).Figure 5Comparison of the recycling behavior of EGFR and c-Src/EGFR overexpressors for two protocols. The recycling rate constants are shown for the (A) pulse-chase protocol and (B) internalization protocol. The recycling rate constants for the 5HR (closed bar) and NR (open bar) cell lines are shown at high (6,000–40,000) and low (300–3,000) numbers of internal complexes (n = 2–5). The average number of internal complexes was taken as an integral average over time for each k x . Error barsrepresent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An alternative measure of the recycling rate constant was obtained from the internalization data. Instead of plotting the number of internal complexes (C i ) as a function of the average number of surface complexes over time (∫C s dt),C i −k e ∫C s dt was plotted as a function of∫C i dt, yielding a straight line with a slope of −k x . The results of these experiments also yielded no apparent effect of c-Src on recycling rate constants, although the magnitude of the recycling rate constant was roughly 2-fold greater in this assay (Fig. 5 B) than in the pulse/chase assay (Fig. 5 A). The differences in recycling rate noted between protocols could be due to insufficient surface stripping by the light acid strip or insufficient cold chase, resulting in reinternalization of labeled ligand. Analysis of pulse-chase data neglects any internalization of labeled ligand; the presence of excess unlabeled ligand and the light acid strip removes any labeled ligand from the internalization pool. The analysis used to calculate the recycling rate constant from internalization data takes the endocytic rate constant into account, resulting in the calculation of a higher recycling rate constant.To determine if differences in recycling were hidden by assay insensitivity, steady-state values for the numbers of internal and surface EGF·EGFR complexes (C i ,C s ) were measured for all four cell lines. Fig.6, panels A and C, show that at all concentrations of surface complexes, the 5HR cell line exhibited a higher ratio of C i toC s than the NR cell line, consistent with its increased EGFR internalization rate constant and unchanged EGFR recycling rate constant. This trend remains for concentrations of ligand that saturate the endocytic machinery, which is not consistent with the observed endocytic rate constants. This implies there could indeed be some differences in recycling rate or sorting fractions at high occupancy. There could also be an effect due to degradation by 3 h. There were no significant differences between the 5H and Neo cell lines, even though their internalization rate constants differed (Fig.6, panels B and D). Since the internalization rate constants were lower for the 5H and Neo cell lines compared with the 5HR and NR lines, it was not surprising that the effect of endocytic dynamics on steady-state receptor distribution was minimal for the former (32Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 73-132Google Scholar). To fully answer this question, assays more sensitive than any currently available would need to be developed.Figure 6Comparison of long term trafficking behavior of EGFR, c-Src, and c-Src/EGFR overexpressors. Internal and surface counts/min are representative of the number of EGF-EGFR complexes. Surface counts (open markers) and internal counts (closed markers) are shown for A, NR (circles) and 5HR (squares), and B, Neo (circles) and 5H (squares). The ratio of internal to surface counts is compared between C, NR (open bars) and 5HR (closed bars), andD, Neo (open bars) and 5H (closed bars). All data represent n = 3.

Increased rate constants for EGFR internalization were observed in c-Src overexpressors relative to control cells expressing endogenous levels of c-Src. Internalization rates were found to be increased until the endocytic machinery became saturated at high levels of EGF·EGFR complexes. Increased internalization rates were also reflected in the larger steady-state pool of internalized EGFR in cells overexpressing both EGFR and c-Src compared with cells overexpressing EGFR alone.Our experimental methodology for studying EGF-induced EGFR internalization and recycling has relied on using125I-labeled EGF to follow EGF·EGFR complexes. EGF·EGFR complexes have been found to remain largely associated during endosomal sorting (37Sorkin A.D. Teslenko L.V. Nikolsky N.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and previous work has demonstrated consistency of this methodology with other approaches to quantifying EGFR trafficking processes (33Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which c-Src affects EGFR internalization is not known, but an examination of the endocytic process yields some possible clues. Ligand-activated EGFRs are recruited into clathrin-coated pits by an unknown component of the endocytic apparatus. A candidate for such a component is adaptin (38Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). At low levels of ligand-receptor complexes, c-Src may function by potentiating the activity of such a recruitment factor. At high complex numbers, this factor becomes limiting and is no longer available to be recruited or activated by c-Src to bind additional complexes. A similar hypothesis has been proposed as an explanation for the differential affinity of EGFR mutants for coated pits (39Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this scenario, it was suggested that the affinity of the receptor for coated pits depends upon the binding of the receptor to a specific internalization component (IC) and the binding of the receptor-IC complexes to coated pits. In the work discussed here, c-Src might be affecting the rate of receptor-IC complex formation.Whether physical association between c-Src and EGFR is required for this process or whether c-Src acts independently of the receptor or in concert with other tyrosine kinases is unknown. In the absence of EGF, c-Src overexpression does not affect EGFR half-life. This finding suggests that physical association between c-Src and EGFR induced by EGF is important for the effect of c-Src on EGFR internalization. The requirement of a physical complex for the effect of c-Src on EGF-induced tumorigenesis has previously been suggested (16Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Internalization of the constitutively internalized transferrin receptor is not affected by the presence of c-Src. This implies that the increased internalization of EGFR due to c-Src has a certain specificity. In addition, there is the question of possible involvement of other tyrosine kinases or even other receptors, such as ErbB2, in the internalization process. Investigating the presence and effect of any other components is a question for future work.In addition to the recruitment factor or internalization component, c-Src may affect the function of dynamin. Dynamin is a GTPase that is critical for the formation and release of the endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (26Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 27Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Dynamin has also been shown to bind the SH3 domain of c-Src in vitro, raising the possibility that c-Src might interact with dynamin in vivo. We speculate that when low ligand-receptor complexes are present, overexpression of c-Src could result in the activation or recruitment of a larger pool of dynamin than in cells expressing normal levels of c-Src.The overall result of c-Src overexpression, however, is increased mitogenesis or tumorigenesis stimulated by EGF (13Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

Fibrillar collagens represent the most abundant structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. They all participate in the elaboration of the fibrillar network and thus to the extracellular matrix architecture (1van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). However, the minor collagens V and XI can be distinguished from the others by their capacity to control fibrillogenesis (2Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B.

All fibrillar collagens are composed of a major triple-helix domain (COL1) flanked by two noncollagenous domains, namely the N-propeptide (NC2, COL2, and NC3) and the C-propeptide (NC1). Whereas collagens I, II, and III undergo a processing that reduces the molecule mainly to the triple-helix domain, collagen V retains a large part of the N-propeptide in the mature molecule (4Broek D.L. Madri J. Eikenberry E.F. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 555-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

This propeptide forms a globular domain that could dictate the fibril diameter by sterically inhibiting the accretion of collagen I within heterotypic fibrils (6Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F.

In addition to the importance of the N-propeptide retention, heterotypic fibrils were shown to be thinner in tissues where the amount of collagen V is particularly high (7Tseng S.C. Smuckler D.

Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Significantly, genetic alteration of collagen V molecules impairs the control of matrix assembly (13Andrikopoulos K. Liu X. Keene D.R. Jaenisch R. Ramirez F.

Therefore, despite being a quantitatively minor collagen, collagen V is involved in fundamental processes such as development and human connective tissue disorders. So far, studies on collagen V function concerned the most abundant and widely distributed molecular form, i.e. the heterotrimer (α1(V))2α2(V). Nevertheless, collagen V also occurs with different chain associations: α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) described only in human placenta (17Niyibizi C. Fietzek P.P. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14170-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the homotrimer (α1(V))3. Homotrimers have not been isolated from tissues but were reported in Chinese hamster cell cultures (18Haralson M.A. Mitchell W.M. Rhodes R.K. Kresina T.F. Gay R. Miller E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5206-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous reports inferred that it exists also in vivo based on the ratio of α1versus α2 chains found in chick embryo crop (19Kumamoto C.A. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7053-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human bone extracts (20Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.-C. Kleman J.-P. Champliaud M.-F. Boutillon M.-M. Bernillon J.

However, because of an inability to isolate this molecular form from tissues, it has not been possible to formally study the (α1(V))3 homotrimer, which is thus almost completely uncharacterized. We used a eucaryotic recombinant approach to engineer and generate α1(V) molecules in sufficient amounts for biochemical characterization and further functional analysis.

The cDNAs were first subcloned from an EcoRI site in M13 into an EcoRI site of the Bluescript plasmid SK. As the α1(V) sequence itself comprises three internal EcoRI sites, several intermediate plasmids had to be designed. The first step consisted in subcloning aBamHI-EcoRI (750–3430) fragment of 302 into a Bluescript SK plasmid; this plasmid was called A. The main part of the vector was then constructed by cloning anEcoRI-AccI fragment (bases 3430–5160) from clone 401 into plasmid A. The resulting plasmid contained bases 750–5160 and was called B. The 5′ end of the cDNA was generated by combining plasmid 508 and 302 up to the SphI site. A fragmentBamHI-XhoI of clone 302 was subcloned in KS Bluescript; this plasmid was called plasmid C. Clone 508 was digested with BamHI, and the fragment was subcloned into plasmid C, generating a plasmid called D, which encoded base 1–1900. A 1620-base pair NotI-SphI fragment from plasmid D containing the translational start site and the cDNA sequence up toSphI was subcloned into plasmid B digested withNotI-SphI. The resulting clone, plasmid E, contained sequences 1–5160 of collagen V cDNA. Concerning the 3′ end of the cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction product consisting of the last 400 bases of the cDNA (bases 5242–5643) was generated in order to remove an EcoRI site located at base 5671 and to keep the stop codon. The primers were TATATCGATCTAGCCCATGAAGCAAGCCGG, which generate a ClaI site and AGTGAATTCAAGCGTGGGAAACTGCTCTCC. TheEcoRI-ClaI fragment was subcloned in Bluescript SK and sequenced. It was then cloned into the 3′-most EcoRI site (5240) of a plasmid 401 first digested with BamHI and religated to remove the EcoRI site at base 3430. ASalI fragment containing the sequences 5160–5676 was excised from this plasmid and cloned into the single SalI site in plasmid E to generate the full-length cDNA (base 1–5750) in the Bluescript vector KS. The full-length cDNA was excised usingKpnI and subcloned into the mammalian episomal expression vector pCEP-4 (InVitrogen). Sequences at junction points were checked. The expression plasmid was amplified by Qiagen prep and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells by electroporation (960 microfarads, 250 V). This cell line constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 protein from the Epstein-Barr virus, allowing episomal replication of the vector. 18 μg of the DNA for 7 million cells were used. The transfected cells were selected by hygromycin (300 μg/ml) during 15 days. 293-EBNA-resistant cell media were tested for expression of α1(V) chains by 6% SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. , followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For immunostaining, proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Molshein, France) overnight in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 5% methanol. After saturation, membranes were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against collagen V (22Lawrence R. Hartmann D.J. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9603-9609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Collagen V standards (pepsinized bovine bone and intact human embryonic bone heterotrimeric collagen V) were purified and characterized as described previously (23Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For further protein characterization and purification, cells were grown in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of sodium ascorbate (50 μg/ml). In some cases, cell layers were solubilized on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of lysate buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer and immunostaining as described above. Large amounts of serum-free medium from transfected 293-EBNA cells were collected every 48 h and stored at −20 °C before dialysis against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.6. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m acetic acid and stored at −20 °C. The supernatant was passed over a DEAE column (Econo column, 2.5 × 15; Bio-Rad) and subsequently eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Pools containing purified recombinant α1(V) triple-helix domain were recovered from 0.25 m NaCl elution, dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid, and stored at −20 °C until used. The different samples were digested with pepsin in 0.5 m acetic acid for 3 h at 20 °C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of approximately 1:5. For bacterial collagenase digestions, freshly collected serum-free medium was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Collagenase digestions was performed at 37 °C for 3 h at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:7 (Advanced Biofacture). Digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Amino acid compositions were determined after hydrolysis under vacuum (6n HCl, 115 °C, 24 h) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol in a Pico Tag system (Waters) with a Beckman amino acid analyzer. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Triple-helix conformation and thermal stability of the recombinant homotrimer (α1TH) were analyzed by circular dichroism. Spectra were recorded at 4 °C in 0.05 m acetic acid on a CD6 Jobin Yvon spectropolarimeter equipped with a variable temperature unit. For comparison, we used pepsinized heterotrimeric collagen V extracted from amniotic/chorionic membrane of human placenta as described previously (23Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is worth mentioning that the N-terminal extensions of the pepsin-treated heterotrimer are completely cleaved off, whereas the homotrimeric α1TH molecules retain the major part of the NC2 domain. Measurements were done with a 1-mm path length cuvette at a constant rate of 1 nm/min with a 0.2-nm resolution. Thermal transition curves were obtained by monitoring (Θ) 222 nm as a function of temperature. For rotary shadowing, samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml with 0.1m acetic acid, mixed with glycerol (1:1), sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica sheets, and immediately placed on the holder of a MED 010 evaporator (Balzers). Rotary shadowing was carried out as described previously (23Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Observations of replicas were performed with a Philips CM120 microscope at the CMEABG (Center de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie et à la Géologie, Université Claude Bernard, Lyon I). Electrophoresis analysis of serum-free medium from α1(V)-transfected 293-EBNA cells demonstrated an additional 250-kDa protein band referred to α1FL, which is absent in nontransfected cell medium (Fig.1 A). A concentration in the range 15–20 μg/ml for the recombinant α1FL chains was estimated based on the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining after electrophoresis. The secreted α1FL chains rapidly underwent degradation into a band referred to α1TH that migrated to a position identical to pepsinized α1(V) collagen isolated from tissue (Fig. 1 A). The identity of the recombinant α1(V) chain products was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against pepsinized collagen V (Fig. 1 B). The N-terminal sequence AQPA for the upper band, α1FL, was determined by Edman degradation after electrotransfer. This sequence starts with the first amino acid of the α1(V) chain after the predicted peptide signal cleavage site and indicates that the entire N-propeptide is present. This is in agreement with the slower migration of α1FL compared with intact α1(V) chains isolated from human bone (Fig.1 A). Indeed, the tissue form of collagen V undergoes N-terminal processing that removes a large part of the N-terminal propeptide including the PARP domain (5Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.-C. Kleman J.-P. Champliaud M.-F. Boutillon M.-M. Bernillon J. Wallach J. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The α1TH migration is not affected by pepsin treatment, attesting that this band corresponds to the main triple-helix domain of α1(V) chain (data not shown). However, N-terminal sequencing performed on the α1TH form gave the peptide sequence RFGGGGDAGS with starting position at residue 525. This result indicates that the α1TH form retains the major part of the NC2 domain. A first purification step showed that α1FL chains precipitate selectively at pH 8.6 in Tris-HCl buffer. Although α1TH forms coprecipitate at this pH, large amounts of α1TH remain soluble and can be eluted from a DEAE column with 0.25 m NaCl as a single protein (Fig. 1 A). When samples were not reduced before electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A), the α1FL band is not converted into a high molecular mass product, indicating the absence of disulfide-bonded trimers in the culture medium. Immunoblotting of transfected cell homogenates showed a band staining for collagen V antibodies with a slower migration than α1FL from medium (Fig. 2). The difference in migration is in good accordance with the predicted molecular mass of the α1(V) C-propeptide (less than 30 kDa). Moreover, a high molecular mass product is observed in unreduced cell homogenate and likely corresponds to disulfide bonded trimers. Taken together, these results indicate that, although the C-propeptide of synthesized recombinant chains is involved in disulfide bonding, it is rapidly cleaved after secretion in the medium. In addition, collagenase digestion of α1FL chains from cell medium revealed a unique 86-kDa fragment (Fig.3) with the same N-terminal sequence as α1FL (AQPA), indicating that this band corresponds to the entire unprocessed N-propeptide. When nonreduced (Fig. 3), the 86-kDa fragment migration is converted into a slightly faster migrating product. This difference in migration between the reduced and nonreduced forms of this fragment attests to a correct folding of the N-propeptide via intrachain disulfide bonds.Figure 3Digestion with bacterial collagenase (C'ase): 10% SDS-PAGE patterns of reduced (lanes 1 and 2) and unreduced (lane 3) purified α1FL with (+) or without (−) collagenase digestion. Npro, N-propeptide; DTT, dithiothreitol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The α1FL chains secreted by transfected cells were triple helices as indicated by resistance of the COL1 domain to pepsin digestion (Fig.4). When ascorbate was omitted, α1FL was secreted as single chains or loosely formed triple helices sensitive to pepsin digestion (Fig. 4). Amino acid composition of media in the presence or absence of ascorbate revealed the absence of hydroxyproline in the medium devoid of ascorbate. In contrast, purified α1FL homotrimers contains 112 Hyp residues/1,000, which is in agreement with the maximal value predicted from cDNA α1(V) sequence (115 Hyp residues/1,000 for the COL1 domain and 124 including COL2). Although the recombinant α1(V) chains were poorly hydroxylated at lysyl residues (6/1,000 instead of 31/1,000 for tissue-purified α1(V) chains), the triple-helix domain is, at least in part, glycosylated, since the corresponding band (α1TH) stains with Schiff's reagent (data not shown). Thermal stability of the recombinant homotrimers was investigated by circular dichroism (Fig. 5). The CD spectrum obtained for α1TH presents similar features to that monitored for the human pepsinized heterotrimeric collagen V (Fig.5 A). They both show a negative minimum peak at 197 nm and a positive peak around 222 nm attesting for the triple-helix conformation in collagen (24Piez K.A. Sherman M.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The thermal transition curves exhibit a transition at 37.5 °C for the recombinant homotrimer and a transition at 39.5 °C for the heterotrimer. Rotary shadowing of α1FL homotrimers revealed 300-nm-long molecules with a large globular domain at one extremity, the N-propeptide (Fig.6 A). The small triple-helix domain COL2 within the N-propeptide is not visible in our preparations. The absence of a small globular domain at the C-terminal end of the molecule confirms the cleavage of the C-propeptide on secreted molecules. In addition, a kink at about 70 nm from the N-terminal extremity of the homotrimers is almost always observed on molecules (Fig. 6 B). A 120-kDa fragment often occurred in our preparations and seems to correspond to further trimming of the triple-helix domain α1TH (Fig. 6 C). This fragment is also generated by α1FL pepsin digestion (Fig. 4 B), likely indicating a micro-unfolding area within the triple-helix domain of α1(V) homotrimer. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of α1(V) contains a unique segment of 13 Gly-X-Y triplets between Gly793 and Ile831 containing only one proline. This region, poor in imino acids, is liable to generate a flexible site in the triple helix. The position of this sequence corresponds to the location of the kink observed in the triple-helix domain of rotary-shadowed recombinant molecules. To test whether the 120-kDa fragment arose from proteolytic cleavage of the flexible site observed by rotary shadowing, amino acid sequencing was performed on the corresponding band by Edman degradation. The sequence obtained, DGPPGHPGKEGP, perfectly matched the α1(V) triple-helix sequence at positions 759–770, about 30 amino acids upstream the micro-unfolded region. Although this cleavage site did not occur in the imino acid-poor region, it is a difficult task to estimate in what extent the triple-helix regions flanking the flexible site might be altered. Thus it cannot be excluded that these neighboring regions represent a target for proteases as well. Together with collagen XI, collagen V was called a minor collagen because of its low level of expression in tissue. Additionally, the biochemical extraction of its intact form is difficult, and the amount of material available is quite limited. Its recombinant production seemed an indispensable step to obtain enough high grade material. Recombinant approaches have been widely used to obtain human full-length collagen chains including α1(I), α1(II), and α1(III) (25Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 339-405Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Tomita M. Ohkura N. Ito M. Kato T. Royce P.M. Kitajima T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Baculovirus insect cells and human cells have been proven both useful in this regard. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells are known to synthesize few, if any, extracellular matrix proteins and to produce recombinant proteins in high quantity when manipulated by genetic engineering (28Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D.P. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, as it has been shown recently, these cells ensure correct post-translational modifications specific to collagens (30Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T.-C. Zhang R.-Z. Mann K. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To this end, we chose these cells to provide α1(V) chains. As shown here, 15–20 μg/ml α1(V) chains were obtained, which is above the yields obtained for other human fibrillar collagens in other eucaryotic systems (2 μg/ml for α1(III) and 0.6 μg/ml for α1(II)). The results presented here demonstrate that the 293 cells expression system is a highly efficient method for the production of substantial amounts of α1(V) homotrimer. This quantitative aspect, although important to consider for further experiments, had to be correlated to qualitative investigations to ensure the biochemical and functional integrity of the recombinant protein. The α1(V) chains we produced are present in two major species called α1FL and α1TH, which correspond, respectively, as will be discussed below, to an N-terminal unprocessed form and a fully processed one. Both are resistant to pepsin digestion and are thus triple helical in the presence of ascorbate. As commonly observed with fibrillar collagens, the requirement of ascorbate to obtain the triple-helix formation is a prerequisite in our experiments (31Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-50Google Scholar, 32Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). It allows the hydroxylation of proline in a range comparable to the one predicted from the cDNA sequence. It has been shown for collagen III and for collagen XII that proline hydroxylation could be essential not only for the stability of the helix but also for the triple-helix nucleation itself, thus canceling the role of the disulfide bonds in this particular process (33Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has to be investigated for our model. Concerning the hydroxylation of lysine, a weak rate is observed, which is the case for other fibrillar recombinant collagens (27Tomita M. Ohkura N. Ito M. Kato T. Royce P.M. Kitajima T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The subsequent glycosylation of the lysines that are hydroxylated, however, occurs since carbohydrates are present in the truncated molecule corresponding to the COL1 domain only. As a consequence of correct hydroxylation of the produced homotrimer, the triple helix formed is properly folded and stable at physiological temperature. Although the major form of collagen V in tissues is the heterotrimer (α1(V))2α2(V), several observations hint at the existence of the homotrimer not only in cell and tissue culture systems (18Haralson M.A. Mitchell W.M.

Chem. 1981; 256: 7053-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Haralson M.A. Mitchell W.M. Rhodes R.K. Miller E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but also in tissues (20Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.-C. Kleman J.-P. Champliaud M.-F. Boutillon M.-M. Bernillon J. Wallach J. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). So far, the only experiments showing that α1(V) chains are able to reform stable triple-helix molecules came from in vitro renaturation experiments (35Bentz H. Bächinger H.P. Glanville R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the renatured product showed aT m of 35 °C, whereas our results clearly indicate that the melting temperature of the recombinant homotrimer is more compatible with in vivo conditions (T m = 37.5 °C). Furthermore, our results provide the first analysis of biochemical and structural properties of the homotrimers. Indeed, rotary shadowing observations showed that the homotrimers exhibit a regular kink at 70 nm from the N-terminal end of the molecule. This kink is correlated with the paucity of prolyl residues in this region. Since N-terminal sequencing of the 120-kDa degradation product corresponds to this area of the molecule, this region is likely to bein vivo as well a target for proteases. The susceptibility of the homotrimers to proteases together with the melting temperature close to 37 °C may explain the difficulties in detecting substantial amounts from tissues. Fibrillar collagens undergo a processing involving two specific proteinases that removes the N- and C-propeptides. This processing is complete in collagen I, II, and III, leaving only two telopeptides flanking the triple helix (37Kühn K. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1987: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar). The N-terminal processing is, however, different in collagen V. In the (α1(V))2α2(V) tissue form, the α2(V) chain is unprocessed, and different authors agree with the fact that for α1(V) chains only, sequences of NC3 are lost and that COL2 and NC2 remain intact (4Broek D.L. Madri J. Eikenberry E.F. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 555-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.-C. Kleman J.-P. Champliaud M.-F. Boutillon M.-M. Bernillon J. Wallach J. van der Rest M. Eur. J.

Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1987: 81-103Google Scholar). Thus, in the heterotrimer, a globular domain persists at the N-terminal end of the triple-helix domain, and this is of functional importance since it could sterically inhibit the accretion of heterotypic collagen V/I fibers (6Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue form of α1(V) homotrimer was suggested to exist only as a fully processed molecule (20Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.-C. Kleman J.-P. Champliaud M.-F. Boutillon M.-M. Bernillon J. Wallach J. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This could be of physiological importance, since the absence of the N-propeptide could promote the existence of thicker heterotypic fibrils. In this regard, the different processing occurring in the various collagen V isoforms could influence fibril diameter modulation. Interestingly, we observed two molecular forms in the culture media, N-terminal unprocessed (α1FL) and fully processed homotrimers (α1TH). Although a putative N-proteinase cleavage site analogous to the collagen I was designated in α1(V) chain at positions Ala541-Gln542 (39Morikawa T. Tuderman L. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2646-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the determination of the N-terminal sequence of the recombinant product indicates that the cleavage occurs at positions Phe524-Arg525. Thus, as it generally occurs in fibrillar collagens, the fully processed form of the recombinant homotrimer retains the major part of the NC2 domain. Concerning the C-terminal domain, three pieces of evidence indicate that it is processed in our model. (i) Cell medium collagenase digestion generates only a single band of 86 kDa whose sequence indicates that it is the NC3 region, (ii) the molecule observed by rotary shadowing lacks a small globular domain at the C terminus, and (iii) when working with cell homogenates, the form obtained exhibits a molecular mass of about 30 kDa greater than that of α1FL. This difference matches the size of the C-propeptide. All these results mean that the cells synthesize a precursor that contains the C-propeptide and that this C-propeptide is rapidly cleaved in the medium after secretion as it occurs in vivo. Interestingly, our results show that 293 cells contain proteases able to cleave the C-propeptide to generate pN-α1(V) homotrimers. So far, it constitutes the only expression system where the C-propeptide is removed. As these cells do not synthesize any detectable amounts of collagen, investigations have to be done to elucidate which proteases are involved. However, the process occurring in 293 cells provides an undeniably interesting tool for further studies of the role of collagen V homotrimer, particularly in fibrillogenesis. We are very much indebted to Dr. K. Takahara (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) for the generous gift of α1(V) clones and to Dr. U. Mayer (Max Plank Institut) for advice and helpful discussion concerning the expression vector and the use of 293-EBNA cells. We thank Dr. D. J. Hartmann for providing antibodies and M.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2017885694,"15-Lipoxygenase has been implicated in the in vivo oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) a process thought to be important in the origin and/or progression of human atherogenesis. We have suggested previously that oxidation of LDL's cholesteryl esters (CE) and phospholipids by soybean (SLO) or human recombinant 15-lipoxygenase (rhLO) can be ascribed largely to α-tocopherol (α-TOH)-mediated peroxidation (TMP). In this study we demonstrate that addition to LDL of unesterified linoleate (18:2), other free fatty acid (FFA) substrates, or phospholipase A2(PLA2) significantly enhanced the accumulation of CE hydro(pero)xides (CE-O(O)H) induced by rhLO, whereas the corresponding CE and nonsubstrate FFA were without effect. The enhanced CE-O(O)H accumulation showed a dependence on the concentration of free 18:2 in LDL. In contrast, addition of 18:2 had little effect on LDL oxidation induced by aqueous peroxyl radicals or Cu2+ ions. Analyses of the regio- and stereoisomers of oxidized 18:2 in SLO-treated native LDL demonstrated that the small amounts of 18:2 associated with the lipoprotein were oxidized enzymically and within minutes, whereas cholesteryl linoleate (Ch18:2) was oxidized nonenzymically and continuously over hours. α-Tocopheroxyl radical (α-TO⋅) formed in LDL exposed to SLO was enhanced by addition of 18:2 or PLA2. With rhLO and 18:2-supplemented LDL, oxidation of 18:2 was entirely enzymic, whereas that of Ch18:2 was largely, though not completely, nonenzymic. The small extent of enzymic Ch18:2 oxidation increased with increasing enzyme to LDL ratios. Ascorbate and the reduced form of coenzyme Q, ubiquinol-10, which are both capable of reducing α-TO⋅ and thereby preventing TMP, inhibited nonenzymic Ch18:2 oxidation induced by rhLO. Trolox and ascorbyl palmitate, which also inhibit TMP, ameliorated both enzymic and nonenzymic oxidation of LDL's lipids, whereas probucol, a radical scavenger not capable of preventing TMP, was ineffective. These results demonstrate that rhLO-induced oxidation of CE is largely nonenzymic and increases with LDL's content of FFA substrates. We propose that conditions which increase LDL's FFA content, such as the presence of lipases, increase 15-LO-induced LDL lipid peroxidation and that this process requires only an initial, transient enzymic activity. 15-Lipoxygenase has been implicated in the in vivo oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) a process thought to be important in the origin and/or progression of human atherogenesis. We have suggested previously that oxidation of LDL's cholesteryl esters (CE) and phospholipids by soybean (SLO) or human recombinant 15-lipoxygenase (rhLO) can be ascribed largely to α-tocopherol (α-TOH)-mediated peroxidation (TMP). In this study we demonstrate that addition to LDL of unesterified linoleate (18:2), other free fatty acid (FFA) substrates, or phospholipase A2(PLA2) significantly enhanced the accumulation of CE hydro(pero)xides (CE-O(O)H) induced by rhLO, whereas the corresponding CE and nonsubstrate FFA were without effect. The enhanced CE-O(O)H accumulation showed a dependence on the concentration of free 18:2 in LDL. In contrast, addition of 18:2 had little effect on LDL oxidation induced by aqueous peroxyl radicals or Cu2+ ions. Analyses of the regio- and stereoisomers of oxidized 18:2 in SLO-treated native LDL demonstrated that the small amounts of 18:2 associated with the lipoprotein were oxidized enzymically and within minutes, whereas cholesteryl linoleate (Ch18:2) was oxidized nonenzymically and continuously over hours. α-Tocopheroxyl radical (α-TO⋅) formed in LDL exposed to SLO was enhanced by addition of 18:2 or PLA2. With rhLO and 18:2-supplemented LDL, oxidation of 18:2 was entirely enzymic, whereas that of Ch18:2 was largely, though not completely, nonenzymic. The small extent of enzymic Ch18:2 oxidation increased with increasing enzyme to LDL ratios. Ascorbate and the reduced form of coenzyme Q, ubiquinol-10, which are both capable of reducing α-TO⋅ and thereby preventing TMP, inhibited nonenzymic Ch18:2 oxidation induced by rhLO. Trolox and ascorbyl palmitate, which also inhibit TMP, ameliorated both enzymic and nonenzymic oxidation of LDL's lipids, whereas probucol, a radical scavenger not capable of preventing TMP, was ineffective. These results demonstrate that rhLO-induced oxidation of CE is largely nonenzymic and increases with LDL's content of FFA substrates. We propose that conditions which increase LDL's FFA content, such as the presence of lipases, increase 15-LO-induced LDL lipid peroxidation and that this process requires only an initial, transient enzymic activity.

Much of the literature ascribes oxidation of LDL by 15-LO to a direct reaction with esterified fatty acid substrates, including phospholipids (PL) and cholesteryl esters (CE) (11Belkner J. Wiesner R.

In LDL exposed to 15-LO, or to cells overexpressing this enzyme (15Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol.

This may be expected as CE, particularly cholesteryl linoleate (Ch18:2), are the major oxidizable lipid in LDL. However, the vast majority of CE are normally buried in the core of the lipoprotein particle and hence may be largely inaccessible to 15-LO. In addition, certain aspects of 15-LO catalysis, such as the rapid oxidation and characteristic suicidal inactivation of the enzyme observed with free fatty acid (FFA) substrates, are notably absent from, or distinct to, 15-LO-induced LDL oxidation (11Belkner J.

Recently, we have obtained results suggesting that α-tocopherol (α-TOH)-mediated peroxidation (TMP) (17Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 18Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6044Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar), initiated and promoted by the formation of α-tocopheroxyl radical (α-TO⋅), largely accounts for the persistent lipid oxidation observed in LDL induced by soybean (SLO) (19Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and human recombinant 15-LO (rhLO) (20Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2650-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reconcile these observations with previous reports, we have hypothesized (20Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2650-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that 15-LO-mediated oxidation of FFA associated with LDL stimulates TMP of esterified lipids in LDL via initial, enzyme-induced formation and release of FFA peroxyl radicals. The latter have been demonstrated previously by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (21Chamulitrat W. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20968-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If formed, FFA peroxyl radicals would be expected to be scavenged by LDL's α-TOH, resulting in the formation of FFA hydroperoxides and α-TO⋅; the latter which could subsequently initiate and propagate TMP. Herein we demonstrate that increasing the levels of FFA in LDL enhances the accumulation of hydroperoxides and hydroxides of Ch18:2 (Ch18:2-O(O)H) in LDL exposed to 15-LO. The oxidation products of Ch18:2, formed over prolonged periods of time, display an entirely (in the case of SLO) or predominantly (rhLO) nonenzymic profile, whereas those of 18:2, which are formed within minutes, are entirely enzymic. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that two mechanisms contribute to 15-LO-induced LDL oxidation, i.e. rapid and direct enzymic interaction of 15-LO with LDL lipid and ongoing, nonenzymic CE oxidation that is both initiated and promoted by α-TO⋅. Our findings have major implications for the inhibition of 15-LO-induced LDL oxidation. rhLO, prepared as described in Ref. 22Kühn H. Barnett J. Grunberger D. Baecker P. Chow J. Nguyen B.

Coenzyme Q (50 mg) capsules were a generous gift from Blackmores Ltd (Sydney, Australia). dl-α-TOH was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., and probucol was a gift from Marion-Merrel Dow Inc.

Hydroxy 13-(S)(Z,E)- and 9-(S)(E,Z)-Ch18:2 and 13-(S)(Z,E)-H(P)ODE, 18:2, linolenate, and arachidonate were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Authentic standards of racemic Ch18:2-OH were prepared by vitamin E-controlled autoxidation of Ch18:2 followed by NaBH4reduction (23Peers K.E. Coxon D.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 32: 49-56Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-10 (CoQ10H2) was produced by reduction of coenzyme Q using dithionite as described in Ref. 24Lang J.K. Gohil K. Packer L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar and used immediately. PD-10 Sephadex G-25M columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden) and Centriprep-30 concentrator tubes were from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). The nitroxide spin label 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-phenylimidazolin-3-oxide-1-oxyl was a gift from Dr. Vitaly Roginsky (Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow) and was used without further purification. Organic solvents of HPLC quality were obtained from Mallinckrodt Inc. (Clayton, Australia) and Merck (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), except diethyl ether (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Before use, PBS and all other aqueous solutions were stored over Chelex 100® (Bio-Rad) to remove contaminating transition metals. All other chemicals were of the highest available purity. Nanopure water (Millipore Systems, Sydney, Australia) was used throughout. LDL was isolated from fresh heparinized whole blood obtained from healthy volunteers. The density of the plasma was adjusted to 1.2 g/ml with KBr and LDL isolated by ultracentrifugation for 2 h as described previously (25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The LDL was collected and used immediately or stored under argon on ice for <24 h prior to use. For the EPR studies LDL, obtained from three to four different donors, was pooled and concentrated to ≈3 mg of protein/ml using Centriprep-30 concentrator tubes. Before use, low molecular weight, water-soluble contaminants were removed by passage of the LDL solution through two successive PD-10 columns, equilibrated with PBS. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic assay and the LDL concentration estimated using a molecular weight for apolipoprotein B-100 of 500 kDa. Alternatively, the concentration of LDL was estimated by cholesterol determination (see below) assuming 550 molecules of free cholesterol/LDL. In vivoenrichment of LDL with CoQ10H2 was achieved essentially as described in Ref. 26Mohr D. Bowry V.W. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, although the dose of ubiquinone-10 was decreased to 150 mg/day. Two nonfasted, healthy individuals were supplemented, one of whom underwent two separate supplementation regimes. The second supplementation was only carried out when plasma CoQ10H2 levels had returned to base line (approximately 3 weeks). Subjects received Coenzyme Q (3 capsules of 50 mg each) as a single, daily dose for 7–10 days. At the end of this period a blood sample was withdrawn and LDL prepared as described above. In addition, before supplementation commenced, a plasma sample (base line) was taken and stored under argon, protected from light, at 4 °C, until the end of the supplementation period. Significant loss of CoQ10H2 does not occur under these conditions (27Thomas S.R. Neuzil J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). LDL was then prepared from this sample, and hence at the same time as the supplemented plasma sample. Where indicated, LDL was supplemented with various lipids or PLA2as defined in the figure legends. Lipids were purified by reverse phase HPLC immediately before use to remove contaminating lipid hydroperoxides. Briefly, a 20 mm stock of lipid was prepared in methanol (nonesterified) or propan-2-ol (CE) and 10-μl aliquots injected onto an LC-18 column (25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, Supelco) for separation of oxidized lipid from FFA and CE as described below. The eluting unoxidized lipids were collected, re-extracted in chloroform (nonesterified) or hexane:methanol, 5:1 (v/v) (CE), dried, and finally resuspended in methanol (FFA) or propan-2-ol (CE). Oxidation of LDL in the presence of rhLO was routinely performed using ∼0.3 mol of enzyme/mol of apoB, except where the rhLO:LDL ratio was varied, and all incubations were carried out aerobically at 37 °C. For SLO, the enzyme and LDL concentrations used are given in the figure legends. The chemical oxidants, AAPH and Cu2+, were used at oxidant (μm):LDL (μm) ratios of 1000 and 1.5, respectively. LDL aliquots (50 μl) were removed at various times and added to 5 ml of hexane and 1 ml of methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid for extraction of CE-O(O)H, free cholesterol, neutral lipids, and α-TOH into the hexane and FFA/FFA-O(O)H into the aqueous methanol phase (28Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The hexane phase was evaporated and the residue redissolved in propan-2-ol (200 μl). Unoxidized lipids (free cholesterol and CE), α-TOH, and hydro(pero)xides of CE (Ch18:2 and cholesteryl arachidonate, CE-O(O)H) were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using UV and electrochemical detection as described in Refs. 25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar and 28Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar. Compounds were quantified by peak area comparison with authentic standards. Analyses of enzymic versus nonenzymic oxidation products of 18:2 and Ch18:2 were performed on samples treated with 50 mm NaBH4, which reduces hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxides (18:2-OH and Ch18:2-OH, respectively). Using the method described below, these hydroxides (but not the hydroperoxides) are base line-separated. Aliquots (50–250 μl) of NaBH4-treated LDL (≈1 μm in apoB) were added to 10 ml of hexane and 2 ml of methanol, the hexane phase (containing Ch18:2-OH) evaporated to dryness and resuspended in hexane. CHCl3/methanol (2:1, v/v, 6 ml) was added to the aqueous methanol phase of the original extract, followed by H2O (2 ml), the CHCl3 layer removed, and the aqueous phase re-extracted with CHCl3 (4 ml). The CHCl3extracts containing 18:2-OH were combined, evaporated to dryness, and the residue resuspended in methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid. Ch18:2-OH in LDL was analyzed directly by NP-HPLC, while FFA-OH in LDL were isolated first by reverse phase HPLC using an LC-DB column (25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, Supelco) as described (11Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), re-extracted (11Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and analyzed further by NP-HPLC. The amounts of FFA-OH was determined using authentic 13-(S)(Z,E)-HODE as a standard. NP-HPLC, utilized for the analysis of the geometrical isomers of 18:2-OH and Ch18:2-OH, was carried out using an LC-Si column (25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, Supelco) with the eluent monitored at 234 nm. 18:2-OH were separated using hexane, propan-2-ol, acetic acid (100:2:0.1, v/v/v) as the eluent at 1 ml/min (11Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas Ch18:2-OH were separated using heptane, diethyl ether, propan-2-ol (100:0.5:0.175, v/v/v) at 2 ml/min (20Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2650-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ch18:2-OH isomers were analyzed directly, without saponification. A slight variation in retention times of the different isomers was observed between batches of solvent, therefore authentic standards of 13-(S)(Z,E)- and 9-(S)(E,Z)-Ch18:2-OH and 13-(S)(Z,E)-HODE were employed for each set of experiments to allow unambiguous assignment of the different isomers. 13-(Z,E) isomers of 18:2-OH and Ch18:2-OH eluting from above NP-HPLC were collected for chiral phase HPLC analysis, using a CHIRACEL-ODH column (Daicel Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan, 25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm) and the eluent monitored at 234 nm. A solvent system of hexane, propan-2-ol, acetic acid, 95:5:0.1 (v/v/v) at 1 ml/min separated the S and R isomers of 13-(Z,E)-18:2-OH (11Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas hexane, propan-2-ol, 97.5:2.5 (v/v) at 1 ml/min separated the S and R isomers of 13-(Z,E)-Ch18:2-OH. Assignment and quantitation of the individual peaks was based on co-elution and area comparison with authentic standards. EPR spectra were obtained at 9.41 GHz using a Bruker ESP-300 spectrometer at 20 °C. At the times indicated aliquots (200 μl) of oxidizing LDL were placed into an aqueous flat cell (500 μl, Wilmad, Buena, NJ) and α-TO⋅monitored. The time lag between obtaining the reaction aliquot, tuning the sample in the cavity, and carrying out the EPR analysis was consistently 1–2 min. The time-dependent increase in α-TO⋅ intensity was measured using the following parameters: magnetic field scan, 60 G; power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 12.5 kHz; gain, 2 × 105; time constant, 163 ms; and sweep time, 20.5 s. Employing these EPR parameters and averaging the output of five cumulative scans gave an acceptable signal to noise ratio that allowed the determination of time-dependent changes in concentration of the α-TO⋅ signal. Radical concentrations were estimated by comparison of the total peak area for the α-TO⋅ signal with that obtained from a solution of the nitroxide, 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-phenylimidazolin-3-oxide-1-oxyl (5 μm), measured under identical spectrometer conditions in the absence of LDL. The SLO used in these EPR studies was concentrated 10 times using Centriprep-30 tubes and then diluted to 1 × 105 units/ml, corresponding to a final concentration of 1.74 μm in the reaction mixtures. Purified 18:2 (10 μm in ethanol) was stored on dry ice and added to LDL immediately prior to addition of SLO. Pancreatic PLA2 (2.5 μm) was incubated with LDL at 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition of SLO. Ethanol was added to a separate LDL batch as a control. We have proposed recently (20Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2650-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that 15-LO-induced oxidation of LDL-associated FFA stimulates TMP of esterified lipids in the lipoprotein via initial, enzyme-induced formation and release of peroxyl radicals of FFA. To test this hypothesis we first examined the effect of supplementation of LDL with various FFA (10 μm; oleate, 18:2, linolenate, and arachidonate), and some of the corresponding CE, on CE-O(O)H accumulation induced by rhLO. Fig.1 A shows that of the various lipids tested only FFA containing a 1,4-pentadienyl group, and that have been described to be substrates for 15-LO (i.e. 18:2, linolenate and arachidonate (29Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar)), significantly enhanced CE-O(O)H accumulation in LDL. Both 18:2 and arachidonate also appeared to accelerate α-TOH consumption (Fig. 1 B). The increase in initial rate of rhLO-induced CE-O(O)H accumulation in LDL (1 μm in apoB) showed a dose dependence with increasing amounts of 18:2, which became saturated at ∼200 μm 18:2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, 18:2 supplementation of LDL had no significant effect on the rate of CE-O(O)H accumulation when LDL oxidation was induced nonenzymically by aqueous peroxyl radicals (AAPH) or Cu2+ions (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the enhancing effect of supplemented 18:2 on CE peroxidation is specific for rhLO as the oxidant. The data are also consistent with 18:2 supplementation of LDL increasing rhLO-induced CE-O(O)H accumulation by increasing the formation of FFA peroxyl radicals from the enzymic reaction. As PLA2 cleaves FFA in PL to generate free FFA substrates for 15-LO, we examined its effect on rhLO-induced CE-O(O)H accumulation in LDL. In the presence of 2.9 μm PLA2 the FFA content of LDL increased to approximately 90 μm. 2J. Neužil, unpublished data. Similarly to exogenous addition of FFA, PLA2 significantly increased CE-O(O)H accumulation and α-TOH loss in LDL following incubation with rhLO (Fig. 3). These results suggest that substrates for rhLO are released from PL in LDL by PLA2action and that rhLO conversion of these substrates increases the radical flux to which the lipoprotein is exposed. The direct detection of FFA peroxyl radicals by EPR requires large amounts of materials (21Chamulitrat W. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20968-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that greatly exceed the amounts of human LDL readily available to us. For this reason, we did not attempt to measure FFA peroxyl radicals in LDL undergoing rhLO-induced oxidation. However, the FFA peroxyl radicals demonstrated to be released by 15-LO (21Chamulitrat W. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20968-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would be expected to be scavenged by LDL's α-TOH, quantitatively the major and most important peroxyl radical scavenger in LDL. We therefore assessed the effect of 10 μm 18:2 supplementation, or addition of 2.5 μm PLA2, on the formation of α-TO⋅, the product of such a putative reaction. As expected, both conditions led to an enhanced rate of formation of α-TO⋅in LDL exposed to 15-LO, as measured by EPR spectroscopy (Fig.4). As 15-LO was required in large amounts for these experiments, it was necessary to use the more readily available, commercial SLO. In addition, it was also necessary to concentrate the LDL to ∼6 μm apoB to afford α-TO⋅ concentrations sufficient for quantitation (30Witting P.K. Upston J.M. Stocker R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The rate of α-TO⋅ accumulation in control LDL following exposure to SLO (1.74 μm) increased with time, with a steady-state level reached after ∼3 h (Fig. 4); this corresponded to 0.36–0.45 μm in different pooled preparations. FFA supplementation of LDL significantly shortened the time required to reach steady-state α-TO⋅ levels from 3 to 1 h with 18:2 or to 2 h for PLA2, although the steady-state α-TO⋅concentration remained unaffected (Fig. 4). The above results suggest that enzymic oxidation of 18:2 results in α-TO⋅ formation during 15-LO-induced LDL oxidation. We therefore exposed native LDL (∼1 μm in apoB) to SLO (1.1 μm) and analyzed for enzymic and nonenzymic lipid oxidation products after reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxides, but without saponification of the samples (see “Experimental Procedures”). SLO was used for these studies due to the large amount of enzyme required to detect the small amounts of FFA oxidation products by UV234 nm (20Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2650-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 5, formation of 18:2-OH was rapid and reached a maximum after 30 min. Both the regio- and stereoisomers of 18:2-OH were determined: at 15 and 60 min 13-(Z,E)-18:2-OH corresponded to 73 ± 10 and 62 ± 13% (n = 3, mean values ± S.D.), respectively, of the total 18:2-OH detected. At the same time points, 94 ± 9 and 100 ± 10%, respectively (n = 3, mean values ± S.D.), comprised the enzymic Sstereoisomer. Thus, 18:2 oxidation in native LDL exposed to SLO is largely enzymic. Analysis of the regio- and stereoisomers of Ch18:2-OH formed in the same LDL exposed to SLO demonstrates that these products were formed primarily via nonenzymic proc"

However, a recent study reported that 17β-estradiol (E2) inhibited Ah responsiveness in mouse Hepa 1c1c7 hepatoma cells (Kharat, I., and Saatcioglu, F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 10533–10537), and therefore, estrogen receptor-AhR cross-talk was reinvestigated in MCF-7 and mouse Hepa 1c1c7 cells. Treatment of MCF-7 or Hepa 1c1c7 cells with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) resulted in induction of CYP1A1-dependent activity and mRNA levels. Treatment of both cell lines with E2 had no effect on basal or TCDD-inducible CYP1A1-dependent activity or mRNA levels. In MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells transiently transfected with an Ah-responsive plasmid containing the 5′-regulatory region of the human CYP1A1 gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene 10 nm TCDD significantly induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity; in cells cotreated with TCDD plus E2 the induced response was not affected by the hormone. Nuclear extracts from cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide, E2, TCDD, and TCDD plus E2 were incubated with the [32P]dioxin-responsive element and analyzed by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A retarded band associated with formation of a [32P]dioxin-responsive element-AhR complex was observed in nuclear extracts from cells treated with TCDD or TCDD plus E2 (cotreated). Collectively these studies suggest that E2 does not modulate AhR-mediated CYP1A1 gene expression in MCF-7 or Hepa 1c1c7 cells.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been identified as the initial cellular target for TCDD and related compounds, and results of most studies indicate that the effects of these chemicals are mediated through the AhR. The AhR is a ligand-induced nuclear transcription factor, which forms a heterodimer with the AhR nuclear translocator protein. Based on extensive studies with the CYP1A1 gene, ligand-induced transactivation is associated with interaction between the nuclear AhR complex and cis-genomic dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) located in the 5′-promoter region of responsive genes (2Whitlock J.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that TCDD modulates estrogen (E2)-induced pathways in human breast cancer cells. For example, treatment of MCF-7 cells with E2 increases cell proliferation (3Gierthy J.F. Bennett J.A. Bradley L.M. Cutler D.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3149-3153PubMed Google Scholar); procathepsin D, cathepsin D (4Beigel L. Safe S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The mechanism of AhR-mediated inhibition of E2-induced cathepsin D (9Krishnan V. Wang X. Safe S. J. Biol.

McDonell P. Wu Z.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2707-2713PubMed Google Scholar) gene expression involves interactions of the nuclear AhR complex with inhibitory dioxin-responsive elements strategically located in the promoter regions of these genes. Vickers et al. (10Vickers P.J. Dufresne M.J. Cowan K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) first pointed out that for a series of ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines only the former cells were Ah-responsive as determined by induction ofCYP1A1 gene expression by TCDD. In contrast, breast cancer cell lines such as ER-negative MDA-MB-231 (11Thomsen J.S. Wang X. Hines R.N. Safe S. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Hs578T (12Wang W.L. Thomsen J.S. Porter W. Moore M. Safe S. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) cells express the AhR and AhR nuclear translocator proteins, but TCDD did not induce CYP1A1 or reporter gene activity in cells transiently transfected with Ah-responsive constructs. Research in this laboratory showed that transient transfection of the ER or variant ERs expressing activation function 1 or activation function 2 restored Ah responsiveness in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (11Thomsen J.S. Wang X. Hines R.N. Safe S. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Wang W.L. Thomsen J.S. Porter W. Moore M. Safe S. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of cross-talk between the ER and AhR are unknown the results suggest that the ER plays an important role in AhR-mediated gene expression in both ER-positive and ER-negative human breast cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, Kharat and Saatcioglu (13Kharat I. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10533-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) reported that E2 significantly inhibited TCDD-induced reporter gene activity in Hepa 1c1c7 cells transiently transfected with an Ah-responsive construct. Moreover, in gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from cells treated with TCDD or TCDD plus E2 (cotreated), they reported that hormone treatment blocked formation of the TCDD-induced retarded band. These data were inconsistent with results of previous studies, and therefore the effects of E2 on Ah responsiveness have been reinvestigated in both MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that E2 does not affect Ah responsiveness in either cell line. TCDD was prepared in this laboratory and was determined to be >99% pure by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. All other chemicals and biochemicals were of the highest quality available from commercial suppliers. Pure ER was purchased from PanVera (Madison, WI). The human wild type double-stranded DRE oligonucleotide 5′-GATCTCCGGTCCTTCTCACGCAACGCCTGGGG-3′ and mutant DRE 5′-GATCTCCGGTCCTTCTACATCAACGCCTGGGG-3′ were synthesized by Gene Technologies Laboratory (College Station, TX). The human adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). MCF-7 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen, Newark, NJ), 10 μg/liter insulin, 2.38 g/liter HEPES, 1.0 g/liter glucose, 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, and 2 ml/liter antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) solution. Hepa 1c1c7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3 and 10 ml/liter antibiotic/antimycotic solution. All cells were grown on 150-cm2 tissue culture dishes in a 37 °C incubator with a humidified mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were subcultured at approximately 80% confluency. For induction experiments cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped serum and 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3 and 10 ml/liter antibiotic/antimycotic solution for 2 days prior to treatment and then maintained in this medium throughout the experiment. The pRNH11c plasmid containing the −1140 to +2435 promoter region of the human CYP1A1 gene fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Hines (Wayne State University). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Gene Technologies Laboratory, Institute for Developmental and Molecular Biology, Texas A&M University or by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Primers used to amplify human and mouse CYP1A1 were as follows: B0350, 5′-TAGACACTGATCTGGCTGCAG-3′; B0351, 5′-GGGAAGGCTCCATCAGCATC-3′; mCYP1A1F, 5′-ACATCACAGACAGCCTCATTGA-3′ and 5′-CCACTGGTTCACAAAGACACA-3′, respectively. Optimal annealing temperature and cycle number for each primer set were determined empirically to be 60 °C (23 cycles) for B0350/B0351 and 58 °C (25 cycles) for mCYP1A1F/mCYP1A1R. PCR reagents were purchased from Perkin-Elmer, and all experiments were performed using a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Foster City, CA) or MJ Research DNA Engine (Watertown, MA) in 600:1 thin walled reaction tubes (Phenix, Hayward, CA). Total RNA was extracted by the RNAzol method (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and quantitated by UV spectroscopy. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using exogenous internal controls was used for analysis of CYP1A1 messenger RNA in mouse and human cells. A 592-base pair internal control was produced by reverse transcribing 200 ng of total RNA from MCF-7 or Hepa 1c1c7 cells followed by 30 rounds of PCR using primers containing a sequence specific to human β-actin ligated distally to sequences containing primer sites for amplification of human or mouse CYP1A1 (see above). PCR products were preparatively separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), excised using a sterile scalpel blade, and extracted using a modified crush and soak method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 187-210Google Scholar). The forward primer B0350F or mCYP1A1F was end-labeled with [32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 50:1 and quantitated by liquid scintillation in a Beckman LS 5000 TD spectrometer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) using Ecoscint A scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics). Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 25 min using an oligo(dT)16 primer. Subsequent amplification was performed in 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μm each primer, 1 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). 200 (human) or 50 fg (mouse) of internal control was spiked into each reaction. Following amplification, products were separated on an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, quantified using a Betagen Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA), and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film (Rochester, NY). Cells were seeded onto 60-mm2 tissue culture dishes, and when 70–80% confluency was achieved, transient transfection of protein-encoding constructs was carried out. 10 μg of pRNH11c or vector only were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. 6 h later, cells were shocked with 25% Me2SO for 4 min. Cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD in the absence/presence of 10 nm E2 or Me2SO vehicle (final concentration, 0.2%) 18 h after the Me2SO shock. 48 h after treatment cells were harvested, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plate, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and lysates were prepared by 3-min cycles (× 3) of freeze-thaw and sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was decanted, and the protein concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). For determination of CAT activity selected amounts of protein were diluted in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubated at 56 °C for 5 min to remove endogenous deacetylase activity.d-Threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (0.2 mCi, NEN Life Science Products) and 4 mm acetyl-CoA were added and incubated for 18 h in a 37 °C water bath. After incubation, 700 μl of ethyl acetate was added, and the samples were mixed by vortexing and centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 12,000 rpm. A 600-μl aliquot of the upper phase was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube, dried, and then dissolved in 20 μl of ethyl acetate, and spotted onto a Whatman PE SilG thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Kent, UK), and the substrate and acetylated products were resolved using chloroform:methanol (95:5%). The TLC plate was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film overnight for visualization of radiolabeled acetylated metabolite. Cells were seeded into 48-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells/well in 0.5 ml of media. After 24 h, plates were treated with 1 nm TCDD or Me2SO vehicle. The kinetic conversion of ethoxyresorufin to resorufin was used as an indicator of CYP1A1-dependent activity. EROD activity and protein determinations were measured in the same samples as described by Kennedy and Jones (16Kennedy S.W. Jones S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Analysis was conducted on a CytoFluor 2350 plate reader at 530 nm/590 nm for resorufin production and 400 nm/460 nm for fluorescamine protein determination. Cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD either in the presence or absence of 10 nm E2 or Me2SO vehicle for 1 h. Cells were harvested and washed with HEGD buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (pH 7.6)) and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g (4 °C). The resulting pellet was resuspended in HED buffer (HEGD buffer without glycerol) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g (4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of HEGD followed by homogenization using a Teflon pestle-drill apparatus. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 1500 × g. The resulting pellet was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in HEGDK (HEGD plus 0.5 mm KCl). The nuclear proteins were separated from cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. Five μg of nuclear protein and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Following addition of 1 nm32P-labeled specific DRE probe, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. For competition with the specific unlabeled or mutant DRE probe or pure ER transformed with 1 nm E2 for 1 h at 25 °C (PanVera), the selected competitor (200-fold excess for DNA probes and 2 ng for ER) was incubated for 5 min prior to the addition of 32P-labeled DRE. The reaction was carried out in 20 mm HEPES, 5% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA in a final volume of 25 μl. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at 110 V in 0.09 m Tris, 0.09m borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Gels were dried and protein-DNA binding was visualized by autoradiography. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. for at least four determinations for each treatment group. All experiments were carried out 2 or more times. Statistical differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance followed by Fischer's protected LSD test for significance (SuperANOVA, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) using p ≤ 0.05 as the level of significance. Means with similar letters are not significantly different. Metabolism of ethoxyresorufin was used as a measure of CYP1A1-dependent activity in MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells (Fig.1). Following treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 nm TCDD, there was a 4.9-fold increase in EROD activity compared with Me2SO-treated cells (Fig.1 A). Cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 nm TCDD plus 1 nm E2 resulted in a 4.9-fold increase in EROD activity. E2 alone had no effect on EROD activity in MCF-7 cells. Likewise, treatment of Hepa 1c1c7 cells with 1 nm TCDD alone and in the presence of E2 resulted in a 5.6- and 6.1-fold increase, respectively, in EROD activity (Fig. 1 B). In Hepa 1c1c7 cells E2 did not significantly induce EROD activity and E2 did not inhibit induction of EROD activity by TCDD in either cell line. Competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to determine the effect of E2 on induction of CYP1A1 mRNA levels by TCDD in MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells. Consistent with the results obtained for induction of EROD activity, CYP1A1 mRNA levels were induced by 10 nm TCDD in both cell lines in the absence or presence of 10 nm E2 (Fig. 2,A and B). TCDD causes a 8.7- and 24.1-fold induction of mRNA levels in MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells (lane 2), respectively. Me2SO and E2 alone did not induceCYP1A1 mRNA levels (lanes 1 and3), and E2 did not significantly inhibit induction in either cell line (lanes 4). To evaluate the effects of E2 on TCDD-mediated induction of an ectopically expressed Ah-responsive plasmid, MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells were transiently transfected with pRNH11c, which contains the −1140 to +2435 region of the 5′-regulatory region of the CYP1A1 gene promoter, and cells were then treated with 10 nm TCDD in the absence or presence of 10 nm E2. In MCF-7 cells, TCDD treatment resulted in a 6-fold increase in CAT activity compared with Me2SO treatment (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). CAT activity in cells treated with E2 alone was similar to activities in Me2SO-treated cells (compare lanes 3 and 1). Cotreatment with equimolar doses of TCDD plus E2 resulted in a 6-fold increase in CAT activity (lane 4), and this was comparable with induction observed in MCF-7 cells treated with TCDD alone (compare lanes 4 and 2). Treatment of Hepa 1c1c7 cells with 10 nm TCDD in the absence or presence of E2 (Fig.3 B) resulted in a 4-fold increase in CAT activity compared with Me2SO-treated cells (compare lanes 2 and4 with lane 1). E2 alone did not significantly affect CAT activity in Hepa 1c1c7 cells (lane 3). Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells treated with Me2SO, TCDD, TCDD plus E2, or E2 were incubated with 32P-DRE and analyzed by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells treated with TCDD formed a specifically bound retarded DRE-AhR complex (compare lanes 1 and 2in MCF-7 (Fig. 4 A) and Hepa 1c1c7 (Fig. 4 B) cells. E2 alone had no effect on formation of this retarded band (lanes 3), and extracts from cells cotreated with TCDD plus E2 gave retarded bands with intensities (lanes 4) similar to that observed with extracts from cells treated with TCDD alone (lanes 2). AhR binding to the32P-DRE could be competitively decreased by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and8) but not by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled mutated DRE (lanes 6 and 9). Incubation with excess ER had no effect on formation of the specifically bound retarded band (lanes 7 and 10). Basal expression of CYP1A1 is low in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues of laboratory animals and in mammalian cells in culture. In many cells/tissues AhR agonists such as TCDD or 3-methylcholanthrene cause a marked induction of CYP1A1 gene expression, and the AhR-mediated mechanism of this response has been extensively investigated (17Tukey R.H.

Polymorphisms in the CYP1A1 gene and expression of this gene in various tissues are being used as prognostic factors for some cancers (20Kellermann G. Shaw C.R. Luyten-Kellermann M. N. Engl. J.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3692-3695PubMed Google Scholar), and this may be related, in part, to the important role of CYP1A1 in metabolic activation of structurally diverse carcinogens and toxins (20Kellermann G.

Not surprisingly, there are numerous studies that have investigated cell-specific factors which regulate CYP1A1 expression. There is evidence that both cis-genomic sequences within the 5′-promoter region of the CYP1A1 gene and trans-acting factors may play an important role in modulating basal and inducible expression (23Hines R.N.

Moreover, several other factors also inhibit induction ofCYP1A1 and/or CYP1A2 gene expression, and they include interleukin 6 in human HepG2 cells (28Fukuda Y. Sassa S. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 944-954PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these effects may be cell-specific since studies in this laboratory indicate that neither insulin nor epidermal growth factor inhibited induction of EROD activity by TCDD in MCF-7 cells. 2D. Hoivik, K. Willett, C. Wilson, H. Liu, and S. Safe, unpublished results. Kharat and Saatcioglu (13Kharat I. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10533-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) recently reported that E2 inhibited induction ofCYP1A1-dependent responses in Hepa 1c1c7 cells, and these results were in direct contrast to other reports in breast cancer cell lines where ER expression is required for Ah responsiveness (10Vickers P.J. Dufresne M.J. Cowan K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Wang W.L. Thomsen J.S. Porter W. Moore M. Safe S. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reported inhibitory effect of E2 also contrasted to results showing that 17α-ethynylestradiol enhanced induction ofCYP1A1 in cultured chick embryo hepatocytes (34Sundstrom S. Sinclair J. Smith E.L. Sinclair P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2215-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because of these conflicting reports this study has focused on determining the effects of E2 on induction of CYP1A1 and related activities in both mouse Hepa 1c1c7 and human MCF-7 cells. The results (Figs. 1, 2, 3) clearly demonstrate that E2 alone did not induce EROD activity andCYP1A1 mRNA levels of reporter gene activity, and in cells cotreated with E2 plus TCDD the presence of the hormone did not significantly affect transactivation. Moreover, E2 did not affect formation of the TCDD-induced AhR-DRE retarded band, which was detected by gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that E2 does not inhibit induction of CYP1A1 gene expression in Hepa 1c1c7 or MCF-7 cells, and the rationale for the differences between these results and a previous study (13Kharat I. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10533-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) is unknown. Several studies indicate that the ER is important for AhR-mediated transactivation in breast cancer cells (10Vickers P.J. Dufresne M.J. Cowan K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Thomsen J.S. Wang X. Hines R.N. Safe S.

Cancer. 1996; 73: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and this was consistent with results showing that down-regulation of the ER in MCF-7 cells by the anti-estrogen ICI 164,384 was accompanied by loss of Ah responsiveness (35Thomsen J.S. Wang X. Safe S. Toxicologist. 1995; 15: 1270Google Scholar). It is possible that the ER sequesters corepressor protein(s) or acts as a coactivator for AhR-mediated gene expression in breast cancer cells, and current studies are utilizing in vitrotranscription models to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2128917308,"Evidence exists that the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat occurs extracellularly and is involved in the immunosuppression of non-HIV-1-infected T cells of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The mechanism of this immunosuppressive activity of Tat has been controversially discussed. Interestingly, Tat binds to the T cell activation marker CD26, which has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of growth of lymphocytes and to inhibit its dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) activity. Here we show that the N-terminal nonapeptide MDPVDPNIE of Tat is a competitive inhibitor of DP IV and suppresses DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Amino acid exchanges at positions 5 and 6 strongly weaken these effects.1H nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations of Tat(1–9), I5-Tat(1–9), and L6-Tat(1–9) suggest a similar backbone conformation for Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). The solution conformation of I5-Tat(1–9) considerably differs from the other two. However, Tat(1–9) fits into our previously proposed active site model of DP IV in contrast to I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). Conformational alterations with regard to the parent peptide and spatial hindrances between these both compounds and DP IV can explain the loss of inhibitory activity.

Tat protein is a transactivator regulating the transcription of the viral genes and is essential for viral replication in vitro (1Dayton A.I. Sodroski J.G. Rosen C.A. Goh W.C. Haseltine W.A.

Science. 1985; 227: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, Tat exerts a variety of effects on cell growth and metabolism. Interestingly, HIV-1-infected T cells release Tat into the culture supernatant (3Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 4Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R.A. Wingfield P. Gallo R.C. J.

Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) have recently described that Tat sensitizes T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. One possible pathway of mediation of the immunosuppressive effects by extracellular Tat is the interaction with cell surface proteins. Some investigators demonstrated that Tat interacts with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV), an exopeptidase, which cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from oligopeptides with proline or alanine in the penultimate position and which is important for the growth of lymphocytes (6Subramanyam M. Gutheil W.G. Bachovchin W.W. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2544-2553PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl.

Immunobiology. 1993; 188: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of the function of DP IV in the proliferation and activation processes has not been resolved yet. Interestingly, the viral protein Tat is a natural inhibitor of DP IV and evidence exists that the immunosuppressive effects of HIV-1 are mediated at least in part by Tat-DP IV interactions (17Reinhold D. Wrenger S. Bank U. Bühling F. Hoffmann T. Neubert K. Kraft M. Frank R. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated the special importance of the N terminus of Tat. Modification of the N-terminal amino group with rhodamine prevented inhibition of DP IV as well as suppression of DNA synthesis in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated human T cells (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the structural requirements of the N-terminal part of Tat for the effects on DP IV activity and cell proliferation. The DP IV inhibitor Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide was synthesized as described previously (12Schön E. Born I. Demuth H.U. Faust J. Neubert K. Steinmetzer T. Barth A. Ansorge S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1991; 372: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Human IL-2(1–12) and Tat(1–9) peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) technique using the peptide synthesizer 431A (Applied Biosystems) (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Tat(1–86) and Tat(1–72) were synthesized on polyoxyethylene-polystyrene graft resin in a continuous flow instrument (18Kraft M. Westendorp M.O. Krammer P.H. Schukert O. Bayer P. Rösch P. Frank R.W. Maia H.L.S. Peptides 1994. Escom Science Publishers B. V., Leiden1994: 349-350Google Scholar). For rhodamine labeling the resin-bound N-terminal free peptide was incubated with a 3-fold excess of 5-/6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) in the presence of PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinephosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and N-methylmorpholine. The synthetic peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from heparinized blood of healthy donors as described by Reinhold et al. (16Reinhold D. Bank U. Bühling F. Neubert K. Mattern T. Ulmer A.J. Flad H.D. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1993; 188: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PBMC (105 cells/100 μl) were stimulated in serum-free CG medium with tetanus toxoid (100 ng/ml; Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden/Ts., Germany) in the presence of effectors in the concentrations indicated. After 6 days, cultures were pulsed for an additional 16 h with [3H]methylthymidine (0.2 μCi/well; Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. After preincubation (30 min, 37 °C) of 550 femtokatals of porcine kidney DP IV in 1 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate assay buffer, pH 7.4, with 2 μl of effector in assay buffer, the enzymatic reaction was started by addition of 2 μl of 1 mm IL-2(1–12) substrate in assay buffer. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of 30 mm phosphoric acid. Degradation of DP IV peptide substrate was measured by the method of free zone capillary electrophoresis using Biofocus 3000 system of Bio-Rad (München, Germany). Separations were performed as described by Reinhold et al. (17Reinhold D. Wrenger S. Bank U. Bühling F. Hoffmann T. Neubert K. Kraft M. Frank R. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra were measured at 303 K at 6 mm peptide concentration on Bruker ARX500 and Varian UNITY 500 spectrometers. Chemical shifts were calibrated with respect to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-3,3,2,2-tetradeuteropropionic acid (sodium salt). Water suppression was achieved using presaturation during relaxation delay. Torsion angles φ were calculated using Karplus-type equations (19Bystrov V.F. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1976; 10: 41-81Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (953) Google Scholar). For determination of temperature coefficients spectra were recorded from 303 to 323 K in steps of 2 K. Standard methods were used to perform COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY experiments (20Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 229-246Google Scholar, 21Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar, 22Bothner-By A.A. Stephens R.L. Lee J. Warren C.D. Jeanloz R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Crossref Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Pulse programs were taken from Bruker and Varian software libraries. TOCSY and ROESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the TPPI or States-Haberkorn-Ruben methods (23Müller L. Ernst R.R. Mol. Phys. 1979; 38: 963-992Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 24Marion D. Wütherich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar, 25States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). The TOCSY experiment used the MLEV-17 sequence for spin-lock (mixing time,t m = 80 ms) (26Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The ROESY experiment (t m = 300 ms) at 303 K was used for observation of NOEs. For both TOCSY and ROESY, 512 FIDs of 2000 data points, 24 scans each, were acquired. In both dimensions, the data were processed using π/2-shifted, squared sinebell weighting functions. Zero filling to 2000 was applied in ω1. The compounds were energy-minimized to a convergence of energy gradient less than 0.001 kcal/mol × Å using the TRIPOS force field included in the SYBYL MAXIMIN2 module (27Clark M. Cramer III R.D. Van Opdenbosch N. J. Comp. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). The partial atomic charges were computed using the Gasteiger method (28Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3238Crossref Scopus (3627) Google Scholar, 29Gasteiger J. Saller H. Angew. Chem. 1985; 97: 699-701Crossref Google Scholar). A distance independent dielectric constant ε = 78 was used in calculations to mimic the experimental NMR conditions (water solution). The manually built nonapeptides were optimized and used as an input for 200 cycles of simulated annealing dynamic runs. Each cycle included 1000 fs simulation at 1000 K and linear cooling to 200 K within 1000 fs. The resulting low energy conformations at 200 K were optimized by energy minimization. Starting with the most stable conformations found in the first run the procedure was repeated. Those conformations that fit the NMR data best were selected and solvated by water using a precomputed water box of 1400 solvent molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K using periodic boundary conditions were carried out to test the stability of the conformations in solution. During the whole simulation time the overall structure of the three nonapeptides kept in equilibrium with the starting conformation except for the frequently observed breaking and forming of the hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Asn7 and Asp5. In the dynamics simulations we did not take into consideration any restraints based on NOEs of Tat(1–9), I5-Tat(1–9), and L6-Tat(1–9). Nevertheless, the average structures agree very well with all observed NMR data such as NOEs, dihedral angels φ derived from Karplus equations, and temperature coefficients of the amide protons. Interactions of the Tat peptides with the model of the active site of DP IV were studied by energy minimization of the manually docked peptide and fixed backbone conformation of the DP IV model proposed by us earlier (30Brandt W. Lehmann T. Thondorf I. Born I. Schutkowski M. Rahfeld J.-U. Neubert K. Barth A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that Tat(1–86) suppresses DNA synthesis in pokeweed mitogen- (2 μg/ml) and tetanus toxoid-stimulated (100 ng/ml) PBMC in the same concentration range as Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide, a highly specific, synthetic inhibitor of DP IV (IC50 = 2.7 ± 0.3 μm), does (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is in striking accordance with the inhibitory effects of Tat(1–86) and Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide on DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) cleavage. N-terminal-modified rhodamine-Tat(1–72) did not inhibit DP IV activity and had no effect on DNA synthesis (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The short N-terminal nonapeptide Tat(1–9) inhibited 45 ± 5% of IL-2(1–12) cleavage in a tenfold higher concentration than Tat(1–86) (Fig. 1 A). Although Tat(1–9) is not a substrate for DP IV it behaves like a competitive inhibitor (Lineweaver-Burk plot, K i = 111 ± 12 μm, determined with the programs EZ-FIT1.1 and LSTSQ1.10 using non-linear regression; data not shown). This suggests binding directly to or at least near the active site. To prove the specificity of the Tat-DP IV interaction and to identify the amino acids necessary for this interaction, we synthesized N-terminal nonapeptides derived from the Tat sequence containing amino acid substitutions in positions 2–7. Interestingly, significant differences have been found on Tat peptides containing amino acid substitutions in the positions 2, 4, 5, and 6. Whereas the replacement of Asp2 or Val4by Pro (P2-Tat(1–9), P4-Tat(1–9)) had no negative effects on the inhibition of DP IV activity, those replacements of Asp5 by Ile and Pro6 by Leu strongly influenced DP IV inhibition (Fig. 1 A). I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) exerted 22 ± 6% and 9 ± 10% inhibition of IL-2(1–12) cleavage, respectively, compared with 62 ± 6% for P2-Tat(1–9). Similar effects were observed on DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC (Fig. 1 B). P2-Tat(1–9) or P4-Tat(1–9) reduced [3H]methylthymidine incorporation as did Tat(1–9), whereas I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) had no effect. The replacement of Pro6 by the slightly more hydrophobic Leu and the replacement of Asp5 by Ile generated Tat(1–9) peptide analogues which are ineffective in inhibition of IL-2(1–12) cleavage as well as in suppression of DNA synthesis suggesting differences in the preferred conformation of Tat(1–9), I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). Therefore, we performed 1H NMR studies in H2O/D2O (90:10) and molecular dynamics simulations on these three compounds. Briefly, the overall backbone conformations of Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) are similar, but the solution conformation of I5-Tat(1–9) considerably differs from the other two (Fig.2). Docking of the determined solution conformations of the three peptides to the active site model of DP IV, proposed by us earlier, results in a marked difference: Tat(1–9) forms several attractive interactions to the amino acids of the active site, in contrast to both I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). Some of these interactions are missing in the I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) derivatives (compare Fig. 3, A andB) that leads to reduced affinities to the active site of DP IV in comparison to the parent peptide Tat(1–9). Therefore, the model helps to explain the low competitive inhibitory activity of both I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9).Figure 3Stereo representation of the docking of Tat(1–9) (magenta) into the pocket of the active site of DP IV (atom typed) (A) and of I5-Tat(1–9) (B).

Absence of NOEs between adjacent CαH protons and absence of chemical exchange cross peaks in TOCSY and ROESY spectra indicated that the average preferred solution conformation of the three peptides is characterized byall-trans peptide bonds. The3JHN-CαH homonuclear coupling constants for both peptides were in a range of 7.4 ± 0.8 Hz typical for conformational averaging of linear peptides. With a few exceptions no NOEs between NH(i) and NH(i + 1) protons in the ROESY experiments were observed, suggesting that the amide protons are in general not directed to one side of the backbone but alternately oriented. In Tat(1–9) the amide protons of Asp2, Val4, Asp5, and Glu9 showed temperature coefficients −Δδ/ΔT from −7.15 to −8.55 ppb/K indicating intermolecular hydrogen bond formation with another solute or a solvent molecule. Smaller temperature coefficients in the range of −5.00 to −5.50 ppb/K expected for protons shielded from the surrounding solvent were observed for the protons NαH, NγHA, NγHB of Asn7 and the amide proton of Ile8. Theoretical conformational energy calculations were carried out using the TRIPOS force field implemented in the SYBYL molecular modeling package (27Clark M. Cramer III R.D. Van Opdenbosch N. J. Comp.

Of the roughly 400 obtained low energy conformations the preferred solution structure in water was selected by the comparison of all conformations with the NMR data. All vicinal coupling constants3JHN-CαH and corresponding torsion angles ϕ of L6-Tat(1–9) as well as the temperature coefficients of the amide protons and relevant NOEs resembled those of Tat(1–9) suggesting a similar overall backbone conformation for L6-Tat(1–9) (Fig. 2 A). The amino acids Met1 to Val4 adopt an extended structure. Furthermore, two inverse γ-turns appear to exist both between Asp5 and Asn7 and Pro6 (or Leu6) and Ile8. The conformations of both peptides Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) are additionally characterized by a hydrogen bond formed between the carboxyl group of Asp5 and its own NH group (Fig. 2 A). With the hydrophobic side chain of Ile in I5-Tat(1–9) this interaction is not possible. The NMR data of I5-Tat(1–9) (NOEs and vicinal coupling constants) indicated alterations in the backbone torsion angles in particular in position 5 but also in positions 2, 4, 7, and 9. Altogether, a completely different solution conformation is favored for this peptide (Fig. 2 B). Recently, we proposed a model of the active site of DP IV on the basis of a multitude of experimental findings concerning the substrate specificity as well as results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments (30Brandt W. Lehmann T. Thondorf I. Born I. Schutkowski M. Rahfeld J.-U. Neubert K. Barth A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The determined solution conformations of the N-terminal Tat fragments were used to dock to this model. Indeed, we found attractive interactions of several residues of Tat(1–9) with the active site of DP IV (Fig. 3 A). The only slight alteration of the conformation that appeared to be necessary is the twist of the dihedral angle Ψ1 (Met1) by about 180°. In the solution conformation the N-terminal protonated amino group forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Asp2, which may be removed when the N terminus of Tat(1–9) interacts with the negatively charged side chain of Asp739 from the active site of rat-DP IV. The requirement of such a type of interaction for the inhibitory activity of Tat was proved by the substitution of the positively charged N terminus by rhodamine which led to an inactive compound. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val4 of Tat(1–9) and the amide groups of catalytically active Ser631 and Trp630. Interestingly, a number of attractive hydrophobic interactions occur between the Tat(1–9) and the active site of DP IV. Thus, the side chains of Met1 and Asp2 interact with Trp628, the pyrrolidine ring of Pro3 with the tyrosine side chain of Tyr632, Val4 with His740 and Pro6 with Trp630. Altogether, these interactions might explain the competitive inhibition of DP IV. If Pro6 in Tat(1–9) is substituted with Leu the affinity to DP IV is considerably reduced. Based on the energy minimized docking of Tat(1–9) into the active site we tried to dock the L6-Tat(1–9) in the same manner. However, because of the more bulky side chain of Leu6 a strong steric hindrance between its side chain and the side chain of Trp630 occurs (see Fig. 3 A, orange highlighted side chain of Leu6). An energy optimization of this starting conformation led to a conformation of L6-Tat(1–9) where the Leu6 residue may perform attractive interactions with Trp630 but simultaneously other interactions were considerably weakened particularly those of Pro3 and Val4 including the hydrogen bonds of these residues to DP IV. This effect can explain the very low competitive inhibitory activity of L6-Tat(1–9) despite the similarity of its solution conformation to that of Tat(1–9). In the case of the I5-Tat(1–9) derivative both important hydrophobic interactions between Pro6 and Trp630 and Pro3 with the side chain of Tyr632 are almost completely removed in comparison to the native nonapeptide. This is caused by the considerable different conformation at Ile5 which leads to spatial hindrances between the side chain of this residue and Gly629 of the active site of DP IV (Fig. 3 B). This repulsion prevents the diving of this derivative into the binding pocket of DP IV. Even early in infection, T lymphocytes from HIV-1-positive individuals have a defect in mounting an antigen-specific response (31Lane C. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. Whalen G. Waldmann T.A. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 131: 79-84Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that the HIV-1 Tat protein occurs extracellularly and exerts immunosuppressive effects (4Ensoli B.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 2729-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tat interacts with the T cell activation marker CD26 and inhibits its dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and suppresses DNA synthesis in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated human T cells as synthetic DP IV inhibitors do (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6594-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This suggests that the defects in the immune response of HIV-1 infected individuals are mediated at least in part by Tat-DP IV interactions. In previous examinations we demonstrated the importance of the charged N terminus of Tat. N-terminal modification with rhodamine prevented inhibition of DP IV as well as suppression of T cell proliferation whereas the short N-terminal nonapeptide Tat(1–9) inhibited DP IV activity (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With our DP IV assay using the N-terminal dodecapeptide of IL-2 as substrate, we observed a competitive inhibition mechanism for Tat(1–9), suggesting specific binding to or at least near by the active site, although Tat(1–9) is not a putative DP IV substrate because it contains neither Pro nor Ala in penultimate position. To determine the amino acids necessary for the interaction with DP IV we synthesized nonapeptides derived from the N terminus of Tat containing amino acid substitutions. The peptide with Pro instead of Asp in the penultimate position slightly enhanced the inhibitory action. Val in position 4 was also not crucial for DP IV inhibition. However, the exchange of the negatively charged hydrophilic Asp5 with the uncharged hydrophobic Ile generated a peptide with strongly reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that Asp in position 5 is important for inhibition of IL-2(1–12) cleavage. Most strikingly, the replacement of Pro in position 6 by the slightly more hydrophobic Leu generated a peptide being ineffective in inhibition of DP IV as well as in suppression of DNA synthesis. These data suggest that the active site of DP IV would interact not only with the amino acids flanking the cleavage site but also with the amino acids in positions 5 and 6. The N-terminal regions of the well known DP IV substrates neuropeptide Y and pancreatic polypeptide adopt extended polyproline-like helical structures stabilized by having proline as every third residue (proline in positions 2, 5, and 8). The polyproline II helix is an extended structure with three residues per turn. It is found prominently in collagen. Short sequences adopting this conformation have been identified on the surface of proteins in a surprisingly large number of cases. Although very few of these sequences consist entirely of proline residues, the majority contain at least one proline. Many proline-rich sequences function as a “sticky arm” binding rapidly and reversibly to other proteins (33Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Tat(1–9) has two XXP repeats as neuropeptide Y, suggesting that it could form a polyproline-like conformation. The exchange of Pro6 by Leu6 in L6-Tat(1–9) could lead to a change in the conformation and be responsible for the lost inhibitory action of this peptide on DP IV. NMR studies and molecular dynamics simulations of Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9) resulted in similar overall backbone conformations for both peptides without the characteristics of a polyproline II helix and could not explain the reported effects. Using our unique active site model of DP IV developed on the basis of comparative molecular field analysis of competitive inhibitors and by force field calculations (30Brandt W. Lehmann T. Thondorf I. Born I. Schutkowski M. Rahfeld J.-U. Neubert K. Barth A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that Tat(1–9) fits well and builds a number of attractive interactions. In contrast, the bulky side chain of Leu6 in L6-Tat(1–9) exerts strong steric hindrances to the side chain of Trp630 of DP IV, whereas in the interaction with Tat(1–9), the flat aromatic ring of Trp630 binds well to the flat hydrophobic surface of Pro6 implicating the low competitive inhibitory activity of L6-Tat(1–9) compared with that of natural Tat(1–9). The conformation of I5-Tat(1–9) considerably differs from that of the other two peptides, which leads to reduced affinities to the active site of DP IV in comparison to the parent peptide Tat(1–9). Furthermore, the model can also explain why P2-Tat(1–9) exerted the highest effect of all investigated compounds in inhibition of DP IV and why none of these compounds is a substrate of DP IV. In the case of P2-Tat(1–9) the pyrrolidine ring of Pro2 adopts a conformation that allows attractive hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Trp628 and disturbs the formation of a salt bridge between Asp2 and the N terminus in Tat(1–9). It has been shown that DP IV substrates must adopt a γ-turn (C7) conformation around the peptide bond to be cleaved (30Brandt W. Lehmann T. Thondorf I. Born I. Schutkowski M. Rahfeld J.-U. Neubert K. Barth A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Only in this case the catalytically active oxygen atom of Ser631 can attack the peptide bond perpendicular to the plane of the peptide bond. As shown in Figs. 2 and3, Pro3, which is near to Ser631, forms an extended conformation (Ψ = 160°) instead of a γ-turn structure (Ψ = 80°). This would prevent an attack of the active serine to the carbonyl carbon atom of Pro3 and therefore no peptide bond cleavage would be possible. The high similarity of efficiency of the Tat(1–9)-derived peptides in the inhibition of DP IV activity and in the suppression of cell proliferation implies that immunosuppressive effects of Tat are mediated at least in part by DP IV. The importance of DP IV in the antigen response in HIV-1 infected individuals has been demonstrated recently. Addition of soluble DP IV restored the defective in vitro recall antigen response, probably by serving as a decoy receptor for HIV-1 Tat (34Schmitz T. Underwood R. Khiroya R. Bachovchin W.W. Huber B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The existence of a viral immunomodulatory oligopeptide implies the existence of an endogenous counterpart. In previous studies, we found other peptides, e.g. gastrin-releasing peptide(14–27), peptide YY(3–36), and Met-IL-2(1–6), being also capable of inhibiting DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) degradation (7Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many cytokines also have some prolines near the N terminus and are putative candidates for DP IV-mediated regulation of lymphocyte proliferation. Interferon-γ contains proline in position 6 and IL-11, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lymphotoxin, monocyte chemotactic protein I, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β release peptides containing proline in position 6 after cleavage of the N-terminal XP-dipeptide. Experiments with two U937 cell clones gave evidence that control of cell proliferation via DP IV could be a general mechanism not only in T cells but also in other CD26 positive cells, since DP IV inhibitors decreased DNA synthesis of the DP IV expressing U937 cell clones but not of U937 cell clones expressing very low levels of DP IV (35Reinhold D. Bank U. Bühling F. Kähne T. Kunz D. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1994; 192: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on data obtained from biochemical studies, NMR, and molecular modeling we propose that the N-terminal sequence of the HIV-1 Tat protein behaves as a competitive inhibitor and that this protein interacts directly with the active site of DP IV. Tat(1–9)-derived peptides with amino acid substitutions in positions 2 or 4 enhanced the inhibition of IL-2(1–12) only slightly whereas substitutions in positions 5 or 6 led to peptides with strongly reduced inhibitory activity. The bulky side chain on Leu6 disturbs the interaction with DP IV hence explaining on the molecular level why the replacement of Pro6 to Leu6 generates a peptide with totally lost inhibitory effect on DP IV although the overall backbone conformation is similar for both analogues. The different conformation at Ile5 in I5-Tat(1–9) leads to spatial hindrances preventing the docking to the active site of DP IV. The striking correlation of the action of the different Tat(1–9) -deduced peptides on DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) cleavage and on suppression of DNA synthesis in cultures of stimulated PBMC suggests that HIV-1 Tat mediates antiproliferative effects via specific DP IV interactions. Thus, substances interfering in the interactions of Asp5 and Pro6 of Tat and the active site of DP IV/CD26, e.g. by inhibition or competition, might be important for the therapy of HIV-1-induced AIDS. Furthermore, it could be very interesting to construct a recombinant virus wherein position 6 at the Tat N terminus is altered to Leu, to determine whether this has any consequences on infectivity.

This reaction is driven by the energy derived from hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. The most common nucleotide used is ATP. Depending on the enzyme, other nucleotides can substitute for ATP more or less efficiently (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). However, some helicases prefer a single triphosphate, e.g. T7 gene 4 protein is fueled mainly by dTTP (9Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Helicases are typically oligomers, forming either dimers or rings consisting of six subunits. The ring-shaped enzymes are found widely distributed throughout the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic worlds including examples in viruses, bacteriophages, and plasmids. In all of these organisms, ring-shaped helicases function in the various processes of DNA replication, repair, or transcription and were found to have either 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ polarity. Therefore, the common ring structure shared by this class of helicases confers general, not process-specific, functional properties to these enzymes.Three-dimensional structure analysis by electron microscopy of the replicative helicases DnaB, T7 gene 4 protein, and T4 gene 41 protein showed that these enzymes contain either 6 or 12 subunits (11San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DnaB is a triangle-shaped oligomer composed of a trimer of dimers with point group symmetry D3 (11San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas gene 4 and gene 41 proteins are ring-shaped hexamers with 6-fold symmetry (12Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,13Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is not known whether both strands of DNA or just one pass through the central hole formed by the subunits. While initial insights into the three-dimensional structure of helicases were gained by electron microscopical analysis, clues to their mechanism of action will probably be provided by x-ray crystallography.Recently, the first x-ray crystal structure of a helicase was reported (14Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of this monomeric protein derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus remains unclear. Another recent report described preliminary x-ray crystallographic data of the first hexameric replicative helicase crystallized, the RepA protein of plasmid RSF1010 (15Röleke D. Hoier H. Bartsch C. Umbach P. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is one of the smallest helicases known (29,896 Da/subunit). Structural analysis using electron microscopy revealed that, at neutral pH, RepA is a ring-shaped hexamer with a central channel formed by the globular subunits (15Röleke D. Hoier H. Bartsch C. Umbach P. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At pH 5.6, the hexamers aggregate to form tubular structures. Crystallization experiments of RepA resulted in crystals diffracting to 3.5-Å resolution (15Röleke D. Hoier H. Bartsch C. Umbach P. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated the presence of a 6-fold rotational axis within the molecule so that the six monomers are oriented identically to each other.The RepA protein might be the first hexameric replicative DNA helicase for which high resolution structural information is available. Since most of the components of the RSF1010 replication initiation system are plasmid-encoded and characterized, the structural and biochemical data available for this model system can be combined to gain insight into the function and the mechanism of action of ring-shaped replicative helicases.RSF1010 (also called R300B and R1162) is a small (8,684 bp; 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); App(NH)p, β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; App(CH2)p, β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate; Epps, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); App(NH)p, β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; App(CH2)p, β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate; Epps, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6705-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The replication of RSF1010 DNA inEscherichia coli was shown to depend completely upon three plasmid-encoded proteins, the products of genes repA,repB′, and repC (18Scherzinger E. Haring V. Lurz R. Otto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the minimal origin sequence required to support RSF1010 replication has been identified (19Scherzinger E. Bagdasarian M.M. Scholz P. Lurz R. Rückert B. Bagdasarian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This 396-bp sequence (oriV) can be divided into two functional domains. The first domain is made up of three direct repeats of 20 bp and adjacent GC-rich and AT-rich segments of DNA. The iterons are the primary binding site for the plasmid-encoded initiator protein RepC (16Scholz P. Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, RepC promotes localized melting of the AT-rich oriV segment (20Haring V. Scholz P. Frey J. Derbyshire K. Hatfull G. Willetts N.S. Bagdasarian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6090-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The second domain contains two oppositely oriented sites for the initiation of DNA synthesis, termed ssiA and ssiB. These sequences, which are on the plasmid l- (upper) and r- (bottom) strand, respectively, can function in a single-stranded form as a template for the synthesis of a unique DNA or mixed RNA/DNA primer by the RepB′ protein, and they are the primary positions for the initiation of each plasmid strand (21Tanaka K. Kino K. Taguchi Y. Miao D.-M. Honda Y. Sakai H. Komano T. Bagdasarian M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If either ssiA or ssiB is deleted, the plasmid is substantially disabled, i.e. it is no longer maintained in the cell as a monomeric molecule (21Tanaka K. Kino K. Taguchi Y. Miao D.-M. Honda Y. Sakai H. Komano T. Bagdasarian M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Although both of the ssi signals of RSF1010 are required for normal plasmid replication, they can be replaced by other types of priming signals such as the primosome assembly site from phage φX174 or the priming signal from phage G4 (22Marians K.J. Zipursky S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Honda Y. Nakamura T. Tanaka K. Higashi A. Sakai H. Komano T. Bagdasarian M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 1733-1737Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When both ssisites are replaced by heterologous priming signals, the function of the chimeric oriV is no longer dependent on RepB′ but is still dependent on RepA and RepC (23Honda Y. Nakamura T. Tanaka K. Higashi A. Sakai H. Komano T. Bagdasarian M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 1733-1737Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RepB is the full-length product of therepB gene, whereas RepB′ results from an in-frame start of translation (16Scholz P. Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that, subsequent to the initial RepC-mediated destabilization of the AT-rich oriVsegment, the DNA duplex is unwound by RepA protein.The in vitro replication of RSF1010 DNA is supported by a crude extract from plasmid-free E. coli cells supplemented with purified RepA, RepB′, and RepC proteins (18Scherzinger E. Haring V. Lurz R. Otto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 396-bporiV fragment required in vivo is also activein vitro. DNA synthesis in vitro is initiated at the two ssi signals within the minimal oriVsequence and, as inferred from the structure of intermediates seen in the electron microscope, appears to occur asymmetrically, with each plasmid strand being copied independently in a continuous fashion (18Scherzinger E. Haring V. Lurz R. Otto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition by specific antibodies or complementation of mutant extracts implicate E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, SSB, and DNA gyrase as well as the heat-shock proteins DnaJ and DnaK in this replication pathway. The bacterial RNA polymerase and the DnaA, DnaB (helicase), DnaC, DnaG (primase), and DnaT proteins are not required (18Scherzinger E. Haring V. Lurz R. Otto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 2E. Scherzinger, unpublished observations. 2E. Scherzinger, unpublished observations.This laboratory has been examining the activities of the three plasmid-encoded Rep proteins in an effort to define their precise molecular roles in the initiation of RSF1010-specific replication. In this report, we describe the biochemical properties of the purified RepA protein previously characterized as an ssDNA-stimulated ATPase and dATPase (24Haring V. Scherzinger E. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press Ltd., London1989: 95-124Google Scholar), which is also a DNA helicase. We compare some of its properties with those of DnaB, the principal replicative helicase ofE. coli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and BuffersATP-agarose (ATP attached through the ribose hydroxyls, 11-carbon atom spacer) was obtained from Sigma (A6888).

At A 590 = 0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.33 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h. The cells were harvested at 25° C, washed with 240 ml of ice-cold 40 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, resuspended in the same buffer (1 ml/g wet cells), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70° C. Cells (55 g of bacterial pellet) were thawed at 10° C and distributed into centrifuge tubes, and 1100 volume each of 30 mg/ml egg white lysozyme and 0.1 m EDTA was added. After 45 min on ice, the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Brij 58, transferred to a 37° C water bath, and heated to 15° C with gentle stirring. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 90 min, and the clear supernatant was collected (fraction I, 160 ml).Heparin-SepharoseFraction I was diluted with buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% ethanediol) to a conductivity equivalent to that of 0.1 m NaCl in buffer A and applied, at a flow rate of 25 ml/h, to a heparin-Sepharose column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and 0.1 m NaCl. More than 95% of the applied RepA activity was recovered in the flow-through and 0.1m NaCl wash fractions (fraction II, 310 ml).DEAE-Sephacel ChromatographyFraction II was applied directly, at a flow rate of 200 ml/h, to a DEAE-Sephacel column (5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A and 0. 1 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a 2 liters linear gradient of 0.1–0.4m NaCl in buffer A. RepA eluted at 0.17 m NaCl. The peak fractions, comprising 80% of the activity, were pooled and dialyzed for 6 h against buffer A and 10 mm NaCl (fraction III, 270 ml).Affinity Chromatography on Immobilized ATPThe procedure is similar to that described by Lanka et al. (45Lanka E. Edelbluth C. Schlicht M. Schuster H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5847-5851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the purification of the E. coli DnaB protein. A 27-ml portion of fraction III (65 mg of total protein) was adjusted to 10 mmMgCl2 and applied, at a flow rate of 30 ml/h, to an ATP-agarose column (2.6 × 5.7 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and 10 mm MgCl2. The column was washed first with 30 ml of buffer A and 10 mm MgCl2 and then with 30 ml of buffer A and l0 mm NaCl, followed by elution of RepA with 90 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The procedure was repeated four times using the same ATP-agarose column. After each elution step, the column was washed with 3 column volumes of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 2 mNaCl, 2 m urea, 1 mm EDTA prior to re-equilibration in buffer A and 10 mm MgCl2. The RepA-active fractions from the five pyrophosphate eluates were combined (70 ml), dialyzed for 12 h against buffer A and 10 mm NaCl, and concentrated by applying the enzyme onto a 5-ml DEAE-Sephacel column that had been equilibrated with buffer A. RepA was eluted with buffer A and 0.3 m NaCl, and the fractions with an A 280 of > 1.0 were pooled (fraction IV, 9 ml). Fraction IV has been stored at −70 °C for up to 4 years without significant loss of activity.Cross-linking of RepA SubunitsRepA (2 μg) in 20 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol was mixed with 0.5 μl of 1.6% glutaraldehyde and incubated at 25 °C. After the specified time, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 μl of 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and incubation for 5 min at 4 °C. The quenched samples were mixed with 8 μl of a solution containing 4% SDS, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and applied to a 4–12% polyacrylamide linear gradient gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 80:1) containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Electrophoresis was at 14 V/cm for 6 h with buffer recircularization, and proteins were visualized by staining with silver (27Merril C.R. Goldman D. Van Keuren M.L.

Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It was constructed by insertion of theAluI-PstI fragment into M13 mp8 prepared withSmaI and PstI. m0T7–1 and m0T7–2 are derivatives of M13mp7 that carry the r- and l-strands, respectively, of the 777-bp HincII fragment of RSF1010 (base pairs 7907–8684; Ref. 16Scholz P. Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). They were constructed by insertion of theHincII fragment in both orientations into theHincII sites of M13mp7. The 789-nt ssDNA fragment used in the construction of helicase substrates was the product of digesting m0T7–1 ssDNA with BamHI. The released fragment was separated by electrophoresis on, and recovered from, 1% agarose of low melting temperature as described by LeBovitz and McMacken (31LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The sequences of the oligonucleotides ES-1 (22-mer, untailed), ES-2 (45-mer, 3′-tailed), and ES-3 (45-mer, 5′-tailed) used to generate M13 DNA hybrids were as described by Crute et al. (32Crute J.J. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6585-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SF-1 (GCAAGAATTCGTTGACGGATC) and SF-2 (CGTCAACATAACCTCGGACAG) are 21-mers that are complementary to the sequences at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the 789-nt BamHI fragment described above.Preparation of Helicase SubstrateThe substrate with a 591-bp duplex region was previously used to assay the helicase activities of the phage P1 Ban protein (33Dreiseikelmann B. Riedel H.-D. Schuster H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and the phage P4 α protein (34Ziegelin G. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Lanka E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The partial duplex was formed by hybridizing the 3′-labeled 789-nt BamHI fragment from m0T7–1 to m0T8. The annealed fragment contains 3′- and 5′-overhangs of 79 and 119 nt, respectively. The gel-purified BamHI DNA was 3′-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (35Bollum F.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 145-171Google Scholar). Unincorporated ATP was removed by differential ethanol precipitation (29Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The hybridization mixture (40 μl) containing 5 pmol (1.3 μg) of [32P]DNA fragment and 10 pmol (25.4 μg) of m0T8 ssDNA in 0.15 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then incubated at 65 °C for 3 h. The hybridized DNA was diluted 10-fold in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA and used directly as a helicase substrate.The substrates used to examine the requirement for a preformed fork in RepA helicase activity were prepared by hybridizing a 5′-labeled M13 oligonucleotide (ES-1, -2, or -3) to M13mp18. Each oligonucleotide was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (36Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 299-314Google Scholar). Unincorporated ATP was removed by chromatography on a Sep Pak C18 column (Waters) (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The hybridization mixture (50 μl) containing 12 pmol of 32P-oligonucleotide and 6 pmol (14.1 μg) of M13mp18 ssDNA was heated at 65 °C for 10 min and then cooled slowly (1 h) to <35 °C. The M13 hybrids were separated from free oligonucleotide by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-15 m (Bio-Rad) (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).The substrates used to determine the polarity of the RepA helicase movement were prepared by hybridizing 10 pmol of32P-5′-end-labeled 21-mer (SF-1 or SF-2) to the m0T7–1-derived 789-nt BamHI fragment (6.6 pmol), as described for the M13 DNA hybrids. The hybrids were purified by gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Helicase and ATPase AssaysUnless indicated otherwise, DNA helicase reactions (20 μl) were performed at 30 °C for 10 min in buffer D (pH 7.6) containing 0.5 mm ATP. 32P-Labeled DNA substrates and proteins were added as indicated. The reactions were halted by placing the samples on ice and adding 5 μl of 80 mm EDTA, pH 8, 4% SDS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Aliquots (15 μl) were then electrophoresed for 1 h at 150 V through a 10% polyacrylamide slab gel (0.05 × 8 × 11 cm) containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Labeled DNA products were visualized by storage phosphor technology (37Johnston R.F. Pickett S.C. Barker D.L. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The radioactivity present either in substrate or displaced fragments was quantified using the ImageQuant software, version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). Background values of the displaced fragments varied between 0.5 and 3% of the input substrate and were subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of RepA.ATP hydrolysis reactions (20 μl) were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer D containing 0.5 mm[α-32P]ATP (10 cpm/pmol) and 2 μg of M13mp18 ssDNA. Products were separated by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (38Scott J.F. Eisenberg S. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2090962336,"The complete amino acid sequences of two lysine-specific zinc metalloendopeptidases (EC 3.4.24), Grifola frondosa metalloendopeptidase (GFMEP) and Pleurotus ostreatus metalloendopeptidase (POMEP), from the fruiting bodies of these two edible mushrooms have been established based on the sequence information of the peptides generated from the reduced and alkylated GFMEP and POMEP by proteolytic digestions using GFMEP, trypsin, and other proteinases as well as by several chemical cleavages. From the sequences, it was found that GFMEP and POMEP were polypeptides composed of 167 and 168 amino acid residues, from which their molecular weights were calculated to be 18,040.5 and 17,921.3 in accord with the observed (M+H)+ values of 18,028 and 17,927, respectively, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Two disulfide bonds in GFMEP were found to link Cys5 to Cys75 and Cys77 to Cys97. An unusual post-translational modification of GFMEP was corroborated to be a partial attachment of a single mannose to Thr42. Comparison of the sequences revealed that overall identity between the enzymes was 61.3%. Although a highly homologous sequence was not found in sequence data bases except for a consensus zinc-binding sequence, HEXXH, both metalloendopeptidases somewhat resembled a family of metalloproteinases categorized as deuterolysin. These proteases together with GFMEP and POMEP do not have conserved third and/or fourth liganding amino acid residues seen in metzincin or thermolysin superfamily proteins and belong to a novel zinc metalloendopeptidase superfamily.

These proteases together with GFMEP and POMEP do not have conserved third and/or fourth liganding amino acid residues seen in metzincin or thermolysin superfamily proteins and belong to a novel zinc metalloendopeptidase superfamily. Only a few metalloendopeptidases have been purified and characterized from the culture fluids or fruiting bodies of such higher basidiomycetes as Flammulina velutipes, Lentinus edodes, and Ganoderma lucidum (1Terashita T.

They are sensitive to EDTA and a specific inhibitor, talopeptin, and may be grouped into neutral proteinases owing to their pH optima over a range of 6.7–8.5 and specificity toward the peptide bonds involving the amino group of bulky hydrophobic amino acids. Based on these data, their close relation to some MEPs 1The abbreviations used are: MEP, metalloendopeptidase; GFMEP, G. frondosametalloendopeptidase; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; FAB MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; PE, S-pyridylethylated; POMEP, P. ostreatus metalloendopeptidase; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed phase HPLC; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl-chloromethylketone; TLCK, N-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethylketone; AE,S-aminoethylated; BNPS-skatole, 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine. from molds has been suggested. Lewis et al. (3Lewis W.G. Basford J.M. Walton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 522: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) purified a zinc MEP with a molecular weight of 16,500 from Armillaria mellea mycelia and demonstrated its high degree of specificity to cleave peptide bonds involving the α-amino group of lysine residues. The unique specificity of the enzyme was confirmed by its application to sequence analyses of some proteins (4Shipolini R.A. Callewaert G.L. Cottrell R.C. Vernon C.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Doonan S. Doonan H.J. Hanford R. Vernon C.A. Walker J.M. Airoldi L.P.daS. Bossa F. Barra D. Carloni M. Fasella P. Riva F. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, purifying a MEP (GFMEP) from Grifola frondosa fruiting bodies, we have characterized this enzyme with a molecular mass of 20 kDa to contain 1 atom of zinc/molecule. This enzyme has several prominent properties including a high thermostability, a maximal activity in an alkaline range of pH 9–10, binding capacity to β-glycans, and specific cleavage of acyl-lysine bonds (6Nonaka T. Ishikawa H. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). From the fruiting bodies of another edible mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, a zinc MEP named POMEP has been purified that closely resembles GFMEP in its properties such as molecular mass (19 kDa), tolerance to heat and denaturing reagents, and specificity to acyl-lysine bonds, except for its slightly acidic optimum pH (7Dohmae N. Hayashi K. Miki K. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 2047-2080Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings led us to postulate that the lysine-specific MEPs might be inherently evolved in basidiomycetes, because no proteinase with such a strict specificity toward acyl-lysine bonds has been reported in eumycetes. In this paper, we report the determination of the complete amino acid sequences of the zinc MEPs as the first step to analyze the three-dimensional structure, which may provide the keys for elucidating the structural features responsible for the zinc coordinating catalytic sites as well as for the unique specificity toward acyl-lysine bonds. The data obtained in this work present valuable sequence information for the structural relation of these MEPs to various zinc metalloproteinases, which have recently been grouped into some families on the basis of their amino acid sequences and structural features around the zinc-binding sites (8Hopper N.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Fruiting bodies of the popular edible mushrooms,G. frondosa and P. ostreatus were purchased from producers in Niigata and Gunma Prefecture, respectively, and stored at −40 °C.

Other chemicals used were of analytical grade. GFMEP and POMEP were purified as reported from G. frondosa (6Nonaka T. Ishikawa H. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and P. ostreatus (7Dohmae N. Hayashi K. Miki K. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 315-317Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Methionyl bonds were cleaved according to the method of Gross (10Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar) with 1% (w/v) CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid. Tryptophanyl bonds were cleaved with BNPS-skatole in acetic acid, as described by Omenn et al. (11Omenn G.S. Fontana A. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1895-1902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at cysteine in POMEP was effected with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid by the method of Stark (12Stark G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peptide bonds involving aspartyl residues were hydrolyzed in 2% (v/v) formic acid at 108 °C for 45 min according to Inglis (13Inglis A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion by GFMEP, TPCK-treated trypsin, TLCK-treated chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N,S. aureus V8 protease or thermolysin was carried out at 37 °C in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.5, or in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 8.0 buffer containing 2 or 4m urea (total volume, 80 μl) for 18 h at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 to 1:20 (mol/mol) unless stated otherwise. PE-GFMEP (2 nmol) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 m urea (total volume, 80 μl) and incubated with endoproteinase Asp-N (E/S = 1:50, mol/mol) at 37 °C for 18 h. AE-POMEP (100 pmol) was subjected to digestion with GFMEP (E/S = 1:20, mol/mol) in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate containing 2 m urea (total volume, 80 μl) at 37 °C overnight followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight with TPCK-treated trypsin (E/S = 1:50, mol/mol) added to the reaction mixture. To determine the disulfide bond pairs, cyanogen bromide-cleaved native GFMEP (3 nmol) was dissolved in 8 m urea containing 1 mmiodoacetic acid (20 μl) and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h. The mixture was digested successively with TPCK-treated trypsin and TLCK-treated chymotrypsin in an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:20 (mol/mol) each in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 2 m urea (total volume, 80 μl) at 37 °C for 18 h. A mannose-containing peptide, T2 (100 pmol), generated from PE-GFMEP by tryptic cleavage was digested with jack bean α-mannosidase (27 munits) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, (100 μl) at 30 °C for 20 h, followed by another 20-h incubation with an addition of fresh enzyme. Peptides generated by chemical cleavages were first separated by GPC-HPLC on tandem columns of TSK G2000SWXL and TSK G3000SWXL (7.8 × 300 mm each, Tosoh, Tokyo) or a single column of TSK G2000SWXLusing a Gilson model 302 pump and a Hewlett Packard HP 1040M diode-array detection system. Elution was conducted with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 6 mguanidine HCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at 215, 260, 275, and 290 nm. Further separation of these peptides or all enzymatic digest mixtures were achieved by RP-HPLC using a Gilson HPLC system or a Hewlett Packard model 1090M liquid chromatograph on an Aquapore RP-300 (2.1 × 30 or 4.6 × 100 mm, Applied Biosystems, CA), a Superspher Select-B (2 × 119 mm, E. Merck, Darmstadt), or a Pico Tag (4.6 × 150 mm, Millipore Corp., MA) column. Elution of peptides was performed with a linear gradient of 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 64% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.078% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 or 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 215, 254, 275, and 290 nm with a diode array detector. Compositional analyses were performed by precolumn derivatization with a Waters Pico-Tag system (14Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). The samples (50–200 pmol) were dried and hydrolyzed in vapor phase of 6 n HCl containing 0.1% (w/v) phenol at 110 °C for 20 h. Automated Edman degradation was carried out with an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer connected on line to a model 120A PTH analyzer (15Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an in-house generated gas phase sequencing program. Sugar in GFMEP was identified by the method of Suzuki et al. (16Suzuki J. Kondo A. Kato I. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 283-284Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analyses of peptides were performed by capillary liquid chromatography/Frit-FAB MS on a JMS-LX1000 mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an on-line micro gradient system (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were separated on a capillary column, Fuc18 (0.32 × 250 mm, LC Packings, Zürich) in 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid containing 1% (w/v) glycerol with a linear gradient of 0–64% acetonitrile for 16 min at a flow rate of 3.5 μl/min. Peptides were monitored with a UV detector model 441 (Millipore) equipped with a capillary flow cell (LC Packings) and directly introduced into a JMS-LX1000 with a Frit probe, which was operated at 2 or 3 kV of accelerating voltage in a mass range of 10–2,200 or 10–1,500 m/z, respectively, and the temperature of the ionization chamber was maintained at 50 °C. MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the whole protein and selected peptides were performed on REFLEX (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) or a Kompact MALDI III (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or sinapinic acid as a matrix. Peptides are designated by a serial number prefixed with a letter. The letters indicate the type of digestion: K, GFMEP; T, trypsin; C, chymotrypsin; D, endoproteinase Asp-N; E, S. aureus V8 protease; TH, thermolysin; M, cyanogen bromide; W, BNPS-skatole; CT, chymotrypsin and trypsin; TD, trypsin and dilute acid treatment; TCN, tryptic digestion ofS-cyanylated protein; TKAE, tryptic and GFMEP digestion ofS-aminoethylated protein. The numbers in the peptide designation do not correspond to the order of their elution in HPLC but rather to their positions in the protein sequence, starting from the amino terminus. The overall strategy used for the determination of the complete amino acid sequence of GFMEP is summarized in Fig. 1. More than 80% of the sequence was established by automated Edman degradation of the fragments arising from PE-GFMEP by digestion with GFMEP or trypsin. The sequences of the remainders and the overlaps covering the major fragments were determined based on the sequence data of the peptides derived from two CNBr fragments, M1 and M2+3, by digestion withS. aureus V8 protease as well as those of W3 and D4 generated from PE-GFMEP by BNPS-skatole and endoproteinase Asp-N. The molecular weights of GFMEP, PE-GFMEP, and selected peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF MS and/or Frit-FAB MS to confirm the sequences obtained by automated Edman degradation. The amino-terminal sequence analysis of intact PE-GFMEP established the first 26 residues except for some ambiguities for four consecutive Ala residues. As seen in Fig.2 A, six peptides, K1, K1′, K2, K3, K4+5, and K4+5′ were resolved from a GFMEP digest of PE-GFMEP (2 nmol) by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column. Peptides K2 and K4+5 were isolated by rechromatography. Lacking a lysine residue in the composition (Table I), large peptides K1 and K1′ must be the amino-terminal fragments, in which all four Cys residues and all Trp residues in GFMEP are contained as indicated by the absorptions at 254 (PE-Cys) and 290 nm (Trp) in the elution profile. Amino acid compositions of peptides K4+5 (Table I) and K4+5′ (data not shown) were similar. Automated Edman degradation of peptide K4+5 revealed a 29-residue sequence in which the second Lys residue was placed at the 10th cycle and two Met residues were placed at the 6th and 13th cycles (Fig. 1). Peptides K2 and K3 yielded 18- and 10-residue sequences, respectively.Table IAmino acid compositions of PE-GFMEP and its peptides from GFMEP or tryptic digestPE-GFMEP 1–167K1 1–101K2 102–128K3 129–138K4+5 139–167T1 1–40T2 41–52T2′ 41–52T3+4+5 53–124Asp/Asn (D/N) 17.0 (8/9)5.9 (3/4) 2.0 (1/1) 0.7 (1/0) 4.3 (3/4) 1.5 (0/1) 6.4 (4/3)Glu/Gln (E/Q) 12.7 (5/7)6.1 (2/4) 2.3 (1/1) 1.0 (0/1) 2.9 (2/1) 4.8 (2/3) 3.0 (1/2)Ser (S) 19.1 (22) 11.8 (16) 2.6 (3) 2.4 (3) 7.0 (8) 2.9 (3) 2.6 (3) 6.7 (8)Gly (G)9.9 (10)6.1 (5) 3.3 (4) 0.9 (1) 1.6 (1) 1.1 (1) 1.5 (1) 4.9 (5)His (H)5.7 (6)3.5 (3) 1.6 (2) 0.9 (1) 1.2 (1) 3.7 (4)Arg (R)3.8 (4)3.2 (3) 0.9 (1) 1.2 (1) 1.0 (1) 1.0 (1) 2.0 (2)Thr (T) 15.1 (19) 11.1 (12) 4.6 (6) 1.4 (1) 4.0 (4) 2.2 (2) 2.1 (2) 9.1 (11)Ala (A) 24.0 (24)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 13.0 (14) 2.6 (2) 4.0 (4)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 4.0 (4)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 9.2 (10) 6.0 (6)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.Pro (P)5.5 (5)2.5 (2) 1.1 (1) 1.5 (2) 1.1 (1) 2.0 (2)Tyr (Y) 12.5 (13)8.3 (10) 1.9 (2) 0.8 (1) 2.7 (3) 2.1 (2) 1.9 (2) 4.6 (5)Val (V)6.0 (6)4.0 (4)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 1.0 (1)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 0.8 (1) 1.3 (1) 3.8 (4)Met (M)3.1 (3)0.7 (1) 0.9 (2) 0.9 (2)PE-Cys (C)4.4 (4)3.0 (4) 1.1 (1) 3.3 (3)Ile (I)0.9 (1)0.8 (1) 1.0 (1)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 1.0 (1)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.Leu (L)7.4 (7)4.7 (5) 1.0 (1) 0.9 (1) 3.0 (3)1-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked. 2.9 (3)Phe (F)8.1 (8)5.8 (6) 1.0 (1) 0.9 (1) 1.2 (1) 1.2 (1) 5.8 (6)Trp (W)+ (2)1-bThe symbol + indicates the presence of absorbance at 290 nm.+ (2)+ (1)+ (1)Lys (K)4.2 (4) 0.8 (1) 1.0 (1) 1.6 (2) 1.1 (1)Total residues16710127102940121272Yield (%) 43.727.659.3 5.528.417.5 8.224.3Results are expressed as residues/peptide or protein by amino acid analysis or, in parentheses, from the sequence (Fig. 1).1-a Each composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.1-b The symbol + indicates the presence of absorbance at 290 nm.

Seven peptides, T1, T2, T2′, T3+4+5, T6+7, T8+9, and T8+9′ generated from PE-GFMEP (2 nmol) by tryptic digestion were separated on an Aquapore RP-300 column, as shown in Fig.2 B. Tryptic digestion was incomplete as evidenced by the presence of undigested protein peak eluted following peptide T1. As seen in Table I, amino acid compositions of T2 and T2′ were identical. Those of T8+9 and T8+9′ were very similar (data not shown) not only to each other but also to those of K4+5 (Table I) and K4+5′. Amino acid compositions of T3+4+5 (Table I) and T6+7 (data not shown) revealed that they were overlap peptides containing some Arg and/or Lys residues unsusceptible to tryptic digestion even in the presence of 2m urea. Four peptides, T1, T2, T2′, and T3+4+5 were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analyses (Fig. 1). Peptide T1 turned out to be the amino-terminal fragment as expected from its high content of Ala. Although peptide T2 did not yield any significant PTH signals in the second cycle of the Edman degradation, T2′ yielded PTH-Thr. T3+4+5 was sequenced up to 40 cycles, although some residues remained unidentified. Fragments of PE-GFMEP (5 nmol) by CNBr cleavage were first fractionated by GPC-HPLC as shown in Fig. 2 C and four peptides were isolated by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column. Fragments M2+3 and M2+3+4 are large peptides containing one and two uncleaved Met residues, respectively. The sequence analysis together with MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the carboxyl-terminal fragment M4 (devoid of homoserine) confirmed the carboxyl terminus of GFMEP (Fig.1). To obtain the sequence of the missing portions and to overlap fragmental sequences, fragments M1 and M2+3 were digested with S. aureus V8 protease. Two peptides each were separated from the digests by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column, M1-E1 and M1-E2 from M1 and M2+3-E1 and M2+3-E2 from M2+3. Analysis of peptide M1-E2 completed the sequence of peptide T1 and overlapped to peptide T2 and to T3+4+5 (Fig. 1). The sequence of peptide M2+3-E1 filled the gaps left in that of peptide T3+4+5 and extended the continuous amino-terminal sequence to residue 91. Likewise, the sequence of M2+3-E2 provided overlaps in the carboxyl-terminal portion resulting in the alignment of K peptides in the order of K2-K3-K4+5. Cleavage of tryptophanyl bonds in PE-GFMEP (5 nmol) by BNPS-skatole resulted in the formation of five fragments, W1, W2, W3, W1+2, and W2+3, the latter two being overlap fragments. They were isolated by GPC-HPLC on a TSKgel G2000SWXL column followed by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (data not shown). The 25-residue sequence of a lysine-containing carboxyl-terminal fragment W3 confirmed the overlap between K2 and M2+3-E2 (Fig. 1). To fill the gap left between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences, endoproteinase Asp-N was employed to generate a peptide D4. The digest of PE-GFMEP (5 nmol) was separated by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (data not shown). Among the peptides isolated, a peptide D4 was selected on the basis of PE-Cys- and Trp-containing (254 and 290 nm-absorbing) peptide and subjected to Edman degradation. The 34-residue sequence obtained provided a solid overlap between T3+4+5 and K2 and resulted in the completion of the 167-residue sequence of GFMEP. To assign the locations of the two disulfide bonds, the CNBr-cleaved native GFMEP (5 nmol) was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin and subjected to RP-HPLC. A peptide fraction that was not present in the reduced digest was applied to automated Edman degradation. The peptide yielded two PTH-derivatives in each cycle except for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th cycles, where three PTH-derivatives were observed, and PTH-cystine could be identified in the 5th and 6th cycles (Fig. 3). In addition, Edman degradation of the disulfide bonded CNBr fragment composed of M1 and M2+3 yielded two PTH-derivatives in each cycle except for the 5th cycle, where a single PTH-derivative (PTH-Phe) was observed, and PTH-cystine could be identified in the 12th cycle along with PTH-Ala. These results are compatible with disulfide pairs of Cys5-Cys75 and Cys77-Cys97. Sequence analyses of tryptic peptides T2 and T2′ indicated that Thr42 was partially modified. To identify the modification to Thr42, T2 and T2′ (100 pmol, each) were subjected to capillary liquid chromatography/Frit-FAB MS. The masses (MH+) of T2 and T2′ were determined to be 1,629 and 1,467 atomic mass units, respectively. The latter matches with the value calculated from the sequence of the peptide, 1467.7. The difference of 162 in the mass values between these peptides indicated the attachment of a hexose to the hydroxyl group of Thr42 throughO-glycosidic linkage. Hence, GFMEP (90 μg) was hydrolyzed at 100 °C with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h, and the sugar released was pyridylaminated and analyzed by HPLC on a TSKgel Sugar AXI column using pyridylaminated derivatives of glucose, mannose, and galactose as the standards (16Suzuki J. Kondo A. Kato I. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 283-284Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A single peak at retention time corresponding to pyridylaminated mannose was detected (data not shown). Mannosyl residue was completely split off from T2 by the action of jack bean α-mannosidase, and the resulting T2 yielded a peptide peak on an Aquapore RP-300 column at the same retention time as that of T2′ (data not shown). The susceptibility of mannosyl residue in T2 to jack bean α-mannosidase presented an unambiguous proof for α-configuration of glycosidic linkage to Thr42 in GFMEP. Compositional analysis of POMEP revealed that this protein completely lacks two valuable residues, Met and Lys, for sequence analysis (TableII). Resistance of the protein, especially in the amino-terminal half, even after reduction and pyridylethylation in complete denaturing condition (6 mguanidine HCl), to proteolytic digestions with a prior denaturing step at 8 m urea combined with the absence of the strategic residues required use of a rather uncommon fragmentation procedure: tryptic digest following chemical cleavage by cyanylation (12Stark G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows the complete amino acid sequence of POMEP derived from the sequence data of tryptic fragments of PE- andS-cyanylated POMEP as well as those of BNPS-skatole cleavage of PE-POMEP. Overlaps between the major fragments were obtained from chymotryptic peptide W1-CH1 of a BNPS-skatole fragment W1, tryptic peptide TD1 of PE-POMEP pre-treated with 2% (v/v) formic acid, thermolytic peptides TH1, TH2, and TH3, peptide TKAE1 generated from AE-POMEP by successive digestion with trypsin and GFMEP, peptide T7-D3 from endoproteinase Asp-N digestion of T7, and peptide E4 from V8 protease digestion of PE-POMEP. Edman degradation of the native protein revealed the amino-terminal sequence of 36 residues, except for the 6th and 34th residues where no significant PTH-derivative was observed.Table IIAmino acid compositions of PE-POMEP and its tryptic peptidesPE-POMEP 1–168T1 1–10T2+3+4 11–112T5 113–125T6 126–144T5+6 113–144T7 145–168Asp/Asn (D/N)20.9 (7/13)10.4 (3/8)2.8 (2/1)3.4 (2/1)6.4 (2/4)Glu/Gln (E/Q)10.9 (3/7)4.1 (0/4)1.3 (1/0)2.0 (0/2)3.3 (1/2)3.4 (2/1)Ser (S)20.0 (23)0.9 (1)13.8 (17)1.7 (2)1.0 (1)2.5 (3)1.9 (2)Gly (G)12.2 (12)1.2 (1)5.3 (5)2.2 (2)3.5 (4)4.7 (6)His (H)5.7 (6)2.1 (2)1.6 (2)0.9 (1)2.2 (3)1.0 (1)Arg (R)6.2 (6)1.0 (1)3.4 (3)1.0 (1)1.1 (1)1.6 (2)Thr (T)17.9 (21)1.7 (2)12.6 (16)1.7 (2)1.0 (1)2.3 (3)Ala (A)22.0 (22)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.2.0 (2)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.10.2 (11)2.9 (3)3.3 (3)6.0 (6)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.Pro (P)4.4 (4)1.6 (2)1.9 (2)Tyr (Y)8.2 (9)5.8 (7)0.8 (1)1.2 (1)1.0 (1)Val (V)7.3 (7)1.0 (1)5.1 (5)1.0 (1)1.0 (1)PE-Cys (C)4.0 (4)1.2 (1)3.6 (3)Ile (I)2.8 (3)1.2 (1)0.7 (1)0.9 (1)1.0 (1)Leu (L)8.3 (8)5.0 (5)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.1.0 (1)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.1.0 (1)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.2.0 (2)2-aEach composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.1.1 (1)Phe (F)11.2 (11)0.9 (1)8.2 (8)1.2 (1)1.2 (1)1.1 (1)Trp (W)+ (2)2-bThe symbol + indicates the presence of absorbance at 290 nm.+ (2)Total residues1681010213193224Yield (%)49.027.056.944.419.662.2Calculated MH+18,346.91,118.311,383.41,442.61,918.03,341.52,560.7Observed MH+18,4051,120ND2-cND, not detected.1,4411,9183,3352,557Results are expressed as residues per peptide or protein by amino acid analysis or, in parentheses, from the sequence (Fig. 4).2-a Each composition was calculated on the basis of the integral value of the residue marked.2-b The symbol + indicates the presence of absorbance at 290 nm.2-c ND, not detected.

Fig.5 A shows the elution profile of six peptides, T1, T2+3+4, T5, T5+6, T6, and T7, which were generated from PE-POMEP (1 nmol) by tryptic cleavage. Table II summarizes amino acid compositions and molecular mass values of PE-POMEP and these peptides. The largest tryptic peptide T2+3+4 contained three Arg residues. Complete sequences of T1, T5, and T6 were obtained by Edman degradations, which were in accord with their amino acid compositions and mass values. As seen in Fig. 4, peptide T1 confirmed the amino-terminal 10-residue sequence and placed a Cys as the 6th residue. T7 must be the carboxyl-terminal fragment, which is the only peptide devoid of arginine. The largest peptide, T2+3+4, was refractory to Edman degradation. Because T5, T6, and T7 do not have the amino-terminal sequence of QTQLN– (starting at residue 11), it is likely that the amino-terminal Gln in the peptide T2+3+4 was converted to a pyroglutamyl residue.

https://openalex.org/W2072068916,"Coagulation factor VIIa (fVIIa), a soluble serine protease, exhibits full proteolytic activity only when bound to its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). Both proteins interact with membranes; TF is an integral membrane protein, while fVIIa binds reversibly to phospholipid surfaces via its Gla domain. In this study, we examine the extent to which the location of the fVIIa active site in the fVIIa·TF complex is determined by the fVIIa Gla domain. A fluorescein dye was covalently attached to the active site of fVIIa lacking the Gla domain (Gla domainless fVIIa, GD-fVIIa) via a tripeptide tether to yield fluorescein-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-GD-fVIIa (Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa). The location of the active site of GD-fVIIa relative to the membrane surface was determined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescein dye in the active site of GD-fVIIa and octadecylrhodamine (OR) at the surface of phospholipid vesicles. As expected, no energy transfer was observed between Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa and OR in vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS, 4:1) because the Gla domain is required for the binding of fVIIa to phospholipid. However, when Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa was titrated with PC or PC/PS vesicles into which purified TF had been reconstituted, energy transfer was observed. Based on the dependence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer on OR density, the average distance of closest approach between fluorescein in the active site of Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa·TF and OR at the vesicle surface was determined to be 78 Å (κ2 =23). Since this value is nearly the same as that obtained with intact Fl-FPR-fVIIa bound to TF, the presence or absence of the fVIIa Gla domain has only a small effect on the location of the active site in the fVIIa·TF complex. The extracellular domain of tissue factor therefore must be fairly rigid and fixed relative to the surface to position and maintain the fVIIa active site far above the membrane even in the absence of the fVIIa Gla domain.

Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of fVIIa toward its substrates is increased several thousand-fold when fVIIa is complexed with TF, calcium ions, and phospholipid (2Bom V.J.J. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which TF increases fVIIa activity has not yet been elucidated. Structurally, fVIIa consists of five domains: an amino-terminal domain that contains Gla residues, the aromatic stack (also called the helical or hydrophobic stack; some investigators consider it to be part of the Gla domain), two epidermal growth factor-like domains, and the protease domain (reviewed in Ref. 3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 508-518Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In the presence of anionic phospholipid, fVIIa binds to the membrane surface, and this binding is Gla domain-dependent (4Nelsestuen G.L. Kisiel W. Di Scipio R.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2134-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have shown that the active site of membrane-bound fVIIa is located far above the phospholipid surface (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound fVIIa therefore projects approximately perpendicularly from the surface with its protease domain farthest from the bilayer, a topography that is similar to those of the other vitamin K-dependent enzymes (6Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when TF binds to fVIIa, the location of its active site above the membrane surface is altered (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cofactor-dependent structural change may be responsible, at least in part, for the TF-dependent increase in fVIIa activity, since this reorientation may serve to align the active site of fVIIa for optimal cleavage of its membrane-bound substrates (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar cofactor-dependent changes in active site location have been observed when fVa binds to fXa (6Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein S binds to activated protein C (9Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Factor Va has also been shown to alter the topography of its membrane-bound substrate, meizothrombin, a result consistent with the proposed cofactor-dependent alignment of active sites and scissile bonds (8Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of fVIIa and a proteolyzed, soluble derivative of TF lacking its transmembrane domain (sTF) shows that the two proteins are aligned side by side in the fVIIa·TF complex (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In this crystal structure, the main areas of fVIIa that contact TF are in epidermal growth factor-like domain 1 and the protease domain, with some additional contacts being provided by the aromatic stack region (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In addition, there may be limited contacts between the fVIIa Gla domain proper and TF, although this is less clear (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The role of the fVIIa Gla domain in fVIIa·TF function is not entirely clear. While removal of the Gla domain (and, in some studies, the adjacent aromatic stack) from fVIIa decreases its affinity for TF, most of the binding energy for this interaction is preserved (11Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Petersen L.C. Schiodt J. Christensen U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amidolytic activity of Gla domainless fVIIa (i.e. its ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of small, tripeptidyl-amide substrates) is indistinguishable from that of intact fVIIa, and this activity is enhanced to the same extent as is intact fVIIa upon binding to TF (11Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that allosteric activation of fVIIa occurs through protein-protein interactions involving TF and epidermal growth factor-like domain 1 and the protease domain of fVIIa but not involving the fVIIa Gla domain. On the other hand, the ability of fVIIa to catalyze the proteolysis of fX (in the presence of membrane-bound TF) is severely compromised when the fVIIa Gla domain is removed (11Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the fVIIa Gla domain is critical for efficient recognition of macromolecular substrates, although the mechanism is not understood. It is possible that the fVIIa Gla domain contributes to fVIIa·TF function via protein-protein interactions with TF and/or the substrate (13Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Byfield P.G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13949-13955Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Ruf W. Kalnik M.W. Lund-Hansen T. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, or alternatively, the fVIIa Gla domain may contribute to efficient recognition of membrane-bound protein substrates through its ability to interact with the membrane surface. Consistent with this possibility, the fVIIa Gla domain appears to be well positioned for interaction with the membrane surface. The crystal structure suggests that the fVIIa·TF complex stands on the membrane on two “feet,” one foot being the fVIIa Gla-domain interacting with phospholipid head groups and the other foot being the connection to the membrane-anchoring region of TF that spans the phospholipid bilayer. Interestingly, the transmembrane domain of TF is connected to the extracellular domain by a span of nine amino acids that are disordered in all three crystal structures of this protein (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 30Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

This suggests that the extracellular domain of TF is connected to its membrane anchor by a flexible peptide that may allow the protein some range of motion relative to the membrane surface. If so, then the fVIIa Gla domain may be required to restrict the mobility of the complex relative to the membrane surface. Thus, as suggested above, it is conceivable that phospholipid-Gla domain interactions are required to maintain the fVIIa active site at the proper location above the surface in the fVIIa·TF complex, just as the Gla domain is obviously required to position the active site of membrane-bound fVIIa in the absence of TF (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine how much influence the Gla domain has in specifying the topography of the protease domain in the fVIIa·TF complex, we have repeated our earlier FRET measurements using a Gla domainless form of fVIIa instead of intact fVIIa. This allowed us to assess the role of fVIIa-phospholipid interactions in establishing the position of the active site in the complex as well as to evaluate the flexibility of the extracellular domain of TF and its junction with the membrane surface. Interestingly, the location of the active site above the bilayer surface in the fVIIa·TF complex is nearly the same whether or not the Gla domain is present. Thus, TF plays a major role in dictating the location of the active site above the membrane in this procoagulant complex, a structural contribution that may have the functional ramifications suggested by our earlier study (5McCallum C.D.

The amount of TF exposed on the outside of the vesicles was quantified by measuring the TF-dependent enhancement of fVIIa activity in a chromogenic assay using Chromozym t-PA (11Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration was determined using a trace amount of [14C]PC (Amersham Corp.) in the samples as before (6Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TF-containing vesicles (TF·PC or TF·PC/PS) were stored at 4 °C and used within 1 week. Steady-state fluorescence intensity measurements were made using the same instrumentation and procedures as described earlier (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distance between donor and acceptor dyes at which singlet-singlet energy transfer is 50% efficient (R o ), the quantum yield, and the spectral overlap integral (J DA) were each determined as described previously (7Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Energy transfer experiments were performed as before (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four samples were prepared in parallel for each energy transfer experiment: samples D (donor-containing) and DA (donor- and acceptor-containing) contained 10 nmFl-FPR-GD-fVIIa, while samples B (blank) and A (acceptor-containing) contained 10 nm of unmodified GD-fVIIa. The initial net fluorescence intensity (F o ) was obtained by the subtraction of the signal of B from the signals of DA, A, and D. Samples D and B were then titrated with TF reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles lacking OR (TF·PC or TF·PC/PS), while samples DA and A were titrated with an equivalent amount of relipidated TF containing OR (TF·PC·OR or TF·PC/PS·OR). The emission intensity of a sample was measured 5 min after each addition, a time that was found to be sufficient to reach equilibrium (i.e. a stable signal), and the net intensity of D, DA, or A (F D, F DA, andF A, respectively) was obtained by subtracting the background signal and then correcting for dilution. The blank signal never exceeded 1% of the fluorescent signal of the D or DA samples. To compensate for any signal in the DA sample caused by direct excitation of the acceptor, the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of the A sample was subtracted from that of the DA sample. The intensity of DA was then normalized by comparison with its own initial intensity as shown below, as was that of D. Assuming that the absorbance of the donor dye in the active site is not altered by the presence of the OR at the membrane surface, the ratio of the donor quantum yields in the D and DA samples is given by the equation, QD/QDA=(FD/(FD)o)/((FDA−FA)/(FDA−FA)o)Equation 1 where F is the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of a sample at some point in the titration and the subscripto is used to denote the initial intensity of the sample. At the end of a titration, each sample was incubated with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml, 20 min, 22 °C) to digest Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa and release the donor dyes from the vesicles. The spectral measurements were then repeated to determine what fraction of the OR-dependent reduction in donor emission intensity was due to Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa binding to membrane-anchored TF. In some experiments, sTF was added instead of proteinase K to compete with TF·PC or TF·PC·OR for binding to Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa (10 min, 22 °C) and thereby release the Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa from the vesicles. Titrations with sTF showed that no further change in FRET efficiency was observed after the sTF concentration reached a 6-fold excess over TF. In other experiments, TF·PC (with or without OR) vesicles containing 200 nm TF were either preincubated with monoclonal antibody TF9–9C3 (61 μg/ml, 30 min, 22 °C), which binds specifically to TF and blocks the binding of fVIIa or GD-fVIIa to TF·PC (19Morrissey J.H. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 247-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), or TF9–9C3 was added at the end of the titration to release the Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa from the vesicles. The normalized Q D/Q DAvalue used to calculate L, the distance of closest approach between the fluorescein dye in the active site of TF-bound Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa and rhodamine dyes localized at the phospholipid surface, was obtained by dividing theQ D/Q DA value before proteinase K or sTF addition by theQ D/Q DA value after exposure to proteinase K or sTF. L was then calculated using the equation (20Dewey T.G. Hammes G.G. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 1023-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), QD/QDA=1+(πςRo2/2)(Ro/L)4Equation 2 where ς is the density of OR molecules on the surface of the vesicles, and R o is the distance between donor and acceptor dyes at which singlet-singlet energy transfer is 50% efficient. Gel filtration over a Superdex 200 FPLC column was used to detect and quantify the binding of protein to phospholipid vesicles as described previously (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The phospholipid vesicles and any bound Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa eluted in the void volume, while unbound protein eluted much later. The vesicle and protein content of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting and fluorescence intensity, respectively. To show that proteinase K digested Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa and liberated fluorescein from the phospholipid surface under the conditions used in the FRET experiments, samples containing Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa (10 nm) and TF·PC (588 nm TF, 1.3 μm PC) were incubated with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml, 20 min, 22 °C) in buffer A + 2 mm CaCl2 prior to gel filtration in the same buffer. Similarly, samples containing 10 nm Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa and TF·PC (588 nm TF, 1.3 μm PC) were preincubated with sTF (3530 nm, 15 min, 22 °C) or TF9–9C3 (0.18 mg/ml, 15 min, 22 °C) and then gel-filtered to show that Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa does not bind to TF·PC under these conditions. Human GD-fVIIa was inactivated withN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-chloromethylketone and then reacted with 5-(iodoacetamido) fluorescein to yield, after purification, Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa. While the reaction of GD-fVIIa with the chloromethylketone was complete, based on the nearly total (>99.9%) loss of amidolytic activity (7Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the number of dyes/protein molecule in our Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa preparations averaged 0.75 when calculated as described by Bock (21Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) because the reaction of the fluorophore with the activated thiol was not complete. For the experiments discussed in this paper, the presence of non-fluorescein-labeled FPR-GD-fVIIa molecules in a sample does not interfere with the interpretation of the spectroscopic data. The wavelength of maximum emission (corrected) and the average values for the quantum yield (Q) and steady-state anisotropy (r) of the fluorescein dye in Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa were found to be 520 nm, 0.41, and 0.19, respectively, in buffer A plus 2 mmCaCl2. The same values were obtained for Fl-FPR-fVIIa (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so the spectral characteristics and environment of the active site probe are unaffected by the presence or absence of the Gla domain. These spectral quantities were also unchanged by Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa binding to TF·PC except that the emission intensity decreased slightly (−OR in Fig. 1). Our FRET experiments utilized the fluorescein covalently tethered to the active site histidine and serine in Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa as the donor dye and the rhodamine in OR as the acceptor dye. The partitioning of the long aliphatic hydrocarbon chain of OR into the nonpolar interior of the bilayer anchors the charged rhodamine moiety at the phospholipid surface (22Cerione R.A. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa was titrated with TF·PC or TF·PC/PS vesicles lacking OR, a slight decrease in fluorescein emission intensity was observed (−OR in Fig. 1). However, when Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa was titrated with either TF·PC·OR or TF·PC/PS·OR vesicles, a much larger decrease in the fluorescein emission intensity was observed that reached a plateau after sufficient TF-containing vesicles were present to bind all of the Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa (+OR in Fig. 1). The OR-dependent decrease in fluorescein intensity results primarily from FRET from the donor dyes in TF-bound Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa to the acceptor dyes at the membrane surface. To focus on OR-dependent changes in donor emission intensity, the data in Fig. 1 were normalized and expressed as the ratio of the donor quantum yields in the presence and absence of acceptor (Fig.2). Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa appears to bind to TF·PC with lower affinity than full-length Fl-FPR-fVIIa, since less TF·PC was required to achieve complete binding of Fl-FPR-fVIIa in our earlier study (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with previous findings that GD-fVIIa has a lower affinity for TF than does full-length fVIIa (11Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Petersen L.C. Schiodt J. Christensen U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Higashi S.

The binding of all of the Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa molecules in our sample to vesicles and the TF-dependence of this association were confirmed by gel filtration (see below). The average separation between free Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa molecules and vesicle-bound OR is too large for significant energy transfer to occur at the concentrations used in our experiments. Thus, if the OR-dependent decrease in fluorescein intensity (Fig. 2) was due solely to energy transfer that occurs when Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa binds to TF anchored in the OR-containing membrane, then the dissociation of Fl-FPR-GD-fVIIa from TF should eliminate the OR-dependent spectral change. We previously used EDTA to release intact Fl-FPR-fVIIa from vesicles (5McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C."

Glut1 is the prototype member of the Glut family of membrane glycoproteins, which comprises four glucose transporter isoforms (Glut proteins 1–4) and a fructose transporter (Glut5) (1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Glut1 is perhaps the most extensively studied of all of the facilitated diffusion-type membrane transport systems. Its kinetic properties have been studied for over four decades in the human erythrocyte membrane (3Carruthers A. Physiol.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C30-C35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the kinetic observations on Glut1 are consistent with a simple alternating conformation mechanism for glucose transport (8Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 597-634Google Scholar), although important transport anomalies have been observed in the human red blood cell that have not been adequately explained in terms of the simple carrier model (3Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Glut1 was deduced from analysis of cDNA clones isolated from human HepG2 (9Mueckler M.

The human polypeptide comprises 492 amino acid residues, exhibits a molecular mass of 54,117, and bears a single N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn45. The 12-transmembrane helix topological model for Glut1, originally postulated on the basis of hydrophobicity analysis (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 12-transmembrane helix model has also been experimentally verified for the Lac permease ofEscherichia coli (14Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a protein that belongs to the same superfamily as the mammalian Glut proteins, lending indirect but additional evidence in support of the 12-transmembrane helix model for Glut1 and other members of the superfamily. We noted that 5 of the 12 transmembrane segments of Glut1 could form amphipathic α-helices and postulated that several of these helices might cluster together in the membrane to form the walls of an aqueous pathway through which sugar substrates traverse the fatty acyl core of the lipid bilayer (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Additionally, we suggested that hydroxyl and amide side chains within these amphipathic helices (helices 3, 5, 7, 8, and 11) might form the glucose-binding site or sites within the membrane via hydrogen bonding to glucose hydroxyl groups. In support of this hypothesis, experimental evidence has been presented that Gln282, within helix 7 (15Hashiramoto M. Kadowaki T. Clark A.E. Muraoka A. Momomura K. Sakura H. Tobe K. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Holman G.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Gln161, within helix 5 (16Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), form part of the exofacial substrate-binding site. We previously reported that a mutation discovered in the Glut2 gene of a diabetic patient (Val197 → Ile) severely disrupts activity of the Glut2 protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and that the corresponding mutation in Glut1 (Val165 → Ile) also abolished transport activity (17Mueckler M. Kruse M. Strube M. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17765-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This valine residue lies within transmembrane helix 5, approximately one helical turn distant from Gln161. The effect of this mutation was completely unexpected, given the highly conservative nature of the substitution, and the unreactive nature of the valine side chain, especially in the context of a hydrophobic environment where valine cannot participate in hydrophobic interactions with other amino acid side chains that might otherwise stabilize transporter structure in the context of an aqueous environment. To investigate the role of Val165 in the structure and function of Glut1, we used an experimental approach involving cysteine substitution mutagenesis combined with sulfhydryl-reactive chemical probes.

Three days after injection, groups of ∼30 oocytes were incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), 1The abbreviations used are: pCMB,p-chloromercuribenzoate; pCMBS,p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; C-less, Glut1 molecule in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either glycine or serine. p-chloromercurisulfonate (pCMBS), iodomethane, or iodoacetate in Barth's saline at 22 °C. The 100-fold concentrated reagent stocks were prepared in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. In some experiments, sugars (2-deoxyglucose, ethylidene glucose,d-glucose) were included in the incubation solution at 200 mm to test for their ability to delay the sulfhydryl reaction. After the 15-min incubation, the oocytes were washed three times in Barth's saline and then used for the determination of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C). We reported previously that the highly conservative substitution of an isoleucine for Val165 of Glut1, a residue that lies in the middle of transmembrane helix 5, dramatically reduces transport activity (17Mueckler M. Kruse M. Strube M. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17765-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Val165 lies one helical turn distant from Gln161, a residue that appears to be involved in forming the exofacial substrate-binding site of Glut1 (16Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). We reasoned that the isoleucine side chain, which bears an extra methylene group compared with valine, might sterically inhibit interaction between glucose and the amide side chain of Gln161 as a result of its greater bulk. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of other amino acid substitutions at position 165 on transport activity. If the hypothesis is correct, bulkier aliphatic side chain substitutions at position 165 should inhibit activity, whereas less bulky side chains should have little if any effect on transport function. The aliphatic series of amino acid substitutions at position 165 of human Glut1 that were generated and analyzed are listed in TableI. The mutant cDNAs were transcribed into mRNAs that were then injected into Xenopus oocytes. Transporter expression and function were analyzed 3 days after injection. Western blot analyses of total oocyte membranes demonstrated that the relative level of protein expression varied somewhat among the mutants and wild-type Glut1 (Fig.2 A) and also varied from one experiment to another, as is often the case with the oocyte expression system. However, laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of oocyte sections demonstrated that all of the mutants were consistently expressed in the plasma membrane as efficiently as wild-type Glut1 (Fig. 2 B). 2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements showed that amino acid side chain substitutions at position 165 that were bulkier than valine (leucine, isoleucine) inhibited activity of Glut1 by 76–82%, whereas side chain substitutions less bulky than valine (glycine, alanine) had little or no effect on transport activity (Fig.3). Although there was a tendency for the alanine substitution mutant to display a lower activity than wild-type Glut1, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0543).Table IMutations introduced into wild-type or C-less Glut1Residue no.Amino acid changeCodon change133Cys → SerTGC → AGC201Cys → GlyTGC → GGC207Cys → SerTGC → AGC347Cys → SerTGC → AGT421Cys → GlyTGC → GGC429Cys → SerTGT → TCT165 in C-less Glut1Val → CysGTC → TGC165Val → GlyGTC → GGA165Val → LeuGTC → CTC165Val → AlaGTC → GCC165Val → IleGCT → ATCMutations were created by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (16Mueckler M.

The first six mutations listed were introduced into wild-type human Glut1 cDNA to create cysteine-less (C-less) Glut1. The seventh mutation listed was introduced into C-less Glut1 cDNA to create the Cys165C-less mutant. The last four mutations listed were introduced into wild-type human Glut1 cDNA to test the effect of aliphatic side chain size on transport activity. The above observations, coupled with the fact that Val165lies approximately one helical turn distant from a residue that appears to interact directly with glucose during its passage through the membrane, suggest that Val165 may extend into the aqueous pathway by which glucose traverses the lipid bilayer, and that bulky substitutions at this position either inhibit substrate interaction with Gln161 or interfere with transport activity in some other way. To determine more directly whether Val165 lies exposed in the aqueous transmembrane pathway formed by Glut1, we first created a Glut1 molecule devoid of cysteine residues by employing site-directed mutagenesis to change all six native cysteine residues to either glycine or serine residues (see Table I). The resultant cysteine-less Glut1 molecule (C-less Glut1) exhibited 77 ± 16% of wild-type Glut1 transport activity when expressed inXenopus oocytes as indicated by [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (mean ± S.E., four independent experiments), confirming that none of the native Glut1 cysteine residues is essential for transport function (32Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We then introduced a single cysteine into C-less Glut1 at position 165 by site-directed mutagenesis. The Cys165 mutant exhibited 55 ± 11% of the glucose transport activity of wild-type Glut1 (mean ± S.E., four independent experiments), a sufficient level of activity to allow an accurate assessment of the effect of cysteine-specific reagents on transport activity. Considering that residue 165 resides in the middle of transmembrane helix 5, if the Cys165 C-less mutant reacts with a membrane-impermeant, cysteine-specific reagent, this would be highly suggestive that this residue lies within an aqueous transmembrane channel accessible from the extracellular fluid. pCMBS was used as the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent, and the structurally similar pCMB served as a membrane-permeable control for reactivity of Cys165 (see Fig. 4). Fig.5 A demonstrates that preincubation of oocytes in the presence of 0.5 mm of either reagent inhibited 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity of wild-type Glut1 by ∼50%, consistent with a previous report demonstrating that this inhibition is due to reactivity with the exofacially disposed Cys429 (33Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of C-less Glut1 was minimally effected by pCMB or pCMBS. However, when oocytes expressing the Cys165 mutant were preincubated with pCMB or pCMBS, transport activity was inhibited by 78 and 89%, respectively. Fig.5 B demonstrates that inhibition of Cys165activity by both reagents was dose-dependent, although the percentage maximal inhibition observed with either reagent varied from ∼60% to ∼90% in independent experiments (data not shown). To determine whether Cys165 is accessible from the cytoplasmic compartment, pCMB and pCMBS were injected into oocytes prior to measurement of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Fig. 5 C shows that neither pCMB nor pCMBS was able to inhibit the activity of C-less Glut1 or the Cys165 mutant when injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. These data indicate that, during the transport cycle, Cys165 is accessible from the external solvent but not from the cytoplasmic compartment, suggesting that this residue may lie within or near the exofacial vestibule of the aqueous permeation pathway.Figure 5Effect of pCMB and pCMBS on transport activity. A, 3 days after injection of mRNAs, groups of 20–30 oocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm pCMB or pCMBS in Barth's saline at 22 °C. Oocytes were washed three times in Barth's saline and then subjected to 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 3. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data shown represent one of three independent experiments.Sham indicates results obtained with water-injected control oocytes; Wild-Type represents unaltered human Glut1;C-less represents the cysteine-less Glut1; Cys165represents the Val165 → Cys mutant in the C-less background.

C, groups of 20–30 oocytes expressing the C-less mutant or the Cys165 mutant in the C-less background were injected with 50 nl of a solution of either 12.5 mm pCMB, 12.5 mm pCMBS, or 25% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, control) and 15 min later subjected to 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The final concentration of pCMBS or pCMB within the oocyte was ∼1.25 mm, assuming uniform dispersion. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data shown represent one of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If Cys165 lies in close proximity to the exofacial substrate-binding site or directly in the sugar translocation pathway, then sugar substrates might compete with and delay the covalent reaction of pCMBS with Cys165. A complete inhibition of the reaction would not be expected, because sugar ligand binding is a transient, non-covalent interaction. Fig.6 demonstrates that sugar substrates can indeed complete with and delay the interaction of pCMBS with Cys165. l-Glucose was used as an osmotic control that lacks affinity for Glut1-binding sites. The relative efficacy of the different sugars at competing out the pCMBS reaction parallels their relative affinity (1/K m ) for Glut1,i.e. 2-deoxyglucose > ethylidene glucose ≅d-glucose (8Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 597-634Google Scholar). Additionally, the observation that the non-transported Glut1 exofacial ligand, ethylidene glucose, inhibited the reaction of pCMBS with Cys165 indicates that interaction with the exofacial substrate-binding site is sufficient to cause inhibition, and that inhibition was not the result of transport into the cytoplasm or binding to the inward-facing substrate-binding site. pCMBS and pCMB were used as sulfhydryl reactive reagents in the above experiments, in part because these molecules bear some resemblance to hexose molecules in overall size and shape (see Fig. 4). To determine whether there are structural constraints on molecules that have access to Cys165, we examined the ability of two other sulfhydryl-reactive reagents, both smaller in size than either pCMB or pCMBS, to interact with Cys165. Fig.7 A demonstrates that neither methyliodide nor iodoacetate inhibited transport activity of the Cys165 C-less mutant. Because this lack of inhibition could be due to the inability of the reagents to gain access to Cys165, or to the inability of the methylated or carboxymethylated cysteine residue to inhibit transport activity, we performed the experiment shown in Fig. 7 B. In this experiment, oocytes expressing the Cys165 C-less mutant were first incubated with either methyl iodide or iodoacetate, rinsed with buffer to remove the reagents, and then incubated with pCMBS under conditions that normally elicit inhibition of transport activity. If the iodine reagents react with Cys165 but the reactions do not inhibit transport, then subsequent incubation with pCMBS should not result in transport inhibition of the Cys165 C-less mutant, because the sulfhydryl group would already have formed adducts with the iodine reagents. The data in Fig. 7 B show that subsequent incubation with pCMBS did result in inhibition of transport activity, indicating that the iodine reagents did not have access to Cys165 within the permeation pathway of Glut1. The experiments described herein identify an amino acid residue that appears to lie within the sugar translocation pathway of Glut1. This residue was originally identified because of its alteration in theGLUT2 gene of a patient with type II diabetes (34Tanizawa Y. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Janssen R.C. Bell D.S. Go R.P. Roseman J.M. Acton R.T. Permutt M.A. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The valine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 197 of Glut2 and at the equivalent position 165 of Glut1 dramatically reduced transport function of the respective isoforms (17Mueckler M. Kruse M. Strube M. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17765-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unexpected effect of this mutation on transport activity motivated the present studies to determine the role of this residue in transporter function. Although Val165 is unlikely to be directly involved in the binding of sugar substrates or in transporter conformational changes given its unreactive aliphatic side chain and in light of the results described here, it does appear to lie within the sugar translocation pathway in the vicinity of the exofacial sugar-binding site. Previous studies have demonstrated that Gln161, which lies about one helical turn distant from Val165 within transmembrane helix 5, may be involved in both exofacial substrate binding and in transporter conformational changes (16Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, larger aliphatic side chains at position 165 may either inhibit interaction of substrates with the amide side chain of Gln161 or sterically inhibit transporter conformational changes. Yan and Maloney (21Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), using a cysteine substitution experimental approach, have defined three distinct regions within putative transmembrane helix 7 of the bacterial glucose 6-phosphate antiporter, UhpT. They discovered that amino acid residues were either accessible to pCMBS only in intact cells, accessible only in inverted membrane vesicles, or accessible in both circumstances, depending on their relative location within the transmembrane helix. Residues close to the exoplasmic membrane face fell into the first category, residues close to the cytoplasmic membrane face fell into the second category, and residues near the middle of the helix fell into the third category. They interpreted their observations in terms of the classic single-site membrane carrier model (3Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4Widdas W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 385-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where one would expect amino acid residues involved directly in substrate binding (in the middle of helix 7 in the case of UhpT) that become exposed to both aqueous compartments during the course of the transport cycle. Residues that lie on the exofacial side of this region may only be exposed to the exoplasmic compartment, and residues that lie endofacial to this region may only be exposed to the cytoplasmic compartment. Their data provide compelling physical evidence for a general model of facilitative membrane transport derived solely on the basis of kinetic transport data. The observation that Cys165 in C-less Glut1 was accessible to pCMBS from the external medium but not from the cytoplasm suggests that this residue lies in the outer vestibule of Glut1 that does not become exposed to the cytoplasm during transporter conformational changes accompanying the transport cycle. The negative result obtained after injecting the reagent into oocytes must be interpreted with caution, however. It is possible that the intracellular pCMBS did not react with the cysteine residue at position 165 for a reason other than inaccessibility of the side chain. For example, there may be a large surplus of intracellular sulfydryl groups that affectively compete for reaction with the pCMBS. Cys165 lies only one helical turn distant from a residue that appears to be directly involved in exofacial substrate binding, and also appears to lie in a structurally exclusive environment, given that iodomethane and iodoacetate do not have access to this residue. If one assumes that the Cys165side chain is inaccessible to intracellular substrate, as suggested by the pCMBS injection experiment, then Val165 most likely lies at an intermediate position between the outer vestibule of Glut1 and the region of helix 5 involved directly in binding exofacially disposed glucose. Regardless of the exact mechanism of the inhibition at Val165, the results reported here lend additional support to our original simplified structural model for Glut1 in which helix 5, along with other amphipathic helices, participates in forming an aqueous transmembrane channel, only accessible from one membrane face at any instant, and containing one or more substrate-binding sites (35Mueckler M. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 31-45Google Scholar). Interestingly, helix 5 of the Lac permease of E. colihas been proposed to play a direct role in the transport of disaccharides. The Lac permease belongs to the 12 transmembrane helix transporter superfamily along with the mammalian Glut proteins, but much more is known about the structure/function relationships of the Lac permease compared with Glut1. Based on a variety of data, Kaback (36Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5539-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) has proposed that lactose is transported across the permease through a pocket or channel formed by helices 5, 7, and 8, and that Cys148 and Met154 within helix 5 are in direct contact with lactose during transport. It is tempting to speculate that overall helix bundling is conserved in all members of the 12 transmembrane helix superfamily, and that these same helices compose the sugar translocation pathway in Glut1. This would be consistent with existing data that Gln282 in helix 7 and Gln161in helix 5 participate in exofacial substrate binding. We thank the members of the Mueckler laboratory at Washington University for helpful discussions during the course of these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2029510213,"The kinetic pathway for the Na+-induced slow → fast transition of thrombin was characterized. The slow form was shown to consist of two conformers in a 3:1 ratio (E S2:E S1) at 5 °C, pH 7.4, Γ/2 0.3. E S2 binds Na+ 3 orders of magnitude faster than doesE S1.

The serine protease thrombin plays a central role in the blood coagulation cascade (1Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therikildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shafer J.A. Higgins D.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1988; 26: 1-41Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thrombin catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin monomer and activates factor XIII to factor XIIIa, which in turn cross-links fibrin, thereby mechanically and chemically stabilizing the fibrin blood clot (3Naski M.C. Lorand L. Shafer A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thrombin also activates factors XI, V, and VIII, important components of the thrombin-generating blood coagulation cascade. In addition, thrombin activates platelets (4Jamieson G.A. Okumura T. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 861-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Activated platelets aggregate to form a platelet plug that, together with the fibrin clot, provides hemostasis. Activated platelets also provide the surface for assembly of components of the blood coagulation cascade (5Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Esmon C.T. Weiss H.J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17049-17057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of thrombin to catalyze the formation of several components involved in its generation is responsible for the explosive formation of thrombin when the blood coagulation cascade is triggered by vascular injury-induced exposure of tissue factor. Thrombin also down-regulates its own formation. Upon binding to endothelial cell membrane-associated thrombomodulin, the specificity of thrombin is altered. Essentially devoid of activity toward fibrinogen, thrombomodulin-bound thrombin efficiently catalyzes the activation of protein C, which in conjunction with activated protein S inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, thereby shutting down the thrombin-generating blood coagulation cascade (6Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Matsuda M. Murayama H. Hashimoto S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 96: 455-460Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Walker F.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1984; 10: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that Na+ and certain other monovalent ions induce a conformational change in thrombin and alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme (8Villanueva G.B. Perret V. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 489-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Lundblad R.L. Jenzano J.W. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Wells and Di Cera (10Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were the first to show that thrombin is an allosteric enzyme existing in two forms, designated as slow and fast form thrombin, and that these forms interconvert upon binding of Na+ to a specific site of the enzyme. The slow → fast transition is also accompanied by a significant increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme (10Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis of thrombin indicates that Na+ is coordinated octahedrally by 4 molecules of water and the amide oxygen atoms of Arg-221a and Lys-224 (12Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A.

Mutation of Arg-221a and Lys-224 to alanine diminishes the ability of thrombin to bind Na+ (15Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The importance of the allosteric regulation mediated by Na+ is that the Na+-bound fast form cleaves fibrinogen with higher specificity, whereas the slow form shows a higher catalytic specificity in the activation of protein C both in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin (16Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The existence of two interconvertible conformers provides a means for expanding the substrate specificity of thrombin and regulating the enzyme via interactions with allosteric effectors. Although Na+-free thrombin has been designated as the slow form and Na+-bound thrombin has been designated as the fast form, the equilibrium distribution of the two interconvertible thrombin conformers in the Na+-free and Na+-bound states has not been evaluated. Additionally, the reaction pathway for the slow → fast transition has not been established. Elucidation of this pathway is crucial for understanding the mechanism of allosteric regulation of thrombin as a paradigm for serine protease specificity in general.

Human α-thrombin (in 200 mm NaCl and 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.5) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. and used without further purification. R221aA and K224A thrombin variants were prepared as described previously (15Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thrombin concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements (E 280 = 1.83 ml/(mg-cm) and a molecular weight of 36,500 (23Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201PubMed Google Scholar). Active site titration indicated that the thrombin was >95% active (19Chase Jr., T. Shaw E.

Solutions of the slow form were prepared by replacing sodium citrate buffer with Tris or Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4 at 5 °C) containing 300 mm choline chloride (ChCl) by centrifugation using a Centricon 10 (Amicon Inc.).

Ionic strength was maintained by addition of ChCl. Several rate constants were determined in both Tris and Hepes buffers. Rate constants determined in the Tris buffer were indistinguishable from those determined in Hepes buffer. The kinetics for the binding of Na+ to thrombin were monitored using an Applied Photophysics SX17 stopped-flow fluorimeter (excitation 285 nm, emission 299 nm).

The kinetics of dissociation of Na+ from the thrombin-Na+ complex were monitored by an Applied Photophysics SX17 stopped-flow fluorimeter (excitation 285 nm, emission 299 nm) using an asymmetric mixing method. Dissociation of Na+ was initiated by a 1:6 dilution of the solution containing thrombin (3 μm) and Na+ (100 mm or 30 mm) with 300 mm ChCl solution while maintaining the ionic strength at 0.3. Dissociation of Na+ (5 mm) from the thrombin-Na+complex in the presence of the crown ether, 1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclopentadecanether, 15-crown-5 (25 mm), in ChCl was conducted by the dilution procedure described above.

The full time course of Na+ or L-371,912 binding to thrombin was simulated using Runge-Kutta digital integration methods, and rate constants for the approach of the fluorescence to its final value were evaluated from fits of the data to Equation 2 using a Kaleidagraph 3.0 least squares fitting routine. Ft=Fi+(Ff−Fi)exp(−kobst)Equation 2 Inhibition constants for L-371,912 were determined from studies of the dependence of the initial velocity for the release of AFC from the substrate on the inhibitor concentration as described previously (20Fenton II, J.W.

The final concentrations were as follows: thrombin or thrombin mutants (10 nm), Z-GPR-AFC (12 μm or 100 μm), and inhibitor (0.1–6.0 μm). Since the inhibitor concentration is in large excess of the total enzyme concentration, the dependence of the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis (V i ) on the inhibitor concentration is described by Equation 3, whereV 0 and K i ,appdenote the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis in the absence of inhibitor and apparent inhibition constant, respectively.

The total change in the fluorescence of thrombin (0.5 μm) upon binding to Na+ was monitored as a function of the Na+ concentration at 5 °C, Γ/2 0.3, pH 7.4. Static fluorescence measurements were performed on an SLM8000 fluorimeter (excitation 285 nm, emission 335 nm) using a thermostatted cell that was flushed with nitrogen and maintained at 5 °C with a circulating water bath. Each measurement was made after thermal equilibration. Thermal equilibration was confirmed by measurement of the temperature of the solution in the cuvette using a thermocouple. Fig. 1 depicts the dependence of the difference in thrombin fluorescence (arbitrary units) in the presence of Na+ (F f ) and absence (F o ) of Na+ on the Na+concentration at 5 °C. A value of 5.0 mm for the apparent dissociation constant K d was obtained from fits of the dependence of the Na+-induced change in fluorescence (ΔF) on the Na+ concentration ([Na+]) to the absorption isotherm defined by Equation 7where ΔF l is the limiting value of the Na+-induced fluorescence change and K is equivalent to K d (Fig. 1). ΔF=ΔFl[Na+]K+[Na+]Equation 7 A stopped-flow fluorescence study of the association of Na+ with thrombin at 5 °C with [Na+] = 5 mm is shown in Fig. 2. Inspection of Fig. 2 reveals that the binding of Na+ to thrombin is a biphasic process with a fast phase that occurs within the dead time of the stopped-flow fluorimeter and with a slow phase defined by a pseudo first order rate constant (k obs) of 32 s−1. Such biphasic binding of a ligand to a protein has usually been interpreted in terms of one of two limiting kinetic pathways analogous to those depicted in SchemeFS1, A and B (23Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201PubMed Google Scholar). In Scheme 1A, Na+ binds to thrombin in a rapid reversible fashion to produce an initial thrombin-Na+ complex (E S·Na+) with an increased fluorescence followed by a slow conformational change to produce a second thrombin-Na+(E F·Na+) complex. This scheme predicts that the rate constant for the slow phase should increase to a limiting value (k 2 +k −2) as the Na+ concentration is increased (Equation 8). kobs=k2[Na+]K1+[Na+]+k−2Equation 8 In Scheme 1B, Na+ rapidly binds to the thrombin conformer E s2 to produce anE F·Na+ complex concomitant with a fluorescence increase. This process perturbs the equilibrium between free E S2 and E S1. In this pathway, the slow phase reflects conversion ofE S1 to E S2. If Scheme 1B were operating, the pseudo first order rate constant for the slow phase should exhibit the Na+ dependence defined by Equation9. kobs=k1+k−1K−2K−2+[Na+]Equation 9 Thus, the observed pseudo first order rate constant (k obs) for the slow phase should decrease from a value equivalent to k 1 +k −1 to k 1 as the Na+ concentration is increased.Figure 2Biphasic binding of Na+ to thrombin at 5 °C, pH 7.4, Γ/2 0.3, 5 mmNa+, 500 nm thrombin as monitored by stopped-flow fluorimetry.

The data listed in TableI indicate that little change in the pseudo first order rate constant for the slow phase (k obs) is seen upon increasing the Na+ concentration from 5 to 150 mm and thatk obs is changed little by increasing the ionic strength from 0.3 to 2. The relative constancy ofk obs observed in the range 5–150 mmNa+, together with the increasingk obs with increasing Na+concentration in the range 250–1000 mm, clearly deviates from the dependence of k obs on the Na+ concentration predicted by either Equation 8 or 9. Thus, Na+ must bind to thrombin via a process more complex than that depicted in either Scheme 1A or Scheme 1B. SchemeFS2, which might be considered as a modification of Scheme 1B wherein Na+ binds to two conformers of thrombin at different rates, is the simplest pathway that can account for the dependence of k obs on the Na+ concentration.Table ISodium ion concentration and ionic strength dependence of the pseudo first order rate constant (k obs ) for the binding of Na + to thrombin at 5 °C, pH 7.4[Na+]k obsk obs 1-aRate constants for the approach of the simulated time dependence of fluorescence to its final value.

Open table in a new tab In Scheme FS2, Na+ is envisaged as binding more rapidly toE S2 than E S1. At low Na+ concentrations ([Na+] < 150 mm), E S1 is converted toE S2 more rapidly than E S1binds to Na+ so that formation ofE F·Na+ fromE S1 proceeds via the pathway,E S1 → E S2 →E F·Na+. An estimate of the equilibrium constant for the dissociation ofE F·Na+ toE S2 and Na+ can be obtained by analyzing the dependence of the amplitude of the fast phase on the Na+ concentration (at [Na+]<150 mm) in terms of the absorption isotherm defined by Equation7. A value of 3.8 mm was obtained from the fit of the data in Fig. 3 to Equation 7, whereK is equivalent to k -2 of Scheme FS2. Analysis of the sum of the amplitudes of the fast phase (F i − F o ) and slow phase (F f − F i ) in terms of Equation 7yields a value of K = 5.0 mm, which as expected is equivalent to the dissociation constant determined from the static fluorescence measurements. Equations Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13, Equation 14 relate the equilibrium constant K d to the equilibrium constants that define the processes depicted in Scheme FS2. Kd=([ES2]+[ES1])[Na+]/[EF·Na+]Equation 10 K−2=[ES2][Na+]/[EF·Na+]Equation 11 K−3=[ES1][Na+]/[EF·Na+]Equation 12 Kd=K−2+K−3Equation 13 K1=K−2/K−3=K−2/(Kd−K−2)Equation 14 Thus, the experimentally determined values ofK d and K −2 of 5.0 mm and 3.8 mm yield values of 1.2 mm and 3.2 for K −3 andK 1. As the Na+ concentration is increased, and k 3[Na+] becomes comparable to k 1, formation ofE F·Na+ directly fromE S1 becomes important. Equations Equation 15, Equation 16, Equation 17, Equation 18 relate fluorescence values observed in the stopped-flow fluorimeter to the concentration of the species in Scheme FS2, where the subscriptso, i, f, and t denote values in the absence of Na+, at the end of the fast phase, at the end of the slow phase, and at time t after mixing, respectively, and ɛ represents fluorescence response factors for the subscripted species.

This rate constant is close to the value for the rate constant for conversion of E S1 to E S2observed in studies of Na+ binding to thrombin, as expected for the pathway depicted in Scheme FS2. Although Scheme FS2 depicts the simplest kinetic pathway for the binding of Na+ to thrombin that accounts for our experimental observations, Na+ probably binds to thrombin via a more complex pathway involving formation of Na+ complexes ofE S1 and E S2 that undergo conformational rearrangements toE F·Na+ (SchemeFS3). Rapid rates of conversion ofE S1·Na+ andE S2·Na+ toE F·Na+, or the failure to saturate a weak E S1-Na+ orE S2-Na+ interaction may account for our inability to detect to E S1·Na+and E S2·Na+.

C. (1995) Science 268, 411–415), suggesting a role for protein (de)phosphorylation in Fas signaling. To investigate whether this interaction is conserved in mouse, we performed yeast two-hybrid interaction experiments and transfection studies in mouse T cell lines. For the corresponding PDZ motif in the mouse homologue of FAP-1/PTP-BAS, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-BAS-like (PTP-BL), only an interaction with human but not with mouse Fas could be detected. Presence of the tS-L-V motif proper, which is unique for human Fas, rather than the structural context of its carboxyl terminus, apparently explains the initially observed binding. To test for functional conservation of any indirect involvement of PTP-BL in Fas-mediated signaling, we generated T lymphoma cell lines stably expressing mouse or human Fas receptor with and without PTP-BL. No inhibitory effect of PTP-BL was observed upon triggering apoptosis using mouse or human Fas-activating antibodies. Together with the markedly different tissue expression patterns for PTP-BL and Fas receptor, our findings suggest that protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL does not play a key role in the Fas-mediated death pathway.

Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Indeed, screenings of oriented peptide libraries employing the second PDZ motif of FAP-1 revealed a consensus binding sequence oft(S/T)-X-(V/I/L) (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M.

Puzzled by the considerable sequence divergence displayed by the carboxyl terminus of Fas (Fig. 1), we set out to study whether FAP-1's presumed role in Fas signaling was evolutionary conserved. We found that mouse Fas does not interact with the mouse homologue of PTP-BAS/FAP-1, known as PTP-BL (22Hendriks W. Schepens J. Bachner D. Rijss J. Zeeuwen P. Zechner U. Hameister H. Wieringa B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or RIP (23Chida D. Kume T. Mukouyama Y. Tabata S. Nomura N. Thomas M.L. Watanabe T. Oishi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies using transformed mouse cell lines failed to demonstrate any role for PTP-BL in the regulation of Fas-mediated signaling. Our results show that the interaction between the Fas receptor and PTP-BL is not conserved between mice and men. Plasmid DNAs and the yeast strain used for the interaction trap assay were provided by Dr. Roger Brent and colleagues (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston) and used as described (24Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The individual PDZ motifs of PTP-BL were cloned in the pEG202 bait vector by amplifying PTP-BL sequences using specific primers containing convenient restriction sites for cloning purposes. This results in LexA fusion proteins containing amino acids 1076–1177 (BL-PDZ-I), 1352–1450 (BL-PDZ-II), 1471–1601 (BL-PDZ-III), 1756–1855 (BL-PDZ-IV), and 1853–1946 (BL-PDZ-V) of PTP-BL. The carboxyl-terminal 60 residues of mouse Fas were cloned in the prey vector pJGBr2 by subcloning a 599-base pair PvuII-DraI restriction fragment from pBOS-EA (25Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Itoh N. Yonehara S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar), and for the human Fas carboxyl terminus (40 amino acids), this was done by subcloning a 120-base pairBglII-ApaI restriction fragment from pCMV-hFAS (a kind gift of Dr. Anderson, Cambridge, MA). Construction of the control baits is described elsewhere 2E. Cuppen, H. Gerrits, B. Pepers, B. Wieringa, and W. Hendriks, submitted for publication. (11Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid interactions were analyzed by plating yeast containing reporter, bait, and prey constructs on minimal medium agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, and leucine and subsequent incubation at 30 °C for 4 days. The relative strength of two-hybrid interactions was determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activity in crude yeast lysates. For this, a single yeast colony was inoculated in 1.5 ml of minimal medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and uracil and containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. After overnight growth at 30 °C until the culture reached A 600 nm ≈ 1.0, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.2 ml of ice-cold buffer (0.1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). About 100 μl of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) were added, and the suspension was vortexed six times for 30 s alternated with 30-s incubations on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min with 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and used for protein concentration determination (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by adding 10 μl of lysate to 200 μl of freshly prepared ONPG buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.35 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma)) in microtiter plates. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and the A420 nm was monitored for 1 h on a CERES UV900C MTP-photometer (Bio-Tek). The specific β-galactosidase activity (arbitrary units) was calculated using the initial linear part of theA 420 nm/min curves and normalized for the protein concentration in the sample. Every sample was measured in duplicate, and for each bait-prey combination, five independent colonies were assayed. Mouse T cell lymphoma WR19L cell line (ATCC TIB52) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transformants expressing mouse or human Fas and PTP-BL were established by electroporation as described (17Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 WR19L cells in 0.5 ml of K-PBS (30.8 mm NaCl, 120.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2PO4, 1.46 mmKH2PO4) were cotransfected with 2.5 μg/mlPvuI linearized pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA-BL (full-length PTP-BL cDNA (22Hendriks W.

Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar) by electroporation at 290 V with a capacitance of 960 μF using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells were cultured in 40 ml of RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well microtiter plates (0.1 ml/well) for 2 days, and neomycin-resistant clones were then selected in medium containing G418 (900 μg/ml). Cells were analyzed for PTP-BL and Fas receptor expression after 14 days of selection. WR19L or derived transformed cells were lysed in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. Amounts of lysate containing 25 μg of protein were loaded in each lane of a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini-gel (Bio-Rad), and following electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.). The blot was blocked for 30 min in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal catalytic PTPase domain of PTP-BL2 in a one to thousand dilution in PBST containing 1% normal goat serum. After subsequent washings, the blot was incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (20.000 × diluted, Pierce), washed, and labeled bands were visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of Fas antigen was analyzed by incubating 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of IF buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide) containing 0.5 μg/ml hamster monoclonal antibody Jo2 (27Ogasawara J.

Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar) for detection of mouse Fas or mouse monoclonal antibody CH-11 (28Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) for detection of human Fas, for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with IF buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat α-hamster-Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, diluted 1:25 in IF buffer) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Rabbit α-mouse-Ig (Dako, diluted 1:50 in IF buffer). Cells were washed and resuspendend in 0.5 ml of IF buffer and analyzed on a flow cytofluorometer (Coulter). Mouse WR19L wild type or transformed cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 24-well tissue culture plate and cultured at 37 °C. Cell death was induced by addition of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (Jo2 for mouse Fas or CH-11 for human Fas expressing cells) to a final concentration ranging from 10−9 to 10−3 mg/ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 to 20 h, dead cells were stained by adding propidium iodine to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. The percentage of dead cells was determined by flow cytofluorometric analysis (Coulter). Total RNA from several tissues was prepared using the guanidium isothiocyate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). 15 μg of RNA was loaded on a 1% formamide agarose gel, and after electrophoresis the RNA was transferred to nylon membrane according to standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Complete PTP-BL (22Hendriks W. Schepens J. Bachner D. Rijss J. Zeeuwen P. Zechner U. Hameister H. Wieringa B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and mouse Fas (25Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Itoh N. Yonehara S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs were radioactively labeled by random priming and used as probes for hybridization. The large difference between species that is obvious in the carboxyl-terminal Fas receptor sequence (Fig.1) prompted us to test the interaction between Fas receptor and PTP-BL using the two-hybrid interaction trap (24Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Baits were generated containing either the complete array of PDZ motifs or individual PDZ motifs of PTP-BL and were assayed for interaction with both mouse and human Fas carboxyl termini. An interaction of the ensemble of five PDZ motifs of PTP-BL (BL-PDZ-I-V) with the human Fas receptor could be observed, but no interaction occurred with mouse Fas receptor (Fig.2). Assays employing single PDZ motifs only revealed an interaction for BL-PDZ-II and human Fas receptor, but this was rather weak. No interaction of mouse Fas receptor with any of the PTP-BL PDZ motifs tested was observed, nor did any of the baits activate transcription of the β-galactosidase reporter in the presence of an empty prey vector (Fig. 1). Finally, two nonrelated domains, the nNOS PDZ motif, found to recognize the carboxyl-terminal tG-(D/E)-X-V motif (11Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the RIL PDZ motif,2 did not interact with mouse or human Fas receptor. Another motif, the second PDZ motif of PSD95/SAP90, known to recognize t(T/S)-X-V (32Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), did interact only with the human Fas receptor (not shown, Ref. 11Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To study any functional involvement of PTP-BL in Fas-mediated apoptosis, we generated stable transformants of the mouse T cell lymphoma WR19L cell line. This cell line does not express PTP-BL (Fig.3 C) or endogenous Fas receptor as identical flow cytometric staining profiles were obtained with (Fig.3 A) and without the primary anti-Fas antibody (not shown). Expression plasmids were introduced by electroporation and protein expression of Fas receptor and PTP-BL were analyzed by flow cytofluorometric analysis and Western blotting, respectively. No endogenous Fas receptor could be detected in the wild type WR19L cell line. Stable transformants were obtained expressing human Fas receptor in combination with (H2O and H25) or without (4B1) PTP-BL (Fig. 3,A and C). Similarly transformants were generated expressing mouse Fas receptor with (M3 and M5) or without (2H2) PTP-BL (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition a control line expressing PTP-BL only was generated (3C) (Fig. 3, B andC). Transformants H2O, H25 and M3, M5 express about equal amounts of surface-bound Fas receptor, as measured by flow cytofluorometric analysis (Fig. 3, A and B), but express different amounts of PTP-BL as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3 C). Apoptosis was triggered in the human Fas receptor transformants by adding monoclonal anti-Fas IgM (CH-11, 250 ng/ml), and apoptosis was measured at fixed time points by propidium iodine uptake and flow cytofluorometric analysis. As expected, the wild type cell line WR19L and the transformant that expresses PTP-BL only (3C), which both lack Fas receptor expression, do not undergo antibody-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4, A andB). The human Fas receptor-expressing transformant (4B1) undergoes rapid apoptosis, and within 8 h over 95% of the cells have permeable membranes and take up propidium iodine, indicative for the onset of apoptosis. The transformants expressing in addition PTP-BL (H2O and H25) undergo rapid apoptosis also, although at a slightly slower pace. However, cell lines with and without PTP-BL are indistinguishable when the time points at 20-h incubation are compared. Furthermore, no influence of the amount of PTP-BL protein expression is observed (H2O versus H25, Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that PTP-BL expression has no major influence on human Fas-mediated apoptosis in mouse WR19L cells and doesn't protect against apoptosis. A similar experiment was done with the mouse Fas receptor transformants by triggering apoptosis with the monoclonal antibody Jo2 (anti-mouse Fas). Apoptosis in the cell line expressing only mouse Fas receptor (2H2) is somewhat slower compared with human Fas-mediated apoptosis. This difference may be explained by the lower surface expression of the mouse Fas receptor on 2H2 (Fig. 3 B) or may be due to clonal variations or subtle differences in the way these two monoclonal antibodies induce apoptosis. Compared with the cell line expressing only mouse Fas receptor (2H2), the transformants that express PTP-BL as well as mouse Fas receptor (M3 and M5) undergo apoptosis more rapidly (Fig. 4 B), but at a rate comparable with the human Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig.4 A). Again, comparison of the read-out upon overnight incubation of the transformants with apoptosis inducing antibody revealed no effect of PTP-BL at all. Taken together these findings indicate that PTP-BL expression is not a significant modulatory factor in mouse or human Fas-mediated apoptosis. Perhaps the impact of PTP-BL on Fas-mediated apoptosis is much more subtle than what was proposed for the human counterpart. Therefore, we tested for the influence of PTP-BL expression on dose responsiveness by treating wild type WR19L cells and its transformants overnight with increasing amounts of apoptosis inducing antibody. Even at the highest concentration of antibody tested, cells without Fas receptor are refractory to undergo apoptosis (Fig.5, A and B). The dose-dependent sensitivity for Fas-mediated apoptosis did not significantly differ between Fas receptor transformants with and without PTP-BL. Again, this argues against an inhibiting role of PTP-BL in Fas signaling. Moreover, the mouse Fas receptor expressing transformant seems to be slightly less sensitive without PTP-BL expression, even suggesting a small apoptosis-enhancing effect of PTP-BL. A Northern blot of total RNA from several mouse tissues was used to determine the tissue distribution of both Fas receptor and PTP-BL. The obtained patterns are quite distinct (Fig.6). Expression of Fas receptor is very high in lung and thymus and ubiquitously at a low level in all tissues examined. PTP-BL, on the contrary, is expressed at a high level in lung, kidney, testis, stomach, and skin (Fig. 6). It is now well established that one of the functions of PDZ motifs is the recruitment of proteins via recognition binding of their carboxyl-terminal domain (9Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The preferred motif in this domain has an extremely simple consensus structure (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 34Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This raises the question how the cell can meet the criteria required for high specificity in binding interaction, necessary to achieve correct functioning of the cell signaling network. As a working hypothesis for the studies presented here, we assumed that there must be a strong evolutionary preference to conserve the optimal interaction avidity between individual PDZ domains and their preferred substrate. Interestingly, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BAS/FAP-1, which contains five PDZ motifs, was found to directly associate with the Fas receptor via its second PDZ motif. However, the carboxyl terminus of the Fas receptor, which is involved in this interaction, is not strongly conserved between species (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the amino acids demonstrated to be important for the interaction with PTP-BAS (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 12Yanagisawa J. Takahashi M. Kanki H. Yano-Yanagisawa H. Tazunoki T. Sawa E. Nishitoba T. Kamishohara H. Kobayashi E. Kataoka S. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8539-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have been substituted in the mouse Fas receptor. To conserve the interaction, the second PDZ motif of the mouse homologue of PTP-BAS/FAP-1, PTP-BL, may have adapted to these changes. This is not very likely, since this motif is very homologous between human (13Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Nagamatsu M. Harada S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and mouse (22Hendriks W. Schepens J. Bachner D. Rijss J. Zeeuwen P. Zechner U. Hameister H. Wieringa B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (96% identical) and bovine (GenBank™ accession number 915210) (98% identical). Alternatively, the PTP-BL PDZ-II may be tolerant in peptide recognition, allowing different peptides to bind. This, however, would affect high specificity constraints necessary in signaling networks. Our results show that PTP-BL does interact with the human Fas receptor, but fails to interact with the mouse Fas receptor. This indicates that specific peptide recognition is conserved between species and that changes, as found in the carboxyl terminus of the Fas receptor abolishes the interaction. This last observation is in line with the tightly defined consensus motif for binding to the second PDZ domain of PTP-BAS/FAP-1, which was independently found to be tS/TxV/I (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) or tS/TxV/L/I (12Yanagisawa J. Takahashi M. Kanki H. Yano-Yanagisawa H. Tazunoki T. Sawa E. Nishitoba T. Kamishohara H. Kobayashi E. Kataoka S. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8539-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, none of the other PDZ motifs of PTP-BL does interact with the carboxyl terminus of the mouse Fas receptor, indicating that PTP-BL does not directly interact with the Fas receptor in vivo. This is corroborated by immunoprecipitation experiments, which failed to detect PTP-BAS/FAP-1 or an approximately 250-kDa protein in the unstimulated or stimulated Fas receptor-containing complex (20Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Chinnaiyan A.M. Krammer P.H. Dixit V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 161-170PubMed Google Scholar,35Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8627-8632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, any indirect involvement of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL in Fas signaling cannot be excluded, although even the basal question if tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in modulating Fas signaling is not answered yet. For tyrosine kinases as well as tyrosine phosphatases, both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Fas-mediated apoptosis have been reported. For example, the protein-tyrosine kinase Abl and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BAS/FAP-1 both were found to inhibit the process (16Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 37McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Martin S.J. Mahboubi A. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22625-22631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas another cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase, the hematopoietic cell phosphatase HCP/SHP-1, and the p59fyn kinase seem to potentiate the apoptotic signal induced by Fas (38Su X. Zhou T. Wang Z. Yang P. Jope R.S. Mountz J.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Atkinson E.A. Ostergaard H. Kane K. Pinkoski M.J. Caputo A. Olszowy M.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5968-5971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The involvement of HCP/SHP-1 remains controversial (40Takayama H. Lee M.H. Shirota Someya Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3943-3948PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins upon stimulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis is reported (41Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation as well as the apoptotic process could be blocked by inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases in a concentration-dependent manner. Findings that a Jurkat cell variant, deficient in this elevation of tyrosine phosphorylation upon Fas ligation, still does undergo apoptosis are contradictory to these findings (42Janssen O. Lengl-Janssen B. Oberg H.H. Robertson M.J. Kabelitz D. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 49: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observed correlation between the levels of endogenous PTP-BAS/FAP-1 and resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in several cell lines (16Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) is not confirmed by others (20Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Chinnaiyan A.M. Krammer P.H. Dixit V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 161-170PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in general and certain protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in particular in Fas signaling remains controversial. The reported effects may be secondary downstream effects and might be cell type-specific. Functional studies using our model system revealed no obvious role for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL in the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. A small inhibitory effect on Fas-mediated apoptosis was observed in transformants expressing human Fas receptor. In contrast, PTP-BL seems to enhance apoptosis in mouse Fas receptor expressing transformants. However, both effects are not dependent upon the expression level of PTP-BL, since transformants expressing equal amounts of Fas receptor on their surface, but expressing different amounts of PTP-BL, behave very similar. Clonal variations and differences in the amount of surface expression of Fas receptor for the transformants with and without PTP-BL may partially account for the differences observed. Furthermore, the small inhibitory effect of PTP-BL on human Fas-mediated apoptosis may be caused by its capability to interact with the carboxyl terminus of the human Fas receptor and thereby inhibiting the formation of a functional death-inducing signaling complex rather than its catalytic activity. This effect will not occur in the mouse system, because PTP-BL does not interact with the mouse Fas receptor. Nevertheless, no influence of PTP-BL expression could be observed after overnight incubation with apoptosis-inducing antibodies, clearly demonstrating that PTP-BL can not (partially) protect from Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results, combined with the different RNA expression patterns make an important role for PTP-BL in the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in mouse very unlikely. In mouse the negatively regulatory carboxyl terminus of the Fas receptor may bind other, so far unknown, proteins and perhaps in a PDZ-mediated fashion. Interestingly, we have observed that a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region of human Fas potentiates Fas-induced apoptosis in mouse L929 cells (43Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a similar deletion in mouse Fas did not show any effect. 3S. Nagata, unpublished observations. Thus, the role of the Fas carboxyl terminus in regulating the apoptotic process remains unclear. Furthermore, the target molecules for the PTP-BL PDZ motifs are still to be determined and will aid in elucidating its biological function.

https://openalex.org/W2002989164,"The effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) on ATP levels were studied in metabolically inhibited L929 cells. Treatment of these cells with TNF in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide induces cyclic changes in the intracellular ATP content preceding cell death. After 3 h of incubation, the intracellular ATP content increased by 48 ± 6% (p < 0.001), but at 4 h, it decreased to the control level. Two hours later, it increased again by 23 ± 5% over the control level (p < 0.001). Coinciding with cell death, ATP content decreased progressively until almost complete depletion. These changes in ATP content were associated with parallel alterations in the respiratory coupling and with increased generation of reactive oxygen species. The mechanism by which TNF/actinomycin D or TNF/cycloheximide increased cellular ATP seemed to be dependent on the mitochondrial ATP synthesis and related to the cytotoxic effect of TNF, since blockade of mitochondrial electron transport prevented the increase in cellular ATP, the formation of reactive oxygen species, and the apoptotic cell death caused by TNF. We suggest that the TNF/actinomycin D- or TNF/cycloheximide-induced changes in intracellular ATP levels may be involved in the cytotoxic effect of TNF in metabolically inhibited L929 cells.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 2Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Camussi G. Albano E. Tetta C. Bussolino F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). TNF was first described as an antitumor cytotoxin that preferentially killed growing tumor cells (4Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Recently, it became clear that this cytokine may also exert biological effects on a variety of normal cells, mostly related to immunomodulatory or inflammatory processes (5Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 6Grunfeld C. Palladino Jr., M.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1990; 35: 45-72PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity of TNF against tumor cells has been studied extensively, although its molecular mechanism of action is not well understood (7Larrick J.W. Wright S.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar,8Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that it may not be unique and instead may be dependent on the cell line and on the presence or absence of metabolic inhibitors (9Reid T.R. Torti F.M. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4583-4589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2629-2634PubMed Google Scholar). Although TNF alone exerts cytotoxic effects against certain tumor cell lines, cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (AD) have been shown to enhance TNF-mediated cell killing (11Kull F.C. Cuatrecasas P. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4885-4890PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of CHX or AD, not only is less TNF required, but also cell death occurs in a shorter period of time (12Ruff M.R. Gifford G.E. Pick E. Lymphokines. 6. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 549-555Google Scholar). This enhancement of the cytolytic properties of TNF by inhibiting transcription by AD is the basis for a commonly used in vitro biological assay of TNF in biological fluids (13Meager A. Leung H. Woolley J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 116: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Involvement of mitochondria in TNF-induced cytotoxicity has been suggested because of the finding of abnormalities in the mitochondria of TNF-treated cells (14Matthews N. Neale M.L. Jackson S.K. Stark J.M. Immunology. 1987; 62: 153-155PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, impaired electron flow in the mitochondria has been detected in target cells treated with TNF (15Lancaster Jr., J.R. Laster S.M. Gooding L.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert K. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and synthesis of manganese superoxide dismutase, a mitochondrial enzyme, is induced in some cells incubated with TNF (17Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Moreover, Schulze-Osthoff et al. (18Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) showed that L929-°ρ cells, lacking in mitochondrial DNA, are resistant to the cytotoxic effect of TNF. The above observations led to the hypothesis involving the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic effect of TNF (16Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert K.

Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the changes induced by TNF in the energy charge of metabolically inhibited L929 cells and their relationship to the respiratory coupling during the time preceding cell death. Recombinant human TNF was purchased from Genzyme Co. (Cambridge, MA). RPMI 1640 medium was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Bio-Whittaker (Verviers, Belgium). Rotenone, AD, CHX, antimycin A, oligomycin, trypsin, Hepes, Mops, EDTA, proteinase K, Triton X-100, ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, mixothiazol, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), SDS, and pyruvate kinase were purchased from Sigma (Alcobendas, Spain). Potassium cyanide (KCN) was from FEROSA (Barcelona, Spain); l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA); and trichloroacetic acid was from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). Potassium hydroxide and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Fetal calf serum was from Sera-Lab (Sussex, UK). Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR-123) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). L929 murine fibrosarcoma cell line and HepG2 human hepatoma cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). L929 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For TNF cytotoxicity, lactate, and ATP/ADP assays, cells were cultured in six-well plates (35-mm-diameter well). At confluence (1 × 106cells/plate), the medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium in the absence (control) or presence of 25 ng/ml TNF, 1 μg/ml AD, 0.1 mm CHX or the combined treatment, TNF and AD (TNF/AD) or TNF and CHX (TNF/CHX), for the times indicated under “Results” and figure legends. Mitochondrial inhibitors were added at the same time as TNF/AD or TNF/CHX. For measurement of whole cell respiration, L929 cells were cultured in 175-cm2 flasks. At confluence (40 × 106 cells/flask), cells were incubated in fresh RPMI medium with the treatments as described above. Cytotoxicity was measured using the index of lactate dehydrogenase leakage from damaged cells and was expressed as a percentage of total cellular activity, as described by Decker and Lohmann-Matthes (19Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a commercial assay kit (Cromatest, Laboratorios Knickerbocker, S.A.E., Barcelona, Spain). For DNA fragmentation analysis, 3 × 106 L929 cells were exposed to TNF, AD, CHX, TNF/CHX, or TNF/AD for 8–72 h. Cells were centrifuged and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was lysed by the addition of 400 μl of a hypotonic lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and 0.2% Triton X-100. Microfuge tubes were spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and 350 μl of supernatant were incubated with 106 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 40 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, final concentrations) for 4 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamylic acid (25:25:1, v/v/v) and precipitated in ice-cold 100% ethanol and 4 m NaCl at −20 °C for 12–18 h. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C, the DNA pellet was washed with 500 ml of 70% ethanol and resuspended in 15 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, and 50 μg/ml RNase for 1 h at 37 °C. Loading buffer (2 μl) was added to each sample. Samples were analyzed on 1% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The same amount of DNA, as assessed by spectrophotometric measurement, was loaded in each lane. A mixture of HeaIII-digested φX174 DNA and λHindIII-digested DNA was run as a size marker. DNA fragmentation was also measured by quantitation of apoptotic cell death on single cell level using a flow cytometric kit (in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein; Boehringer Mannheim, SA, Barcelona, Spain). This test is based on the detection of single- and double-stranded DNA breaks occurring at early stages in apoptosis. This assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After one wash with PBS, cells were permeabilized for 2 min on ice in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate. After two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 50 μl of TUNEL mixture (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUtp-x nick end labeling) reaction and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice before they were analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis was also performed after DNA staining with propidium iodide as described by Nicoletti et al. (20Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar). L929 cells were treated without or with TNF, TNF/AD, TNF/CHX, CHX, or AD for 8–72 h. After the treatment period, cells were harvested, centrifuged (500 rpm for 5 min), washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide staining solution (5 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cell suspensions were then incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. Stained nuclei were analyzed with an Elite Flow Cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Hypodiploid apoptotic cells and apoptotic bodies appear as a sub-G0/G1 peak. The intensity of this peak is related to the amount of apoptotic cells. L929 cells were harvested by trypsinization at the indicated times. After centrifugation for 10 min (4 °C, 500 × g), the pellet of packed cells was resuspended in RPMI medium without serum (1 × 107cells/ml) and placed in a polarographic chamber at 37 °C. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co.) fitted to a 600-μl thermally insulated sample chamber (37 °C) under constant stirring. The oxygen consumption rate of the whole cells was calculated by assuming that dissolved oxygen concentration in 1 ml of media was initially 200 nmol/ml (21Oller A.R. Buser C.W. Tyo M.A. Thilly W.G. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rate of oxygen consumption observed after cells were added to the chamber was termed the basal respiration. To determine the fraction of respiration attributable to coupled oxidative phosphorylation, oligomycin (20 μg/ml), which inhibits the F0,F1-ATPase, was added during cellular basal respiration. To determine the nonmitochondrial respiration, KCN (1 mm), an inhibitor of the cytochrome c oxidase, was added during cellular basal respiration. Oxygen consumption rates are expressed as nmol of oxygen/min/106 cells. l-Lactic acid was determined in the culture media using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Results are expressed in nmol/106 cells. Cellular, cytosolic, and mitochondrial content of ATP and ADP were measured in trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v)-precipitated samples using the luciferin/luciferase reaction with an adenosine 5′-triphosphate bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma). ADP was converted into ATP by pyruvate kinase (22Hampp R. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 7. Verlag-Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1985: 370-379Google Scholar). Luminescence was measured in a bioluminometer equipped with injector (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold). Separation of cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments was carried out by digitonin fractionation (23Zuurendonk P.F. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 333: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). After the indicated times, L929 cells were harvested by trypsinization and suspended in ice-cold medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, Mops buffer (pH 7.0), 3 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml digitonin. After 1 min, the suspension was rapidly centrifuged at 3000 × g for 1 min. To determine adenine nucleotides, both pellets and supernatant were acidified with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v). After removal of proteins by centrifugation, the extracts were neutralized with 4m KOH and frozen for later analysis. Lactate dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) and citrate synthase (mitochondrial marker) (24Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) were measured in the supernatant to ensure a proper permeabilization (>95% of recovery) without mitochondrial contamination. ATP:ADP ratios were calculated from these data. Extracts were prepared from 60 × 106 L929 cells or HepG2 cells. Harvested cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and washed three times in Hepes-buffered Hanks's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% dextrose (w/v). The cell pellet was treated with 5 volumes of cold trichloroacetic acid 10% (w/v), followed by sonication on ice for 5 min. The extract was neutralized by 4 m KOH, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g (4 °C), and the supernatant was lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. For NMR measurements, the dried homogenate was dissolved in 0.7 ml of deuterium oxide in a 5-mm NMR tube. The pH was adjusted with deuterium chloride to 7.4. 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 202.4 MHz on a vertical superconducting narrow bore Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer (Kalsruhe, Germany). Spectra were collected using a 2-s repetition time and a 60° flip angle. The spectral width was 8196 Hz, and 16,000 points were collected, corresponding to about a 1-s data acquisition window. Scans (1,000) were accumulated for each cell extract spectrum totalling 37 min. In this study, we compared the same phosphorus metabolites from different cell lines; therefore, it was not necessary or practical to obtain quantitative results by allowing complete relaxation.31P chemical shifts were assigned by standardizing β-ATP to −18.7 ppm. 31P spectra were analyzed on an Aspect X32 data station. The data were zero-filled to 32,000 points, line-broadened, and then Fourier transformed. Zero order phasing was done, but first order phasing was unnecessary. We measured peak intensity and peak areas with the computer. The resonance areas under γ-, α-, and β-ATP were determined with the more commonly used method of computer integration. The areas of the individual peaks were determined with interactive deconvolution using standard Bruker software (UXNMR). Initial starting values for the peaks were manually defined and then automatically fitted with Lorentzian lines. The nonfluorescent DHR-123 probe reacts with intracellular ROS to form the highly fluorescent rhodamine. This reaction is the basis for a sensitive and specific assay for intracellular generation of ROS, since DHR-123 is a stable agent that is not involved in any other biochemical pathway, and its spontaneous oxidation to rhodamine is very low (25Shoji Y. Uedono J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 84: 543-548Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in six-well plates (35-mm-diameter well). At confluence (1 × 106 cells/plate), cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml), AD (1 μg/ml), CHX (0.1 mm), or the combined treatment TNF/AD or TNF/CHX. At the indicated times, 0.4 μl of DHR-123 (1 μm) was added, and the incubation was prolonged for an additional 30 min. Once the incubation was finished, cells were harvested, washed, centrifuged (1000 rpm), resuspended in RPMI medium, and analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation, 488 nm; fluorescent detection, 530 nm). DHR-123 fluorescence was exclusively analyzed on viable cells, characterized by morphology: forward scatterversus side scatter. All results are expressed as means ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. The unpaired Student'st test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups, accepting p < 0.05 as the level of significance (26Colton T. Estadı́stica en Medicina. Salvat, Barcelona1979: 103-153Google Scholar). In this investigation, we studied the cytotoxic activity of TNF toward L929 cells metabolically inhibited with AD or CHX for 24 h. Fig. 1 shows that murine L929 cells are susceptible to the cytotoxic action of TNF. However, sensitivity of these cells to this cytokine is enhanced significantly in the presence of CHX or AD. In the presence of 1 μg/ml AD or 0.1 mm CHX, 25 ng/ml TNF increased the cell death from 7 ± 2% to 100% in 24 h (Fig. 1). Treatment with either CHX or AD also yielded cytotoxic effects on L929 cells, but cell death started later (12 ± 1 h) and was to a lesser extent than with combined TNF treatment (Fig. 1). Apoptosis was identified on the basis of the occurrence of internucleosomal DNA cleavage on agarose gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic pattern of the DNA extracted from TNF-treated cells showed fragments of molecular weights corresponding to multiples of about 180 base pairs at 48 and 72 h, but not at 24 h, of incubation (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, laddering of DNA was induced in L929 cells treated with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Finally, DNA fragmentation was observed in cells exposed to TNF/AD for 8 h or more. These results were supported by the quantitative measurement of fragmented DNA using two different methods (TUNEL assay and sub-G0/G1 peak). The time course study of DNA fragmentation in L929 cells incubated with TNF/AD showed that significant DNA cleavage (17 ± 1.3%) was first seen by the TUNEL assay after 8 h of treatment, reaching 61.2 ± 5.8% and 100% after 12 and 24 h, respectively, of incubation (Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained when apoptosis was quantified by measuring the sub-G0/G1 peak (Fig. 2 C). Incubation of cells with TNF or AD alone also elicited DNA fragmentation, but the slope of the time curve was more attenuated than the slope of the curve caused by TNF/AD treatment. DNA fragmentation after 12 and 24 h of incubation with AD was 13.4 ± 1.9 and 22.5 ± 1.8%, respectively. At 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with TNF, the DNA fragmentation was 8.2 ± 1.1%, 23.1 ± 9.3% and 39.4 ± 0.7%, respectively. TNF/AD and TNF/CHX induced a biphasic increase in intracellular content of ATP during the first 6 h of treatment (Fig. 3). After 3 h of incubation with TNF/AD or TNF/CHX, the ATP content in cells increased by 44 and 52%, respectively (p < 0.001, for both cases), over the basal level. At 4 h, ATP content had declined to control levels. However, 2 h later, cellular ATP content was enhanced again by 19 and 27%, respectively (p < 0.001, for both cases). These early increases were followed by a progressive decrease in cellular ATP content until 24 h, at which time cellular ATP was almost undetectable (Fig. 3). This late decrease coincided in time with the release of LDH, which began at 5–6 h of incubation and was steadily enhanced until 24 h. None of these changes were seen in untreated cells. The slight decrease in cellular ATP levels observed in control cells after 24 h of incubation can be ascribed to the depletion of nutrients in the culture medium. Treatment of L929 cells with AD or CHX, but not with TNF, enhanced intracellular ATP levels significantly for the 24 h of observation. However, these elevations were significantly less marked than those obtained after 2 and 3 h of treatment with TNF/AD or TNF/CHX. While these conditions resulted in the death of about 80% of cells at 12 h of incubation, treatment with TNF, AD, or CHX alone did not cause any cell death at this time (Fig. 1). Treatment with TNF alone has no effect on cellular ATP levels during the 72 h of incubation, although about 60% of cells have died at this time, and 39% showed apoptotic features (Fig. 2). Effects of TNF/AD on cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP content were similar to those found in total cellular ATP. The cytosolic ATP level reached its maximum at 2 h, and mitochondrial ATP reached its maximum 1 h later (Table I). At 4 h, both cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP decreased to control level. The ADP content did not change significantly during the 4 h of treatment with TNF/AD (Table I). Therefore, determination of the ATP:ADP ratio, as a measurement of the energy charge, showed that at 2 h, TNF/AD increased this ratio markedly in the cytosolic compartment. These results obtained by a luminometric method were confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy of cellular extracts. After 2 h of incubation with TNF/AD, the area of the peaks assigned to ATP increased by 68 ± 11%. This elevation was also significantly more marked than those induced by AD alone (AD, 43 ± 10%; TNF/AD, 68 ± 11%, p < 0.01). The intensity of the peaks assigned to ADP did not change during treatment with TNF/AD or AD alone (Fig. 4).

To determine the relevance of these findings, we tested the ability of TNF to increase ATP levels in the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. TNF added to these cells did not change cellular ATP significantly and did not induce cell death either. However, sensitivity of these cells to this cytokine increased in the presence of AD. Treatment of HepG2 cells with TNF/AD led to a marked increase in cell death at 24 h and to cyclic changes in the ATP content similar to those induced in L929 cells. Cellular ATP increased after 1 and 4 h of treatment but decreased at 3 and 6 h (Fig.5 A). Both ATP increase and cell death were significantly higher in cells treated with TNF/AD than in those incubated with AD alone (Fig. 5, A andB). Because glycolysis contributes to the formation of ATP, we studied the effects of these treatments on the glycolysis rate by measuring lactate concentration in the culture medium. As Fig.6 shows, ATP accumulation in L929 cells cannot be ascribed to an increased glycolysis, since lactate levels in culture medium did not change significantly during the initial 2–3 h of incubation. After 4 h, both TNF/AD and TNF/CHX caused a significant accumulation of lactate in the medium, indicating that glycolysis increased after this time (Fig. 6). Treatment of cells with either AD or CHX also resulted in an increase in the lactate concentration after 4 h of incubation, although it was significantly lower than the increase caused by the combined treatment with TNF. In the absence of metabolic inhibitors, TNF increased lactate moderately through all of the incubation period (Fig.6). Most ATP synthesis takes place during the mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of TNF, AD, CHX, and TNF/AD or TNF/CHX on the oxygen consumption by L929 cells in RPMI medium in the presence or absence of either oligomycin or KCN. These conditions allow us to determine the basal respiration, the coupled respiration, and the nonmitochondrial respiration. Through the first 8 h of incubation, the total basal respiration and the nonmitochondrial respiration did not change significantly by any of these treatments. Nevertheless, there were major changes in the oligomycin-sensitive respiration, which provides us information about the coupling degree between the mitochondrial electron flux and the ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial ATPase. In basal conditions, L929 cells consumed 1.87 ± 0.20 nmol of O2/min/106 cells (Fig.7 A). About 20 ± 2% of the respiration rate was insensitive to cyanide, and it should be attributed to nonmitochondrial reactions. When oligomycin was added to the polarographic chamber, the oxygen consumption decreased by 32 ± 3%, indicating the degree of coupled respiration. The remaining 48 ± 3% represents the uncoupled respiration (Fig.7 A). Treatment of cells with TNF alone increased the respiratory coupling from 32 ± 3% of the total respiration in untreated cells to 47 ± 3% and 42 ± 2.8% in cells treated with TNF for 2 and 3 h, respectively (p < 0.01) (Fig.7 A). After this time, coupled respiration decreased and remained at the control levels for the next 69 h (Fig.7 B). Treatment either with AD or CHX induced a smooth cyclic change o"

A major determinant of the A2 epitope has been located by homolog scanning mutagenesis using recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules to a sequence bounded by Arg484–Ile508 (Healey, J. F., Lubin, I. M., Nakai, H., Saenko, E. L., Hoyer, L. W., Scandella, D., and Lollar, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 14505–14509). Within this region, human residues Arg484, Pro485, Tyr487, Ser488, Arg489, Pro492, Val495, Phe501, and Ile508 differ from porcine fVIII. We stably expressed in mammalian cells nine active B-domainless human fVIII molecules containing single alanine substitutions at these sites. Their inhibition by a murine anti-A2 monoclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 413, and by three A2-specific alloimmune and two A2-specific autoimmune human inhibitor plasmas was measured by the Bethesda assay. The inhibition of Arg484 → Ala, Tyr487 → Ala, Arg489 → Ala, and Arg492 → Ala by mAb413 was reduced by greater than 90% compared with wild-type, B-domainless human fVIII. mAb413 inhibited the most severely affected mutant, Arg489 → Ala, 0.01% as well as wild-type fVIII. For all five patient plasmas, the Tyr487 → Ala mutant displayed the greatest reduction in inhibition. The inhibition of the Tyr487 → Ala mutant by these antibodies ranged from 10% to 20% that of wild-type fVIII. The inhibition of the Ser488 → Ala, Arg489 → Ala, Pro492 → Ala, Val495 → Ala, Phe501 → Ala, and Ile508 → Ala mutants by most of the plasmas also was significantly reduced. In contrast, the Arg484 → Ala and Pro485 → Ala mutants were relatively unaffected. Thus, although mAb413 binds to the same region as human A2 inhibitors, it recognizes a different set of amino acid side chains. The side chains recognized by human A2 inhibitors appear to be similar, despite the differing immune settings that give rise to fVIII alloantibodies and autoantibodies.

In this region, there are nine amino acid differences between human and porcine fVIII (18Lubin I.M. Healey J.F. Scandella D. Runge M.S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8639-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we constructed human fVIII cDNAs that encode single alanine substitutions at positions where the human and porcine fVIII sequences differ to identify specific amino acid residues that contribute to the A2 inhibitor epitope. These constructs were stably expressed as active fVIII molecules in mammalian cells, and their inhibition by mAb413 (a model murine monoclonal A2 inhibitor) and by a panel of A2-specific patient antibodies was measured.DISCUSSIONAlanine scanning mutagenesis has been used widely to study binding sites on proteins (25Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 26Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions are dominated by electrostatic effects, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions between large, nonpolar side chains. Alanine is used as a substitute because it is uncharged and has the smallest amino acid side chain except glycine, which is not preferred because it can change the main chain conformation of the protein.Analysis of protein-protein complexes by x-ray crystallography shows that typically 20–30 amino acid side chains of a protein make contact with its binding partner (27Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Interestingly, alanine scanning mutagenesis studies typically reveal that only a few of these residues contribute significantly to the binding energy (28Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 29Jin L. Wells J.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural epitope of a protein, which is defined as the side chains buried at the binding interface, is larger than the functional epitope, which is defined as the side chains that contribute to the binding energy (32Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Additionally, the sum of the changes in binding energy of individual alanine mutants typically exceeds the total binding energy for the interaction of the wild-type protein because of side chain interactions (26Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Therefore, although alanine scanning mutagenesis can be used to identify amino acid side chains that contribute significantly to binding, it is not possible to determine quantitatively the binding energies associated with individual amino acid side chains.Although the structural epitope for fVIII A2 inhibitors has not been determined by x-ray crystallography, homolog scanning mutagenesis using recombinant human/porcine hybrid fVIII molecules has located a major determinant for human inhibitors and for mAb413 to residues Arg484–Ile508 (17Healey J.F.

A 3.1-Å x-ray structure is available for ceruloplasmin, which contains three A domains homologous to fVIII (33Ziatseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar). Each ceruloplasmin A domain is composed of two homologous subdomains that form a plastocyanin-type β-barrel. Homology models of the fVIII A1, A2, and A3 domains based on the ceruloplasmin and nitrite reductase structures suggest that residues Val483–Glu507 lie in an exposed loop between β-sheets bounded by D482 and Ile508 (34Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in close agreement with the region identified by homolog scanning mutagenesis.In this study, we made nine alanine substitutions within the human Arg484–Ile508 segment where human and porcine fVIII differ. The results with mAb413 are typical of an alanine scanning mutagenesis study. Four of the nine mutants showed greater than 90% decreases in antibody inhibition in the Bethesda assay, and the remainder showed only mild decreases in antibody inhibition (Fig.2). Arg489 appears to be the most important residue that contributes to inhibition by mAb413, since the inhibition of the Arg489 → Ala mutant was reduced by over 10-fold compared with the other mutants.Several findings have indicated that mAb413 and patient A2 inhibitors bind to the same structural region in fVIII. mAb413 competes with human A2 inhibitors for binding to fVIII (6Scandella D. Timmons L. Mattingly M. Trabold N. Hoyer L.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both inhibit fVIIIa in the intrinsic pathway factor X activation complex by a noncompetitive mechanism (36Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Patient A2 inhibitors and mAb413 are poor inhibitors of HP9, which contains substitution of the human Arg484–Ile508 by the homologous porcine segment (17Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14505-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the pattern of inhibition of the patient antibodies toward the alanine mutants is different from mAb413 (Figs. 2and 4). Thus, although patient inhibitors appear to recognize the same antibody binding loop as mAb413, the residues that contribute to the binding energy differ. mAb413 binding is dominated by Arg489 > Tyr487 > Arg484 > Pro492. Patient antibody binding is dominated by Tyr487 and to a lesser extent by Ser488 → Ala, Arg489 → Ala, Pro492 → Ala, Val495 → Ala, Phe501 → Ala, and Ile508 → Ala. The difference between mAb413 and patient inhibitors is consistent with behavior observed for the binding of antibody D1.3 to hen egg white lysozyme and to an anti-D1.3 antibody (31Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). X-ray structural analysis shows that, whereas D1.3 binds lysozyme and anti-D1.3 using essentially the same set of combining site residues, the functionally important residues of D1.3 are different for the two interactions.Another difference between patient antibodies and mAb413 is that patient antibodies inhibit mutants more effectively than mAb413 does. The polyclonal nature of the patient antibodies may account for this behavior. Most likely, A2 antibodies in a given plasma are a population of high affinity antibodies that compete for binding to fVIII because they recognize different functional epitopes within a structural epitope. Single alanine substitutions could greatly reduce the inhibition by a given monoclonal antibody within this population with little change in the inhibition by the entire population. Alternatively, residues within the region bounded by Arg484–Ile508 that are identical in human and porcine fVIII may contribute significantly to antibody binding. These residues were not mutated in this study. This hypothesis must be considered together with the finding that insertion of the porcine Arg484–Ile508 sequence into human B− fVIII decreases the Bethesda titer by greater than 90% in four of the five patient antibodies tested (Fig. 3). It is possible that some porcine replacements do not remove a favorable interaction between antibody and a human residue but instead substitute a residue that is highly unfavorable for antibody binding. If so, substitution of alanine at this position could have little effect on antibody binding. Further analysis of the A2 epitope will require additional mutagenesis and the testing of A2 monoclonal antibodies isolated from the human A2 inhibitor population.Alanine substitutions at critical positions produce novel recombinant fVIII molecules that retain procoagulant function and have reduced inhibition by A2 antibodies. Extension of this approach to other fVIII epitopes could lead to the design of a recombinant fVIII molecule that is useful in the treatment of inhibitor patients. However, the reduction in antigenicity toward patient A2 inhibitors achieved by single alanine substitutions is less than that seen with hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules. Multiple alanine substitutions at inhibitor epitopes may further reduce antigenicity. Alternatively, replacement of the common inhibitor epitopes with porcine sequences may be superior to alanine mutagenesis for therapeutic purposes.A more general problem is to decrease immunogenicity of fVIII,i.e. to decrease the occurrence of clinically significant inhibitors, in hemophilia A patients who are undergoing fVIII replacement therapy. The regulation of the immune response to fVIII is poorly understood. In particular, it is not clear why only two or three epitopes dominate the fVIII inhibitor response. Structural studies indicate that the entire surface of a protein is immunogenic, at least with selected experimental protein antigens under certain conditions of antigenic stimulus, such as the use of adjuvants (28Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Benjamin D.C. Berzofsky J.A. East I.J. Gurd F.R.N. Hannum C. Leach S.J. Margoliash E.

Webster R.G. Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). An epitope could be immunodominant, by virtue of the concentration or affinity of its cognate antibodies, because of T cell regulation of antibody producing B cells and be independent of the structure of the epitope. Alternatively, the structure of the epitope could contribute intrinsically to immunodominance. In the latter instance, amino acid side chains within the epitope would partly determine the degree to which the immune system can make high affinity antibodies.All of the patient antibodies in this study appear to recognize a similar epitope (Fig. 4). The consistent pattern of antibody recognition at the amino acid level is remarkable, especially considering that the antibodies come from patients in two very different immunological settings (i.e. alloimmune and autoimmune, Table I). If the A2 epitope is intrinsically immunogenic, then it is possible that mutagenesis of immunodominant residues could yield a less immunogenic fVIII molecule.

Inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) to fVIII can arise as alloantibodies in patients with hemophilia A transfused with fVIII or as autoantibodies in non-hemophiliacs (2Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Semin.

Most fVIII inhibitor plasmas contain antibodies that bind to epitopes located in the A2, C2, and/or A3-C1 domains of fVIII (3Fulcher C.A. Mahoney S.D. Roberts J.R. Kasper C.K. Zimmerman T.S. Proc.

We have used recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules to map a major inhibitor epitope determinant to a 25-residue segment bounded by residues Arg484–Ile508 in the A2 domain (17Healey J.F.

In this region, there are nine amino acid differences between human and porcine fVIII (18Lubin I.M. Healey J.F. Scandella D. Runge M.S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8639-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we constructed human fVIII cDNAs that encode single alanine substitutions at positions where the human and porcine fVIII sequences differ to identify specific amino acid residues that contribute to the A2 inhibitor epitope. These constructs were stably expressed as active fVIII molecules in mammalian cells, and their inhibition by mAb413 (a model murine monoclonal A2 inhibitor) and by a panel of A2-specific patient antibodies was measured. DISCUSSIONAlanine scanning mutagenesis has been used widely to study binding sites on proteins (25Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 26Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions are dominated by electrostatic effects, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions between large, nonpolar side chains. Alanine is used as a substitute because it is uncharged and has the smallest amino acid side chain except glycine, which is not preferred because it can change the main chain conformation of the protein.Analysis of protein-protein complexes by x-ray crystallography shows that typically 20–30 amino acid side chains of a protein make contact with its binding partner (27Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Interestingly, alanine scanning mutagenesis studies typically reveal that only a few of these residues contribute significantly to the binding energy (28Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 29Jin L. Wells J.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural epitope of a protein, which is defined as the side chains buried at the binding interface, is larger than the functional epitope, which is defined as the side chains that contribute to the binding energy (32Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Additionally, the sum of the changes in binding energy of individual alanine mutants typically exceeds the total binding energy for the interaction of the wild-type protein because of side chain interactions (26Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Therefore, although alanine scanning mutagenesis can be used to identify amino acid side chains that contribute significantly to binding, it is not possible to determine quantitatively the binding energies associated with individual amino acid side chains.Although the structural epitope for fVIII A2 inhibitors has not been determined by x-ray crystallography, homolog scanning mutagenesis using recombinant human/porcine hybrid fVIII molecules has located a major determinant for human inhibitors and for mAb413 to residues Arg484–Ile508 (17Healey J.F.

A 3.1-Å x-ray structure is available for ceruloplasmin, which contains three A domains homologous to fVIII (33Ziatseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar). Each ceruloplasmin A domain is composed of two homologous subdomains that form a plastocyanin-type β-barrel. Homology models of the fVIII A1, A2, and A3 domains based on the ceruloplasmin and nitrite reductase structures suggest that residues Val483–Glu507 lie in an exposed loop between β-sheets bounded by D482 and Ile508 (34Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in close agreement with the region identified by homolog scanning mutagenesis.In this study, we made nine alanine substitutions within the human Arg484–Ile508 segment where human and porcine fVIII differ. The results with mAb413 are typical of an alanine scanning mutagenesis study. Four of the nine mutants showed greater than 90% decreases in antibody inhibition in the Bethesda assay, and the remainder showed only mild decreases in antibody inhibition (Fig.2). Arg489 appears to be the most important residue that contributes to inhibition by mAb413, since the inhibition of the Arg489 → Ala mutant was reduced by over 10-fold compared with the other mutants.Several findings have indicated that mAb413 and patient A2 inhibitors bind to the same structural region in fVIII. mAb413 competes with human A2 inhibitors for binding to fVIII (6Scandella D. Timmons L. Mattingly M. Trabold N. Hoyer L.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both inhibit fVIIIa in the intrinsic pathway factor X activation complex by a noncompetitive mechanism (36Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Patient A2 inhibitors and mAb413 are poor inhibitors of HP9, which contains substitution of the human Arg484–Ile508 by the homologous porcine segment (17Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14505-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the pattern of inhibition of the patient antibodies toward the alanine mutants is different from mAb413 (Figs. 2and 4). Thus, although patient inhibitors appear to recognize the same antibody binding loop as mAb413, the residues that contribute to the binding energy differ. mAb413 binding is dominated by Arg489 > Tyr487 > Arg484 > Pro492. Patient antibody binding is dominated by Tyr487 and to a lesser extent by Ser488 → Ala, Arg489 → Ala, Pro492 → Ala, Val495 → Ala, Phe501 → Ala, and Ile508 → Ala. The difference between mAb413 and patient inhibitors is consistent with behavior observed for the binding of antibody D1.3 to hen egg white lysozyme and to an anti-D1.3 antibody (31Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). X-ray structural analysis shows that, whereas D1.3 binds lysozyme and anti-D1.3 using essentially the same set of combining site residues, the functionally important residues of D1.3 are different for the two interactions.Another difference between patient antibodies and mAb413 is that patient antibodies inhibit mutants more effectively than mAb413 does. The polyclonal nature of the patient antibodies may account for this behavior. Most likely, A2 antibodies in a given plasma are a population of high affinity antibodies that compete for binding to fVIII because they recognize different functional epitopes within a structural epitope. Single alanine substitutions could greatly reduce the inhibition by a given monoclonal antibody within this population with little change in the inhibition by the entire population. Alternatively, residues within the region bounded by Arg484–Ile508 that are identical in human and porcine fVIII may contribute significantly to antibody binding. These residues were not mutated in this study. This hypothesis must be considered together with the finding that insertion of the porcine Arg484–Ile508 sequence into human B− fVIII decreases the Bethesda titer by greater than 90% in four of the five patient antibodies tested (Fig. 3). It is possible that some porcine replacements do not remove a favorable interaction between antibody and a human residue but instead substitute a residue that is highly unfavorable for antibody binding. If so, substitution of alanine at this position could have little effect on antibody binding. Further analysis of the A2 epitope will require additional mutagenesis and the testing of A2 monoclonal antibodies isolated from the human A2 inhibitor population.Alanine substitutions at critical positions produce novel recombinant fVIII molecules that retain procoagulant function and have reduced inhibition by A2 antibodies. Extension of this approach to other fVIII epitopes could lead to the design of a recombinant fVIII molecule that is useful in the treatment of inhibitor patients. However, the reduction in antigenicity toward patient A2 inhibitors achieved by single alanine substitutions is less than that seen with hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules. Multiple alanine substitutions at inhibitor epitopes may further reduce antigenicity. Alternatively, replacement of the common inhibitor epitopes with porcine sequences may be superior to alanine mutagenesis for therapeutic purposes.A more general problem is to decrease immunogenicity of fVIII,i.e. to decrease the occurrence of clinically significant inhibitors, in hemophilia A patients who are undergoing fVIII replacement therapy. The regulation of the immune response to fVIII is poorly understood. In particular, it is not clear why only two or three epitopes dominate the fVIII inhibitor response. Structural studies indicate that the entire surface of a protein is immunogenic, at least with selected experimental protein antigens under certain conditions of antigenic stimulus, such as the use of adjuvants (28Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Benjamin D.C. Berzofsky J.A. East I.J. Gurd F.R.N. Hannum C. Leach S.J. Margoliash E.

Webster R.G. Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). An epitope could be immunodominant, by virtue of the concentration or affinity of its cognate antibodies, because of T cell regulation of antibody producing B cells and be independent of the structure of the epitope. Alternatively, the structure of the epitope could contribute intrinsically to immunodominance. In the latter instance, amino acid side chains within the epitope would partly determine the degree to which the immune system can make high affinity antibodies.All of the patient antibodies in this study appear to recognize a similar epitope (Fig. 4). The consistent pattern of antibody recognition at the amino acid level is remarkable, especially considering that the antibodies come from patients in two very different immunological settings (i.e. alloimmune and autoimmune, Table I). If the A2 epitope is intrinsically immunogenic, then it is possible that mutagenesis of immunodominant residues could yield a less immunogenic fVIII molecule. Alanine scanning mutagenesis has been used widely to study binding sites on proteins (25Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A.

https://openalex.org/W1994997262,"The highly conserved lysine residue Lys758 in the fifth stalk segment of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was substituted with either isoleucine or arginine by site-directed mutagenesis. The substitution with arginine was without significant effects on Ca2+-ATPase function, whereas multiple changes of functional characteristics were observed with the Lys758→ Ile mutant. These included insensitivity of ATPase activity to the calcium ionophore A23187, an alkaline shift of the pH dependence of ATPase activity, reduced maximum molecular turnover rate and steady-state phosphorylation level, reduced apparent affinities for Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate, as well as increased sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate. Analysis of the partial reaction steps of the enzyme cycle traced these changes to two steps. The rate of dephosphorylation of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E 2 P) was increased, irrespective of variations of pH, K+, Ca2+, and dimethyl sulfoxide concentration. In addition, the rate of conversion of the dephosphoenzyme with low Ca2+ affinity (E 2) to the Ca2+-bound form activated for phosphorylation (E 1Ca2) was reduced in the mutant, and the ATP-induced rate enhancement of this step required higher ATP concentrations in the mutant compared with the wild type."
https://openalex.org/W2016647946,"Lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) is a major component of atherogenic lipids that stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Because cationic amino acids are metabolized to growth-stimulatory polyamines, we examined whether lyso-PC regulates the transcellular transport and metabolism of cationic amino acids by vascular SMC. Treatment of SMC with lyso-PC initially (0–2 h) decreased cationic amino acid uptake, whereas longer exposures (6–24 h) progressively increased transport. Kinetic studies indicated that lyso-PC-induced inhibition was associated with a decrease in affinity for cationic amino acids, but the stimulation was mediated by an increase in transport capacity. Lyso-PC strongly induced the expression of cationic amino acid transporter-2 mRNA while modestly elevating the level of cationic amino acid transporter-1 mRNA. In addition, lyso-PC stimulated intracellular cationic amino acid metabolism by inducing ornithine decarboxylase activity and mRNA expression and also by inducing arginase activity in vascular SMC. In contrast, lyso-PC inhibited the catabolism ofl-arginine to nitric oxide by blocking inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Lyso-PC increased markedly the capacity of SMC to generate putrescine, a polyamine, from extracellularl-ornithine and l-arginine. The lyso-PC-mediated increase in the production of putrescine was reversed by N G-methyl-l-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of cationic amino acid transport, or by α-difluoromethylornithine, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor. The formation of putrescine from l-arginine was also prevented by arginase inhibitorN G-hydroxy-l-arginine. These results demonstrate that lyso-PC stimulates polyamine synthesis in vascular SMC by inducing the expression of the genes that regulate both the transport and metabolism of cationic amino acids. The actions of lyso-PC in stimulating cationic amino acid uptake and directing their metabolism to growth-stimulatory polyamines while simultaneously inhibiting the synthesis of antiproliferative NO, may contribute to lyso-PC-induced SMC proliferation and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) is a major component of atherogenic lipids that stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Because cationic amino acids are metabolized to growth-stimulatory polyamines, we examined whether lyso-PC regulates the transcellular transport and metabolism of cationic amino acids by vascular SMC. Treatment of SMC with lyso-PC initially (0–2 h) decreased cationic amino acid uptake, whereas longer exposures (6–24 h) progressively increased transport. Kinetic studies indicated that lyso-PC-induced inhibition was associated with a decrease in affinity for cationic amino acids, but the stimulation was mediated by an increase in transport capacity. Lyso-PC strongly induced the expression of cationic amino acid transporter-2 mRNA while modestly elevating the level of cationic amino acid transporter-1 mRNA. In addition, lyso-PC stimulated intracellular cationic amino acid metabolism by inducing ornithine decarboxylase activity and mRNA expression and also by inducing arginase activity in vascular SMC. In contrast, lyso-PC inhibited the catabolism ofl-arginine to nitric oxide by blocking inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Lyso-PC increased markedly the capacity of SMC to generate putrescine, a polyamine, from extracellularl-ornithine and l-arginine. The lyso-PC-mediated increase in the production of putrescine was reversed by N G-methyl-l-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of cationic amino acid transport, or by α-difluoromethylornithine, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor. The formation of putrescine from l-arginine was also prevented by arginase inhibitorN G-hydroxy-l-arginine. These results demonstrate that lyso-PC stimulates polyamine synthesis in vascular SMC by inducing the expression of the genes that regulate both the transport and metabolism of cationic amino acids. The actions of lyso-PC in stimulating cationic amino acid uptake and directing their metabolism to growth-stimulatory polyamines while simultaneously inhibiting the synthesis of antiproliferative NO, may contribute to lyso-PC-induced SMC proliferation and atherosclerotic lesion formation.

Lyso-PC also induces chemotaxis of leukocytes and activates endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes into the arterial intima (5Quinn M.T.

Lyso-PC induces gene expression of potent SMC growth factors such as PDGF and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like protein in vascular cells and directly stimulates SMC proliferation (7Kume N.

Recent studies indicate that the synthesis of polyamines plays an integral role in the mitogenic response of vascular SMC. SMC proliferation is preceded by increases in cellular polyamine content and inhibition of polyamine formation prevents cell growth (11Thyberg J. Fredholm B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Nishida K. Abiko T. Ishihara M. Tomikawa M.

Fredholm B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are naturally occurring polycations found in all mammalian cells. Putrescine is generated from the basic amino acid l-ornithine via a decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ODC, whereas spermidine and spermine are synthesized from putrescine through the sequential addition of a propylamine moiety fromS-adenosylmethionine (14Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). Induction of ODC activity and polyamine synthesis is one of the earliest biochemical events associated with cell growth (14Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 15Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). Both arterial injury-induced and PDGF-mediated SMC proliferation are associated with a striking increase in ODC activity (11Thyberg J. Fredholm B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol.

Res. 1987; 61: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of ODC activity inhibits both arterial injury- and PDGF-mediated SMC proliferation, indicating that ODC activity is essential for SMC growth (11Thyberg J. Fredholm B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol.

Res. 1991; 50: 634-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although ODC activity is often believed to be rate-limiting in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, the availability ofl-ornithine also plays a crucial role in regulating polyamine synthesis. Previous studies demonstrate that the steady-state level of l-ornithine markedly influences polyamine formation and DNA synthesis in neoplastic cells (18Wu V.S. Byus C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez G.G. Byus C.V. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2932-2939PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that PDGF-induced polyamine synthesis and vascular SMC mitogenesis are dependent on the transcellular transport of l-ornithine (13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transport of cationic (basic) amino acids, such as l-ornithine andl-arginine, by vascular SMC is mediated by the system y+ carrier (20Low B.C. Ross I.K. Grigor M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Durante W. Liao L. Schafer A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1158-H1164PubMed Google Scholar). This particular transport system is characterized by its recognition of basic amino acids with high affinity, its Na+-independence, and the ability of substrate on the opposite (trans) side of the membrane to increase transport activity (22White M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 355-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recently, the genes encoding the proteins responsible for the activity of the system y+carrier have been cloned and designated as CAT-1, CAT-2, and CAT-2A (23Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57 (634): 659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 24MacLeod C.L. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. Kozak D.K. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both CAT-1 and CAT-2 are low capacity transporters that have a high affinity (K m ≈ 100 μm) for cationic amino acids. In contrast, CAT-2A is an alternate splice variant of CAT-2 which possesses low affinity but high transport capacity (26Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study we found that vascular SMC express mRNA for both of the high affinity transporters, CAT-1 and CAT-2, but do not express message for CAT-2A (13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to transcellular transport, l-ornithine can be obtained from intracellular sources by endogenous synthesis. In this respect, the basic amino acid l-arginine, which enters cells via the same CATs as l-ornithine, is metabolized tol-ornithine and urea by arginase (27Barbul A. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1986; 10: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This enzyme is found in a high concentration in the liver and has recently been identified in vascular cells (28Wu G. Meininger C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1312-H1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Buga G.M. Singh R. Pervin S Rogers N.E. Schmitz D.A. Jenkinson C.P. Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1988-H1998PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, little is known about the regulation of arginase activity in vascular SMC. Because lyso-PC stimulates SMC proliferation and because polyamines play a critical role in mediating cell growth, the present study was designed to determine whether lyso-PC regulates polyamine synthesis. We now report that lyso-PC coordinately induces the gene expression of CAT proteins and ODC, resulting in markedly increased production of polyamines by vascular SMC. In addition, lyso-PC promotes the intracellular metabolism of l-arginine to polyamines by stimulating arginase activity. These lyso-PC-induced actions that promote SMC proliferation are amplified by lyso-PC inhibition of the synthesis of antiproliferative NO by inhibition of iNOS protein expression.

Subcultured strains were used between passages 6 and 26. When cells reached confluence, the culture media were replaced with serum-free media containing bovine serum albumin (0.1%) for 24 h. Treatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC was restricted to those concentrations that did not affect cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion (30Durante W. Schini V.B. Catovksy S.

Methods. 1983; 655: 55-63Crossref Scopus (45846) Google Scholar). Cationic amino acid transport was determined by measuring the influx of radiolabeledl-ornithine or l-arginine into SMC (21Durante W. Liao L. Schafer A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1158-H1164PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with either basic amino acid. Cells were washed with HEPES buffer (140 mm choline chloride, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 45 s in HEPES buffer containingl-[3H]ornithine orl-[3H]arginine (50 μm; 1 μCi). Transport activity was terminated by aspirating the media and rapidly washing the cells with ice-cold HEPES buffer. Cells were then solubilized by the addition of 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.2n NaOH, and a portion of the extract was collected for liquid scintillation counting. The remaining extract was used for the determination of protein concentration utilizing the bicinchoninic acid method with serum albumin as the standard. SMC were harvested in ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm pyridoxal 5-phosphate, pH 7.4), sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected, and ODC activity was determined by measuring the release of14CO2 froml-[1-14C]ornithine, as described previously (32Russell D.H. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using γ-globulin as the standard, and enzymatic activity was expressed in pmol of CO2/mg of protein/h. Polyamine formation was determined by incubating SMC with l-[3H]ornithine orl-[3H]arginine and monitoring the intracellular formation of radiolabeled putrescine, as described previously (13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SMC were incubated withl-[3H]ornithine orl-[3H]arginine (20 μCi/mmol) for 24 h and the reactions stopped by removing the radiolabel-containing media and washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were solubilized in Tris buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing Triton X-100 (0.01%), and aliquots of the supernatant were spotted onto TLC plates and developed in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (1:4:2:1, v/v/v). After drying, putrescine was detected by ninhydrin spray, and [3H]putrescine was identified by co-chromatography with unlabeled putrescine, scraped, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Arginase activity was determined by monitoring the formation of [14C]urea froml-[guanido-14C]larginine (33Russell A.S. Ruegg U.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 32: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SMC were lysed for 30 min in Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing Triton X-100 (0.4%), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), and aprotonin (10 mg/ml). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and an aliquot of the supernatant was added to an equal volume of Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing MnCl2 (10 mm). Arginase was then activated by heating for 10 min at 56 °C and the arginase reaction initiated by adding Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 9.6) containingl-arginine (10 mm) and l-[guanido-14C]larginine (0.25 Ci). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and reactions terminated by adding ice-cold sodium acetate (250 mm, pH 4.5) containing urea (100 mm). [14C]Urea was separated from basic amino acids by adding a continuously stirred suspension of Dowex resin (50W-X8 100–200 mesh; 1 g/ml water) to the samples. Samples were shaken, centrifuged at 1,000 × gfor 5 min, and an aliquot was collected for scintillation counting. Arginase activity was expressed in μmol of urea/mg of protein/h. Total cellular RNA was obtained by the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl procedure and RNA concentration determined by absorbance spectrophotometry at 260 nm (34Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J.

CAT mRNA levels were determined by solution hybridization/ribonuclease protection analysis; ODC mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting (13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I.

For both ribonuclease protection assays and Northern blotting, relative mRNA levels were quantified by scanning densitometry (LKB 2222-020 Ultrascan XL laser densitometer, Bromma, Sweden) and normalized with respect to GAPDH mRNA. The expression of iNOS by SMC was determined by measuring NO release and by monitoring iNOS protein levels. NO synthesis was assessed by measuring the extracellular release of nitrite, the stable oxidation product of NO (37Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8706-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar), with the Griess reagent (38Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowsky J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal.

Statistical analysis was performed with the use of Student's two-tailed t test and an analysis of variance when more than two treatments were compared; p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Treatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC stimulated the transport ofl-ornithine and l-arginine in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1). In contrast, PC had no effect on cationic amino acid transport (Fig. 1). Time course studies demonstrated that lyso-PC (100 μm) had a biphasic effect on cationic amino acid transport (Fig.2). Initially, lyso-PC inhibited the transport of basic amino acids, but by 6 h of lyso-PC treatment a significant rise in transport was observed; this was increased further after 24 h of treatment. Incubation of SMC with a neutralizing antibody directed against PDGF had no effect on lyso-PC-stimulated l-ornithine transport but completely prevented the PDGF-mediated increase in uptake (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of lyso-PC-regulated cationic amino acid transport in vascular SMC. Specific transport of 50 μml-[3H]ornithine orl-[3H]arginine was measured in HEPES buffer after preincubation with lyso-PC (100 μm) for the indicated times. Results are means ± S.E. of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. * indicates a statistically significant effect of lyso-PC treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In subsequent kinetic studies, saturable uptake of radiolabeledl-ornithine (5–500 μm) was measured. As evident from a representative Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig.3), high affinity uptake ofl-ornithine by vascular SMC was mediated by a single carrier. Data from several experiments (n = 5) indicated that this transporter had a Michaelis constant (K m ) of 128.3 ± 13.1 μm and a maximum transport velocity (V max) of 770 ± 77 pmol/mg of protein/45 s. Pretreatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC (100 μm) for 24 h significantly increased both theK m (216.6 ± 14.5 μm;p < 0.05) and V max (3,206 ± 195 pmol/mg of protein/45 s; p < 0.05) of thel-ornithine transporter. The increase inV max of cationic amino transport by lyso-PC was completely abolished with actinomycin D (2 μg/ml) (data not shown). Treatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC (100 μm) rapidly induced the expression of the mRNA of both cationic amino acid transporters, CAT-1 and CAT-2 (Fig. 4). Both CAT transcripts peaked 2 h after exposure to lyso-PC; however, the increase in CAT-2 message (≈20-fold) was much greater than that of CAT-1 (≈3-fold) (Fig. 4). The elevated levels of CAT mRNA decayed rapidly, but messages for CATs reappeared again at 24 h at levels comparable to those observed at 2 h (Fig.4). Incubation of vascular SMC with lyso-PC also induced ODC activity. Significant increases in enzyme activity were evident 4 h after lyso-PC (100 μm) addition, reached maximum activity at 8 h (≈20-fold), and then declined to near basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 5 A). Increases in ODC activity were dependent on the concentration of lyso-PC (Fig.5 B) and were blocked by actinomycin D (data not shown). In contrast, PC failed to stimulate ODC activity (data not shown). SMC expressed two faint ODC transcripts of approximately 2.6 and 2.2 kb (Fig. 6). Treatment of SMC with lyso-PC resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in ODC message with proportional increases (≈12-fold) in the two mRNA species (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of lyso-PC on the expression of ODC mRNA in vascular SMC.

The stimulatory effect of lyso-PC on putrescine synthesis was inhibited by the cationic amino acid transport inhibitorN G-methyl-l-arginine (21Durante W. Liao L. Schafer A.I. Am. J.

Vascular SMC also expressed constitutive arginase activity (1.6 ± 0.2 μmol of urea/mg of protein/h, n = 4) which was increased by lyso-PC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A). In addition, lyso-PC increased the capacity of SMC to generate putrescine from extracellular l-arginine (Fig. 8 B). The latter experiments were based on the rationale that l-arginine must be converted to l-ornithine by arginase to be metabolized to putrescine by the action of ODC. Therefore, stimulation of arginase by lyso-PC would result in increased synthesis of [3H]putrescine froml-[3H]arginine. The stimulatory effect of lyso-PC on putrescine synthesis was inhibited by the arginase inhibitorl-NOHA (41Daghigh F. Fukuto J.M. Ash D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 42Hecker M. Nematollahi H. Hey C. Busse R. Racke K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359 (154): 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and by the ODC inhibitor DFMO (Fig.8 B). Finally, incubating SMC with interleukin-1β (5 ng/ml) for 24 h stimulated the accumulation of nitrite in the incubation medium and induced the expression of iNOS protein (Fig.9). The addition of lyso-PC (100 μm) to SMC inhibited the interleukin-1β-stimulated production of the NO oxidation product, nitrite, in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced markedly the cytokine-induced rise in iNOS protein (Fig. 9). In the absence of interleukin-1β, lyso-PC had no effect on SMC NO production or iNOS protein levels (Fig. 9). The present study demonstrates that lyso-PC stimulates polyamine synthesis in vascular SMC by modulating the expression of the genes that regulate the transport and metabolism of cationic amino acids (see Fig. 10). In particular, lyso-PC increases the transcellular transport of basic amino acids and the intracellular metabolism of l-ornithine to polyamines by stimulating the expression of the genes for both CAT and ODC. In addition, lyso-PC directs the intracellular metabolism ofl-arginine to polyamines by stimulating arginase activity and by blocking iNOS. These effects are specific for the lysophospholipid because PC has no effect on cationic amino acid transport or metabolism. The capacity of lyso-PC to augment the transport of basic amino acids and direct their metabolism to growth-stimulatory polyamines (and away from growth-inhibitory NO) may contribute to the proliferative actions of lyso-PC. Treatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC stimulates the transport of cationic amino acids in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Kinetic experiments indicate that high affinity (K m ≈ 130 μm) basic amino acid transport is mediated by a single carrier system and that lyso-PC increases both theV max and K m of this transport system. These kinetic data suggest that the lyso-PC-induced decrease in cationic amino acid uptake observed at early time points likely arises from a lyso-PC-mediated decrease in affinity of the transporter. In contrast, the increase in basic amino acid transport observed at later time points may result from the de novo induction of transport protein. Studies in our laboratory and others have demonstrated that high affinity transport of cationic amino acids by vascular SMC is mediated by CAT-1 and CAT-2 (13Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Shafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our current study demonstrates that lyso-PC stimulates CAT-1 and CAT-2 mRNA expression. Although the relative contribution of these CAT proteins to the overall activity of the system y+carrier is difficult to determine because of their similar kinetic properties, the much greater increase in CAT-2 mRNA compared with CAT-1 suggests that CAT-2B mediates most of the lyso-PC-mediated increase in l-ornithine transport. Interestingly, whereas CAT mRNA expression is elevated during the initial 2 h after lyso-PC treatment, transport activity is increased several hours later when CAT transcripts have decayed to near basal levels. This dissociation between CAT message and transport activity may reflect the time required for the translation, post-translational modification, and eventual insertion of the CAT protein into the plasma membrane to yield a functional transporter. The co-expression of both CAT-1 and CAT-2 mRNA in vascular SMC after lyso-PC treatment is also observed after the administration of PDGF or angiotensin, but it contrasts with the selective expression of CAT-2 by inflammatory cytokines (13Durante W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11280-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lyso-PC induces PDGF synthesis from vascular cells (7Kume N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the lyso-PC effect is secondary to PDGF release. However, neutralizing antibodies to PDGF fail to modulate lyso-PC-mediated increases in basic amino acid uptake. It is possible that SMC-derived PDGF exerts its effect in an intracrine manner, which would be unaffected by neutralizing antibodies. The ability of lyso-PC to stimulate CAT gene expression directly and to evoke the release of secondary autocrine mediators may account for the biphasic temporal expression of CAT transcripts. In addition to stimulating l-ornithine transport, lyso-PC stimulates the metabolism of intracellular l-ornithine to polyamines in vascular SMC. The lyso-PC-mediated increase in ODC activity is paralleled by an increase in ODC mRNA, suggesting that lyso-PC stimulates ODC gene transcription. The inhibition of lyso-PC-stimulated ODC activity by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D is consistent with this notion. The presence of two ODC mRNA species in vascular SMC is also in agreement with previous studies utilizing other cell types and inducing stimuli (36Gilmour S.K. Avdalovic N. Madara T. O'Brien T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16439-16444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Berger F.G. Szymanski P. Read E. Watson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7941-7946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two ODC mRNA species arise from the alternative use of two different polyadenylation signals (46Hickok N.J. Seppanen P.J. Kontula K.K. Janne P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 47Wen L. Huang J.-K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9016-9021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transport and metabolism of l-ornithine appear to be closely coupled after lyso-PC administration. This is reflected by the delayed, parallel concentration-dependent increase in CAT and ODC activities. The co-induction of these two proteins by lyso-PC may provide a mechanism by which increased levels of substrate (l-ornithine) are provided to SMC during activation of the ODC enzyme. In this respect, treatment of vascular SMC with lyso-PC is associated with a prominent increase in the capacity of SMC to generate putrescine. This lyso-PC-mediated effect is blocked by the cationic amino acid transport inhibitorN G-methyl-l-arginine and by the selective ODC inhibitor DFMO, indicating that both the transcellular transport of l-ornithine and ODC activity are limiting factors that regulate the capacity of lyso-PC to generate polyamines in vascular SMC. Interestingly, whereas lyso-PC results in a transient elevation in ODC activity which returns to basal levels after 24 h of lyso-PC exposure, cationic amino acid transport activity increases progressively during this time. These findings indicate thatl-ornithine uptake is dissociated from polyamine synthesis at later time points. The elevated rate of transport at this time may function to provide the necessary amino acids required for the synthesis of new proteins during cell growth. Because lyso-PC stimulates the transcellular transport ofl-arginine as well as l-ornithine into SMC, the effect of lyso-PC on intracellular l-arginine metabolism was also investigated. We found that vascular SMC possess substantial arginase activity and that lyso-PC increases this activity. This finding complements recent studies demonstrating constitutive arginase activity in endothelial cells (28Wu G. Meininger C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1312-H1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Buga G.M. Singh R. Pervin S Rogers N.E. Schmitz D.A. Jenkinson C.P. Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1988-H1998PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of arginase activity in vascular cells is unknown, we suggest that arginase may function to shunt l-arginine tol-ornithine metabolism to generate biologically relevant polyamines. In support of this proposal, we found that lyso-PC increases the capacity of SMC to generate putrescine froml-arginine and that this lyso-PC effect is blocked by the arginase inhibitor l-NOHA. The ability of lyso-PC to induce coordinately the transcellular transport and the intracellular synthesis of l-ornithine may function to maximize the cellular capacity for polyamine biosynthesis. In vascular SMC l-arginine is also metabolized to NO andl-citrulline by iNOS (48Busse R. Mulsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). NO is an important antiatherogenic molecule. In addition to being a potent vasodilator, it inhibits platelet aggregation, vascular SMC proliferation, and monocyte adherence, all of which are key contributors in the development of atherosclerosis (49Gruetter C.A.

Palmer R.M.J. Martin J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that lyso-PC attenuates cytokine-stimulated SMC NO synthesis by inhibiting iNOS protein expression. In contrast, an earlier study demonstrated that lyso-PC stimulates the transcriptional activation of the constitutive endothelial NOS gene (53Zembowicz A. Tang J. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results indicate that lyso-PC has divergent isoform-specific regulatory effects on NOS gene expression. The ability of lyso-PC to shunt the metabolism ofl-arginine from the iNOS to the arginase pathway in vascular SMC may serve to promote further the mitogenic and atherogenic effects of lyso-PC. The concentration of lyso-PC required to regulate cationic amino acid transport and metabolism in vascular SMC is similar to the level needed to induce gene expression of other proteins in vascular cells (6Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 7Kume N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin.

Although this concentration is higher than the level of lyso-PC present in oxidized low density lipoprotein (≈10 μm) (8Chai Y.-C. Howe P.H. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17791-17797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 54Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Miyake R. Akita H. Ishikawa Y. Fukuzaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1992; 183: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the response of SMC to lyso-PC may be physiologically relevant because cells can generate additional lyso-PC by the action of phospholipase A2 on membrane PC (56Vadas P. Prudzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the actual concentration of free lyso-PC in our study is much lower than the reported concentration because the experiments were performed in the presence of albumin, which has a high affinity for lysophospholipids (57Ulrich K.H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 17-54PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that lyso-PC stimulates the transport of cationic amino acids by inducing the expression of the genes for CAT-1 and CAT-2 and increases l-ornithine metabolism by inducing ODC activity. In addition, lyso-PC redirects the metabolism of l-arginine from the formation of antiproliferative NO to the synthesis of growth-stimulatory polyamines. As shown in the model in Fig. 10, these multiple sites of action of lyso-PC found in this study appear to be coordinately directed toward promoting the proliferative capacity of vascular SMC. The actions of lyso-PC to up-regulate basic amino acid transport and direct their metabolism to polyamines may contribute to SMC proliferation and atherosclerotic lesion formation."

Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To date, this mechanism seen in rabbits has not been clarified despite its significance in toxicology. The activation of CYP1A1 gene by aryl hydrocarbons is mediated by a soluble protein designated as AhR (8Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Prior to the binding with such an inducer, AhR exists in the cytoplasm as part of a complex that has a molecular mass of about 280 kDa. This complex is comprised of AhR, two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90), and possibly other proteins (9Gonzalez F.J. Liu S.-Y. Yano M. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Denis M. Cuthill S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After binding with a ligand, AhR dissociates from the above complex and translocates to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with Arnt (13Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 14Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimer AhR·Arnt complex binds to several copies of short sequences, termed XREs, located within the 5′-flanking region of CYP1A1 gene to stimulate the synthesis of CYP1A1 protein and several other proteins involved in xenobiotic metabolism (15Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 16Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L.

Thus, the induction of CYP1A1 is regulated exclusively at the transcriptional level (19Israel D.I. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5400-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Gonzalez F.J. Tukey R.H. Nebert D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar). AhR and Arnt proteins have two domains necessary for the TCDD-induced activation of CYP1A1 gene. One of the two domains is the Per-Arnt-Sim region composed of approximately 300 amino acids that mediates the ligand binding and interaction with Hsp90. This region is also found in the Drosophila regulatory proteins Per and Sim (21Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton K.A. Crews S.T. Cell. 1991; 67: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and the mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (22Wang G.L. Jiang B. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). The other is a bHLH motif essential to the DNA binding and the dimerization of AhR and Arnt toward their amino termini (23Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O.

Most transcriptional factors such as Max, USF1, MyoD, and E47 contain bHLH motif and bind as dimers to the specific DNA sequence (CACGTG), termed E-box (25Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pendergast G.C.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that Arnt constitutively binds as a homodimer to the E-box motif of AdMLP (29Antonsson C.

On the other hand, the AhR·Arnt heterodimer recognizes an asymmetrical XRE sequence that only partially resembles the E-box. The consensus sequence of XRE has been identified as 5′-(T/G)NGCGTG(A/C)(G/C)(A/T)-3′ (31Yao E.F. Deninson M.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5060-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Four core nucleotides (5′-CGTG-3′) within XRE are absolutely required for the binding with AhR·Arnt heterodimer. Arnt binds to the thymidine in the 5′-CGTG-3′ core identical to an E-box half site (GTG), whereas AhR binds to 5′ proximal to the 5′-CGTG-3′ core in the XRE (34Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found USF1 to be an additional factor capable of binding to the rabbit XRE to inhibit the interaction of the AhR·Arnt complex with XRE in rabbits. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of rabbitCYP1A1 gene (35Storm D.K. Postlind H. Tukey R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a gene library prepared from the rabbit DNA cleaved by EcoRI and cloned into λZAPII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a 32P-labeled CYP1A1 cDNA as a probe (36Kagawa N. Mihara K. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By screening about 1.1 × 105 plaques, we obtained a genomic clone (pBK4.5k) containing the 5′-flanking region of rabbit CYP1A1 gene and mapped for further studies. Fusion genes with various external deletions were constructed as follows. The pBK4.5k was treated with exonuclease III after cleavage withSacI and BamHI. The digested plasmids were treated with T4 DNA ligase and then introduced into Escherichia coli TG1 to yield intermediate plasmids. These intermediate plasmids were cleaved with KpnI and HindIII to shorten them and to obtain the various lengths of 5′-flanking sequences. The fragments were inserted into the uniqueKpnI-HindIII site of the basic vector 2 (Stratagene). A cDNA fragment for human USF1 (37Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Rorder R.G.

Kamataki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resultant expression plasmids, designated AhR-SRα, Arnt-SRα, and USF-SRα, were used for the transfection. To ascertain the contribution of USF1 in rabbit kidney RK13 cells, reporter plasmids XRE-TK/Luc and TK/Luc were constructed. The double-stranded XRE was subcloned into the basic vector 2 by a blunt end ligation. The basal TK promoter was then inserted into theNheI-HindIII site of the plasmid. The copy number and the direction of the oligonucleotides inserted into the reporter plasmids were confirmed by sequence analysis (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the livers of nontreated rabbits (New Zealand White, male) at 0–4 °C as described by Schibler et al. (40Schibler U. Hagenbuchele O. Wellauer P.K. Pittet A.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), except for 1% aprotinin (Sigma) and 0.1 mm PMSF (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in an initial homogenization buffer. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9) containing 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol twice for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the extracts were snap-frozen in 0.05-ml aliquots at 5–10 mg of protein/ml and stored in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear extracts from RK13 cells were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (41Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Twice the cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9) containinng 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) were added into a tube containing cells. The cell suspension was kept on ice for 10 min. Then the cells were homogenized (20–30 strokes) and centrifuged. The cells were washed once with the buffer A and were resuspended with a pellet volume of a dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9) containing 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF), followed by the addition of the same volume of the dialysis buffer containing 1.26 m NaCl. The solution was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed toward the dialysis buffer. The solution was used as the RK13 nuclear extract. Gel shift assay was performed with 10 μl of a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4% Ficoll, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of carrier DNA, 5% glycerol, 5–10 μg of nuclear extracts, and a 32P-labeled probe DNA (5 fmol). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Oligonucleotide primers used as probes are as follows: XRE3, 5′-TCCCCCCAGTTCGCGTGACTGCGCCGGGA-3′ and 3′-AGGGGGGTCAAGCGCACTGACGCGGCCCT-5′; mutant XRE3, 5′-TCCCCCCAGTTCGATTGACTGCGCCGGGA-3′ and 3′-AGGGGGGTCAAGCTAACTGACGCGGCCCT-5′; XRE4, 5′-CGCCCAGGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGGGCTTGGA-3′ and 3′-GCGGGTCCTCAACGCACTCTTCCCGAACCT-5′; XRE5, 5′-GAGTCCCTGCTCGCGTGAGAAGCTCAGCGACC-3′ and 3′-CTCAGGGACGAGCGCACTCTTCGAGTCGCTGG-5′; AdMLP, 5′-GATCCGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGG-3′ and 3′-CTAGGCATCCGGTGCACTGGCCC-5′. In vitrotranscription and translation assays were carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, 1 μg of pBAhR/KS (7Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Shimojima T. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or pBArnt/KS (7Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Shimojima T. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was added to a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50% of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 20 μmcomplete amino acid mixture, 40 units of a ribonuclease inhibitor, and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. AhR and Arnt were labeled by the addition of [35S]methionine to this system. The products were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for molecular weight analysis. A complementary pair of synthetic oligonucleotides containing the core sequence of XRE was annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. A nonspecific competitor, poly(dI-dC) (4.5 ng), was mixed with rabbit AhR and Arnt proteins, expressed in vitro, and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The radiolabeled probe (1 × 105 cpm) was then added and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by a nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The K d values of a XRE-binding factor(s) were calculated from the results of a gel shift assay with a fixed amount of nuclear extracts and the various concentrations of the radiolabeled XRE3. After gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, radiolabeled bands corresponding to the bound and the free DNAs were excised. The resultant radioactivity was measured by a LSC-300 liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies against human AhR and Arnt proteins were prepared as described previously (30Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Antibodies to human USF1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa, Cruz, CA). The super shift assay was performed using these antibodies as follows. After incubation of probe DNAs with a rabbit nuclear extract as described above, antibodies were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The products were then analyzed by a gel shift assay. Rabbit kidney RK13 cells were grown in a minimal essential medium containing fetal calf serum (10%) and nonessential amino acids (42Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter and expression constructs were introduced into the cultured cells by a modification of the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.41Google Scholar). After exposure for 16 h, the DNA-containing culture medium was removed. The cells were washed with a minimal essential medium and then exposed to a culture medium with either 1 μm MC or the equivalent volume of Me2SO (0.1% (v/v) at final concentration as a control). After another 38 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15m NaCl) and then lysed. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. A luciferase activity was determined using Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Tokyo, Japan). β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.41Google Scholar). Each luciferase activity was corrected by β-galactosidase activity. To identify possible regions responsible for the MC-induced expression of rabbitCYP1A1 gene, 5′ deletion mutants were constructed as shown in Fig. 1 A. These plasmids were transfected into rabbit kidney RK13 cells to show the inducibility of CYP1A1 by some inducers (data not shown). The cells were then exposed to MC. The maximal MC-induced activity was seen in the cells transfected with Luc1.6. The activity decreased with progressive deletions starting from −1.6 kb of rabbit CYP1A1 gene. The luciferase activity was significantly decreased by the deletion of the sequences between nucleotides −1.06 and −0.95 kb, −0.95 and −0.83 kb, and −0.68 and −0.45 kb from the transcriptional start sites. These results indicate that at least three regions containing essential XREs are responsible for the induction of rabbit CYP1A1gene. Deletions to −1.28 kb resulted in an approximately 55% decrease in a constitutive expression, whereas further deletions to −0.18 kb decreased to about 5%. Comparing the sequences of possible XREs in the 5′-flanking region of rabbit CYP1A1 gene up to −1.4 kb with the consensus sequence (Fig. 1 B) reported so far, XRE3, XRE4, and XRE5 were found to be identical with the reported consensus sequence (31Yao E.F. Deninson M.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5060-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, other XREs possessed the replacement of some nucleotides from the consensus sequence. To analyze the specificity of AhR·Arnt to bind to the XREs, a competition analysis was carried out (Fig. 1 C). The specific binding of AhR·Arnt disappeared when a 150-fold molar excess of an unlabeled probe (XRE3, XRE4, or XRE5) was added. Thus, we focused on the XREs that possibly regulate the CYP1A1 induction by MC in RK13 cells. We found a constitutive factor(s) in rabbit liver nuclear extracts that bound to XRE3 and XRE5. Thus, the amounts of the constitutive factor(s) present in the nuclear extracts from neonatal livers were compared with those from adult livers (Fig. 2). The binding of a liver-specific transcriptional factor HNF4 (44Ramji D.P. Tadros M.H. Hardon E.M. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was monitored as a control. The amount of the constitutive factor(s) bound to XRE3 and XRE5 was greater in the nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers than neonatal rabbit livers. No shifted bands were observed when the nuclear extracts from neonatal and adult livers were added to XRE4 used as a probe. As a first step to prove our idea that the unknown XRE-binding factor(s) in the nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers bound to XRE to compete with the AhR·Arnt complex, we examined the possibility that the constitutive factor(s) recognized the core sequence of XRE. As shown in Fig.3 A, the factor(s) did not bind to a XRE possessing a mutation, indicating that the core sequence of XRE was specifically recognized by the constitutive factor(s). Additionally, the shifted band disappeared when a 300-fold molar excess of a nucleotide with a consensus sequence (CANNTG) was added, supporting the idea that this constitutive factor(s) belongs to the bHLH family. These results indicate that the factor(s) bound to bHLH sequence modulates CYP1A1 induction in adult rabbit livers by competition with the AhR·Arnt complex to bind to XRE. To test this possibility, we examined whether or not the competition occurred between the factor(s) and AhR·Arnt heterodimer to bind to the XRE. When nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers were absent, the AhR·Arnt complex clearly bound to XRE3 to show a shifted band (Fig.3 B). The amount of the AhR·Arnt heterodimer to bind to XRE3 was decreased by the addition of the constitutive factor(s). Addition of a large amount of the AhR·Arnt complex was needed to obtain an efficient binding to XRE3 in the presence of the factor(s) (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the constitutive factor(s) in adult rabbit livers regulates CYP1A1 induction by competing with the AhR·Arnt complex. The affinities of the AhR·Arnt complex and the constitutive factor(s) to bind to DNA were calculated by saturation binding assays in which a fixed amount of the factor(s) was added and by the binding assay by titration with the increasing amounts of radiolabeled XRE3 (Fig. 4). The data were plotted as the amount of the bound XRE3 versusthe total amount of XRE3. The dissociation constants were calculated from Scatchard plots of the formation of the complex versusthe amounts of free XRE3. The results showed that K d values for the AhR·Arnt complex and the constitutive factor(s) were 2.6 and 1.8 nm, respectively, indicating that the affinities for XRE3 were similar. To prove that the constitutive factor(s) did not contain AhR and Arnt, a gel shift assay using antibodies to human AhR and human Arnt (Fig.5) was performed. To remove AhR and Arnt from the nuclear extracts, antibodies to human AhR or Arnt were added to the nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers. The results showed that a shifted band corresponding to the constitutive factor(s) appeared, indicating that a factor(s) other than the AhR·Arnt complex recognized the core sequence of XRE. The binding of AhR·Arnt heterodimer to XRE disappeared when the antibodies against human AhR were added. Although antibodies to human AhR inhibited the heterodimerization of AhR with Arnt, antibodies to human Arnt did not inhibit the formation of the AhR·Arnt complex (30Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, a super shifted band was detected by the presence of the antibodies against human Arnt. We found that the sequence of rabbit XRE3 was similar to that of the USF1-binding site (Fig. 6). The USF1-binding site was originally identified as the E-box motif (CACGTG) of AdMLP (45Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This site was also found in human growth hormone (46Peritz L.N. Fodor E.J.B. Silversides D.W. Cattini P.A. Baxter J.D. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5005-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse metallothionein I (47Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), rat γ-fibrinogen (48Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Morgan J.G. Crabtree G.R. Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 238: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and Xenopus TFIIIA genes (49Scotto K.W. Kaulen H. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although some nucleotides in the binding site of USF1 identified in a variety of cellular and viral promoters differed from those in the E-box motif (50Vostrov A.A. Quitschke W.W. Vidal F. Schwarzman A.L. Goldgaber D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest to note that the sequence of rabbit XRE3 is identical to that of the USF1-binding site (CGCGTGAC) in the mouse metallothionein I promoter. To determine if USF1 could bind to XRE3, we performed a competition assay using an E-box motif of AdMLP as a competitor. When nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers were added, the formation of the complex with XRE3 was abolished by the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled AdMLP (Fig. 7 A). Super shift bands were detectable with antibodies against USF1, although the amounts of super shift bands varied depending on the probe (Fig. 7 B). To further prove the specific binding of USF1 with XRE3, USF1 was expressed in RK13 cells by transfection of the expression plasmid USF-SRα into the cells. Nuclear extracts prepared from the cells were applied to a gel shift assay. Consequently, a specific band appeared only when nuclear extracts from USF1-transfected cells were applied. Antibodies against USF1 recognized the super shifted band. This antibody-bound complex exhibited a further retarded mobility in the polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7 C). To determine the functional consequences of the interaction of USF1 with XRE3 of rabbit CYP1A1 gene, the expression plasmid carrying USF1 was cotransfected to RK13 cells with the expression vectors for AhR and Arnt in addition to the XRE-TK/Luc or TK/Luc. Relative to pUC-SRα-transfected or nontransfected cells, the transfection of AhR- and Arnt-SRα together with XRE-TK/Luc resulted in a 2-fold increase in basal expression in the absence of MC. USF1 inhibited the transactivation of XRE-TK/Luc reporter gene by the AhR·Arnt complex and MC (Fig. 8 B). Relative to the maximum induction observed with the absence of USF-SRα (16 ± 1-fold), the down-regulation observed with USF-SRα (2 μg) (9.5 ± 0.3-fold) and USF-SRα (4 μg) (6.1 ± 0.2-fold) was significant with p values all equal to <0.0001 but not with USF-SRα (1 μg) (14 ± 1-fold) with p value of >0.05. The increasing amounts of the USF-SRα expression vector did not affect basal expression. However, the transfection of USF-SRα (>5 μg) enhanced the basal activity of XRE-TK/Luc gene (data not shown). The co-transfection of RK13 cells with the USF1 expression vector together with Luc 1.28 reporter plasmid inhibited the induction by MC by 39% (data not shown). These results indicate that USF1 depresses the induction of CYP1A1 by MC in rabbit livers by competing XRE3 with the AhR·Arnt complex. The induction of CYP1A1 by MC occurs only in neonatal and not in adult rabbits, probably resulting in low susceptibility to carcinogens (4Kahl G.F. Friederich D.E. Bigelow S.W. Okey A.B. Nebert D.W. Dev. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 1: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Alvares A.P. Ueng T.-H. Eiseman J.L.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) involved in the nonresponsive nature of rabbits to such an inducer in rabbits has not been clarified despite its significance in toxicology. Our hypothesis to account for this phenomenon is that bHLH proteins in addition to the AhR·Arnt complex are capable of recognizing the core sequence of XRE and that a factor(s) that binds to XRE inhibits the induction of CYP1A1 by MC in adult rabbits. To examine this idea, we performed a gel shift assay using nuclear extracts from adult rabbit livers as a competitor to the binding of the AhR·Arnt complex with XRE3 and found a constitutive factor(s) that inhibited the binding as was expected. Scatchard plots showed that the binding affinity of the factor(s) for XRE3 was similar to that of the AhR·Arnt complex (Fig. 4). In fact, the binding of the AhR·Arnt complex to XRE3 was not observed even after treatment of adult rabbits with MC. Alternatively, the constitutive factor(s) bound to XRE3 (data not shown). Recently, we reported that there was a lesser amount of Arnt mRNA in rabbit livers than in extrahepatic tissues (7Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Shimojima T. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the amount of Arnt limits the amount of the AhR·Arnt complex, leading to the low level of induction of CYP1A1. These results indicate that the interaction of a constitutive factor(s) with XRE3 occurs predominantly in the livers from MC-treated rabbits, accounting for the known fact that the induction by MC does not occur in adult rabbits. A computer search was performed to find a sequence(s) similar to XRE3 in the rabbit CYP1A1 gene. The sequence of rabbit XRE3 was highly homologous to that of USF1-binding sites (Fig. 6). The presence of the conserved sequences has been reported in AdMLP (45Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), human growth hormone (46Peritz L.N. Fodor E.J.B. Silversides D.W. Cattini P.A. Baxter J.D. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5005-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse metallothionein I (47Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), rat γ-fibrinogen (48Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Morgan J.G. Crabtree G.R. Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 238: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and Xenopus TFIIIA genes (49Scotto K.W. Kaulen H. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Particularly, the sequences of XRE3 and XRE5 were identical to the USF1-binding site of mouse metallothionein I promoter (CGCGTG) (Fig. 6). The existence of the XRE core sequence (CGCGTG) allowed us to predict that rabbitCYP1A1 gene is regulated in a positive (AhR·Arnt) and a negative (USF1) manner through the overlapped XRE sequence. Interestingly, the portion of XRE sequence identical with that of USF1 sequence was conserved in humans but not in rats and mice known to be highly responsive to aromatic hydrocarbons (34Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar, 51Sogawa K. Fujisawa S. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike the rabbit CYP1A1 gene, the binding site of USF1 was not found in the possible XRE sequences in the 5′-flanking region of rabbitCYP1A2 gene (35Storm D.K. Postlind H. Tukey R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CYP1A2 is known to be induced by TCDD in both neonatal and adult rabbit livers (35Storm D.K. Postlind H. Tukey R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our super shift assay indicated that one of the constitutive factor(s) was USF1, a bHLH protein (Fig. 5). However, the E-box motif is reported to be recognized by a number of bHLH proteins such as USF2, Max, MyoD, and E47 (25Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This suggests that a factor(s) in addition to USF1 also binds to the core sequence of XRE3. In fact, only some of the bands were super shifted by antibodies to USF1 when XRE3 and AdMLP were used as probes. Similar to the binding shown in the present study, the factor(s) constitutively bound to XRE has been found in human keratinocytes (55Corton J.C. Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 85: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and human fibroblasts (56Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4061-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that an additional XRE-binding factor was detectable only in the presence of TCDD (17Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). Because these findings were obtained with XREs that did not contain the binding site of USF1 within the core sequence, the constitutive factor (USF1) found in the present study was distinct from the above factors. Recently, it has been reported that AhR2 negatively regulates the MC-induced expression ofCYP1A1 gene by blocking the heterodimerization of AhR with Arnt or competing with the AhR·Arnt complex on the same binding site (57Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii Y. Abstr. Jpn. Biochem. Soc. 1996; 68: 1302Google Scholar). Thus, a factor such as AhR2 may also contribute to the negative regulation of the induction of CYP1A1 in rabbits. To date, the mechanism responsible for the suppression of the induction of CYP1A1 has been widely discussed. A negative regulatory element has been found in the 5′-flanking region of human CYP1A1 gene (58Boucher P.D. Hines R.N. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 59Boucher P.D. Ruch R.J. Hines R.N. J. Biol.

Weaver J.A. Sterling K.M. Bresnick E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1996; 28: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An unknown factor(s) in HepG2 cells bound to a 21-base pair palindrome in the human CYP1A1 gene, resulting in the negative regulation of the enhancement of the transcription ofCYP1A1 gene by TCDD. Because the negative regulatory element was not present in the upstream region of rabbit CYP1A1gene, the incapability of adult rabbits to induce CYP1A1 must not be caused by the negative regulatory element-binding factor(s). In the present study, we showed that USF1 bound to XRE3 to compete with the AhR·Arnt complex in the rabbit CYP1A1 gene. Because the sequence of XRE3 in the rabbit, to which USF1 bound, was not present in the 5′-upstream region of rat and mouse CYP1A1gene, the inhibition of the induction by USF1 may not occur in the rat and mouse. This regulation of CYP1A1 expression may account, at least in part, for the species differences in chemical carcinogenesis and cytotoxicity."

The kinetics of GTP binding was investigated by monitoring the fluorescence changes resulting from GTP binding to polymerase and fluorescent 2-aminopurine-containing promoter DNA complex.

Our studies show that GTP at the elongation site binds with at least 10-fold tighter affinity than the GTP at the initiation site. Two conformational changes were revealed upon GTP binding to the polymerase·2-aminopurine DNA complex. The first conformational change occurred upon GTP binding to the elongation site. This conformational change was reversible, and studies with partially melted DNA and incorrect NTPs suggested that it may represent a DNA melting and/or base pairing step. A second rate-limiting conformational change whose rate was same as the maximum rate of pppGpG synthesis occurred after two GTPs were bound. As with DNA polymerases, this rate-limiting conformational change probably occurs at each NMP incorporation event and may be involved in proper positioning of the initiation and the elongating GTPs within the polymerase active site to achieve efficient and accurate RNA synthesis.

It is known that the regulation of gene expression can be brought about by regulating the efficiency of transcription initiation. A number of intrinsic factors govern the efficiency of transcription initiation such as the promoter sequence, the rates and equilibrium constants of promoter opening steps, initiating and elongating NTP binding steps, and RNA synthesis steps during initiation. Whereas the study of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the promoter binding during transcription initiation has been a subject of numerous investigations (1Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), very little is known about the details of the steps following promoter binding. Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, the subject of this study, is a 98-kDa single subunit enzyme that contains all of the activities necessary for the initiation, elongation, and termination of RNA synthesis (3Chamberlin M.J. Ryan T. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 87-108Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Previous kinetic studies have shown that both initiation of RNA synthesis and promoter clearance are slow relative to the elongation of RNA (5Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The efficiencies of both processes therefore govern the overall yield of full-length RNA products. Both the initiation of RNA synthesis and promoter clearance are complex multistep processes, whose individual steps have not been characterized yet. We and others have shown that binding of the polymerase to small synthetic promoter DNAs occurs at close to the diffusion-limited rate constant, and the promoter opening step is fast relative to the rate of initiation (1Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Ujvari A. Martin C.T.

Thus, synthesis of RNA during transcription initiation, at least at a strong T7 promoter such as the Φ10 promoter, appears to be limited by a step between promoter opening and pppGpG formation (5Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been difficult to quantitate by direct means the interactions of the polymerase with the initiating and elongating rNTPs because of the lack of sensitive methods available to measure the kinetics of NTP binding. In this paper, we report stopped-flow kinetic studies that have allowed us to quantitate the transient interactions of the NTPs during initiation. Binding of GTP to polymerase·2-AP DNA complex resulted in time-dependent changes in the fluorescence of 2-AP, which allowed us to dissect the kinetic pathway of initiating and elongating GTP binding and the kinetics of RNA synthesis during initiation as shown in Scheme FS1. Our results show that the elongating GTP binds with at least 10-fold tighterK d compared with the initiating GTP. The binding of GTP at the elongation site was accompanied by a fast fluorescence change that we believe represents a step involved in proper base pairing of GTP with the template DNA and/or DNA melting. A second fluorescence change occurred after both the initiating and the elongating GTP molecules were bound. This fluorescence change was limited by a step that may represent a rate-limiting conformational change occurring prior to phosphodiester bond formation reaction to yield the first RNA product, pppGpG, and this step appears to be analogous to the one proposed in many DNA polymerases (6Patel S.S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Three chromatographic columns consisting of SP-Sephadex, CM-Sephadex, and DEAE-Sephacel (all purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.) were used to purify the RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli strain BL21/pAR1219 (10Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The polymerase was >95% pure as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry. The purified enzyme was stored in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 1 mm Na3-EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 mm NaCl and 50% (v/v) glycerol at −80 °C. The enzyme concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 280 nm and molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105m−1cm−1 (11King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Normal and 2-AP promoter DNAs were synthesized on a Millipore nucleic acid synthesis system 899 as described previously (1Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2-AP CE phosphoramidite (Glenn Research Corp.) was used at positions −3, −1, and +4 for Φ10 nontemplate strand and at positions −4 and −2 for Φ10 template strand 2-AP DNA (Fig. 1). Ultrafast cleavage and deprotection methods provided by Glen Research were used for 2-AP DNA synthesis. Synthetic promoter DNAs were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18% polyacrylamide and 4.4 m urea); the DNAs were visualized by UV shadowing and electroeluted using an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The concentration of DNA was determined from absorbance measurements at 260 nm in TE buffer containing 8 m urea. The extinction coefficients of DNAs were calculated from their sequence and from the following extinction coefficients of the bases: dA, 15,200; dC, 7,050; dG, 12,010; dT, 8,400; 2-AP, 1,000 m−1 cm−1(12Fox J.J. Wempen I. Hampton A. Doerr I.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1669-1675Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The dsDNAs were prepared by annealing the template and nontemplate ssDNAs. To determine the exact 1:1 molar ratio of the complementary ssDNAs, a constant amount of template DNA (10 μm) was titrated with increasing amounts of the nontemplate DNA (3–17 μm). Duplex DNA formation was monitored by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18%) and DNA staining with Stains-all dye (Sigma Chemical Co.). The pre-steady-state kinetic assays were carried out using a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., State College, PA) designed and built by Johnson (13Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The enzyme solution (in 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mmsodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) in one syringe was mixed with [γ-32P]GTP (ICN Biomedicals) + GTP (Sigma Chemical Co.) (in 50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) from a second syringe. The reactions were quenched with 1 n HCl from a third syringe after 5 ms to several seconds in the quench-flow apparatus. The quenched reactions were neutralized with 0.25 m Tris base and 1 m NaOH in the presence of chloroform. The RNA products were analyzed on a highly cross-linked 23% polyacrylamide, 3m urea gel (the stock consisted of 40% acrylamide, 3% bisacrylamide). The substrate ([γ-32P]GTP) and the product RNAs (correct and incorrect) differing by a single base were resolved on the gel and quantitated on a Betascope instrument (Betagen). A stopped-flow instrument from KinTek Corp. was used for all stopped-flow experiments. The preincubated enzyme and 2-AP DNA solution in buffer (50 mmTris acetate, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) was loaded in one syringe, and GTP substrate solution in the same buffer was loaded in the other syringe. GTP binding was measured at 25 °C by rapidly mixing 40-μl solutions from each syringe of the stopped-flow instrument. The 2-AP fluorescence was excited at 315 nm (5-mm slit width), and emission was measured using a photomultiplier tube and a cut-on filter >360 nm (WG 360, Hi-Tech Scientific, serial no. 273129).

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that incorporation of 2-AP base, a fluorescent analog of dA, in the promoter DNA facilitates measurement of DNA binding to the RNA polymerase by stopped-flow kinetics. 2-AP nucleotide base pairs with dT, and its fluorescence is most sensitive to the stacking interactions of 2-AP base with the neighboring bases (14Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Millar D.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that GTP binding to theE·2-AP DNA complex also leads to a change in 2-AP fluorescence. We have used this change in fluorescence to quantitate the transient kinetic interactions of initiating and elongating GTP with the E·D complex. The synthetic DNAs used in this study were 40 base pairs long and contained the natural T7 promoter DNA sequence from position −21 to +19 relative to the transcription start site at +1 of the Φ10 promoter (Fig. 1). The 2-AP bases were chemically incorporated at positions −3, −1, and +4 in the nontemplate strand and −4 and −2 in the template strand in place of dA bases. The promoter DNA with normal dA bases was also synthesized for comparison. Sen and Dasgupta (16Sen R. Dasgupta D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have reported that there is a change in T7 RNA polymerase protein fluorescence upon the addition of GTP. The authors have reported that the GTP binds to T7 RNA polymerase in the absence of promoter DNA with a very tight K d of 25 nm. We wished to use this protein fluorescence change to measure the kinetics of GTP binding to the E·D complex, but we were unable to observe a time-dependent protein fluorescence change when E·D was mixed with GTP in a stopped-flow instrument. We interpret this to mean that either there is no protein fluorescence change when GTP binds to E·D, or the change is too fast for stopped-flow measurement. We have therefore used the 2-AP fluorescence change instead to measure the kinetics of GTP binding to the E·D complex. A preincubatedE·2-AP Φ10 promoter DNA from one syringe of the stopped-flow instrument was mixed with a solution of GTP in 10 mm magnesium acetate buffer from the other syringe. The resulting time-dependent increase in 2-AP fluorescence is shown in Fig. 2. Two distinct kinetic phases were observed. To measure the kinetic rate constants of the fast phase as well as the slow phase accurately, data were collected in two time windows (Fig. 2). The kinetics from 0 to 0.1 s fit to one exponential and provided the rate constant of the fast phase more accurately, whereas the kinetics from 0 to 1.0 s, which fit to two exponentials, provided the rate constant for the slow phase. The stopped-flow kinetics of GTP binding was repeated with increasing [GTP] to assign the fluorescence changes to specific steps in the kinetic pathway of transcription initiation. Fig.3 shows the dependence of the first order rate constants of fluorescence increase on [GTP].Figure 3[GTP] dependence of the stopped-flow fluorescence changes. The stopped-flow kinetics shown in Fig. 2were repeated at increasing [GTP]. The exponential rate constants obtained by curve fitting (as shown in Fig. 2 B) were plottedversus [GTP]. Panel A shows the [GTP] dependence of the fast phase. The solid line represents the fit to a hyperbolic equation (Equation 2), which provided aK 1/2 of 78 ± 46 μm, saturation at 49 ± 8 s−1, and an intercept of 11 ± 9 s−1. Panel B shows the [GTP] dependence of the second slow fluorescence change. The solid line represents the fit to Equation 3, providing an averageK d of GTPs equal to 320 ± 97 μm, rate saturation at 7 ± 0.2 s−1, and intercept of 0.13 ± 0.1 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first order rate constant of the fast phase increased with increasing [GTP] and saturated beyond a certain [GTP] (Fig. 3 A). Because the observed rate constants did not increase linearly with [GTP] but saturated, GTP binding cannot be described by a simple one-step binding process. The observed kinetics indicates that GTP binds to the E·D complex in a two-step process (17Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar) as shown below, (E·D)1+GTP⇌Kd(E·D)1·GTP⇌k−k+(E·D)2·GTPEquation EReaction 1 Observed rate=k+∗[GTP]/(Kd+[GTP])+k−Equation 2 where (E·D) n represents the polymerase-promoter DNA complex in different conformations. Observation of only one fast phase and the saturation of the [GTP] dependence kinetics indicate that the first GTP association step is rapid equilibrium, which is followed by a slow conformational change. The [GTP] dependence fit to hyperbolic Equation 2 and provided the intrinsic equilibrium constant and rate constants of GTP binding. The hyperbolic fit provided the K d of GTP equal to 78 ± 46 μm (K 1/2), the forward rate constant k + of 49 ± 8 s−1 (maximum rate), and the reverse reaction rate constantk − of 11 ± 9 s−1(y intercept). The first order rate constant of the second slow fluorescence change also increased with increasing [GTP] and saturated, but it required very high [GTP] for saturation (Fig. 3 B). The [GTP] dependence of the slow phase did not fit to a hyperbolic equation, but it fit to the [GTP]2 equation, the solution to the two-GTP binding reaction. (E·D)1+2GTP⇌Kd(E·D)1·GTP·GTP⇌k−k+(E·D)2·pppGpGEquation EReaction 2 Observed rate=(k+∗[GTP]2)/(Kd+[GTP]2)+k−Equation 3 The data in Fig. 3 B were described by the Equation 3with a K d equal to 102,164 ± 9,000 μm2 for two-GTP binding, the forward rate constant of the conformational change k + equal to 7 ± 0.2 s−1, and a reverse rate constantk − equal to 0.13 ± 0.1 s−1. The average K d of 320 μm was calculated for the GTP by taking the square root of the two-GTPK d value. The above GTP binding stopped-flow kinetics alone do not allow us to assign the fast or the slow phase to specific steps in the kinetic mechanism. We have therefore compared the stopped-flow GTP binding kinetic data with the presteady-state kinetics of RNA synthesis which was measured by the radiometric gel assay. The presteady-state kinetics of RNA synthesis was measured under the same conditions as the stopped-flow experiments; that is, experiments were carried out in the presence of GTP alone. The experiments were conducted by mixing various concentrations of GTP + [γ-32P]GTP with 20 μm E·D complex. The reactions were stopped in the millisecond to second time scale on the rapid chemical quench-flow instrument. The RNA products synthesized in the first turnover and a few of the subsequent turnovers were quantitated after their resolution on the sequencing gel. The major RNA products in this time scale were the 2-mer, 3-mer, and 4-mer. The resulting kinetics of total RNA synthesis at various [GTP] is shown in Fig. 4 A. The presteady-state kinetics showed a burst of RNA synthesis, which was followed by RNA synthesis at a slower linear steady-state rate. The burst kinetics indicates that RNA is synthesized on the active site of the polymerase at a rate much faster than the recycling of the polymerase, which is required for catalysis of subsequent rounds of RNA synthesis. We have shown previously that the synthesis of pppGpG is slower than the synthesis of pppGpGpG (1Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The [GTP] dependence of the burst rate constant therefore provides a measure of the maximum rate of pppGpG synthesis as well as the average K d of initiating and elongating GTP. When we compare the [GTP] dependence of RNA synthesis with the [GTP] dependence of the fluorescence changes measured by stopped-flow kinetics, it is the dependence of the slow phase which overlays quite well with the RNA synthesis data (Fig. 4 B). This correlation indicates that the slow fluorescence change corresponds to the pppGpG synthesis step, or at least its rate is limited by the pppGpG synthesis step. Taken together the results thus far support the minimal kinetic mechanism shown in Reaction 3. (E·D)1+GTP⇌(E·D)1·GTP⇌(E·D)2·GTP+GTP⇌GTP·(E·D)2·GTP⇌(E·D)3·pppGpGEquation EReaction 3 Binding of one GTP to the E·D complex is followed by a fast reversible conformational change. The binding of both GTPs is followed by a rate-limiting synthesis step or a rate-limiting step that dictates the synthesis of 2-mer RNA. The data thus far do not distinguish between the kinetics of the initiating and the elongating GTP binding. One way to measure the microscopic K d of the two GTPs that bind to the initiating and the elongating sites on the E·D complex is to saturate one of the sites and measure the interactions of the GTP with the other site. Because both sites are specific for GTP, we have used GMP to saturate the initiating binding site and thus measure the interactions of the GTP with the elongating site. It has been shown that GMP can serve as the initiating nucleotide for transcription initiation (18Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow kinetics of GTP binding were measured in the presence of a 750 μmconcentration of GMP, which is close to saturation, since the reported value of GMP K m is 330 μm. The experiments were conducted by preincubating GMP with theE·D complex and rapidly mixing the solution with GTP in the stopped-flow apparatus. The resulting fluorescence changes were identical to those observed in the absence of GMP (Fig.5 A); thus, both fast and slow changes in fluorescence were observed upon GTP binding. The above experimental result and the fact that mixing of GMP alone with theE·D complex did not induce any fluorescence changes (data not shown) indicate that the observed fluorescence changes are the result of the binding of the elongating GTP. Increasing GMP from 500 μm to 1,000 μm did not change the rate constants of the two phases. This indicates that the GMP concentration used in the experiment was saturating. Furthermore, since an increasing concentration of GMP did not inhibit the rate of fluorescence changes, it indicates that GMP does not compete with GTP for binding at the +2 position. The stopped-flow kinetics of GTP binding in the presence of GMP were repeated at increasing [GTP]. The kinetics of the fast phase were very similar to those shown in Fig. 2 B with GTP alone. However, the [GTP] dependence of the second slow phase was different, as shown in Fig. 5 B. In contrast to the [GTP] dependence of the slow phase in the absence of GMP which showed [GTP]2 dependence, the [GTP] dependence of the slow phase in the presence of GMP fit to a hyperbola. The maximum rate constant remained in the same range as in the absence of GMP, but GTP binding was much tighter (K d equal to 106 ± 36 μm). This K d value is in fact closer to the K d of GTP obtained from the [GTP] dependence of the fast phase (78 ± 46 μm). Because GMP appears to replace GTP in the initiating position, we conclude from these experiments that the fast fluorescence change occurs upon binding of the elongating GTP, and the slow phase occurs after both GTPs are bound. From the relationship, average K d of GTP = (K d E·K d I)1/2, we can calculate the K d of the initiating nucleotide. The average K d of GTP is equal to 320 μm, and ifK d E equals 32–124 μm, we calculateK d I as 825–3,200 μm. To understand the origin of the first conformational change that occurs upon binding of the elongating GTP, experiments were carried out with the partially dsDNA promoter modified with 2-AP bases at positions −1 and −4 in the template strand. The partially dsDNA promoter was double stranded from −21 to −5 (Fig. 1), but the initiation and the coding regions were single stranded, thus it mimics an already open promoter. A representative time course of 2-AP fluorescence change upon mixing E·partially dsΦ10 DNA with GTP is shown in Fig. 6 A. GTP binding to E·D resulted in a time-dependent decrease in 2-AP fluorescence in the partially dsDNA promoter. The fluorescence change was, however, slow (Fig. 6 B) relative to the fast phase observed with the fully dsDNA promoter. The exponential rate constant was measured at increasing [GTP], and the [GTP] dependence was found to be the same as the [GTP] dependence of the second slow phase observed with the fully dsDNA promoter, shown in Fig. 3 B. The [GTP] dependence fit to Equation 3 and provided an averageK d of GTP equal to 468 ± 200 μm. Because the first fast phase fluorescence change, which corresponds to the first reversible step, was not observed with the partially dsDNA promoter, either the rates of the reversible step are too fast to measure with the partially dsDNA promoter, or this step is absent in the already open promoter. The GTP binding kinetics (Fig.6 A) at the partially dsDNA promoter also showed a second slow fluorescence change. This change was slow relative to the rate of pppGpG synthesis and may therefore represent fluorescence changes caused by subsequent steps such as poly(G) formation. The efficiency of transcription at a given promoter is determined by a number of factors including protein-DNA interactions during the initial binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the efficiency of initiation and promoter clearance. Whereas the interactions between the polymerase and the promoter DNA have been studied to some extent, very little is known about the kinetic mechanism of initiation and promoter clearance. Using presteady-state kinetics we have shown that T7 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter DNA with diffusion-limited rate constants, and promoter opening is a fast step relative to the rate of RNA synthesis during initiation (1Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The studies also showed that RNA synthesis during transcription initiation was limited by steps between promoter melting and pppGpG synthesis. In the present study, we investigate steps between DNA melting and pppGpG synthesis including initiating and elongating GTP binding and accompanying conformational changes in more detail using stopped-flow kinetics. We have used 2-AP-containing Φ10 promoter DNA to investigate the kinetics of initiating and elongating GTP binding because no intrinsic protein fluorescence change was observed upon GTP binding to theE·D complex. Because GTP binding occurs at a very fast rate, the kinetic experiments were carried out on a stopped-flow instrument. The dA bases in both the template and the primer strands of the Φ10 promoter DNA were substituted with the fluorescent 2-AP base at several positions in the initiation region (−4 to +4). The reason for using multiple substitution was to increase the sensitivity of measurement. It is possible that the 2-AP bases at the various sites on the promoter sense different steps during transcription initiation. However, promoters containing 2-AP in the template strand alone, at positions −2 and −4, provided the same kinetics of fluorescence changes upon GTP binding (data not shown). Studies with singly 2-AP-base substituted promoters is desirable and may even provide more detailed information about the early steps during transcription initiation. However, here we can assume that all of the 2-AP bases report the same steps in the kinetic pathway. Rapid mixing of GTP with the E·D resulted in a time-dependent change in 2-AP fluorescence, whose exponential rate constant was dependent on [GTP]. The analysis of the GTP binding kinetics indicated presence of two conformational changes that accompanied GTP binding (Scheme FS1). A fast reversible step was observed upon one GTP binding, and a slow almost irreversible step occurred after two GTP molecules were bound. The [GTP] dependence and the rates of the second slow fluorescence change were the same as the kinetics of pppGpG synthesis, which were measured by the radiometric rapid quench-flow experiments. This correlation allowed us to assign the second fluorescence change to the chemistry step or more likely a rate-limiting conformational change that occurs before synthesis of pppGpG. We wished to dissect the interactions of the initiating and the elongating GTP molecules with the E·D complex. Because the initiation site on the Φ10 promoter contains the sequence GG, both sites are specific for GTP. The kinetics of GTP binding cannot provide the microscopic interactions of the two sites for GTP. Structural studies of T7 RNA polymerase have suggested two separate NTP binding sites for the initiating and elongating positions (19Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Sousa R. Rose J. Wang B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The elongating NTP site makes close contacts with amino acids from the very COOH-terminal region of the polymerase, whereas the initiating NTP site makes contact with amino acids in the NH2-terminal domain. It has been shown that the 5′-triphosphate of the initiating NTP is not required for transcription initiation by T7 RNA polymerase. Thus GMP and guanosine can serve as the initiating nucleotides (18Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The kinetics of NTP binding to the initiation site can be studied by measuring the stopped-flow kinetics of GMP or guanosine binding. However, we saw no change in 2-AP fluorescence upon GMP binding, indicating that the k on andk off rate constants of GMP binding must be very fast or that GMP binding does not induce any fluorescence changes in the 2-AP-substituted DNA. To dissect the intrinsic binding constants and kinetics of initiating and elongating sites, we measured the stopped-flow kinetics of GTP binding to the elongating site while the initiating site was saturated with GMP. Although the initiating site was saturated with GMP, we observed the same fast and slow fluorescence changes upon GTP binding. This suggested that both fluorescence changes were the result of GTP binding at the elongating site. In the absence of GMP, the slow fluorescence change showed a [GTP]2dependence, because this change occurred after both sites were occupied with GTP. However, when one site was saturated with GMP, the rate changed as a function of [GTP] in a hyperbolic manner, and theK 1/2 provided the K d of GTP binding at the elongating site. From the kinetics of fluorescence changes accompanying GTP binding in the absence and in the presence of GMP, we were able to dissect the affinities of GTP for the initiating and the elongating sites. The minimal mechanism of the early stages of transcription initiation at the Φ10 promoter DNA is shown in SchemeFS1. The elongation site was found to bind GTP with at least a 10-fold higher affinity than the initiation site. The binding of GTPE was accompanied by a reversible conformational change, and a second rate-limiting conformational occurred after both GTPE + GTPI were bound. We cannot assign the observed conformational changes to specific structural changes in the protein and/or the DNA accompanying binding of the GTPs. We know, however, that it is the fluorescence of the 2-AP base in the DNA which changes upon GTP binding. The 2-AP fluorescence is known to increase upon base unstacking, which may accompany open complex formation (21Nordlund T.M. Anderson S. Nilsson L. Rigler R. Graslund A. McLaughlin L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9095-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Guest C.R. Hochstrasser R.A. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P.

A. 1994; 91: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed increases in fluorescence of 2-AP DNA upon GTP binding may either represent a global change in the protein·DNA complex or a specific change in the DNA alone, such as promoter DNA opening. GTP binding studies with partially dsDNA promoter that is already open provided some new insights. Stopped-flow GTP binding experiments with the partially dsDNA promoter showed only the second slow phase. The absence of the reversible conformational change accompanying GTPE binding to the partially dsDNA promoter suggests that this step is either too fast to measure or is absent in the already open promoter. The first reversible step may therefore indeed be DNA melting or a structural change in DNA such as DNA bending or twisting, which leads to the unstacking of bases. Furthermore, stopped-flow experiments with incorrect NTP binding such as ATP binding did not lead to any fluorescence changes (data not shown). This indicates that this first reversible conformational change occurs only upon correct base pairing. The second slow fluorescence change was observed with both the fully dsDNA as well as the partially dsDNA. The kinetics of the fluorescence changes with both DNAs showed the same [GTP]2 dependence, and the maximum rate was same as the rate of pppGpG synthesis. The rate of the second fluorescence change is therefore controlled either by a rate-limiting conformational change or the rate of phosphodiester bond formation reaction. An analogous rate-limiting conformational change has been proposed for a number of DNA polymerases (6Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Hsieh J.-C. Zinnen S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide more direct evidence for a similar conformational change in the RNA polymerase·DNA complex by measuring fluorescence changes in the DNA. Because the second slow conformational change occurs after both the initiating and elongating sites are occupied, its role may be in proper alignment of the two GTPs for efficient bond formation reaction. As postulated with the DNA polymerases (25Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), this conformational change along with the first reversible step may play a role in assuring high fidelity of RNA synthesis. All of the intrinsic equilibrium constants and the rate constants, such as GTP binding and the rates of the conformational changes, are likely to be highly sensitive to the promoter sequence. Thus, comparative studies and measurement of these constants with other T7 promoters will allow us to understand better the mechanism of transcription regulation at the level of these elementary steps."

CO rebinding rates for the mutants were markedly decelerated, while the1H, and 15N NMR spectra of the mutants show that the structural changes around the heme iron for these mutants are rather small. The kinetic and structural properties of the mutants indicate that the ligand binding rate depends on the hydrophobicity inside the heme cavity for these mutants in addition to the volume of the side chain at the 29-position. On the basis of the IR stretching frequency of liganded CO, invasion of water molecules into the heme pocket in the mutants is suggested, which would be induced by the decrease in the hydrophobicity due to the amino acid substitution. A slight red shift of the position of the Soret peak for the serine mutant L29S also supports the reduced hydrophobicity inside the heme cavity. We can concluded that, together with the kinetic properties of the mutants, the hydrophobicity of the heme pocket is one of the key factors in regulating the ligand binding to the heme iron.

The x-ray structure of myoglobin has shown that leucine 29 forms a hydrophobic cluster with other distal hydrophobic residues to restrict the movement of the distal side chains (Fig. 1) (18Phillips S.E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 142: 531-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A simulation study (10Elber R. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9161-9175Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar) has revealed that most CO molecules undergo many collisions with the residues forming walls of the heme pocket including the hydrophobic cluster. The number of collisions of Leu29 was second to that of Val68 in myoglobin (10Elber R. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9161-9175Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which has been also supported by picosecond and nanosecond geminate recombination studies (16Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Elber R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22022-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of a detailed analysis of kinetics, Gibson and co-workers (16Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Elber R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22022-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. Dixon B. Pohajdak B. Sharma P.K. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16993-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the initial movements of ligand after dissociation are toward the back of the distal pocket with the side chain of Leu29 acting as a part of the physical barrier that restricts the ligand movement away from and back toward the heme iron atom.In our previous study (5Adachi S. Sunohara N. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12614-12621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared two mutants that replaced Leu29 with alanine (L29A) or isoleucine (L29I). These substitutions caused a 3–5-fold decrease in the rate constants for CO and O2 association. Based on the remarkable decrease in the association constants, we have concluded that the leucine residue is an important constituent of the hydrophobic cluster for maintaining myoglobin's ligand binding properties. Since the mutation of the amino acids forming other hydrophobic clusters in the distal pocket affects a slight alteration of the ligand binding process (5Adachi S. Sunohara N. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12614-12621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hydrophobicity of the leucine residue seems to be essential for the large alteration of the ligand binding rates. To gain further insights into the functional and structural roles of the hydrophobicity at the position of 29 in the ligand binding dynamics, we prepared some more Leu29 mutants in which the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substituted for leucine is decreased.One of the mutants we have prepared here has a glycine residue at position 29 (L29G). The hydrophobic index of glycine is 0, which is lower than that of leucine (+2.31) (19Fauchère J.L. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar). The other amino acid we substituted for the leucine is serine (L29S). Serine is less hydrophobic due to its hydroxy group (hydrophobic index is −0.05), while its steric hindrance is similar to that of alanine. We also tried to introduce some other hydrophilic amino acid residue such as threonine and asparagine. Unfortunately, however, the mutants having a hydrophilic amino acid residue at the 29-position are highly unstable and fail to keep the heme inside the heme pocket in the cyano-met form. To discriminate effects of the hydrophobicity on the ligand binding from those of the steric difference in the side chain of the substituted amino acid residue, we prepared an additional mutant in which a phenylalanine residue is introduced into position 29 (L29F). The hydrophobicity of phenylalanine (its hydrophobic index is +2.43) is similar to that of leucine, whereas the steric hindrance is quite different (15Carver T.E. Brantley Jr., R.E. Singleton E.W. Arduini R.M. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14443-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we utilized the laser photolysis technique to characterize the ligand binding properties of the mutants. Also, we examined the structural changes around the active site by using1H and 15N NMR, IR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies to elucidate the relationship between ligand binding properties and the hydrophobicity of heme pocket.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12614-12621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared two mutants that replaced Leu29 with alanine (L29A) or isoleucine (L29I). These substitutions caused a 3–5-fold decrease in the rate constants for CO and O2 association. Based on the remarkable decrease in the association constants, we have concluded that the leucine residue is an important constituent of the hydrophobic cluster for maintaining myoglobin's ligand binding properties. Since the mutation of the amino acids forming other hydrophobic clusters in the distal pocket affects a slight alteration of the ligand binding process (5Adachi S. Sunohara N. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12614-12621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hydrophobicity of the leucine residue seems to be essential for the large alteration of the ligand binding rates. To gain further insights into the functional and structural roles of the hydrophobicity at the position of 29 in the ligand binding dynamics, we prepared some more Leu29 mutants in which the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substituted for leucine is decreased. One of the mutants we have prepared here has a glycine residue at position 29 (L29G). The hydrophobic index of glycine is 0, which is lower than that of leucine (+2.31) (19Fauchère J.L. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar). The other amino acid we substituted for the leucine is serine (L29S). Serine is less hydrophobic due to its hydroxy group (hydrophobic index is −0.05), while its steric hindrance is similar to that of alanine. We also tried to introduce some other hydrophilic amino acid residue such as threonine and asparagine. Unfortunately, however, the mutants having a hydrophilic amino acid residue at the 29-position are highly unstable and fail to keep the heme inside the heme pocket in the cyano-met form. To discriminate effects of the hydrophobicity on the ligand binding from those of the steric difference in the side chain of the substituted amino acid residue, we prepared an additional mutant in which a phenylalanine residue is introduced into position 29 (L29F). The hydrophobicity of phenylalanine (its hydrophobic index is +2.43) is similar to that of leucine, whereas the steric hindrance is quite different (15Carver T.E. Brantley Jr., R.E. Singleton E.W. Arduini R.M. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14443-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized the laser photolysis technique to characterize the ligand binding properties of the mutants. Also, we examined the structural changes around the active site by using1H and 15N NMR, IR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies to elucidate the relationship between ligand binding properties and the hydrophobicity of heme pocket. We are grateful to Prof. S. G. Boxer and Dr. R. Varadarajan (Stanford University) for a gift of expression vector of human myoglobin gene. We are obliged to Dr. M. Unno (Tohoku University) for fruitful discussions."

This carbachol effect involves (i) activation of brush border phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity and brush border but not basolateral membrane translocation of PLC-γ1 (Khurana, S., Kreydiyyeh, S., Aronzon, A., Hoogerwerf, W. A., Rhee, S. G., Donowitz, M., and Cohen, M. E. (1996) Biochem. J. 313, 509–518); and (ii) brush border tyrosine kinase(s) because mucosal but not serosal addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein prevents the carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl absorption and brush border Na+/H+ exchange. In the present work we identify a pool of villin (a brush border actin-binding protein) in the microvillus membrane fraction of rabbit ileum; this pool of villin is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with brush border membrane PLC-γ1. Villin is present both in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions of the brush border. The Triton X-100-soluble pool is approximately 4-fold smaller than the brush border pool of villin that is present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Only the villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of ileal villus brush border associates with PLC-γ1 and is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Carbachol increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin rapidly (as early as 30 s) and transiently. Carbachol also increases the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated villin that associates with PLC-γ1. These studies demonstrate that carbachol effects on NaCl absorption are accompanied by an increase in brush border PLC-γ1 association with villin and an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of villin. To study the role of cytoskeletal rearrangement in carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl absorption, we used the F-actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide. Jasplakinolide prevents the carbachol inhibition of ileal NaCl absorption. This suggests that F-actin severing is necessary for carbachol to inhibit ileal villus NaCl absorption. Since villin is known to sever actin, these studies suggest a role for villin in the signaling cascade that begins at the basolateral membrane with carbachol binding to its receptor and ends at the apical membrane in inhibition of NaCl absorption. In ileal absorptive cells, carbachol inhibits NaCl absorption and its component brush border Na+/H+ exchanger, acting via basolateral membrane receptors. This carbachol effect involves (i) activation of brush border phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity and brush border but not basolateral membrane translocation of PLC-γ1 (Khurana, S., Kreydiyyeh, S., Aronzon, A., Hoogerwerf, W.

Since villin is known to sever actin, these studies suggest a role for villin in the signaling cascade that begins at the basolateral membrane with carbachol binding to its receptor and ends at the apical membrane in inhibition of NaCl absorption. We have previously shown that the muscarinic-cholinergic agonist carbachol acts on rabbit ileal villus absorptive cells to inhibit NaCl absorption and brush border Na+/H+ exchange (1Cohen M.E.

In addition a BB membrane tyrosine phosphorylation event is essential for this inhibition of BB Na+/H+ exchange and for the activation of BB PLC-γ1 (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A.

The nature of the tyrosine kinase involved and the substrates tyrosine-phosphorylated in the carbachol effects are not known. The ileal brush border Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3, has not been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, and although BB PLC-γ1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, carbachol does not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (2Khurana S.

In the present study we describe another carbachol-induced BB tyrosine phosphorylation event that occurs in the BB but not the basolateral membrane. We demonstrate that BB PLC-γ1 associates with villin, an actin-binding BB-specific cytoskeletal protein. Carbachol increases the association of BB villin with PLC-γ1 and increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin. Our study also provides evidence that cytoskeletal remodelling is involved in the regulation of intestinal Na+ absorption. This is the first report demonstrating the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin; it is also the first report demonstrating the association of villin with PLC-γ1. Sodium orthovanadate, β-glycerophosphate, phenylalanine, phosphorhamidone, aprotinin, leupeptin, carbachol, Triton X-100, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma; pansorbin was from Calbiochem; sodium deoxycholate was from Fisher; anti-PLC-γ1 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog number 05-163); polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Zymed (catalog number 61-5800); general anti-actin monoclonal antibody was from Boehringer Mannheim (catalog number 1378-996); jasplakinolide was a kind gift from Dr. Philip Crews (University of California, Santa Cruz); prestained protein molecular mass standards were from Bio-Rad (high molecular mass range); and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from DuPont. Distal ileum from New Zealand White male rabbits (2–2.5 kg) was used for all experiments. Rabbits were sacrificed by intravenous nembutal overdose. Ileum was then removed, rinsed with 0.9% saline, opened along the mesenteric border, and exposed in vitro to control or carbachol (1 μm). The tissue was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2, in Ringer's/HCO3 containing 10 mm glucose and 1 μm indomethacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Carbachol was then added to one set of tissues, and the incubation was continued for 30 s or 1 min. The tissues were then chilled, and control and carbachol-treated samples were processed in parallel. At the end of the above incubation, ileal sheets were chilled on iced Petri dishes, and mucosa was lightly scraped off with glass slides. BB were prepared by differential centrifugation and double Mg2+ precipitation as described previously (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The final BB pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mmsorbitol and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, with five strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The methods used to measure active ileal electrolyte transport have been described previously (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem.

In brief, ileal mucosa with muscularis propria removed was mounted as a flat sheet between two Lucite modified Ussing chambers having an aperture of 1.13 cm2, oxygenated, and maintained at 37 °C. Transmural potential difference, short-circuit current (Isc), conductance, and unidirectional fluxes of22Na+ and 36Cl− were determined. An automatic voltage clamp corrected for fluid resistance between the potential difference-sensing bridges and provided continuous short-circuiting of the tissue. Unidirectional fluxes of Na+ and/or Cl− were measured 20–100 min after addition of isotope by using 22Na and 36Cl on tissue matched to differ in conductance by not more than 25%. Usually eight pieces of ileum from a single animal were studied simultaneously. Unless specified, the bathing solution consisted of Ringer's/HCO3 composed (in mm) of 115 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2; the pH was 7.4 after gassing with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Glucose (10 mm) was added to the serosal and 10 mm mannitol to the mucosal bathing fluids at the time of mounting the tissue. The effect of carbachol (0.3 μm) added to the serosal surface was determined over two 20-min flux periods in solvent control treated (0.02% Me2SO) ileum or tissue exposed to jasplakinolide (5 μm) added to the ileal mucosal surface for 40 min before carbachol addition. BB (250 or 100 μg of protein) were extracted with a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 4 °C. PLC-γ1 or villin were immunoprecipitated from the soluble extracts as described (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) by using monoclonal antibodies to either PLC-γ1 or villin. To determine the presence of PLC-γ1 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, the pellet from the extract above was dissolved in RIPA buffer (containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4) and PLC-γ1-immunoprecipitated. Rat brain extract was used as a standard for PLC-γ1 and prepared as described (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Measurement of Western blots was by scanning densitometry (Metamorph software, Universal Imaging Corp.) with enhanced chemiluminescence under conditions in which the signal was not saturated. Several BB proteins have increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to carbachol. Those have not been identified but do not include NHE3 or PLC-γ1. Consequently we tested the hypothesis that an intermediate tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associates with PLC-γ1. Rabbit ileal mucosa was treated in vitro with carbachol (1 μm) for 1 min, a time when PLC activity is maximally stimulated in the BB, or for 30 s, an earlier time point when PLC activity is 20% higher than control (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BB from control and carbachol-treated ileum were solubilized, and PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated from both the Triton X-100-soluble and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, all the PLC-γ1 both under control conditions and in carbachol-treated ileum were present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the BB, representing the membrane pool. No PLC-γ1 was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble pool. Carbachol increased the amount of PLC-γ1 in the BB by 20% (p < 0.05, n = 5) at 30 s (Fig. 1 A). Carbachol increased the BB PLC-γ12-fold at 1 min, as reported earlier and as shown in Fig. 1 B(2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the entire pool of PLC-γ1 present in the ileal villus BB is associated with the membrane and not with the BB cytoskeleton. To look for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associating with PLC-γ1, BB were made from control and carbachol-treated ileum (1 μm, 30 s or 1 min). PLC-γ1was immunoprecipitated from both control and carbachol-exposed BB. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western analysis was done using an anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody. A 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with PLC-γ1(Fig. 2). Although this protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated under basal conditions, a 30-s exposure to carbachol caused a significant increase (2-fold, p < 0.01, n = 8) in the tyrosine phosphorylation of this 95-kDa protein. At 30 s, the amount of PLC-γ1present in the carbachol-treated BB is 20% higher than control BB (Fig. 1 A), and the BB PIP2-specific PLC activity is 20% higher than control BB, as reported earlier (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This suggests that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of this 95-kDa protein cannot be explained by increase in amount of BB PLC-γ1alone. At 1 min of carbachol exposure, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of this 95-kDa protein is similar in control and carbachol-exposed tissue (Fig. 2). At this point there is at least 2-fold more PLC-γ1 present in the carbachol-treated BB (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of this 95-kDa protein is very transient. The 95-kDa protein was examined with antibodies to several known signaling molecules of the same size including Vav and the BB cytoskeletal protein villin. PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated and Western analysis done with anti-vav and anti-villin antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitations determined that the 95-kDa proteins were not Vav. In contrast, the cytoskeletal protein villin co-immunoprecipitated with PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3). Equal amounts of BB proteins (250 μg) from control and carbachol-treated tissue (1 μm, 1 min) were solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PLC-γ1, villin, and phosphotyrosine. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal antibodies to villin. As seen in Fig. 3, all three antibodies immunoprecipitated a 95-kDa protein, identified with the monoclonal antibody to villin. This is the first demonstration of the presence of a BB pool of villin in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and thus not associated with the cytoskeleton. The amount of villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble pool which associates with PLC-γ1 is smaller than the total amount of villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the BB. As illustrated in Fig. 3 approximately one-third of the villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble pool of the BB associates with PLC-γ1. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of villin is associated with an increase in the amount of villin that associates with PLC-γ1. At 30 s there is 2-fold more villin associated with PLC-γ1 (p < 0.05,n = 4) (Fig. 4). This suggests that at 30 s more tyrosine-phosphorylated villin associates with PLC-γ1. To determine if the entire pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction associates with PLC-γ1, the following experiment was performed. PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated from the BB Triton X-100-soluble pool, and after removing the immunoprecipitated PLC-γ1, the remaining Triton X-100-soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western analysis done using anti-villin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, the fraction of the Triton X-100-soluble pool that does not associate with PLC-γ1 does not contain tyrosine-phosphorylated villin. These data suggest that the mechanism for interaction between villin and PLC-γ1 may be mediated through the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin.Figure 4Carbachol increases the amount of villin that associates with PLC-γ1. 100 μg of BB from control (−) and carbachol-treated (+) (1 μm, 30 s) ileum were solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and immunoprecipitations (Ipt) were done with monoclonal antibodies to PLC-γ1. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and Western analysis (Blot) done with anti-villin antibodies.

This experiment is representative of three with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BB from control and carbachol-treated ileum (1 μm, 1 min) were solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The Triton X-100-soluble fraction immunoprecipitated with PLC-γ1 and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the BB were separated on 7% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western analysis was done using antibodies to villin. As seen in Fig.6 A, there is approximately 5-fold more villin present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction compared with the villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction associated with PLC-γ1. The Triton X-100-insoluble pool of villin does not associate with PLC-γ1, since there is no PLC-γ1 in this detergent-insoluble fraction. The Western blot shown in Fig. 6 A was stripped and reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 B only the villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and the villin immunoprecipitated with PLC-γ1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Even though there is significantly more villin in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated. These data show that the pool of villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and immunoprecipitated with PLC-γ1 is much smaller than the villin pool present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and that only the villin that is associated with PLC-γ1 is a substrate for tyrosine kinases. To determine the relative amounts of villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble pools, 100 μg of BB was solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton (as described under “Methods”). The Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble pools were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was done using anti-villin monoclonal antibodies. As seen in Fig. 7, there is 4-fold more villin present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction as compared with the villin present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (p < 0.05, n = 3). The latter includes both the villin that associates with PLC-γ1 (as shown in Fig. 6 A) and the pool that does not associate with PLC-γ1. Villin belongs to a family of Ca2+-regulated actin-binding proteins that nucleate, cap, or sever actin filaments (3Glenney Jr., J.R. Kaulfus P. Weber K. Cell. 1981; 24: 471-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). At high Ca2+concentrations villin severs actin filaments. Villin has also been shown to associate with polyphosphoinositides, especially PIP2 (also the substrate for PLC-γ1) (5Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro studies have also suggested that the major effect of PIP2 on villin is to inhibit its ability to sever actin filaments (6Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since carbachol causes the activation of BB PLC-γ1, we hypothesized that this would lead to a localized decrease in the amount of PIP2 and an increase in Ca2+ close to the BB. Both these signaling events would lead to an activation of the actin severing property of villin, which then might regulate the inhibition of NHE3. Our hypothesis then suggests that if the actin filaments are stabilized and cannot be severed by villin, carbachol would not be able to inhibit ileal NaCl absorption. To test this hypothesis, the F-actin stabilizer jasplakinolide was used (7Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide stabilizes F-actin similar to phalloidin but is more membrane-permeant (8Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Hrnjez B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C254-C262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ileum was treated with jasplakinolide added to the mucosal surface for 40 min prior to the addition of carbachol. As seen in Fig. 8, serosal addition of carbachol (0.3 μm) inhibited ileal NaCl absorption as reported earlier (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G.

J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that carbachol inhibits neutral NaCl absorption and BB Na+/H+exchange, the latter as early as 5 min, with the effect persisting at least 40 min following carbachol exposure (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A.

For studies measuring neutral NaCl absorption in intact tissue, 22Na and36Cl fluxes were measured at steady state (20 min following carbachol exposure). Starting 20 min after carbachol addition, two 20-min flux studies were performed, a time during which ileal Isc was constant and slightly increased compared with that during two 20-min basal flux periods in the same tissue before the addition of carbachol. Serosal addition of carbachol caused a statistically significant decrease in mucosal-to-serosal and net Na+ and Cl− fluxes (Fig. 8). In ion flux experiments, a negative sign indicates net secretion and a positive sign indicates net absorption (J net represents the difference between unidirectional fluxes and represents active transport). There was no significant change in the serosal-to-mucosal Na+ fluxes, but there was a significant increase in the serosal-to-mucosal Cl− fluxes. These data show, as reported earlier, that carbachol decreases ileal active Na+and Cl− absorption and increases Cl−secretion. The effects of jasplakinolide on the transport effects caused by serosal carbachol were determined (Fig. 8). The addition of mucosal jasplakinolide prevented the carbachol effects to decrease mucosal-to-serosal and net Na+ and Cl− fluxes. Thus in the presence of jasplakinolide, carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl absorption (as indicated by decreased mucosal-to-serosal and net NaCl absorption (J net)) is prevented. However, the carbachol-induced increase in serosal-to-mucosal Cl−flux was not significantly inhibited. These data show that in ileum pretreated with jasplakinolide the carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl absorption does not occur, although Cl− secretion is not prevented. Jasplakinolide added to the ileal mucosal surface (5 μm) did not alter basal active electrolyte transport (Fig.9). Also, thed-glucose-stimulated increase in Na+ absorption (Na+-glucose cotransport) was not altered by jasplakinolide (3.0 ± 0.5 versus 2.9 ± 0.5 μeq/cm2 h in control and jasplakinolide-treated tissue, respectively, n = 6; not significant). We previously reported that carbachol-initiated signal transduction that inhibits NaCl absorption in intestinal epithelial cells is highly asymmetrical. Carbachol acts on intestinal epithelial cells via basolateral membrane receptors and is linked to inhibition of NaCl absorption and of brush border Na+/H+exchange, which is part of this Na+ absorptive process (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previously recognized steps in carbachol-initiated signal transduction at the ileal brush border include translocation of protein kinase C to the BB along with an increase in brush border diacylglycerol content by 1 min after carbachol exposure, an effect which is prolonged (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the rapid translocation of PLC-γ1 to the brush border with an increase in PIP2-specific PLC activity, a short-lived effect (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The asymmetrical aspect of signal transduction previously recognized was that there was no increase in basolateral membrane protein kinase C activity or amount or PLC-γ1activity or amount after carbachol treatment (1Cohen M.E. Wesolek J.E. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence of another asymmetric aspect of signal transduction, since carbachol tyrosine phosphorylates villin, a protein specifically present in the BB and absent from the basolateral membrane. We previously demonstrated that BB PLC-γ1 was activated in response to carbachol by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism; however, there was no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 itself in response to carbachol (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This tyrosine kinase effect was necessary for the carbachol-induced increase in BB PLC-γ1 amount, the increase in BB PIP2-specific PLC activity, and for the inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger by carbachol (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We speculated that PLC-γ1 could be recruited to the BB by associating with a BB-anchored tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (2Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We now show that carbachol increases tyrosine phosphorylation of a BB pool of villin, and this pool of villin associates with PLC-γ1. This is the first observation of villin associating with PLC-γ1 and is also the first report of villin being tyrosine-phosphorylated. The entire PLC-γ1 that translocates to the BB following carbachol exposure is present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, representing the membrane-associated fraction. Thus we determined if there was a pool of villin in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the BB. Until now, villin was considered only to be a structural protein present in the cytoskeletal core of the BB and to be involved in the morphogenesis of the BB. However, knock-out studies of villin called the latter into question since the small intestine was structurally normal in these mice (9Jaiser F. Cohen-Tanoudji M. Antony C. Pehau G. Ferrar E. Ouelbani L. El Marjou F. Costa de Beauregard M.A. Robine S. Babinet F. Louvard D. Anagnostopoulos T. 29th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Nephrology. 1996; (Abstr. A0323): 1310Google Scholar). These results suggest that BB villin may have other functions. We showed that villin is present in three pools in the BB. The great majority is present in the BB cytoskeleton, but there are in addition two smaller pools of villin in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the BB, which are separated as being associated with PLC-γ1 or not associated with PLC-γ1. The three BB pools are also separated based on tyrosine phosphorylation of villin, with only the PLC-γ1-associated pool being tyrosine-phosphorylated. Even though 4-fold more villin is present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated. This suggests that part of the pool of villin associated with the membrane is a substrate for BB tyrosine kinases, whereas the villin associated with the cytoskeleton and the villin in the soluble fraction not associated with PLC-γ1 are not. The rapid and transient nature of the carbachol-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of villin associated with PLC-γ1 suggests it is involved in early aspects of signaling. We speculate below how villin tyrosine phosphorylation might activate PLC-γ1 and vice versa how activation of PLC-γ1 could affect villin. Carbachol causes a significant (2-fold p < 0.05,n = 4) increase in the amount of villin that associates with PLC-γ1 (Fig. 4), and there is a 2-fold increase in the amount of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this pool of villin (Fig.2). This suggests that while carbachol causes no net increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of individual villin molecules associated with PLC-γ1, the number of villin molecules tyrosine-phosphorylated, present in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, and associated with PLC-γ1 is increased by carbachol. This also suggests that the increase in the tyrosine-phosphorylated villin molecules leads to their association with PLC-γ1, since there is no tyrosine-phosphorylated villin present in the BB other than what associates with PLC-γ1. What accounts for the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated villin and PLC-γ1 is not known. One possibility is that this might be mediated through the SH2 group of PLC-γ1. In fact sequence analysis demonstrates that villin contains the (p)Y-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic motif ((p)YVGV, amino acids 206–209) known to bind the NH2 terminus SH2 group of PLC-γ1. Relevant to our observation is a study by Itohet al. (10Itoh T. Miura K. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrating the association of another cytoskeletal protein, β-tubulin with the SH2 domain of several signaling molecules including Ash/Grb2, the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PLC-γ1. These observations then suggest that cytoskeletal proteins may play a role in the assembly and disassembly of signaling molecules containing SH2 domains and thus participate in a signaling cascade involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement. Villin belongs to a family of Ca2+-regulated actin-binding proteins that nucleate, cap, or sever actin filaments. Unlike other proteins of this family, at low Ca2+ concentrations villin induces the formation of tightly packed microfilament bundles (11Bretscher A. Weber K. Cell. 1980; 20: 839-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). At calcium concentrations above 5 μm in vitro, villin severs actin filaments. Villin has been shown to associate with polyphosphoinositides, especially PIP2. In vitrostudies have demonstrated that the major effect of PIP2 on villin is to inhibit its ability to sever actin filaments (6Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differential activation of severing and nucleating activities in response to changes in the concentration of Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides, which are often immediate consequences of cell stimulation, could place villin directly in the pathway between receptor activation and cytoskeletal remodeling. We have shown that the pool of villin that is intimately associated with the microvillus membrane undergoes changes in tyrosine phosphorylation as part of a signaling process that begins at the basolateral membrane and terminates in the microvillus membrane. In this instance basolateral carbachol initiates a signaling cascade that leads to changes in the BB including the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin and its association with PLC-γ1. The activation of PLC-γ1decreases the amount of PIP2, and this would be expected to remove the inhibitory effect of PIP2 on the actin severing property of villin, thus allowing villin to sever actin filaments. PLC-γ1 activation also generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which increases intracellular free calcium levels, and would also activate the actin severing property of villin. We hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of villin may inhibit its actin bundling property, although this remains to be demonstrated. In several other actin-bundling proteins, such as dematin and band 4.9, phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit their actin bundling property (12Husain-Chishti A. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Bahler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1987; 326: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The consequence of all these carbachol-induced signaling events described above would be to inhibit the actin bundling and promote the actin severing property of villin, which would disrupt the structure of the microvillus cytoskeleton or increase the amount of short F-actin filaments. To begin addressing the functional significance of this process in intestinal cells, we used the F-actin stabilizer jasplakinolide.In vitro and in vivo, jasplakinolide has been shown to stabilize actin filaments and displace phalloidin from F-actin (7Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is more plasma membrane-permeable than phalloidin (8Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Hrnjez B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C254-C262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and actin filaments may be more stable with jasplakinolide than phalloidin under high Ca2+ concentrations (7Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl was not seen in ileum that had been pretreated with jasplakinolide. Our interpretation of this result is that filaments stabilized by jasplakinolide are more resistant to Ca2+-dependent cleavage by villin, and this could explain the reversal of carbachol-induced inhibition of NaCl absorption by jasplakinolide. In recent years there has been increasing evidence of the association of ion transport proteins with actin-binding proteins (14Morrow J.S. Cianci C.D. Aidito T. Mann A.S. Kashgaridan M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the involvement of cytoskeletal remodelling in the regulation of vectorial transport (16Wang W.-H. Cassola A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F592-F598PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C882-C888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently a study by Berdiev et al. (18Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrated the stimulatory effects of short F-actin filaments on the rat epithelial sodium channel in planar lipid bilayers. Although this direct effect of short F-actin filaments on channels may be one mechanism of regulating transport proteins, we suggest another possible mechanism involving a remodelling of the microvillar core and possibly endocytosis of NHE3. Our studies do not establish a role for villin in mediating carbachol inhibition of NaCl absorption. However, the temporal and anatomic similarity of carbachol-induced changes in ileal NaCl absorption and changes in villin tyrosine phosphorylation suggest that the two could be linked. How could the actin severing property of villin inhibit NHE3? We previously showed that nearly all described protein kinase regulation of NHE3 is by changes in V max (19Levine S. Montrose M. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and we recently showed that protein kinase C inhibits NHE3 in the BB of a polarized intestinal cell line, Caco-2, by decreasing the number of transporters in the plasma membrane (20Janecki A. Khurana S. Montrose M. Zimniak P. Donowitz M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A2971Google Scholar). We suggest that inhibition of ileal villus NaCl absorption by carbachol may be due to a decrease in the amount of NHE3 present in the microvillus membrane. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that carbachol induces an increase in the actin severing property of BB villin resulting in the disassembly of the microvillar cytoskeleton, which could lead to one of the following. First, disruption of NHE3 recycling. It is generally assumed that targeting of membrane proteins to the lysosomes from the apical surface is minimal in differentiated enterocytes in the adult intestine and that the bulk of the proteins get recycled between the plasma membrane surface and intracellular recycling pool (21Klumperman J. Boekestjin J.C. Mulder A.M. Fransen J.A.M. Ginsel L.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 76-84PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of the microvillar cytoskeleton could disrupt the process of recycling, thus decreasing the amount of NHE3 remaining in the apical membrane in the presence of carbachol. Whether the removal of NHE3 from the membrane (endocytosis) or insertion into the membrane (exocytosis) in this process of recycling is affected is unknown. This is a reasonable hypothesis since it is becoming increasingly evident that several transporters are regulated by exocytic insertion or endocytic retrieval from the cell surface (22Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 23Holmgren K. Magnusson K.-E. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C672-C677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hirst B.H. Forte J.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, the disassembly of the cytoskeleton could cause the microvilli to fragment into vesicles (25Tanford C. The Hydrophofic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1973Google Scholar), which would decrease the microvillar length or surface area. This could decrease the number of NHE3 molecules present at the microvillar surface, thus decreasing NaCl absorption. Incubating isolated BB in solutions containing high Ca2+ causes such BB vesiculation (26Matsudaira P.T. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Mooseker M.S. Graves T.A. Wharton K.A. Falcon N. Howe C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); similarly, parathyroid hormone or ionomycin cause a rapid (1 min) and dramatic shortening of renal microvilli (28Goligorsky M.S. Menton D.N. Hruska K.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phalloidin inhibits this vesiculation (29Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 449-463PubMed Google Scholar, 30Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. Graves T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These observations then suggest a simple mechanism for vesiculation, by stimulation of the actin severing property of villin. This may be a general mechanism for ileal villus cells to rid the cell of pathological agents including enteropathogens, reduce metabolic demands on the cell, and account for the high membrane turnover rate in normal cells. Our data suggest that structural rearrangements serve as a prerequisite for functional adaptation of transport processes. Agonist-induced morphologic changes are consistent with, and may represent a particular case of, the currently developing concept of transepithelial “cross-talk” between basolateral and luminal membranes.

We have exploited insights into the activation mechanism of STAT factors to derive constitutively active variants. Chimeric genes encoding fusion proteins of STAT5 and the kinase domain of JAK2 have been derived. The functional properties of the fusion proteins have been investigated in transiently transfected COS cells or in HeLa cells stably transfected with STAT5-JAK2 gene constructs regulated by a tetracycline-sensitive promoter. The STAT5-JAK2 proteins exhibit tyrosine kinase activity and are phosphorylated on tyrosine. The molecules are activated through an intramolecular or a cross-phosphorylation reaction and exhibit constitutive, STAT5-specific DNA binding activity. The transactivation potentials of three constitutively activated STAT5-JAK2 variants comprising different transactivation domains (TADs) derived from STAT5, STAT6, and VP16 were compared. The chimeric molecule containing the STAT5 TAD had no or only a very low, the molecule with the STAT6 TAD a medium, and the molecule with the VP16 TAD a very high transactivation potential. Transcription from STAT5-responsive gene promoter regions of the β-casein, oncostatin M, and the cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein genes was observed. These chimeric STAT molecules allow the study of the function of STAT5 independent of cytokine receptors and the activation of other signal transduction pathways.

These chimeric STAT molecules allow the study of the function of STAT5 independent of cytokine receptors and the activation of other signal transduction pathways. Growth factor receptors and cytokine receptors share functional features in their regulation of cell survival, control of proliferation, and differentiation. Although structurally distinct, they commonly utilize molecular components in signal transduction events (1Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Both families of receptors are dimerized by the binding of extracellular ligands, which cause the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinase activities are intrinsic to the intracellular domains of growth factor receptors and non-covalently associated with intracellular regions of cytokine receptors. Phosphorylation of these regions of the receptors is thought to generate binding sites for cytoplasmic signaling components with SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2 domain; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IL, interleukin; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; OSM, oncostatin M; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein; TAD, transactivation domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; tTA, tetracycline-controlled transactivator; MGF, mammary gland factor; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2 domain; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IL, interleukin; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; OSM, oncostatin M; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein; TAD, transactivation domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; tTA, tetracycline-controlled transactivator; MGF, mammary gland factor; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase. domains. These molecules become substrates for the tyrosine kinases, and phosphorylation causes a switch from a latent into an active form. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway via the adaptor protein Grb2, the Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos, the accumulation of active Ras-GTP, and the recruitment of active c-Raf to the membrane has been observed upon growth factor receptor treatment of cells (e.g. with EGF or platelet-derived growth factor) or cytokine treatment of cells (e.g. with IL-2 or prolactin) expressing the corresponding receptors. The same is true for other signaling components like phosphoinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, Src kinase family members, SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatases, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors (3Boonstra J.

The simultaneous activation of different signal transduction pathways by a single signal (growth factor or cytokine) and its corresponding receptor, makes it difficult to assign a particular contribution of an individual signaling component or pathway to the ultimate effect on the cells. To dissect the contributions of individual signal transduction components to the cellular phenotypes induced by growth factors and cytokines, several strategies have been employed. These strategies aim at the prevention of activation of one particular signaling molecule, while preserving all the others. For this purpose, homologous recombination has been used to inactivate the genes encoding signaling components and knock-out mice have been analyzed (e.g.Ref.7); the tyrosine residues within the docking sites of SH2-containing signaling molecules in the intracellular domain of receptors have been mutated (e.g. Ref. 8Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and dominant negative variants of signaling molecules have been derived (9Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jähne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). STAT5 was originally discovered as a transcription factor, which mediates the prolactin response in mammary epithelial cells. It is essential for the transcriptional induction of milk protein genes (10Groner B. Gouilleux F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Schmitt-Ney M.

Meanwhile, it has been found that MGF-Stat5 is also activated by other hormones and cytokines, e.g. IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 (13Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R.

STAT5 has been implicated in the regulation of genes that are important for the prevention of apoptosis and proliferation in hematopoietic cells (19Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We have devised a strategy to gain insights into the contribution of the STAT5 transcription factor to cellular phenotypes. This will allow study of its function independent from upstream activation events. For this purpose, we have derived constitutively active variants of STAT5, which are able to induce transcription from STAT5-dependent gene promoters. To construct the chimeric genes, the region comprising amino acids 613–794 of STAT5 was amplified by a PCR reaction. An EcoRI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the fragment. The region comprising amino acids 757–1129 of the JAK2 gene was amplified by PCR, and an EcoRI site was introduced at the 5′ end. Both fragments were joined in a tri-fragment ligation into pBluescriptSK+. A KpnI-NotI fragment of pXM-MGF(STAT5) (12Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), comprising amino acids 613–794, was then replaced by the STAT5JAK2 fusion fragment. STAT5Δ750JAK2 was cloned in an analogous way. The EcoRI site was introduced 3′ of amino acid position 750. To obtain STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2, the region comprising amino acids 411–489 of VP16 gene was amplified by PCR.EcoRI sites were added to both ends. The EcoRI fragment was inserted between the STAT5 and the JAK2 parts. The region comprising amino acid positions 677–847 of the STAT6 gene was also amplified by PCR and inserted as an EcoRI fragment as described above. To obtain the tetracycline-regulated plasmid p10/3 STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2, STAT5Δ750JAK2 was subcloned as a blunt-endedSalI-NotI fragment into the blunt-endedNotI site of pBluescript SK+. The fusion gene was then inserted as a SacII-XbaI fragment into p10/3 (20Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar), in which transcription is regulated by a tetracycline-controlled transactivator, tTA. p10/3 STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 was cloned analogously. COS-7 cells were grown and prepared for transfection as described before (21Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Semiconfluent COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of the expression plasmid encoding STAT5 or the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins. After 48 h, the cells were lysed. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with a JAK2-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany). The immunocomplexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The filters were developed with an antibody specific for JAK2, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using an epi-chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). HeLa cells stably expressing the transactivator tTA1 (20Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) were transfected with the plasmids pBSpacΔp encoding a puromycin resistance gene and p10/3 STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 or p10/3 STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2. Cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and puromycin (1.25 μg/ ml), and stably transfected cell clones were selected. The expression of the fusion proteins in puromycin-resistant clones was induced by the withdrawal of tetracycline for 48 h and measured by Western blotting and bandshift assays. The immunocomplexes from transfected COS cells were used for in vitro kinase reactions. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10 μm ATP) in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at room temperature. The in vitro phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells transfected with the expression vectors encoding the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins, and bandshift assays were performed as described (22Wakao H. Schmitt-Ney M. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16365-16370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MGF-STAT5 binding site of the bovine β-casein promoter was used as a probe (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATC-3′). This oligonucleotide was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 8000 cpm/fmol. For competition experiments, unlabeled or mutant (5′-AGATTTCTATTAATTCAATC-3′) oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction. HeLa cells transfected with p10/3 STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 were withdrawn from tetracycline for 48 h, treated or not with 30 ng/ml EGF for 5 min, and lysed in ERK lysis buffer (50 mm β-sodium-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.5, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with an ERK2-specific antibody (Santa Cruz). The immunocomplexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with ERK lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2). The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in kinase buffer in the presence of 10 μm ATP, 0.1 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 15 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate. The in vitro phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. COS cells were transfected with the expression vectors encoding the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins; 2 μg of the β-casein luciferase reporter construct and 2 μg of pHM75 encoding the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter to normalize for transfection efficiency were included. HeLa cells were transfected with the reporter genes only. Luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (21Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We exploited insights into the structure and the activation mechanism of STAT proteins to derive constitutively active variants. STAT proteins are able to bind to phosphotyrosine-containing docking sites in the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors, where they are phosphorylated by receptor-associated JAKs. It is thought that STAT phosphorylation results in the dissociation from the receptor, the formation of homodimers, translocation to the nucleus, binding to specific DNA response elements in the promoter of target genes, and activation of transcription (23Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 24Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 25Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). JAK2, a kinase associated with the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular part of, e.g. the prolactin receptor, has been shown to be able to phosphorylate STAT5 in vitro andin vivo (21Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). JAK2 is structurally well defined (Fig.1). It comprises 1129 amino acids and consists of a carboxyl-terminal catalytic tyrosine kinase domain (domain 1), a kinase-like domain (domain 2), and an amino-terminal sequence with common subdomains of the JAK gene family (26Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.A. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

It has been shown that the kinase domain of JAK2 is sufficient for signal transduction when fused to the extracellular and transmembrane region of the EGF or growth hormone receptors (28Frank S.J.

The structures of MGF-STAT5, the sheep homologue, and of STAT5a and STAT5b, the mouse homologues (30Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), have also been investigated (Fig.1). It has been found that the activation of MGF-STAT5 requires the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 694 by JAK2 (21Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and that the 50 carboxyl-terminal amino acids comprise the transactivation domain of the molecule (9Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jähne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To derive constitutively activated STAT5 variants, we constructed fusion proteins consisting of MGF-STAT5 (794 amino acids) and the tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2 (373 amino acids, position 757–1129). We fused the kinase domain of JAK2 to the carboxyl terminus of MGF-STAT5 (STAT5JAK2) (Fig. 1). Since we have previously observed that the transactivation domain of MGF-STAT5 is relatively weak, we also derived constructs in which the STAT5 transactivation domain has been replaced by the transactivation domain of STAT6 (STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2) or by VP16 (STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2). Constructs that lack a transactivation domain (STAT5Δ750JAK2) or that comprise an enzymatically inactive kinase domain (STAT5JAK2KIN−) served as controls. The constructs were integrated in vectors (pXM) that allow constitutive expression in transiently transfected COS cells or in vectors (p10/3) that provide for conditional regulation by a tetracycline-dependent transactivator. To investigate the expression and the enzymatic properties of these fusion proteins, the chimeric constructs were integrated into the eukaryotic expression vector pXM and transfected into COS-7 cells. Cell lysates were prepared, and the fusion proteins were precipitated with a JAK2-specific antiserum and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.2 A). Proteins of the expected sizes (JAK2 of 124 kDa, lane 2; STAT5JAK2 of 128 kDa,lane 3; STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 of 132 kDa, lane 4; STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 of 142 kDa, lane 5; STAT5Δ750JAK2 of 123 kDa, lane 6) were found. To test the kinase activities of these fusion proteins, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. The immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 2 B). Phosphorylation of all constructs was detected, indicating that the JAK2 domain integrated into the fusion proteins is enzymatically active and can catalyze auto- or cross-phosphorylation. The expression levels and enzyme activity detected in the in vitro kinase assays are not strictly proportional. We also investigated the DNA binding properties of the STAT-JAK fusion proteins expressed in the transfected COS cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared and were analyzed in bandshift experiments (Fig. 3 A). The high affinity binding site from the β-casein gene promoter served as a probe. Only a fast migrating, nonspecific DNA protein complex was observed in untransfected COS cells (lane 1). Transfection with STAT5JAK2 (lanes 2–7) resulted in the appearance of two specific complexes (lane 2). The slower migrating one corresponds to the STAT5JAK2-DNA complex. It can be supershifted with an antibody specific for JAK2 (lane 3) or an antibody specific for STAT5 (lane 4). The second specific band observed corresponds to a complex between the DNA probe and the endogenous STAT1, activated by the transfected JAK2 fusion molecule. It can be supershifted with an antibody directed against the NH2 terminus of STAT1 (lane 5). Cotransfection of Stat5JAK2 and Stat5 results in phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of both variants (lane 6). Both complexes can be supershifted by the antibody specific for Stat5 (lane 7). Specific protein-DNA complexes were also observed in extracts from cells transfected with STAT5Δ750JAK2 (lanes 9 and10), STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 (lanes 11 and12), and STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 (lanes 13–15). These complexes can be supershifted with antiserum specific for JAK2 (lanes 10, 12, and14) or STAT6 (lane 15). No specific complex formation was observed when the kinase-deficient fusion construct STAT5JAK2KIN− (lane 8) was transfected. When STAT5JAK2KIN− was transfected together with the prolactin receptor and the cells were treated with prolactin, no DNA binding of this fusion protein was detected. Prolactin induction also did not augment the DNA binding of the constitutively activated proteins. Immunoprecipitates of the kinase-active, DNA-binding STAT5JAK variants from extracts of transfected cells reacted in Western blotting experiments with a tyrosine phosphate-specific antibody (data not shown). The specificity of DNA binding was demonstrated in competition experiments in which non-radioactive and a mutant version of the oligonucleotide from the β-casein gene promoter were introduced into the DNA binding reactions (15Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.-A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). DNA binding of STAT5, STAT5JAK2, STAT5Δ750JAK2, STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2, and STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 was suppressed by an excess of unlabeled β-casein promoter oligonucleotides (lanes 3, 6,9, 12, and 15), but was not affected by addition of an oligonucleotide representing a mutant version of the STAT5 binding sequence (lanes 4, 7,10, 13, and 16). The transactivating potentials of the fusion proteins were evaluated (Figs. 4and 5). For this purpose, the STAT-JAK fusion constructs were co-transfected with a β-casein gene promoter-luciferase, a cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) gene promoter-luciferase, or an oncostatin M (OSM) gene promoter-luciferase construct into COS-7 cells and luciferase activities were measured. These genes were previously identified as immediate early, cytokine-responsive genes, which contain STAT5 response elements in their promoter sequences (31Yoshimura Y. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T.

This results in the transcriptional induction of the β-casein gene promoter (21Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and an approximately 25-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). A 79-fold induction of luciferase was observed when the cells were co-transfected with the STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 construct (lane 3). Similarly to the β-casein gene promoter construct, the CIS-luciferase and the OSM-luciferase constructs showed a modest inducibility with STAT5 activated through the prolactin receptor and a high activity upon co-expression with the STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 construct. Only a slightly increased luciferase activity from the β-casein gene promoter construct was observed when STAT5JAK2 was introduced into the cells (Fig. 5, lane 2) and compared with the luciferase activity obtained upon expression of latent STAT5 (lane 1). In contrast to that of STAT5 (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2), the activity of STAT5JAK2 could not be enhanced by co-transfection of the prolactin receptor and prolactin induction (data not shown). Predictably, STAT5JAK2KIN− and STAT5Δ750JAK2 were also unable to activate transcription of the β-casein luciferase construct (Fig. 5, lane 3 and 4) in the presence or the absence of the prolactin receptor and induction with prolactin (data not shown). Replacement of the STAT5 transactivation domain with the transactivation domain of the Herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16 or of STAT6 resulted in enhanced transactivation (lanes 5and 6). These results confirm our previous observations on the relative strengths of these transactivation domains (34Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J.R. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stöcklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To corroborate the results obtained in transiently transfected COS cells, we established a second cell system, which allowed us to investigate the properties of the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins. This cellular system is based on the stable introduction of the STAT5-JAK2 fusion gene constructs into HeLa cells and the conditional regulation of transgene expression by a promoter sequence sensitive to the action of tetracycline. A tTA is constitutively expressed in these cells and stimulates transcription from a minimal promoter sequence combined with tetracycline operator sequences. The transactivator is not able to bind to tetracycline operator sequences, and the promoter is silent in the presence of low concentrations of tetracycline. Induction can be achieved by tetracycline withdrawal (20Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Two cellular clones transfected with STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 and two clones transfected with STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 were investigated for the expression of the fusion proteins upon tetracycline withdrawal (Fig.6). Western blot analysis of cellular extracts and development with a JAK2-specific antiserum revealed the induction STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 (lanes 1–4; 132 kDa) and STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 (lanes 5–8; 142 kDa). Bandshift experiments, with the MGF-STAT5 binding site from the rat β-casein promoter as a probe, were carried out. Specific DNA binding of both proteins was observed (data not shown), indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization had occurred. Ligand binding to cytokine receptors usually causes not only the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, but also the activation of ERK/MAPK. ERK2/MAPK activation, as a consequence of e.g.growth hormone receptor engagement, has been shown to be JAK2-mediated. Two mechanisms have been suggested to account for the role of JAK2. One suggests the conventional phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor, the recruitment of Ras regulating proteins, and the activation of ERK2/MAPK via Raf and MEK. Alternatively, Ras activation could occur via Sos-linked adaptor proteins, which bind directly to a phosphotyrosine residue within JAK2 (35Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36Winston L.A. Hunter T. Curr.

Since the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins contain active JAK2 kinase domains, we investigated the possibility that the MAPK pathway is activated in STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2-transfected HeLa cells upon tetracycline withdrawal. ERK2 activity was determined by immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from cell lysates with a specific antiserum, addition of myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP, incubation, and gel electrophoresis. Extracts from cells stimulated with EGF served as controls. No ERK2 activities were detected in STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2-expressing cells (Fig.7, lanes 2 and 4). ERK2 activity induced by EGF (lanes 1 and 3) was independent from STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 expression. The fusion proteins STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 and STAT5Δ750 STAT6JAK2 were also found to be potent transactivators in HeLa cells (Fig.8). Two individual HeLa cell clones transfected with STAT5Δ750VP1 6JAK2 (clone 3, lanes 1 and2; and clone 9, lanes 3 and 4) or STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 (clone 6, lanes 5 and 6; and clone 7, lanes 7 and 8) were analyzed. The cells were cultured in the presence (lanes 1, 3,5, anf 7) or for 48 h in the absence (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) of tetracycline and subsequently transfected with a β-casein promoter-luciferase gene construct. After 48 h, luciferase activities were determined. Inductions (30–50-fold) of luciferase activity were observed in all four cell clones. Equivalent experiments were carried out with stably transfected human breast carcinoma cells, SK-BR3. Induction of STAT5Δ750VP16JAK2 or STAT5Δ750STAT6JAK2 by tetracycline withdrawal caused a 50–60-fold induction of a β-casein promoter-luciferase reporter construct (data not shown). Our experiments show that the fusion of the kinase domain of JAK2 to the carboxyl terminus of STAT5 results in a chimeric protein that is constitutively activated and able to bind to the STAT5 response element independently of cytokine receptor activation. The fusion proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated. This phosphorylation can be the result of an intra- or an intermolecular reaction. The activation of the endogenous STAT1 molecules or co-transfected wild type STAT5 molecules indicates that intermolecular phosphorylation events take place. Interestingly, the STAT1 phosphorylation is dependent upon the JAK2 kinase activity present in the STAT5JAK2 fusion molecule. Transfected wild type JAK2 is not able to phosphorylate and activate STAT1, endogenous to COS7 cells. DNA binding of the STAT5JAK2 fusion molecules is not sufficient in all cases for transcriptional activation. STAT5JAK2 and STAT5Δ750JAK2 show strong DNA binding, but do not transactivate. This is not surprising for STAT5Δ750JAK2, since this molecule lacks the endogenous STAT5 TAD. The lack of transactivation potential of STAT5JAK2 might be due to the particular properties of the TAD of STAT5. We have previously observed that this TAD is very weak when linked to a GAL4 DNA binding domain. It only affects a 3-fold induction (9Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jähne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For full transcriptional induction, STAT5 requires the interaction with coactivators. The simultaneous activation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the complex formation with STAT5 strongly enhances transcription (39Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). It is possible that the fusion of the JAK2 kinase domain to the carboxyl terminus of STAT5 might interfere with this interaction. The increasing strength in transactivation function of the STAT5, STAT6, and VP16 TADs might be attributable to the recruitment of different co-activators. The observation that three STAT5 target genes can be induced by the STAT5-JAK2 constructs provided with different TADs suggests that the qualitative regulation exerted by the specific DNA binding domain might be augmented by a quantitative regulation based on the interaction between the TADs and specific co-activators. Alternatively, it is possible that the transactivation function of STAT5 is regulated independently from its DNA binding function and that additional phosphorylation events are required (40Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 41Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This type of regulation is not observed when heterologous TADs are incorporated into the STAT5JAK2 fusions. The inclusion of the strong TADs of VP16 or the moderately active TADs of STAT6 results in the induction of transcription of a β-casein luciferase construct. We have also quantitated the expression of a reporter gene construct that is regulated by the cytomegalovirus promoter, i.e. does not contain a STAT5 binding site, in cells expressing the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins. We observed that the expression of this gene is not affected by the STAT5-JAK2 fusion proteins. The activation of the fusion constructs is not limited to transiently transfected COS cells, but can also be observed in stably transfected HeLa cells or SK-BR3 cells upon induction of the genes through a conditional promoter. In these cells, the expression of the constitutively active JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain present in the fusion proteins does not enhance MAPK activity. This observation strengthens our premise that the chimeric proteins will be potent tools to study the effects of STAT5 independent from receptor stimulation and activation of other signaling pathways. They will also facilitate the identification of new target genes of STAT proteins.

Biol. 1994; 49: 313-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,2Umezawa H. Maeda K. Takeuchi T. Okami Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1966; 19: 200-209PubMed Google Scholar). This property has been exploited widely for cancer chemotherapy (3Lazo J.S. Sebti S.M. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modif. Annu. 1993; 14: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar). Most cell types express bleomycin hydrolase, an enzyme which renders bleomycin unable to cleave DNA and therefore nontoxic, whereas some tumors overexpress the enzyme (4Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). The level of expression of this hydrolase has been suggested to determine a cell's susceptibility to bleomycin. A current difficulty in bleomycin chemotherapy is that certain tumor types can become tolerant to the drug, whereas normal tissues, particularly lung and skin, remain susceptible (5Akiyama S. Ikezaki K. Kuramochi H. Takahashi K. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Lazo J.S. Humphreys C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3064-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The yeast bleomycin hydrolase gene was cloned by different groups asBLH1 or YCP1 by pursuing the peptidase activity of the protein (7Enenkel C. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7036-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Magdolen U. Muller G. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1171: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or as a cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein (9Kambouris N.G. Burke D.J. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21570-21576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first purified the protein unintentionally while characterizing the DNA binding activity of Gal4p (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gal4p is the positive regulator of the GAL regulon of yeast which consists of both structural and regulatory genes. Five structural genes are involved in galactose metabolism as follows:GAL2 encodes a permease for galactose uptake;GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10 encode the Leloir pathway enzymes that convert galactose to glucose-6-phosphate; and MEL1 encodes an α-galactosidase which converts melibiose to galactose and glucose. All of these genes are highly regulated by Gal4p through binding to the upstream activating sequence (UASG) 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activating sequence; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxy- methyl)ethyl]glycine. in the promoter of these genes. The activity of Gal4p is also controlled by Gal80p, a negative regulator, and Gal3p, which is responsible for the signal transduction by galactose (11Melcher K. Zimmermann F.K. Yeast Sugar Metabolism. Technomic Publishing Co. Inc., Lancaster, PA1997: 235-269Google Scholar, 12Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). Here we report that the level of yeast bleomycin hydrolase is low in yeast grown on glucose medium and induced severalfold on galactose medium. A Gal4p-responsive UASG was identified in the promoter region of the gene. It was shown to be responsible for this galactose regulation, prompting its designation as GAL6.Surprisingly, the deletion of the gene increases the expression level of galactose regulated genes, indicating that yeast bleomycin hydrolase, GAL6, is a negative regulator of the galactose regulon. This is the first evidence that a bleomycin hydrolase protein has a cellular function beyond detoxification of bleomycin. The Escherichia coli strain TG1 was used for plasmid amplification. Bacteria were grown in 2 × YT plus 25 μg/ml ampicillin. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrains used were Sc319(MAT a Δgal4 Δgal80 GAL80::URA3 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3 trp1-1 MEL1 GAL1/10::LacZ), Sc454(MAT a Δgal4 Δgal80 Δgal6::TRP1 GAL80::URA3 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3 trp1-1 MEL1 GAL1/10::LacZ), diploid W303(MAT a/α ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/trp1), haploid W303(MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 trp1), and Sc377(MAT α ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 Δgal6::Trp1). Yeast were grown either in rich medium (YEP) or selective medium as necessary with appropriate carbon source. Carbon sources were sterilized separately and added to the medium to a final concentration of 2% glucose for the repressed condition, 3% glycerol plus 2% lactic acid, pH 5.7, or 2% raffinose for the uninduced condition, and 2% galactose for the induced condition. Yeast bleomycin hydrolase was purified from yeast cells grown in galactose as described previously (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of purified protein was measured by mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired with a VG QUATTRO II triple quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass Instruments, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray interface at Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Core Facility at the University of Texas-Southwestern. The vectors pUC118 (14Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), YEP352 (15Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), pVT102u (16Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst .). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and YIP356R (17Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst .). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) have been described. The originalGAL6 clone was obtained from a yeast genomic library in YEP24 and designated pXU2. The primers 28cl (5′-CAACCAGAACACGCGAGGCAGTCTG-3′) from 780 bp upstream of the GAL6 ORF and Nsi(5′-AGCCAGGAAAAGAACAGGCTTATGACAGAA-3′) from 300 bp downstream of theGAL6 stop codon were used to amplify a PCR fragment that contains the GAL6 ORF and intact promoter from pXU2. This PCR fragment was cloned into the multiple cloning sites of YEP352 and designated pXU606. The plasmid pXU616 is the same construct as pXU606 except that the DNA binding site of Gal4p (UASG6) in theGAL6 promoter was deleted by the following method. Oligonucleotide B3 (5′-GGCGGATCCATTGAT TACCACAT-3′) which is upstream of UASG6 was used in combination with 28c1 to amplify PCR the fragment upstream of UASG6 from pXU2. Oligonucleotide B1 (5′-AGTCGCCGACGGATCCCATAAATAAACG-3′) which is just downstream of UASG6 was used with Nsi to amplify a PCR fragment that contains the GAL6 ORF from pXU2. Both B1 and B3 have a BamHI site. These two PCR fragments were then joined at the BamHI site and introduced into YEP352 to form pXU616, which deletes a 30-bp region containing the UASG6. To assay the effect of UASG6 on GAL6 expression, two constructs were made. The EcoRI fragments from pXU606 and pXU616 which contain the promoter and the first 95 amino acid coding region of GAL6 were introduced into theEcoRI site in YIP356R. The GAL6 ORF is in-frame with the lacZ reporter gene in YIP356R. The resulting reporters were then integrated into the URA3 locus in the yeast strain Sc317 to study the regulation of GAL6 by galactose. The SacI/BamHI fragment of the GAL6gene from pXU606 was cloned into pUC118. A 1.8-kb BamHI fragment that contains the yeast HIS3 gene was also cloned into the BamHI site. The construct is designated pWZ1-3. TheXhoI site in the HIS3 3′-flanking sequence is a unique site in pWZ1-3 and was used to linearize the construct and integrate it into the HIS3 locus of yeast genome. The GAL6 knock-out construct was made by replacing the pXU616 BamHI-EcoRV fragment, which contains the coding region for the first 420 amino acids of the Gal6p N terminus, with the 0.9-kb StuI-EcoRI fragment that containsTRP1 gene from YRP6. The primers 28cl and Nsiwere used to amplify by PCR a fragment with ends identical to theGAL6 locus using the null construct as the template. The PCR fragment was then transferred into the yeast genome by one-step gene replacement. All the GAL6 null strains were verified by Southern blot. The GAL6 gene in pWZ1-3 was mutated using a SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system from Amersham Corp. The oligonucleotide 5′-AAACAACCAAGATCTACCAGA-3′ was used to change Cys73 to alanine. To change Lys242, Lys244, and Lys245 to alanines, the oligonucleotide 5′-AGTGTGGATTGCCGCGTCTGCGTCTACGTATTCCC-3′ was used. These amino acid designations are based on the ATG start determined in this work, which is different from previously published data (see below). All the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting mutants in this construct were linearized by XhoI in the 3′-flanking region of the His3 gene and integrated into the HIS3 locus of Sc454. Yeast extracts were made with protease inhibitors (1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10.0 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in extract buffer A50 (25 mm Tris, 50 mm KC1, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) as described previously (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein/DNA binding reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl, containing either purified protein or crude yeast cell extract, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 1 ng of oligonucleotide end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed on either Kodak x-ray film or a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screen. The quantitation of bands was done on the PhosphorImager image, and the figures are from these files. To assay the DNA binding activity of Gal6p, a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide UASG1 (AGCTTAGCGGAAATTTGTGGTCCGAGC) that contains one strand of a Gal4p consensus binding site was used based on our previous observation that Gal6p has very high affinity for single-stranded DNA (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two double-stranded oligonucleotides, UASG6 which has the Gal4p binding site from the GAL6 gene promoter region and UASG1, were used in gel mobility shift assays with the Gal4p (1–147 amino acids) DNA binding domain purified from E. coli. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described elsewhere (18Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To assay the β-galactosidase enzyme level in the cell, yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase in the designated medium. Cells were harvested, and extracts were made in extract buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Twenty to 80 μg of protein were used for the enzyme assay. For induction assays, cells were grown in selective media supplemented with 2% glucose to A 600 nm = 0.85–1.0 and then washed once in H2O. The washed cells were transferred into selective medium plus 2% galactose. At different times the cells were sampled and stored at −80 °C. The sample cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described (18Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of gal6 mutations on galactose induction, the cells that harbored different gal6 mutants were subject to the same induction protocol, except that cells were harvested after growth in galactose medium for 30–36 h. All assays were performed with three independent transformants. Gal6p protease activity was assayed with the synthetic substrate Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) under the conditions previously described (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast whole cell RNA was prepared by the hot phenol method (19Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). To measure GAL1 messenger RNA inGAL6 wild type and deletion strains, a probe forGAL1 (520 base transcript from GAL1 ORF) andACT1 as a control (420 base transcript from its ORF) was used. To determine the half-life of GAL1 messenger RNA,GAL1 and ACT1 probes were transcribed from templates of PCR fragments from yeast genomic DNA. For the 150-bpGAL1 fragment, 5′-GGGGGGGGGGCCTGTTTCTTATTGGCGAGAGACTC-3′ was used as the forward primer. 5′-GTCTGTTTGCGGTGAGGAAGATC-3′ was used as the reverse primer. For the ACT1 probe, the primers 5′-GGGGGGGGGGAAACGTAGAAGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TCCTACGTTGGTGATGAAGC-3′ were used to amplify a 250-bp fragment from yeast ACT1 gene. The T7 promoter (5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGGGGGGGG-3′) was added by PCR. The templates then were transcribed to produce an RNA probe using a MAXIscriptTM kit from Ambion. The RNase protection assay was accomplished by using an RPA IITM kit (Ambion). After RNase treatment, the RNA samples were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel and dried on Whatman paper. The dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitated by ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. Due to partial denaturation of the double-stranded RNA fragment, in some RNA protection assays the signals appeared as doublets. It does not affect our interpretation of the results since the control that has only the RNA probe does not have detectable signal. Total yeast RNA was prepared by the hot phenol method, and blots were carried out by standard protocols (18Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amount of hybridization was quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer using ImageQuant software. The relative amounts of transcript from the GAL2, GAL7, and MEL1 genes were normalized to the messenger RNA level of the chromosomal cyclophilin gene (CYP1) as an internal control. The probes used in Northern blots were as follows: for GAL2, the 1.7-kb ORF; for GAL7, the 0.5-kb fragment of a portion ofGAL7 ORF; for MEL1, a 1-kb PCR fragment from the ORF; for CYP1, the whole ORF cloned into pUC119. All probes used for Northern blots were labeled with 32P by the random primer method (18Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Yeast cell crude extract was made as described under “Enzyme Assays.” Five to 10 μg of protein were run on 10% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDFTMmembrane using a liquid-blotting apparatus (Idea Scientific). Gal6p was detected by a standard Western blot method using a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against Gal6 protein purified from yeast (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported the purification of a 48-kDa protein from yeast based on its DNA binding activity (10Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first obtained amino acid sequence from four tryptic digest fragments of this protein. Based on these sequences the corresponding gene was isolated and the predicted 48-kDa protein identified as the yeast homolog of the rabbit bleomycin hydrolase. Because we had shown that the levels of this protein were regulated by galactose, it was designated as GAL6 (see below). The GAL6 ORF would encode a protein of 51.9 kDa if the +1 ATG designated in Fig. 1 A is used. There is another upstream ATG that would encode a protein of 55 kDa if it were the authentic start site. This upstream ATG was designated as the start in previous publications (7Enenkel C. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7036-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Magdolen U. Muller G. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1171: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the ATG at the downstream site matches the consensus translation initiation sequence better (9/10) than the upstream site (Fig. 1 A) (9Kambouris N.G. Burke D.J. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21570-21576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst .). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine which ATG is used as the translation start site, we purified Gal6p from a wild type yeast strain and measured its molecular weight by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the majority of purified protein has the molecular mass of 51.8 kDa, which is consistent with the use of downstream ATG as the translational start codon of GAL6. Our proposed translation of Gal6p would put its N terminus in alignment with that of the recently cloned human homolog (4Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bromme D. Rossi A.B. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6706-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Gal6p was not discernible in the crystal structure (22Joshua-Tor L. Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. Rees D.C. Science. 1995; 269: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Enenkel and Wolf (7Enenkel C. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7036-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Magdolen et al. (8Magdolen U. Muller G. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1171: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and Pei and Sebti (23Pei Z. Sebti S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10751-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) assumed that the upstream ATG was the initiation site. We have now entered the corrected sequence into GenBank with accession number U74299. Transcription of the galactose genes in yeast is regulated by the transcription activator Gal4p. All the known galactose-regulated genes have a well characterized 17-bp Gal4p binding site (UASG) in their promoters. In glucose medium, the expression of GAL4 is suppressed, resulting in most, but not all, GAL genes being completely off. In glycerol medium, Gal4p levels are elevated, facilitating binding to the UASG. However, the negative regulator GAL80suppresses GAL4 activity and blocks the expression of theGAL regulon (24Leuther K.K. Johnston S.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When cells are grown in galactose, Gal4p binds to the UASG of the galactose-regulated genes and activates transcription (13Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). By several criteria we find thatGAL6 is also a member of the galactose regulon. Gal6p was originally discovered in our lab by its ability to bind to DNA. It is the most significant activity in yeast cell extract that binds single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides in a gel mobility shift assay. We therefore used a gel shift as a sensitive assay to quantitate the amount of active Gal6p in cells expressing various amounts of Gal4p. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the amount of Gal6p in the cell is proportional to the Gal4p levels. Deleting GAL4 (lanes 1 and 4) decreases the level of Gal6p, whereas increasing Gal4p levels with a multicopy plasmid increases Gal6p levels (lanes 3 and6). As expected for a Gal4p/galactose-regulated gene, when cells are grown in raffinose medium, Gal6p is expressed only at a low level. However, when cells are grown in galactose, the expression level of Gal6p increases approximately 5-fold over the glucose or glycerol levels (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and5). An immunoblot for Gal6p levels reveals essentially the same relative effects of galactose induction and Gal4p response as the gel shift (Fig. 2 A, bottom). These differences in Gal6 protein levels are paralleled by the regulation of GAL6mRNA levels, as shown by a Northern blot (Fig. 2 B). This type of regulation is qualitatively the criteria for aGAL-regulated gene and quantitatively very similar to that of GAL80 and GAL3 genes (see “Discussion”). The regulation of GAL6 mRNA levels implies a Gal4p-mediated control. Consistent with this deduction, we found a single Gal4p binding site (UASG6) in the promoter region of the GAL6 gene (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig.2 C, Gal4p can bind to the UASG6 in vitro. To test whether the UASG6 is responsible for the galactose regulation of GAL6 expression, we fused theGAL6 promoter, with or without the UASG6, to alacZ reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the β-galactosidase activity under the control of the wild typeGAL6 promoter is regulated by galactose. A deletion of a 30-bp fragment containing the UASG6 from the promoter eliminates this galactose regulation, indicating that the UASG6 is responsible for the galactose regulation ofGAL6 gene. The difference in reporter levels under repressing conditions (glucose) (60 versus 12 units) could be due to the 30-bp deletion disrupting binding of some other protein or that the Gal4-Gal80 complex contributes to the activation ofGAL6 on glucose. Regardless, we conclude thatGAL6 expression depends on Gal4p activity and thatGAL6 is a newly identified member of the GALregulon. SinceGAL6 is regulated by galactose, we addressed the question of what role it might play in galactose regulation by deleting it. The deletion strain is viable with no notable effect on growth rate of glucose-grown cells (data not shown), which is consistent with previous observations (7Enenkel C. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7036-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Magdolen U. Muller G. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1171: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Kambouris N.G. Burke D.J. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21570-21576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when we compared the induction of a galactose-regulated gene in the wild type and gal6 deletion strain, we found that GAL6 has a negative effect. In thegal6 deletion strain, the induction level of a β-galactosidase reporter under control of the GAL1/GAL10promoter is higher than that in the wild type cells (Fig.3 A). The cells in this assay were transferred from repressing glucose medium to galactose medium at late mig-log phase, so they only grew a few generations before reaching stationary phase (final A 600 nm = 4), accounting for the relatively low β-galactosidase activity. This assay was also performed for the enzyme output of the MEL1gene. The α-galactosidase activity was ∼2.2-fold higher in the deletion strain (data not shown). This protocol emphasizes the effects on the kinetics of derepression from glucose in the GAL6 andΔgal6 strains. When the same GAL6 andΔgal6 strains were grown continuously in galactose medium there was also more β-galactosidase expression in the deletion stain (Fig. 3 B). This difference in β-galactosidase reporter activity is mirrored in an RNA protection assay to detectGAL1 mRNA (Fig. 3 C) and Northern blots to detect GAL2, GAL7, and MEL1 mRNA levels (Fig.3 D). The deletion strain has approximately 2–5-fold more of these mRNAs. On a practical note for two hybrid and related assays, strains deleted for GAL6 show the blue color of a β-galactosidase reporter gene in plate assays 1–2 days earlier than the wild type strain (data not shown). The GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, and MEL1 genes are highly inducible. We were curious as to whether GAL6 might affect other highly inducible genes. As a representative of such genes, we assessed the induction of the yeast heat shock gene, HSP26, in GAL6 wild type and gal6 deletion backgrounds. As shown in Fig. 3 E, GAL6 has no apparent effect on the induction of HSP26, indicating that the effect ofGAL6 deletion is not general for all highly inducible genes. As shown above, the negative effect of GAL6 on theGAL gene expression is at the mRNA level. This effect could be through alterations in mRNA production or stability. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested the stability of the GAL1 mRNA in a GAL6 wild type and agal6 deletion strain. Yeast cells were grown in galactose medium to mid-log phase. Glucose was then added to stop the transcription of the galactose-regulated genes. Whole cell RNA was prepared at different times after glucose was added. The RNA samples were subjected to an RNA protection assay to measure the amount ofGAL1 mRNA. As shown in Fig.4, the starting GAL1 mRNA level in a Δgal6 strain is higher than that of a wild type strain as expected from the results reported above, and the rate of decrease of GAL1 mRNA is essentially the same after adding glucose. This indicates that deleting GAL6 has no obvious effect on the stability of GAL1 mRNA at least in this experimental regime. By elimination, it appears that the effect of the GAL6 deletion on GAL1 mRNA levels is on the rate of production rather than the turnover rate of mRNA. Either of the two known activities of Gal6p, peptidase or nucleic acid-binding, could be responsible for the repression phenotype. To investigate the basis of GAL6-mediated repression, we first created variant forms of the protein by site-directed mutagenesis which had lost either DNA binding or peptidase activity. The peptidase mutant,gal6C73A, was made by replacing the active site Cys73 with alanine. This variant does not have measurable peptidase activity, as assayed against the substrate,N-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Fig.5 B). Disruption of the DNA binding activity of Gal6 protein was accomplished by changing Lys242, Lys244, and Lys245 to alanines. This alteration was guided by the crystal structure that showed these lysines to be near the surface of the hole in the hexamer (22Joshua-Tor L. Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. Rees D.C. Science. 1995; 269: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, these two mutations are independent, that is the DNA-binding variant (gal6db) retains normal peptidase activity and vice versa. When the wild typeGAL6 was replaced with the protease-deficient form, the induction of β-galactosidase activity was unaltered. This indicates that the peptidase activity of Gal6p is not required in the negative regulation of GAL gene expression (Fig. 5 C). We also tested whether the nucleic acid binding activity has any effect onGAL gene induction. The result shows that like the peptidase mutant, the strain bearing the Gal6p defective in nucleic acid binding has the same phenotype as the wild type (Fig. 5 D). This indicates that the DNA binding activity of Gal6p may not be required for the negative regulation of the galactose genes. The double mutant has the same phenotype as the single mutants (data not shown). It appears that the negative regulatory activity of Gal6p does not require either the peptidase or nucleic acid binding functions, at least as measured by conventional in vitro assays. Interestingly, when GAL6 was overexpressed by use of multicopy plasmids or an ADH1 promoter fusion there was no detectable effect on galactose growth or GAL1promoter-LacZ reporter expression (data not shown). This implies that wild type levels of Gal6p are sufficient to convey full negative regulation. This may not be too surprising considering that Gal6 protein is an abundant protein. We estimate from quantitative Western blots using purified protein as a control that there are ∼18,000 Gal6p molecules per cell under glucose growth conditions and 68,000 molecules under inducing (galactose) conditions. The yeast form of bleomycin hydrolase has been discovered in several different, apparently unrelated purifications and selections. We now find that it is a galactose-regulated gene. Furthermore, deletion of this gene, GAL6, leads to higher expression ofGAL-regulated genes. This implies that GAL6 is a newly defined negative regulator of the GAL system and part of an autoregulatory circuit. There is no obvious link between bleomycin hydrolase activity and galactose metabolism. However, GAL6 is not the first example of a non-galactose metabolism gene under GAL4 control. TheGCY1 gene is also regulated by GAL4. It is thought to encode a carbonyl reductase by sequence similarity to animal genes (25Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unlike GAL6, however, deletion ofGCY1 has no effect on the cells' ability to grow on galactose or on GAL gene regulation. We propose thatGAL6 and GCY1 may be part of the “environmental” galactose regulon. That is their gene products are not directly involved in the metabolism of galactose, but the presence of galactose generally correlates with some environmental condition that calls for GAL6 or GCY1. This condition may only be evident with yeast in their natural environment. We report here that GAL6 functions as a negative regulator of the galactose system. Cells transferred from glucose to galactose medium show a faster induction of GAL1 and a higher level at stationary phase. This implies that deletion of GAL6 allows faster relief of glucose repression and higher total output ofGAL1. This up-regulation is also evident for GAL1when the strains are grown continuously in galactose (Fig.3 C) and for the other structural members of theGAL regulon, GAL2, GAL7, andMEL1 (Fig. 3 D). A trivial explanation for this increased expression in the Δgal6 background is that the deletion of the GAL6 gene included the UASG in the promoter leading to higher Gal4p occupancy of other GALgenes. However, a strain in which only the GAL6 open reading frame was deleted had the same phenotype (data not shown). Besides GAL4, two other regulatory proteins of the system are known, Gal3p and Gal80p. GAL3 is defined as a positive element as its deletion results in a long delay in induction of the GAL genes (26Bhat P.J. Oh D. Hopper J.E. Genetics. 1990; 125: 281-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Genetics. 1986; 113: 229-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nogi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 101-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAL80, as withGAL6, is a negative regulator as its deletion leads to high level, constitutive expression of GAL4-regulated genes (29Torchia T.E. Hamilton R.W. Cano C.L. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Shimada H. Fukasawa T. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 39: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nogi Y. Fukasawa T.

Genet. 1987; 207: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also like GAL6, GAL80 and GAL3 are themselves regulated by GAL4, each containing one Gal4p binding site in their promoters (33Bajwa W. Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Shimada H. Fukasawa T. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 39: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All these genes have a significant GAL4-independent expression under non-inducing conditions (Fig. 2 D) (33Bajwa W. Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Shimada H. Fukasawa T. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 39: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is interesting that there is measurable Gal6p expression on glucose medium even whenGAL4 is deleted (Fig. 2 A), implying that there may be other regulator signals for GAL6 expression. Unlike the structural genes that are induced 50–1000-fold, GAL3and GAL80 genes, like GAL6, are only induced ∼5–10-fold by galactose (13Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). Taking these comparisons together,GAL6 regulation is strikingly similar to that of the other negative regulator, GAL80. Gal80p mediates negative regulation through binding the activation domain of Gal4p (24Leuther K.K. Johnston S.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). How GAL6 conveys negative regulation is unknown. Since the GAL regulon is sensitive to Gal4p levels, one possibility is that GAL6 affects the steady state level of Gal4p through its protease activity. This seems unlikely for the following three reasons. 1) We do not observe any changes in Gal4p level in the gal6-deleted strain (data not shown); 2) Gal6p is a peptidase and there is no evidence it is a protease; and 3) most convincingly, the Cys → Ala mutation of the active site does not affect the GAL phenotype. Another possible explanation is that GAL6 enhances the activity of Gal80p, but this could not be through the protease activity of Gal6p. The GAL phenotype could be mediated through the nucleic acid binding activity of Gal6p. However, the mutant defective in this activity behaves the same as the wild type strain inGAL induction, indicating that this activity may not be involved in the GAL phenotype. One possibility we cannot rule out is that the loss of nucleic acid binding activity as measured by the in vitro assay may not reflect the in vivoactivity of the protein. However, it is also possible that there is an as yet unidentified protein that interacts with Gal6p which is involved in the GAL regulation or that Gal6p itself has another undiscovered activity. We conclude that GAL6 is a newly recognized member of theGAL system, apparently acting as a negative regulatory protein. How it conveys its negative regulation is not evident from mutations in its known activities, implying a yet to be discovered function of this protein. This molecular analysis of GAL6provides the first evidence that this highly conserved and ubiquitous protein has a cellular function other than hydrolyzing bleomycin.

Only the combination of bcyt fused to the activation domain of the yeast GAL-4, and δ subunit fused to the DNA binding domain resulted in the strong expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene, suggesting a specific interaction of these subunits. Expression of bcyt fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) together with the δ subunit in Escherichia coli resulted in the overproduction of these subunits in soluble form, whereas expression of the GST-bcyt fusion alone had no such effect, indicating that GST-bcyt was protected by the co-expressed δ subunit from proteolytic attack in the cell. These results indicated that the membrane peripheral domain of b subunit stably interacted with the δ subunit in the cell. The affinity purified GST-bcyt did not contain significant amounts of δ, suggesting that the interaction of these subunits was relatively weak. Binding of these subunits observed in a direct binding assay significantly supported the capability of binding of the subunits. The ATPase activity was reconstituted from the purified bcyttogether with α, β, γ, δ, and ε, or with the same combination except ε. Specific elution of the ATPase activity from glutathione affinity column with the addition of glutathione after reconstitution demonstrated that the reconstituted ATPase formed a complex. The result indicated that interaction of b and δ was stabilized by F1 subunits other than ε and also suggested that b-δ interaction was important for F1-F0interaction.

Proton-translocating ATPase (F1F0-ATPase) expressed on the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria has a key role in energy transduction (1Futai M. Kanazawa H. Microbiol.

The complex subunit structure of this enzyme is basically similar among various species, but there are some differences in the membrane integral subcomplex (F0). Escherichia coli ATPase is composed of two different moieties, F1 and F0. F1,occupying the peripheral membrane portion, has the catalytic activity with five different subunits, α, β, γ, δ, and ε. F0 is the integral membrane portion with three different subunits, a, b, and c that forms a proton channel. The enzyme catalyzes ATP synthesis with a H+ gradient across the membrane formed by the respiratory chain in mitochondria and bacteria or photosynthetic electron transport in chloroplasts. In the reverse reaction, this enzyme pumps protons from the inside to the outside of bacterial cells and mitochondria coupled with hydrolysis of ATP. Based on the three-dimensional structure of αβγ complex of the bovine F1-ATPase (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) and the results of kinetic analyses of nucleotide binding and catalysis (9Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 64: 173-214Google Scholar), rotation of α3β3 around γ was proposed to occur during catalysis (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Data to support this hypothesis have been reported (10Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl.

A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and recently direct visualization of this rotation of the γ subunit within the αβγ complex has been performed for thermophilic bacteria (13Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinoshita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Although evidence of the rotation within the F1 complex has been thus presented, its structural basis, especially in terms of the connecting portion between the αβγ complex and F0 is not well understood (14Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The δ and ε subunits were shown to be important for this interaction (1Futai M. Kanazawa H. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 285-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev.

The atomic structure of the ε subunit and a portion of the δ subunit was resolved by NMR analysis for E. coli(14Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nature Struct.

Sci. 1994; 19: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Dallmann H.G. Geoffrey-Flynn T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also binds to the cytoplasmic region of the c subunit (17Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the topological arrangement of the δ subunit in the F1F0 complex is less well known than that of the ε subunit. In an early study of the biochemical properties of the purified δ subunit from E. coli (18Sternweis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3123-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an elongated structure was estimated. This subunit is also known to open sealed proton channel activity of F0 during enzyme biosynthesis (20Monticello R.A. Brusilow W.S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results of hydropathy analysis of the primary structure of the b subunit of F0 (2Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the majority of this subunit is estimated to be hydrophilic and possibly extruded into the cytoplasm, whereas the small amino-terminal portion is essential for its integration into membranes (22Perlin D.S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Hoppe J. Brunner J. Jorgensen B.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5610-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region between residues 25 and 146 of this subunit was overproduced as a soluble form and was shown to be capable of binding to the F1 complex (24Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these previous studies strongly suggested interactions between the b and δ or ε subunits, direct evidence of b-δ or b-ε interaction has not been reported. The a subunit of F0 has been shown by genetic analysis to be required for F1-F0 binding (21Eya S. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its interacting partners within F1 subunits have been also determined by chemical cross-linking experiments (25Aris J.P. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14599-14609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise regions involved in the binding of this subunit to a specific F1 subunit have not been elucidated. Here, we have found a specific interaction between the b and δ subunits with two approaches; a genetic approach with the yeast two-hybrid system (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 258: 14599-14609Google Scholar, 27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar) and a biochemical approach with overproduction, purification, and in vitro binding of the subunits (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M. Moritani C. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results directly indicate that the interaction of b and δ has an important role for F1 and F0interaction. E. colistrains BL21 and JM109 were used (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M. Moritani C. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) for overproduction of various peptides and genetic manipulations including preparation of various plasmids, respectively. E. coli cells were cultured in a minimal medium (Tanaka medium) (29Kanazawa H. Tamura F. Mabuchi K. Miki T. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7005-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose or glycerol at 37 °C. For the selection of transformants with plasmids, appropriate antibiotics were added to these media. For the two-hybrid system, plasmids pGAD424 carrying the activation domain of GAL4, and pGBT9 carrying the binding domain of GAL4 (27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar) were used. A DNA fragment corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain (residues 26–156) of the b subunit (bcyt) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (30Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13487) Google Scholar) with primer oligonucleotides (TableI), bT26-F (forward primer) and bT156-R (reverse primer), and genomic DNA from the wild-type DNA or plasmid pKM02 carrying the entire unc operon. The nucleotide sequence and deduced primary structure of the b subunit were based on the published results (31Gay N.J. Walker J.E. Nucleic Acid Res. 1981; 9: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Mabuchi K. Kanazawa H. Kayano T. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The amplified DNA was digested withEcoRI and BamHI, and the fragment subsequently recovered from agarose gels after electrophoresis was ligated intoEcoRI and BamHI digested pGAD424 or pGBT9. The chimeric plasmids thus constructed were named pGAD-bcyt and pGBT-bcyt, respectively. To prepare bcytpeptides, DNA corresponding to the same region (residues 26–156) or this region plus the δ subunit gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers bG26-F and bT156-R or bG26-F and DER-C1. The amplified DNA was integrated into the BamHI site of the expression vector pGEX-2T (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M. Moritani C. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and resultant chimeric plasmids were named pGEX-bcyt and pGEX-bcyt and δ. Following essentially the same steps, portions of the a subunit between residues 60 and 100, and 160 and 200 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the oligonucleotide primers aT60-F and aT100-R, and aT160-F and aT200-R, respectively, and the wild-type sequences of the subunit on plasmid pKM02 as a template. The amplified DNAs were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes shown in Fig. 1 and ligated to pGAD424 or pGBT9. The resultant chimeric plasmids were named pGAD-a60–100, pGBT-a60–100, pGAD-a160–200, and pGBT-a160–200. The nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence of the a subunit were cited from (34Kanazawa H. Futai M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the conditions as described previously (35Miki J. Matsuda T. Kariya H. Ohmori H. Tsuchiya T. Futai M. Kanazawa H. Arch. Biochem.

The chimeric plasmids of pGAD424 and pGBT9 derivatives constructed as described above or as previously reported for F1 subunits (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 258: 14599-14609Google Scholar) were introduced into yeast SFY526 carrying the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Expression of β-galactosidase was measured as described previously (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys.

The optical density at 420 nm ofo-nitrophenol released from the substrateo-nitrophenyl β-galactoside was normalized by the cell density of yeast measured photometrically at 600 nm and was expressed in Miller units (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 258: 14599-14609Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pGEX-bcyt was introduced into E. coli BL21 (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M. Moritani C. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli was cultured in 500 ml of M9ZB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose with vigorous shaking at 37 °C. At 0.6 A 600, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture (0.4 mm) and then the incubation was continued for another 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed, suspended in 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication. The disrupted materials were subjected to low (10,000 − g for 10 min) and high speed (100,000 −g for 60 min) centrifugation to fractionate proteins into soluble (supernatant) and membrane (precipitate) fractions as described previously (35Miki J.

The amounts of protein recovered were 92.4 mg and 14.3 mg for the supernatant and membrane fractions, respectively, after high speed centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was subjected to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (2.0 ml) column chromatography as described previously (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M.

GST-δ (7.0 mg), GST-ε (6.0 mg), and GST-bcyt (8.2 mg) were digested with thrombin (11.5 units for 1 mg of fusion protein, Sigma T3010) for 20 h. Subsequently, the digested materials were subjected to glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and 2.2, 2.0, and 2.7 mg of δ, ε, and bcyt, respectively, were obtained as practically homogeneous subunits. The F1-ATPase was reconstituted from purified subunits by dialyzing the subunit mixture against reconstitution buffer (50 mm succinate-Tris, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mmMgCl2) for 8 h at 26 °C (36Dunn S.D. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α, β, and γ subunits were purified as described previously (28Shin Y. Sawada K. Nagakura T. Miyanaga M. Moritani C. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For a typical reconstitution experiment, α (180 μg), β (165 μg), γ (100 μg), δ (20.7 μg), ε (16.4 μg), and GST-bcyt (89.5 μg) were mixed in 2.4 ml of reconstitution buffer. After dialysis, the reconstituted materials that contained the subunits in 3.0 ml were applied to glutathione-Sepharose (0.3 ml). After washing the column with 7.0 ml of reconstitution buffer, the ATPase was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in reconstitution buffer. Aliquots of the eluted materials were used for the ATPase assay (37Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), protein measurement by the published procedure (29Kanazawa H. Tamura F. Mabuchi K. Miki T. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 2 or 4 μg of bcyt or GST were fixed on Millipore GVHP filters (39Shin Y. Sawada K. Moritani C. Kanazawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which were activated with methanol and equilibrated with buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 190 mmglycine, 5% MeOH) prior to fixation. After blocking nonspecific binding of proteins by soaking the filters in skimmed milk, the filter with bcyt and GST was washed with reconstitution buffer and then soaked again in 2 ml of reconstitution buffer containing 100 μg of the δ subunit for 8 h at 26 °C for binding. Then, the filter was washed with reconstitution buffer to remove unbound δ subunits and nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 10% skimmed milk solution. Bound δ was detected by anti-δ mouse IgG raised against the purified E. coli δ and visualized with an ABC Vectastain kit as described previously (35Miki J. Matsuda T. Kariya H. Ohmori H. Tsuchiya T.

Preparation of plasmids, digestion and ligation of the DNA fragments, and other techniques related to handling DNA were performed according to the published procedures (40Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNA in the expression plasmids were verified by the dideoxy method with appropriate primers and35S-α-deoxy CTP (37 TBq/mmol, Amersham) (41Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar) or with a DNA sequencer (Pharmacia, Alfexpress DNA sequencer). Aliquots of eluted materials after affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide) (29Kanazawa H. Tamura F. Mabuchi K. Miki T. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7005-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and separated peptides were blotted onto GVHP filters (Millipore) (35Miki J. Matsuda T. Kariya H. Ohmori H. Tsuchiya T. Futai M. Kanazawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The membrane filters were soaked in a solution of poly- or monoclonal antibodies raised against the purified E. coli α, β,γ, δ, or GST, and the reacted bands were visualized with an ABC Vectastain kit as described previously (35Miki J.

Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Tth and Pfu DNA polymerase, and T7 DNA polymerase were purchased from Bethesda Research Labs, Toyobo Co., New England Biolabs, and Takara Co. Oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized by DNAgency (Malvern, PA). Other materials were of the highest grade commercially available. To identify subunits capable of binding the b subunit, we took two approaches; a genetic approach with the yeast two-hybrid system (27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar) and a biochemical approach with in vitro binding assay of subunits. For these approaches, we constructed two types of chimeric plasmids (Fig.1). For biochemical approaches, DNA fragment spanning the membrane peripheral portion of the b subunit (residues 26–156, bcyt) that was deduced from hydropathy analyses was fused to the GST gene to create a fusion peptide, and for genetic analysis with the two-hybrid system, the same portion of the b subunit was fused to the activation or DNA binding domain of GAL4 gene. The bcyt region of the b subunit gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and fused to the GST or GAL4 gene. Based on the previous model of membrane topology in the a subunit of F0 (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar,42Hoppe J. Sebald W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43Vik S.B. Cain B.D.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we amplified DNA of this gene corresponding to the putative peripheral membrane domain between residues 60 and 100, and 160 and 200, and also fused it to the binding or activation domain of theGAL4. To determine the binding partners of bcytand portions of the a subunit, we used chimeric plasmids of F1 subunits (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) fused to the activation or binding domain of the GAL4 gene for the yeast two-hybrid system constructed in the previous study (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 258: 14599-14609Google Scholar). First, we examined the interaction between bcyt and one of the F1 subunits, and then we analyzed bcyt-bcyt and also bcyt-a interactions with the putative peripheral membrane domains of the a subunit. The pair of α and β subunits gave strong expression of the reporter gene as we described previously (26Moritani C. Sawada K. Takemoto K. Shin Y. Nemoto S. Noumi T. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 258: 14599-14609Google Scholar), whereas the vectors alone did not (Table II). Among the various combinations tested, the combination of bcyt fused to GAL4-ad (activation domain of GAL4) and δ fused to GAL4-bd (binding domain of GAL4) alone resulted in strong expression of the reporter gene, whereas all other combinations showed no significant expression (Table II). These results demonstrated that the interaction between bcyt and δ occurred under in vivoconditions and other combinations might not cause interaction in those pairs. Although the purified soluble fraction of b (residues 25–146 or 26–156) was reported to form a dimer in vitro (24Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol.

The putative membrane peripheral region of the a subunit also did not show reporter gene expression, suggesting that these portions may not interact stably with the δ subunit.Table IIInteraction of the b cyt and the F 1 F 0 ATPase subunits in the yeast two-hybrid systemFusion proteinβ-Galactosidase activity(c)GAL4-adGAL4-bdbα0.09β0.12γ0.13δ15.0ε0.08b0.17αb0.10β0.08γ0.07δ0.08ε0.08αβ18.0−−0.08The expression plasmids carrying the genes for the indicated fusion proteins were cotransfected into yeast SFY526 by the lithium acetate method as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transformants were selected by plating onto SD medium lacking Trp and Leu.

The mutant TTC1, blocked at the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase level, which can transform the hydrocarbon into the corresponding dihydrodiol, has been used to produce bioconversion products. To rationalize the different grades of conversion obtained with different substrates, a study was performed using non-naphthalene derivatives, including benzenes, conjugated benzenes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The corresponding diols obtained by bioconversion have been isolated and characterized.

A theoretical model that considers both energy and geometry factors has been proposed to rationalize the experimental data. Good agreement has been found between the calculated values and the experimental results. Pseudomonas dioxygenases are a family of closely related enzymes that can add an oxygen molecule to a substrate double bond (1Harayama S. Timmis K.N. Hopwood D.A. Chater K.F. Genetics of Bacterial Diversity. Academic Press, London1989: 151-174Google Scholar). Their ability to make such a transformation on aromatic compounds, often the first step in the biodegradation of such compounds (2Dagley S. Sokatch J.R. The Bacteria. 10. Academic Press, London1986: 527-555Google Scholar), is particularly interesting. The high stability of aromatic compounds requires an unusually high redox potential that, in most cases, is made available by two or three component enzymes (3Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The active site is believed to belong to the class of Rieske-type iron-sulfur proteins, in which the iron, coordinated by two histidine nitrogens and two cysteine sulfurs, is, at the same time, the end point of a long redox chain transporting the necessary electrons from NADH (or NADPH) and the coordination site of molecular oxygen (3Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In the general framework of this type of dioxygenase, the specificity of recognition could be related to the geometric and functional characteristics of the active site. As a consequence, there are well-known oxygenases that transform monocyclic compounds (benzene (4Geary P.J. Mason J.R. Joannou C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or toluene (5Gibson D.T. Yeh W.-K. Liu T.-N. Subramanian V. Nozaki M. Yamamoto S. Ishimura Y. Coon M.J. Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Oxygenases and Oxygen Metabolism. Academic Press, London1982: 51-62Google Scholar)), naphthalenes (6Ensley B.D. Gibson D.T. Laborde A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 948-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (7Takizawa N. Kaida N. Torigoe S. Moritani T. Sawada T. Satoh S. Kiyohara H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2444-2449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1992, our research group has been interested in exploiting the power of the dioxygenase of P. fluorescens N3 that we isolated from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant (8Bestetti G. Di Gennaro P. Galli E. Leoni B. Pelizzoni F. Sello G. Bianchi D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 40: 791-793Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The wild type is able to completely degrade naphthalene and some of its derivatives and to transform many other naphthalenes into the corresponding salicylic acids (8Bestetti G. Di Gennaro P. Galli E. Leoni B. Pelizzoni F. Sello G. Bianchi D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 40: 791-793Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We later isolated a mutant strain (TTC1) blocked at the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase level (9Bestetti G. Bianchi D. Bosetti A. Di Gennaro P. Galli E. Leoni B. Pelizzoni F. Sello G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 306-313Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and then we cloned the naphthalene dioxygenase gene in Escherichia coliJM109 (10.à degli Studi di Milano, MilanoDi Gennaro, P. (1995) Produzione di cis-diidrodioli di naftaleni sostituiti mediante la naftalene 1,2-diossigenasi di Pseudomonas fluorescens N3 clonata in E. coli. Ph.D. Thesis, Universitàdegli Studi di Milano, Milano.Google Scholar). Thus, we could efficiently produce dihydrodiols from many naphthalenes carrying substituents in both position 1 and position 2. The yield seemed to be correlated to two aspects, the electronic characteristics of the substituents and their position, and was higher for electron releasing groups in position 2. However, the yield trend was not readily understandable, so we decided to extend our investigation to assess the specificity of N3 dioxygenase. Two strongly correlated actions were considered: the experimental verification of substrate specificity (by testing diverse aromatic substrates) and the theoretical design of a model that could be used to understand enzyme substrate recognition and, possibly, to quantify the yield of the transformation. In this paper, we describe the experimental results together with the model and its application. Chemical characterization of the products was made by 1H NMR spectroscopy using Brucker AC200 and AC300 instruments. Chemical shifts are reported as δ (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane as the internal standard; coupling constants are given in Hz. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV on a 7070EQ instrument updated by VG Instruments. Values of [α]D25 were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer 554 polarimeter. P. fluorescens TTC1 (NCIMB 40605) cells were routinely grown in M9 medium (11Maniatis T. Fritch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) with succinate and salicylic acid as an inducer (0.1 mm) according to a previously described procedure (9Bestetti G. Bianchi D. Bosetti A. Di Gennaro P. Galli E. Leoni B. Pelizzoni F. Sello G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 306-313Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the end of the fermentation period (optical density 1.2, overnight incubation), the cells were harvested by centrifugation and immediately used in the biotransformation. The naphthalene dioxygenase activity was determined by a photometric method as described previously (12Cidaria D. Deidda F. Bosetti A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 689-692Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One unit of dioxygenase activity was defined as the amount of cells (dry cell weight) producing 1 μmol of 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene in 1 min under the test conditions. In a general procedure, biotransformations using P. fluorescens TTC1 were carried out as described below. The cells, corresponding to 400 units of naphthalene dioxygenase activity, were resuspended in 600 ml of M9 minimal medium (11Maniatis T. Fritch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) with 5 mm succinate. The substrate for bioconversion was supplied directly to the culture at the concentration of 1 g·liter−1. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 5 h, and the diol accumulation was monitored by high performance liquid chromatograpy analysis. 1The reaction time used as a standard for the yield comparisons (5 h) was selected on the basis of the kinetic data that have been measured for many substrates and show linear oxidation profiles thus supporting the absence of enzyme inactivation at this stage. At the end of the reaction, the cells and the unreacted substrate were removed by centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatant of the culture was extracted four times with 150 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mg of Amberlite IRA900 basic resin. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using a 9:1 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as eluent. The dihydrodiol 9b (Table I) is highly unstable under the recovery conditions and could be characterized only after spontaneous dehydration to give, as the sole product, the phenol. The dehydration prone compounds 26 and 30b (Table I) were characterized after transformation in the corresponding stable diacetates by reaction with acetic anhydride in pyridine.Table IBioconversion products of aromatic compounds Open table in a new tab The unstable compounds 10b, 27a, and27b (Table I) could not be isolated in a pure enough form for mass and [α]D25 determination.

To gain more experimental data concerning the active site requirements, we enlarged the number of test compounds, adding to the naphthalene derivatives some substrates that could provide significant data to the description of the active site. In agreement with the lines previously reported, we were interested in selecting substrates with either different energy requirements or a particular geometric shape. Consequently, we moved toward aromatic compounds of other classes. Three sets of compounds were chosen: benzene derivatives (benzene, isobutyl benzene, bibenzyl, and diphenylmethane) (set 1); conjugated benzene derivatives (phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene; cis- andtrans-stilbenes, 1,1-diphenylethylene, coumarine, and biphenyl) (set 2); and polycyclic hydrocarbons (biphenylene, fluorene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and anthraquinone) (set 3). These compounds are representative of increasing electron delocalization with a consequent decreasing of oxidation potentials, different geometry, and different conformational freedom. To have a consistent set of experimental data, all of the bioconversions were made using standardized procedures, without any attempt at getting the best possible yields. Therefore, we chose the mutant strain TTC1 in a 3-liter flask. To ensure the standardization of the culture conditions, we also used the enzyme activity test previously reported (12Cidaria D. Deidda F. Bosetti A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 689-692Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When the yield was very low, we used either the E. coli recombinant pVL1343 + pMS13 (10.à degli Studi di Milano, MilanoDi Gennaro, P.

Biotechnol. 1996; 66: 375-381Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to get enough product to characterize. The bioconversion products are reported in Table I. None of the benzene derivatives (set 1) showed recognition by the enzyme; even the presence of a highly lipophilic substructure (isobutyl or CH2CH2Ph) did not lead to oxidation. As soon as the conjugation was extended we observed an interesting change: of all the conjugated benzene derivatives (set 2), onlycis-stilbene and biphenyl were recognized and gave two isomeric products each. It is clear that conjugation sufficiently lowered the oxidation potential, but geometric requirements dictated the conversion chances. For the set 3 compounds, we were confident of the magnitude of the oxidation potentials; nevertheless, we still needed to verify both the bond involved in the transformation and the shape requirements. Of the six compounds, five were recognized and gave different products; the remaining one (anthraquinone) was found to be inactive. This result is a clear sign of the importance of the oxidation potential, which, as soon as some basic geometric requirements are satisfied, functions as the discriminating factor. In set 3 compounds, it is also very interesting to look at the product structures because of their peculiarity. Fluorene gives products in full agreement with expectations (two regioisomers coming from the attack at different bonds of the same ring); phenanthrene and anthracene also apparently give the expected products, but they do not come from the attack at the most oxidizable bond (bond 9–10). In any case, the products exactly reproduce the regioisomers of substituted naphthalenes. Finally, biphenylene and acenaphthylene give products that show a geometry that is peculiar but in agreement with the most oxidizable bond. Enzyme active site modelling is still a developing activity (14Kuntz I.D. Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 117-123Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar) that presents two fundamental approaches. The first approach utilizes a good knowledge of the active site obtained by different methodologies (15Swaminathan P. Hariharan M. Murali R. Singh C.U. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2141-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Nugiel D.A. Jacobs K. Kaltenbach III, R.F. Worley T. Patel M. Meyer D.T. Jadhav P.K. De Lucca G.V. Smyser T.E. Klabe R.M.

ESCOM, Leiden, The Netherlands1993: 336-354Google Scholar). The second approach deduces the specificity of recognition using the structure characteristics of accepted substrates (18Silverman B.D. Platt D.E. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our problem is, to a certain degree, unique. In fact, we do not attempt to predict a complex biological activity, as is the case in medical chemistry, but model a biological transformation that is well defined in its outcome; i.e. we are interested in the rationalization of a known chemical reaction. We do not know two facts: the redox potential of the enzyme and its shape recognition. Thus, we need to identify the descriptor that directs the energy need and a volumetric representation of the allowed size of the molecules. The conversion mechanism of aromatic compounds to the corresponding dihydrodiols has been deeply discussed, and a two-step mechanism has been agreed on: the preliminary addition of an oxygen molecule, mediated by the Rieske-type iron-sulfur protein, and a subsequent reduction by NADH electrons through electron chain transfer (3Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) (see Scheme FSI). We can consider the first step irreversible and, consequently, the second step not important when calculating the yield of the transformation. In this respect, the discriminating factor is the facility to oxidize of the naphthalene double bond, a facility that can, in turn, be related to the energy of the corresponding molecular orbital, i.e. of the molecular orbital located at the bond. To determine these energies, we ran several calculations using a semiempirical quantomechanics program, AM1 (19Stewart J.J.P. MOPAC, version 6.0, Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange n.527. Indiana University, Bloomington, IN1990Google Scholar), that has been found to be consistently reliable for our molecules. The energies obtained are reported in Table II. Most of the time, the energies correspond to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Because the compounds can be considered conformationally rigid, we could almost always avoid searching for the most stable conformation, and even in the few cases in which a partial rotational freedom was present (e.g. ethyl or methoxy substituents), the search was very easy. The calculations were also made for the naphthalene derivatives to compare a more comprehensive set of compounds. The corresponding conversion yields are reported in Table II.Table IICalculated yields, energies, and geometric correctionsNo.CompoundProductYieldEnergyYield (E)2-aCalculated yield using Eq. 2.GeometryYield (E,G)2-dCalculated yield corrected by the geometric factor (Eq. 3).Class2-bCompound class determined using the substituent position.Fs2-cCorrection factor due to the substituent position and calculated as reported in the text.mmol/litereVmmol/litermmol/liter1Benzene0−9.65002i-Butylbenzene0−9.34003Diphenylmethane0−9.32004Bibenzyl0−9.34005Phenylacetylene0−9.280061,1-Diphenylethylene0−8.863.20Out2-eCompound not fitting into the accepted volume.007Diphenylacetylene0−8.754.25Out2-eCompound not fitting into the accepted volume.008trans-Stilbene0−8.496.73Out2-eCompound not fitting into the accepted volume.009cis-Stilbene9A0.37−8.902.811,2 A0.1960.549B0.192.811,2 B0.0430.1610Biphenyl10A0.64−8.952.341,2 A0.1960.4510B0.112.341,2 B0.0430.1411Naphthalene114.63−8.714.6300.9904.58122-Methoxy124.01−8.486.8320.5643.75132-Carbomethoxy131.14−9.011.7620.5640.89142-Ethyl142.89−8.635.3920.5642.94152-Methyl152.84−8.625.4920.5642.99162-Chloro161.83−8.863.2020.5641.70172-Bromo170.93−8.902.8120.5641.48181-Methoxy18A1.56−8.407.591 A0.1961.4818B0.167.591 B0.0430.36191-Ethyl191.42−8.585.871 A0.1961.14201-Methyl200.90−8.546.261 A0.1961.22211-Carbomethoxy21A1.06−8.991.951 A0.1960.3821B0.291.951 B0.0430.12221-Chloro22A4.02−8.774.061 A0.1960.7922B0.864.061 B0.0430.21231-Bromo23A1.19−8.843.391 A0.1960.6623B0.953.391 B0.0430.1824Coumarin0−9.450025Acenaphthylene252.69−8.942.4300.9902.6626Biphenylene260.54−8.437.312,30.0430.3527Fluorene27A0.4−8.714.632,30.0430.2427B0.24.632,30.0430.2428Anthracene280.14−8.1210.272,30.0430.4829Anthraquinone0−10.170030Phenanthrene30A0.99−8.615.591,2 A0.1961.0930B0.195.591,2 B0.0430.282-a Calculated yield using Eq. 2.2-b Compound class determined using the substituent position.2-c Correction factor due to the substituent position and calculated as reported in the text.2-d Calculated yield corrected by the geometric factor (Eq. 3).2-e Compound not fitting into the accepted volume. Open table in a new tab The molecular shape can be well represented by the corresponding Van der Waals' volume, which is easily calculated by many commercial programs (20CHEMX version Jul95. Chemical Design Ltd., Chipping Norton, Great Britain1995Google Scholar). If we superimpose all of the accepted compounds (9-23, 25-28, and30), taking care of exactly matching the double bonds that are transformed, and then we calculate the Van der Waals' volume corresponding to such superimposed molecules, we obtain a comprehensive volume (TotVol) (Fig. 1 A). TotVol is the volume inside the enzyme active site that is certainly free; consequently, all of the molecules that fit inside TotVol fulfil the shape requirements for acceptance. Performing the same operation on the set of compounds (6-8) that, even possessing a molecular orbital of the correct energy, are not transformed into the corresponding diols, we obtain their combined volume (NotVol) (Fig. 1 B). Subtracting TotVol from NotVol, we get a portion of space (ExtVol) (Fig. 1 C) that is characteristic of NotVol only. Thus, we know that any compound that occupies ExtVol cannot be accepted by the enzyme. Two examples of molecules that do not fit into TotVol are shown in Fig. 2. The orientation of 1,1-diphenylethylene puts the nonaromatic double bond in the supposed reactive position. Even if the orbital energy is above the calculated threshold, the molecule does not react because one of its benzene rings is outside TotVol. Similarly, trans-stilbene oriented as required for the reaction of one of its benzene rings puts the other benzene ring outside TotVol; consequently, trans-stilbene is not recognized by the enzyme. Looking at the experimental yields, it is possible to note their dependence on both the substituent nature and its position. The substituent nature is, of course, represented by the orbital energy, and consequently, quantification can easily be made inside a homogeneous set. On the other hand, the role of the substituent position is not automatically considered by the calculation. We took into consideration different possibilities (e.g. calculating the lipophilicity/lipophobicity of the substituents (Ref. 21Provencher L. Jones J.B. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 2729-2732Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar and references therein) or their Van der Waals' radii), but we did not find any efficient descriptor. To overcome this difficulty, we tried a different approach (see below). Still to be quantified is the correction needed for the orbital energies. The calculated energy of the attacked orbital of naphthalene is −8.71 eV. It was selected as the reference energy, and a corresponding correction has been assigned to any change equal to 0.1 eV. To calculate the conversion yields (μ) we correlated the experimental yields of 2-substituted naphthalenes with the calculated energies; we obtained the following line. Δμ=5.035×ΔE+0.453r=0.955Equation 1 This equation gives a yield correction factorF E equal to 0.958 for each 0.1 eV energy unit. The use of this correction factor in the following equation (Eq. 2) allows the calculation of the theoretical yields correlated to the orbital energy difference only (Table II), μic=μnaph+[(Ei−Enaph)/0.1]×FEEquation 2 where μic is the calculated yield of compoundi, μnaph is the naphthalene conversion yield (i.e. 4.63 mmol/liter), E naph is the orbital energy of naphthalene (i.e. −8.71 eV), andF E is the energy correction factor. From Eq. 2, we can also guess the energy threshold that would exclude a compound (μic = 0); it is equal to −9.2 eV (Fig.3). If we consider the experimental results together, they indicate that a minimal extension of the aromatic substructure is required for both energy and geometric recognition, that molecular shapes are restricted to a well defined area, and that the products depend on both the energy of the attacked bond and its juxtaposition inside the active site. The data gathered by the experiments proved essential in the design of the theoretical model. Let us now make some general considerations. All of the compounds are nearly insoluble in water, although this characteristic does not seem to be important. For example, operating with the E. coli recombinant, we can completely convert 1 g·liter−1 of naphthalene to its corresponding dihydrodiol. Diol products are known to be toxic at high concentrations (12Cidaria D. Deidda F. Bosetti A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 689-692Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but our operative concentrations were far from these levels. The bioconversion products always showed some common characteristics: the two hydroxyl groups are cis oriented; the absolute stereochemistry, when checked, was always the same (1R,2S referred to naphthalene dihydrodiol); most of the dihydrodiols showed no tendency to lose water and rearomatize, although some of them are highly unstable (e.g. one of the cis-stilbene derivatives, the fluorene derivatives, and the biphenyl derivatives). The reported yields were calculated using high performance liquid chromatography analysis before isolation and characterization of the products to minimize the noise that could derive from the isolation procedure. To test for acceptance we can operate thus: calculate the energy of the orbitals that can in principle react and exclude all portions of the solution that the wrong energy (lower than −9.2 eV); fit the molecule into the accepted volume in the correct orientation and accept all the solutions falling inside it; or fit the molecule into the excluded volume in the correct orientation and eliminate all the solutions falling inside it. The compounds that have the correct energy but are neither inside the accepted volume nor inside the excluded volume must be experimentally tested. To quantitatively assess the effect of the substituent nature and position in naphthalenes, we then reconsidered the results by separating all the compounds into subclasses. We defined each subclass by considering the position of the substituent (1, or 2, or 1,2, or 2,3) and the type of product obtained (type A if the hydroxyl groups were on the same half space of the substituent; type B if not). We can highlight four different classes: unsubstituted naphthalene (class 0); 2-substituted naphthalenes (class 2); 1- and 1,2-substituted naphthalenes of subclass A (class 1A/1,2 A); 1- and 1,2-substituted naphthalenes of subclass B, and 2,3-substituted naphthalenes (class 1B/1,2B/2,3). When we correlated the calculated yields with the experimental yields inside each class, we obtained four lines (see Fig.4, diagram 2) with the following slopes and correlation coefficients: (class 0)m = 0.99, r = 0.999; (class 2)m = 0.564, r = 0.979; (class 1A/1,2A)m = 0.196, r = 0.971; (class 1 B/1, 2B/2,3) m = 0.043, r = 0.665 (m = 0.035, r = 0.843, excluding compound 18B). Thus we can modify Eq. 2 to take into account also the substitution factor, obtaining the following equation, μic={μnaph+[(Ei−Enaph)/0.1]×FE}×FSEquation 3 where F S depends on the substitution pattern of the compound, and it is equivalent to the slope m calculated from the correlations reported above. Using the yields calculated by Equation 3 we can obtain the correlation line reported in Fig.5, diagram 3.Figure 5Correlation line between calculated (energy and geometry corrections) and experimental yields (expressed in mmol × 100) for all compounds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As can be noted from the diagram shown in Fig. 5, the calculated values are in surprisingly good agreement with the experimental results (r = 0.967; m = 0.91). There are a few exceptions that we will discuss, but we would like to stress the nice behavior of our model, considering that the compounds of the set are different and include different classes of aromatics. Let us now go back to the exceptions. Looking at Table II, we can find four compounds that correlate poorly. For 1-substituted compounds, we can locate three exceptions: the chlorine, bromine, and carbomethoxy derivatives. It is clear that the experimental yields are greater than those calculated. We have no explanation for this anomalous behavior, although it is worth noting that all these compounds carry a substituent that is electron withdrawing by field effect. 3However, the same effect is not shown by substituents in position 2. The last exception is anthracene. Its experimental conversion is lower than predicted. It is possible that the length of anthracene represents the limit of acceptance of the active site, a limit that is in agreement with the fact that 2-substituted naphthalenes do not give products of subclass B. In this paper, we have reported the experimental results of the bioconversion of aromatic compounds by a P. fluorescens mutant strain blocked at the dehydrogenase level. Then, using these results and the data obtained in previous experiences, we described a theoretical model that can rationalize the different behavior of the diverse substrates. The model proposed indicates the two main requirements that must be satisfied to have active site recognition: the minimum oxidation potential and the correct shape. The compounds used in this study demonstrated that the recognition is not limited to naphthalene derivatives and that the scope of the conversion can be greatly expanded. In addition, the amount of products is acceptable and, mainly by using the recombinant strains in a reactor procedure, can assure the availability of a number of optically pure dihydrodiols that constitute a chiral pool for synthetic use."

(1981) Nature 291, 90–92). To gain further insight into functional and structural significance of the modules, we designed two kinds of chimeric hemoglobin subunits (chimeric ααβ- and ββα-subunits), in which the module M4 was replaced by the partner subunits. CD spectra in the far-UV region showed that the secondary structure of the chimeric ααβ-subunit drastically collapsed, while the chimeric ββα-subunit conserved the native globin structure (Wakasugi, K., Ishimori, K., Imai, K., Wada, Y., and Morishima, I. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18750–18756). SAXS data also suggested a partially disordered structure of the chimeric ααβ-subunit. Based on tryptophan fluorescence spectra and computer modeling from x-ray structures of native globins, steric constraint between Trp14 and Tyr125 would be induced in the chimeric ααβ-subunit, which would perturb the packing of the A- and H-helices and destabilize the globule structure. On the other hand, such a steric constraint was not found for the counterpart chimeric subunit, the ββα-subunit. The different stabilities of these module-substituted globins imply that modules would not always be stable “structural” units, and interactions between modules are crucial to construct stable globin subunits.

The exon shuffling in protein evolution with the correspondence of the module to the exon on the gene structure strongly suggested that the module structure is one of the key factors in evolution of structure and function of protein (4Gilbert W.

The module structure was first identified in the globin family (1Go M. Nature. 1981; 291: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and their diagonal plots have clearly shown that both of the Hb subunits (α- and β-subunits) consist of the four modular structures, the modules M1, M2, M3, and M4 (1Go M.

The heme binding property of the minimyoglobin peptide was almost the same as that of the intact myoglobin, and the heme binding induced the recovery of secondary structure of the minimyoglobin. They concluded that the removal of the peptide fragments from the amino and carboxyl terminus has little effect on the heme binding to the apoprotein. These experimental results from the limited proteolysis of globins indicate that the module M2 + M3 can be a structural and functional unit to bind heme.To obtain further insight into the modular structure in globins, we have focused on the module substitution by use of cassette mutagenesis (2Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results have revealed that the heme environmental structure and ligand binding property of the chimeric ββα-subunit, in which module M4 of the β-subunit was replaced by that of the α-subunit, were quite similar to those of the β-subunit, while the chimeric subunit preferentially bound to the native β-subunit to form a heterotetramer, (ββα)2(βββ)2, not to the native α-subunit. The conversion of the association property indicates that module M4 is a key module in specific binding of the α-subunit to the β-subunit. This conclusion also corresponds to the distribution of the amino acid residues responsible for the formation of the α1-β1-subunit interface as shown in Fig.1.In the present study, we prepared the “reversed” chimeric subunit, the ααβ-subunit, in which module M4 of the α-subunit is replaced by that of the β-subunit, to clarify structural and functional roles of the module M4 in more detail. We examined the contributions of the modular structure to the stability of globular proteins and their functional roles in regulating the association property by comparing structural and functional properties of the chimeric ααβ- and ββα-subunits.

These experimental results from the limited proteolysis of globins indicate that the module M2 + M3 can be a structural and functional unit to bind heme. To obtain further insight into the modular structure in globins, we have focused on the module substitution by use of cassette mutagenesis (2Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results have revealed that the heme environmental structure and ligand binding property of the chimeric ββα-subunit, in which module M4 of the β-subunit was replaced by that of the α-subunit, were quite similar to those of the β-subunit, while the chimeric subunit preferentially bound to the native β-subunit to form a heterotetramer, (ββα)2(βββ)2, not to the native α-subunit. The conversion of the association property indicates that module M4 is a key module in specific binding of the α-subunit to the β-subunit. This conclusion also corresponds to the distribution of the amino acid residues responsible for the formation of the α1-β1-subunit interface as shown in Fig.1. In the present study, we prepared the “reversed” chimeric subunit, the ααβ-subunit, in which module M4 of the α-subunit is replaced by that of the β-subunit, to clarify structural and functional roles of the module M4 in more detail. We examined the contributions of the modular structure to the stability of globular proteins and their functional roles in regulating the association property by comparing structural and functional properties of the chimeric ααβ- and ββα-subunits.

Science. 1989; 244: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). In most cases, the virus appears to cause a persistent infection. Previous studies indicate that the development of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with chronic HCV infection (3Saito I. Miyamura T. Ohbayashi A. Harada H. Katayama T. KiKuchi S. Watanabe Y. Koi S. Onji M. Ohta Y. Choo Q.-L. Houghton M. Kuo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6547-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Comparative analyses of the genomes from several HCV strains indicate that HCV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, which includes flaviviruses and pestiviruses (4Choo Q.-L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby A. Barr P.J. Weiner A.J. Bradley D.W. Kuo G. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The HCV genome is a 9.5-kilobase positive-strand RNA from which a single polypeptide is expressed and processed by cellular and viral proteinases to produce the putative viral structural and nonstructural proteins (4Choo Q.-L.

It was previously shown that structural proteins were composed of the core protein of 18–22 kDa and two glycosylated envelope proteins, E1 of 31–35 kDa and E2 of 58–74 kDa (5Grakoui A. Wychowski C.

Although some lymphocyte cell lines have shown to support the limited replication of HCV, there has not been in vitro cell culture system efficiently enough to be used for viral propagation and for detailed virological studies (12Shimizu Y.K.

Expression studies using recombinant cDNA templates are the only means for identifying individual HCV proteins and to study their roles in the pathogenesis of HCV infection. The hydrophobicity profile of HCV polyprotein suggested that the HCV E2 protein corresponds to the flavivirus NS1 glycoprotein and the major pestivirus envelope protein gp53/gp55 (E2; gp53 in bovine viral diarrhea virus and gp55 in hog cholera virus), which were reported to induce protective immunity in experimental animals (13Hulst M.M.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3288-3294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCV envelope proteins are of considerable interest, because experimentally challenged chimpanzees were either protected or shown to ameliorate disease following vaccination with recombinant E1/E2 subunits (15Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Ralston R. Weiner A. Chien D. Van Nest G. Han J. Berger K. Thudium K. Kuo C. Kansopon J. McFarland J. Tabrizi A. Ching K. Moss B. Cummins L.B. Houghton M. Muchmore E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1294-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that HCV E2 protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells binds to target cells at a high affinity. In addition, antibody which neutralizes the binding of E2 to target cell appears to correlate with protection from HCV infection (16Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Moretto C. Guenzi E. Cousens L. Chin M. Dong C. Weiner A.J. Lau J.Y. Choo Q.-L. Chien D. Pikeri P. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HCV E2 protein is a key viral antigen for a hepatitis C vaccine. The HCV envelope protein expressed in cells infected with recombinant baculovirus and vaccinia virus was used for detection of envelope-specific antibody in patient sera (17Chien D.Y. Choo Q.-L. Ralston R. Spaete R. Tong M. Houghton M. Kuo G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 933Abstract PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Hsu H.H. Donets M. Greenberg H.B. Feinstone S.M.

Virol. 1992; 73: 2151-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the purification of HCV envelope protein at a high yield was thought to be a difficult task. When HCV envelope proteins were purified from HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus, approximately 1.5 mg of partially purified E1/E2 protein was obtained from a 120-liter culture of infected HeLa cells (15Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Ralston R. Weiner A. Chien D. Van Nest G. Han J. Berger K. Thudium K. Kuo C. Kansopon J. McFarland J. Tabrizi A. Ching K. Moss B. Cummins L.B. Houghton M. Muchmore E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1294-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Since the yield of purified E1/E2 protein appeared to be extremely low, presumably due to the membrane association of the HCV envelope protein, biochemical and immunological studies with E1 and E2 protein has been hampered so far. In this study, we established two recombinant CHO cell lines expressing a hGH and a secretory hGHE2t fusion protein, consisting of human growth hormone (hGH), thrombin recognition sequence, and a C-terminal truncated E2 (E2t) region. The fusion protein was shown to be a dimer and higher order oligomer, and purified to greater than 80% purity by using immunoaffinity chromatography from the culture supernatant. Prevalence of anti-E2 antibody in patients' sera and antigenic character of the purified hGHE2t protein were further identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera were obtained from blood donors and patients who visited to Korea Cancer Center hospital and Asan Medical Center, located in Seoul, Korea, from 1993 to 1995. Sera were obtained from 24 blood donors who were healthy adults with high alanine aminotransferase levels and negative for anti-HCV antibody assay (HCV ELISA 3.0, Green Cross Corporation, Korea). HCV ELISA 3.0 includes recombinant antigens of core and NS3 purified from bacterial cells and five immunodominant peptides (21–28 amino acids) of NS4 and NS5. When HCV ELISA 3.0 was compared with Ortho HCV 3.0 (Ortho, Neckagemund, Germany) using 990 blood samples, the results of HCV ELISA 3.0 showed 99.6% consistency with that of Ortho HCV 3.0. Four samples showing discrepant results were confirmed by using RIBA 3.0 (Chiron Corporation) and HCV BLOT 3.0 (Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore). One of four samples was shown to be false positive with HCV ELISA 3.0, while two others were with Ortho HCV 3.0. The last one is undetermined. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis was made by persistent liver enzyme abnormalities for longer than 6 months duration, physical findings, ultrasonography, and computerized tomography for evidences of portal hypertension, and/or liver biopsy. For the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, serum α-fetoprotein, imaging studies, and histological conformation were performed in all cases. HCV seropositive subjects which showed at least 4-fold elevations in serum transaminases for longer than 6 months were defined as chronic HCV. Sera from 115 patients with chronic renal failure who were on maintenance hemodialysis were used. As a negative control, we used 62 blood samples from healthy adults who had normal alanine aminotransferase levels and were negative for HCV ELISA 3.0. HCV cDNA covering E1 and E2 regions was obtained by PCR after reverse transcription of RNA extracted from a serum sample of an HCV-positive patient (20Cho Y.G. Yun J.W. Jang K.L. Kim C.M. Sung Y.C. Mol. Cells. 1993; 3: 195-202Google Scholar). The cDNA was synthesized from an antisense primer 2560A (5′-GGC TCT AGA ACA TCA GCA TCC ACA AGC A-3′) and then amplified after the addition of a sense primer E1N (5′-TAC TCC ATG GTG GGG AAC TGG GCC-3′). The complete nucleotide sequence of the clone was determined and classified into type 1b. To construct pSK-IRES, internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was amplified by PCR from pTM1 (21Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-GCG GGA TGA ATT CCG CCC CTC T-3′ and 5′-GCC ATG GTA TTA TCG TGT T-3′, and the amplified product was inserted into SmaI site of pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). pMT3 was constructed by inserting the EcoRI DNA fragment containing IRES of pSK-IRES into EcoRI site of pMT2 (22Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 364–693 and 364–740 of HCV polyprotein were amplified by PCR using E1N and 2420A (5′-TGT TCT AGA GGA GGT GGA TTA ACC CA-3′) or 2560A primers. The PCR products digested with NcoI and XbaI were inserted into downstream of EMCV IRES of pSK-IRES, and the resulting IRES-E2 fusion DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI andXbaI, and then inserted into pMT3 to generate pMT3-E2t and pMT3-E2, respectively. pMT3-hGH was constructed by inserting the cDNA of hGH gene into pMT3 (23DeNoto F.M. Moore D.D. Goodman H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3719-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To construct pMT3-hGHT, the DNA fragment encoding the recognition sequence (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) of thrombin, site-specific protease, was amplified by PCR from pGEX-KG (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) using primers, 5′-CCG CTG CAG ACT GGT TCC GCG TGG ATC CC-3′ and 5′-GCG CTG CAG TTA AGC TTG AGC TCG AGT C-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was in frame fused to amino acid residue 189 of hGH of pMT3-hGH. E2 regions spanning amino acid residues 386–693 and 386–740 were obtained by PCR amplification using E2N (5′-CCA TAT GCG CGT GAC AGG AGG AAC G-3′) and 2420A or 2560A primers, and then were in frame fused to the thrombin recognition sequence of pMT3-hGHT to produce pMT3-hGHE2t and pMT3-hGHE2, respectively. The thrombin recognition sequence allows hGH portion to be cleaved from the HCV envelope protein after purification of fusion protein. Translation of hGHE2 and hGHE2t fusion proteins was stopped by termination codon in primers. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene, dhfr−CHO, were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, hypoxanthine, and thymidine. COS-7 and dhfr−CHO cells were transfected with the plasmid DNA (10 μg) using calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). dhfr−CHO cells transfected were maintained as described previously under selective conditions in α-minimal essential medium containing dialyzed 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (26Pachl C. Burke R.M. Stuve L.L. Sanchez-Pescador L. Van Nest G. Masiarz F. Dina D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cell lines expressing recombinant HCV E2 protein were initially screened using immunoblotting and ELISA with serum from an HCV positive patient and anti-hGH rabbit antibody and were subjected to five subsequent rounds of methotrexate (Sigma) selection. Serum of a patient with chronic hepatitis C was assessed as a positive by using HCV ELISA 3.0 (Green Cross Corporation, Korea), anti-hGH rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the purified hGH protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Goat anti-rabbit antibody and -human immunoglobulin (Ig) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from DAKO diagnostics Ltd (Denmark). Anti-hGH mAb was purified from a hybridoma obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. COS-7 cells were transfected and metabolically labeled with 75 μCi of35S-Express label (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (27Ralston R. Thudium K. Berger K. Kuo C. Gervase B. Hall J. Selby M. Kuo G. Houghton M. Choo Q.-L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS) and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Portions of each lysate and culture supernatant were incubated either with serum from an HCV-positive patient or anti-hGH rabbit polyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were collected by using Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (Calbiochem) as described previously (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 561-591Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were solubilized and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was done according to the method as described previously (27Ralston R. Thudium K. Berger K. Kuo C. Gervase B. Hall J. Selby M. Kuo G. Houghton M. Choo Q.-L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blots were treated with the block solution containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Either serum from an HCV-positive patient or anti-hGH rabbit antibody (diluted 1:1000 in block solution) as the primary antibody and either goat anti-human or anti-rabbit Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:10000 in block solution) as the secondary antibody were used to detect HCV E2 protein and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.). The presence of inter- and intramolecular disulfide linkages was analyzed by the method of Allore and Barber (29Allore R.J. Barber B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Detection of HCV proteins was performed by immunoblotting. The purified hGH, the hGHE2t fusion protein (20 μg in 200 μl), and molecular mass standards (180 μg in 200 μl; Pharmacia) were layered onto 4.8 ml of 5–40% linear sucrose density gradients containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Centrifugation was performed at 45,000 rpm for 9 h in a Beckman type 55 rotor at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated by puncturing the bottom of the tube and collecting 15 fractions of 330 μl each. Gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Microtiter plates (Immulon 2, Dynatech) were coated with either the culture supernatant from transfected cells or the purified hGHE2t protein (400 ng/well). A portion of the purified protein pretreated with heat, 0.2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) with or without heat, andN-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 2 h, and then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The wells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin and followed by incubation with sera from HCV-positive patients at 37 °C for 2 h. After aspiration of the unbound material and washing of the wells, wells were incubated with goat anti-human Ig coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The reaction was developed by the addition of tetramethylbenzidine. Anti-hGH mAb (25 mg), purified from ascites fluid by saturated (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, was coupled to 3 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When CHO cells expressing hGHE2t protein were grown to subconfluent monolayers, culture medium was changed with serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). After additional 72-h incubation, the medium was harvested and applied to the hGH mAb affinity column equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed extensively with PBS and 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, and the bound hGHE2t protein was eluted with 3m NaSCN in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The eluate was immediately dialyzed against PBS. For the purification of C-terminal truncated E2 protein, the purified hGHE2t fusion protein was dialyzed against thrombin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-ME) and digested with thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h, and then applied to an hGH mAb affinity column. The C-terminal truncated E2 protein was purified by collecting the unbound protein. The purified hGHE2t protein was adjusted to 0.2% SDS and 100 mm β-ME, and boiled for 2 min. Treatment of N-glycosidase F was performed in the buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 100 mm β-ME for 1 h at 37 °C. HCV RNA was extracted from serum by proteinase K digestion-phenol/chloroform extraction method as described previously (30Okamoto H. Okada S. Sugitama Y. Kurai K. Iizuka H. Machida A. Miyamura Y. Mayumi M. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2696-2704Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription and amplification using an antisense primer 300A (5′-CAC TCG CAA GCA CCC TAT CAG GCA-3′) and a sense primer 80S (5′-ATC ACT CCC CTG TGA GGA ACT AC-3′) were performed as described previously (20Cho Y.G. Yun J.W. Jang K.L. Kim C.M. Sung Y.C. Mol. Cells. 1993; 3: 195-202Google Scholar), and amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Biochemical and immunological studies of HCV envelope proteins in virion have been limited due to a lack of an in vitro cell culture system allowing virus propagation. In addition, the purification of a native HCV envelope protein without denaturation appears to be difficult because HCV envelope proteins are membrane-associated. To express and purify HCV E2 protein at a high level, we designed several expression vectors for establishing a recombinant CHO cell line. pMT3-E2 and pMT3-E2t plasmids were designed to express the HCV E2 gene with and without a C-terminal hydrophobic region, respectively. Also, the signal sequence of E2 was replaced with the coding region of hGH, because it was found that the signal peptide of E2 was not appropriate for the efficient expression and that hGH was produced at a high level and efficiently secreted into culture medium in CHO cells. 2K. J. Lee, Y.-A. Suh, Y. G. Cho, and Y.-C. Sung, unpublished data. Therefore, we designed two fusion constructs, pMT3-hGHE2t and pMT3-hGHE2, consisting of the E2 gene connected downstream of hGH in which the thrombin recognition sequence was inserted upstream of E2 to remove the hGH portion from the fusion protein (Fig.1). To determine if the resulting constructs were capable of expressing immunologically relevant protein, the recombinant constructs were tested by the transient transfection assay in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, E2t, E2, hGHE2t, and hGHE2 proteins were expressed as molecular masses of 45–54, 52–62, 64–74, and 72–82 kDa, respectively, when cell lysates were specifically precipitated with sera from an HCV-positive patient (Fig. 2,lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). In contrast, any specific protein bands were not detected in cell lysates transfected with either pMT3 or pMT3-hGH as a control (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 4). The corresponding bands of hGHE2t and hGHE2 fusion proteins identified by sera from an HCV-positive patient were also detected when the same lysate was precipitated with anti-hGH rabbit antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that E2t, E2, hGHE2t, and hGHE2 proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were immunoreactive with circulating antibodies in HCV-infected individuals. To determine whether the expressed E2 protein can be secreted, the culture supernatant of transfected COS-7 cells was also immunoprecipitated with sera from an HCV-positive patient. Neither E2t nor E2 protein was detected in culture supernatants of cells transfected with pMT3-E2t and pMT3-E2 (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and9). In contrast, a significant amount of hGHE2t and hGHE2 proteins with molecular masses of 74–84 and 82–94 kDa, respectively, were found in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). It is likely that the hGHE2t protein is more efficiently secreted than the hGHE2 protein. These results indicate that E2 proteins, with and without a C-terminal hydrophobic domain, E2 and E2t, are capable of being secreted into culture medium when an efficient secretory protein, such as hGH, was fused to the E2 protein. The secreted form appeared to be higher molecular weight than its intracellular form, presumably due to the amount of added sugar residue through the secretory pathway. On the basis of these results, we selected pMT3-hGHE2t vector for the establishment of a recombinant CHO cell line expressing E2 as a secretory form. pMT3-hGHE2t and pMT3-hGH as a control were transfected into dhfr−CHO cells, and then positive cell lines were screened using ELISA and immunoblotting with anti-hGH rabbit antibody. After subsequent rounds of methotrexate selection, the recombinant CHO/hGHE2t and CHO/hGH cell lines were adapted at a medium containing up to 20 and 1 μm methotrexate, respectively. At this concentration of methotrexate, the expression level of hGHE2t and hGH protein was shown to be 7 and 2 μg/ml by an anti-hGH ELISA kit (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively. The hGHE2t protein was, as expected, detected as the molecular mass of 74–84 kDa by sera from an HCV-positive patient in immunoblot analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that the hGHE2t protein produced in CHO cells as well as COS-7 cells is a soluble secretory protein which is immunologically relevant. To purify hGHE2t fusion protein, the hGH mAb affinity column was prepared by coupling the hGH mAb to the activated Sepharose-4B. Culture supernatants of recombinant CHO/hGHE2t and CHO/hGH cells were applied to the hGH mAb affinity column and washed serially with PBS and 0.5m NaCl in PBS, and then hGHE2t protein was eluted with 3m NaSCN. By repeating this simple immunoaffinity chromatography twice, approximately 4.0 mg of hGHE2t protein with about 80% purity were obtained from 1 liter of culture of the recombinant CHO/hGHE2t cells. The hGHE2t protein purified from recombinant CHO cell line showed a broad band of 70–86 kDa on SDS gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and was identified with sera from an HCV-positive patient (Fig. 3,A and B, lane 1). The E2t protein was obtained after thrombin digestion, followed by hGH mAb affinity chromatography. The purified E2t protein showed a smaller molecular mass (45–65 kDa) and a broader band than expected in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 3, Aand B, lane 2). Sequencing of the amino-terminal residues resulted in Val387 and Cys607 at the amino terminus. The predicted amino acid sequences around the cleavage sites of thrombin are Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-⬇-Gly-Ser-Pro-His-Met-Arg386-⇩-Val387and Leu603-Thr604-Pro605-Arg606-⇩-Cys607, in which closed and open arrows indicate the predicted and unexpected cleavage site of thrombin, respectively. Therefore, it is likely that Val387 and Cys607 at the amino terminus are derived from the cleavage at Arg386-⇩-Val387and Arg606-⇩-Cys607 of the purified hGHE2t fusion protein, respectively. It is likely that the smaller and broader E2t bands are caused by partial thrombin cleavage of E2t at other unexpected cleavage sites. The hGHE2t fusion protein was used to further characterize the HCV E2 protein for the following reasons. First, the fusion protein appears to be cleaved by thrombin at unexpected sites, resulting in a smaller E2 protein. Second, the binding activity of the E2 protein to an E2-specific antibody was shown to be highly sensitive to β-ME, which should be included in the buffer of thrombin cleavage (see below). Although it was reported that E1 and E2 protein form a heterodimer, it is still controversial that this interaction is mediated by either intermolecular disulfide bonds and/or noncovalent association (10Matsuura Y.

Virology. 1994; 204: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, a homo-oligomeric complex formation of E1 or E2 protein remained to be elucidated. Therefore, we characterized the intermolecular association of purified hGHE2t fusion protein by the method of Allore and Barber (29Allore R.J. Barber B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which detects disulfide linkages by band shifting caused by diffusion of β-ME from reduced samples into adjacent lanes containing nonreduced samples. Under nonreducing conditions, additional high molecular mass bands were observed (Fig. 4,A, lanes 5–7). These high molecular mass bands disappeared in nonreducing samples adjacent to reduced lanes (lanes 4 and 8) as well as lanes containing reducing agents (lanes 1–3 and 9–11), indicating that they were generated by the formation of disulfide bond(s) among monomers. To further confirm oligomeric complexes of the hGHE2t protein, the hGHE2t fusion and the hGH proteins were analyzed on 5 to 40% sucrose gradients, followed by immunoblotting. Sedimentation analysis revealed that the hGHE2t fusion protein"

For instance, the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) aides in the cell-surface targeting of newly synthesized members of the mammalian low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family, which contains tandemly arranged clusters of hexacysteine repeats. In the chicken, an LDLR relative with eight such repeats is expressed as two different splice variant forms in cell type-specific fashion (Bujo, H., Lindstedt, K. A., Hermann, M., Mola Dalmau, L., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (1995) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 270, 23546–23551). To learn more about evolutionary aspects of RAP, its role in escorting of these different receptor splice variants, and other potential functions, we have extended our studies on the avian LDLR family to RAP. cDNA cloning, determination of tissue expression at both the transcript and the protein level, stable expression in COS cells, and binding studies with chicken RAP revealed that mammalian RAPs have retained many features of the non-amniotic proteins. However, structural details, <i>e.g.</i> the well defined internal triplicate repeats in the chicken protein, have been somewhat diluted during evolution. Interestingly, chicken RAP was found to correlate positively with the expression levels in somatic cells of the larger splice variant of the eight-cysteine repeat receptor, but not with those of the smaller variant, expressed only in germ cells. This is compatible with the possibility that RAP may play a role in receptor biology that could be complementing its function in assisting folding. Chicken RAP in crude extracts of the stable expressor COS cells is able to bind to LDLR relatives in ligand blots without requirement for prior purification of the ligand. Thus, in conjunction with the avian model of massive lipid transport to germ cells, these cells provide a novel comparative system amenable to investigation of the biological functions of RAP."
https://openalex.org/W2064698003,"Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) is an ocular protein which is believed to participate in the visual cycle by mediating transport of retinoids between pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the ability of IRBP to target particular retinoids to the specific cells that are their sites of action and metabolism is not completely clear, and little information is available regarding the structure of the protein's multiple ligand-binding sites. IRBP possesses two retinoid-binding sites, and it was reported that binding of the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, in one of these sites, but not in the other, is tightly regulated by another IRBP ligand, docosahexaenoic acid (Chen, Y., Houghton, L. A., Brenna, J. T., and Noy, N. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 20507). The two sites are thus functionally distinct. Here, the thermodynamic parameters governing the interactions of retinol with the IRBP retinoid-binding sites were measured. The data demonstrate that the interactions of retinol with both sites are stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions, and that the hydroxyl head group of retinol is not involved in formation of protein-ligand complexes.

Shuttling of retinoids across the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), 1The abbreviations used are: IPM, interphotoreceptor matrix; IRBP, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: IPM, interphotoreceptor matrix; IRBP, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid. the extracellular space separating between retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells in the eye, is essential for the function of the visual cycle. Rhodopsin regeneration requires transport of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal from its site of synthesis in the RPE to photoreceptor cells. On exposure to light, rhodopsin-bound 11-cis-retinal is isomerized to all-trans-retinal, hydrolyzed from the protein, and is enzymatically reduced to all-trans-retinol. Regeneration of the visual chromophore requires movement of all-trans-retinol from photoreceptors back to the RPE for re-oxidation and isomerization (reviewed in Ref. 1Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-386Google Scholar). Thus, the visual cycle critically includes continuous transfer of all-trans-retinol from the photoreceptors to the RPE and of 11-cis-retinal from RPE to the neural retina. The mechanisms by which retinoids, which are poorly soluble in water, are transported through the IPM at rates that are sufficient to support visual function are not completely clear at present. It has been repeatedly suggested, however, that the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), plays an important role in this process (reviewed in Ref. 2Pepperberg D.R. Okajima T-I.L. Wiggert B. Ripps H. Crouch R.K. Chader G.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). IRBP is a 140-kDa glycoprotein that is the major soluble protein in the IPM. It binds various isomeric and chemical forms of retinoids as well as long chain fatty acids (3Fong S.-L. Liou G.I. Landers R.A. Alvarez R.A. Bridges C.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11311-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that seem to be functionally distinct. The specific function of one of these sites (termed “site 1” in this article) is not clear at present but it has been shown to possess a retinoid selectivity in the order of 11-cis-retinal > all-trans-retinol > all-trans-retinal > 11-cis-retinol. The higher binding affinities for 11-cis-retinal and all-trans-retinol correspond to the physiological need to shuttle these particular retinoids across the IPM (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that site 1 serves mainly to allow IRBP to maintain a large storage pool of these retinoid forms in the extracellular space of the IPM. The recent observations that the interactions of 11-cis-retinal with the other retinoid-binding site of IRBP (“site 2”) are tightly regulated by the polyunsaturated long chain fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), provided clues regarding the possible function of site 2. It was shown that binding of DHA to IRBP dramatically reduces the affinity of site 2 for this ligand, and facilitates the rate by which 11-cis-retinal is released from this site by about an order of magnitude (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, DHA has very little effect on the interactions of 11-cis-retinal with site 1, or on the affinities of either site 1 or site 2 for all-trans-retinol (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further evidence indicated that DHA comprises a significant fraction of fatty acids associated with IRBP in the IPM, and that a steep concentration gradient of free DHA exists across the IPM such that the level of this fatty acid is about 8-fold higher in photoreceptor versus in pigment epithelium cells (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These observations led us to propose that DHA serves as a switch that allows IRBP to specifically target 11-cis-retinal to photoreceptor cells. We thus suggested that when IRBP is in the vicinity of pigment epithelium cells, where DHA concentrations are relatively low, site 2 possesses a high affinity for 11-cis-retinal which consequently binds to it. Movement of IRBP to the vicinity of photoreceptor cells exposes the protein to high DHA levels which then induces rapid release of 11-cis-retinal from site 2 at this location (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The functional interrelationships between the association of 11-cis-retinal and DHA with IRBP, which manifests itself in the regulatory features of site 2, may thus comprise the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the directional transfer of retinoids across the IPM. In addition to functional differences reflected by differential regulatory features and distinct retinoid-binding affinities (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites also display structural dissimilarities. For example, binding of retinol in site 1 results in a marked enhancement in the fluorescence of this ligand (10Okajima T-I.L. Pepperberg D.R. Ripps H. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Adler A.J. Evans C.D. Stafford III, W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4850-4855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting its movement from the aqueous phase to a more restrictive and hydrophobic environment within the binding site (20Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, association of retinol with site 2 does not affect the fluorescence of the ligand (17Chen Y. Saari J.C. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11311-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We previously suggested that these observations might indicate that while site 1 comprises a hydrophobic pocket, site 2 may be a more shallow site located at the surface of the protein, and that it may interact with retinol via its polar head group rather than by providing a non-polar environment which accommodates the β-ionone and the isoprenoid moiety of this ligand (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to further characterize the interactions of retinol with the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites. The data support the suggestion that the two sites are structurally distinct. The results indicate, however, that despite the dissimilarities of the two sites, the interactions of retinol with both of them are stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions, and that the hydroxyl head group of retinol is not involved in interactions of this ligand with either. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, stored in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1.3 mm CaCl2 and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and processed within 6 h after removal. The anterior half of the eye was removed, the eye cup washed with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and the retina was removed. Retinas were stored in the same buffer at −80 °C. This was purified from bovine retina essentially as described (21Saari J.C. Bredberg L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 44: 569-578Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except that fast-flow DEAE-Sepharose was used in place of DEAE-cellulose. Purified protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A), concentrated, and stored at −20 °C in buffer A containing 50% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using ε280 nm = 134,124 (21Saari J.C. Bredberg L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 44: 569-578Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Vesicles were prepared in buffer A as described previously (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration was determined according to Dittmer and Wells (22Dittmer J.C. Wells M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 482-530Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Retinol and retinyl methyl ether (generously provided by Drs. Hill and Shealy, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) were dissolved in ethanol and their concentrations determined using ε325nm = 52,770 and 52,200, respectively. Fluorescence was measured using a Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer (SPEX Instruments, Edison, NJ). Kinetic measurements were carried out using a High-Tech (Salisbury, United Kingdom) rapid mixing apparatus in conjunction with the spectrofluorometer. To induce dissociation of retinol from IRBP, the holo-protein was mixed with vesicles of DOPC which served as an acceptor phase. An access of lipid over protein (typically, 2–6 mm lipid/mm IRBP) was used to ensure that over 95% of the ligand transferred from the protein to the vesicles at equilibrium. To monitor dissociation of retinol from site 1, the decrease in the fluorescence of the ligand as it moves out of this site was followed. To monitor dissociation of retinol from both IRBP's retinoid-binding sites, the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein, which increases as the ligand moved away from both sites, was monitored. In all cases, the dissociation reaction could be well fit to a single first order equation and data analyses were carried out using the software package Origin (Microcal Co.). Rate constants for dissociation of IRBP-retinol complexes were plotted in the form of an Arrhenius plot, ln k off versus 1/T. Energy of activation (E a ) of the reaction was obtained from the slope of the plot (slope =E a /R). Enthalpy of activation (ΔH #) was calculated using ΔH # = E a − RT. Entropy of activation (ΔS #) was calculated using ΔS # = 2.3log(nhX/RT), wheren is the Avogadro number, h is the Planck constant, and X =k off/e−ΔH/RT. Free energy of activation (ΔG #) was calculated using ΔG # = ΔH # − TΔS #. Binding of retinol or retinyl methyl ether to IRBP was studied by fluorescence titrations as described previously (17Chen Y. Saari J.C. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11311-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interactions of the ligands with site 1 were followed by monitoring the enhancement of the fluorescence of the ligand upon binding at this site (10Okajima T-I.L. Pepperberg D.R. Ripps H. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Crouch R.K. Hazard E.S. Lind T. Wiggert B. Chader G. Corson W. Photochem.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Binding in the two retinoid-binding sites was followed by monitoring the decrease in the fluorescence of the protein which occurs concomitantly with ligand binding in both sites (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by fitting the experimental points to an equation derived from simple binding theory using the software package Origin (Microcal Co.). Equilibrium constants (K eq) were plotted as a function of temperature in the form of a van't Hoff plot, ln K eq versus 1/T. In this plot, the slope of the line corresponds to −ΔH/R, while the y intercept corresponds to ΔS/R. The free energy of the reaction was calculated using ΔG = ΔH −TΔS. To explore possible differences between the modes by which the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites interact with retinol, the thermodynamic parameters governing the rates of dissociation of retinol from the two sites were assessed. IRBP was precomplexed with retinol at a ligand/protein mole ratio of 2/1, and mixed with unilamellar vesicles of DOPC. Due to the high affinity of lipid bilayers for retinol, following mixing, the ligand moved from the protein to the vesicles (24Noy N. Xu Z.-J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3883-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Utilization of a large excess of lipid vesicles over protein ensured that over 95% of the ligand transferred into the vesicles at equilibrium. We and others previously showed that retinol moves from IRBP to lipid vesicles by a process that involves dissociation of the ligand from the protein, diffusion through the aqueous phase, and association with the lipid bilayers (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Ho M.-T.P. Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Anderson R.E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 928-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of the overall process is the dissociation of retinol from the protein. Thus, the observed rate of movement of retinol between IRBP and vesicles in these experiments directly reflects the rate of dissociation of the ligand from the protein (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Ho M.-T.P. Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Anderson R.E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 928-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As detailed below, two fluorescent properties within the system proved useful for probing dissociation of retinol from IRBP. One of these was used to monitor the dissociation of the ligand from site 1, while the other was used as a read-out for probing the dissociation of retinol from both site 1 and site 2 simultaneously. To date, no optical method for probing site 2 individually has been developed. Retinol is an efficient fluorophore and the intensity of its fluorescence is markedly enhanced upon its binding in site 1. Consequently, dissociation of retinol from this site can be followed by monitoring the time-dependent decrease in retinol fluorescence following mixing of holo-IRBP with vesicles. Dissociation of retinol from site 1 at various temperatures in the range of 12–40 °C was studied. Representative traces obtained at 12 °C and 40 °C are shown in Fig.1, A and B, respectively. At all of the temperatures studied, the dissociation reaction followed first order kinetics and the respective rate constants could be obtained by fitting the data to a single exponential. Fig. 2 shows an Arrhenius plot describing the temperature dependence of the rate constants. The energy of activation of the reaction and the calculated values of the free energy (ΔG #), entropy (ΔS #), and enthalpy (ΔH #) of activation characterizing the reaction by which retinol dissociates from site 1 are shown in TableI.Figure 2Arrhenius plot for dissociation of retinol from site 1.

Thermodynamic parameters were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Binding of retinol in both of the retinoid-binding sites of IRBP results in a significant decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein which can be monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively (17Chen Y. Saari J.C. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11311-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, movement of retinol away from either binding site results in recovery of the protein's fluorescence intensity and the time-dependent increase in the fluorescence upon addition of lipid vesicles to holo-IRBP reports on the dissociation of the ligand from both sites. Since the rate constants characterizing the dissociation of retinol from the two sites differ by less than an order of magnitude, the observed reaction will have an appearance of a single first order reaction, and the rate constant derived from these data will reflect an intermediate value between the individual rate constants characterizing dissociation of retinol from the two sites (18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To assess the thermodynamic parameters of the dissociation of retinol from the two sites, the temperature dependence of the apparent rate constants of the dissociation reaction was studied. Representative traces at 12 °C and at 40 °C are shown in Fig.3, A and B, respectively, and an Arrhenius plot of the data is shown in Fig.4. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing the dissociation reactions are shown in Table I.Figure 4Arrhenius plot for dissociation of retinol from both binding sites.

Mean values ± S.E. (n = 5) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The energy of activation of the dissociation of retinol from site 1 was found to be about 7 kcal/mol larger than that of the dissociation of retinol from both of the IRBP's retinoid-binding sites. As the later value represents a mean between the activation energies for dissociation of the ligand from site 1 and site 2, it is clear that the energy required to convert retinol bound at site 1 to the activated state is remarkably higher than that required to overcome energy barriers for dissociation of the ligand from site 2. Inspection of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the processes by which retinol dissociates from the two sites reveal additional differences: the entropic contribution to the free energy of activation of retinol dissociation from site 1 is significantly smaller as compared with site 2, while the enthalpic component is several kcal/mol larger. Overall, these observations indicate that the barriers for dissociation of retinol from site 1 versus site 2 are different both in magnitude and nature. To obtain better insight into the forces that stabilize the interactions of retinol within the IRBP retinoid-binding sites, the thermodynamic parameters characterizing these interactions were measured. Equilibrium constants at various temperatures were determined by fluorescence titrations of the protein with retinol. To monitor binding of retinol at site 1, fluorescence titrations were followed by monitoring the enhancement of the fluorescence of the ligand upon binding at this site. A representative titration is shown in Fig. 5 A. The data indicated that the number of binding sites obtained for the titration shown in Fig. 5 A was 0.86 mol/mol IRBP, verifying that following the enhancement of the fluorescence of retinol reports on binding of the ligand in a single site. A van't Hoff plot of the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants is shown in Fig. 5 B. The thermodynamic parameters governing the interactions of retinol with site 1 are presented in Table II.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for binding of retinol to IRBPSiteΔG*ΔHTΔS*kcal/mol1−9.6−1.28.51 + 2−9.2−2.07.22 (calculated)−8.8−2.86.02-a At 25 °C. Thermodynamic parameters for the association of retinol with site 1 and with both sites were obtained from the data in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters for the association of retinol in site 2 were calculated assuming that the values obtained for site 1 + 2 is a mean of the values characterizing the 2 sites. Open table in a new tab 2-a At 25 °C. Thermodynamic parameters for the association of retinol with site 1 and with both sites were obtained from the data in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters for the association of retinol in site 2 were calculated assuming that the values obtained for site 1 + 2 is a mean of the values characterizing the 2 sites. To probe binding of retinol in both of the IRBP retinoid-binding sites, the decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon titration with retinol was monitored. A representative titration of this type is shown in Fig. 6 A. Analysis of these data indicated that the number of retinol-binding sites probed by this method was 1.69 mol/mol IRBP. In 9 independent protein preparations, titration data obtained by monitoring the fluorescence of the protein yielded a number of binding sites that was always about double the number of sites obtained by monitoring the enhancement in the fluorescence of retinol. These observations verify that quenching of the fluorescence of the protein is indeed a valid readout for probing the association of retinol with both binding sites. Equilibrium constants obtained from these titrations thus reflect a mean between the values of the equilibrium constants characterizing the interactions of retinol with the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites. The temperature dependence of the mean equilibrium constant is shown in Fig.6 B in the form of a van't Hoff plot, and the mean thermodynamic parameters governing the interactions of retinol with the two sites are presented in Table II. Inspection of the thermodynamic parameters obtained for the interactions of retinol in site 1 (Table II) shows that only 12% of the energy stabilizing the association of retinol with this site is contributed by enthalpic components. The thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of retinol within site 2 were calculated from the values obtained for site 1 and the values for sites 1 and 2 (Table II). The results indicate that the enthalpic contribution for binding at site 2 comprised about 30% of the overall free energy stabilizing retinol-protein interactions at this site. Thus, the enthalpic contribution for association of retinol in both sites, which could emanate either from van der Waals or from hydrogen bond interactions between the protein and bound retinol, is relatively small. The predominant force that acts to stabilize the interactions of retinol in both sites is entropic. These observations thus indicate that protein-retinol interactions in both of IRBP's retinoid-binding sites originate mainly from hydrophobic associations (27Ross P.D. Subramanian S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3096-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The data presented above allow for comparison of the equilibrium and kinetic constants of the interactions of retinol with the two IRBP sites (TableIII). The observations reveal that the rates of both the dissociation and the association of retinol from site 1 are significantly slower as compared with rates of the interaction of retinol within site 2. The rate of dissociation of retinol from site 1 was 3.6-fold slower from the apparent mean rate of dissociation from both sites. It can thus be estimated that k offfrom site 1 is about 6-fold slower versus site 2. The difference between the rates of association of retinol with the two sites is smaller than the difference between thek off values, resulting in an overall 2-fold higher affinity of site 1 for retinol as compared with the mean binding affinity of both sites.Table IIIKinetic and equilibrium constants characterizing the interactions of retinol with IRBPSiteK dk offk onms −1m −1 s −1187 × 10−90.070.8 × 1061 + 2180 × 10−90.251.4 × 106Values at 25 °C are presented. K d values for site 1 and for both sites were obtained from the data in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Values at 25 °C are presented. K d values for site 1 and for both sites were obtained from the data in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Values of k off for site 1 and for both sites are from Figs. 2 and 4, respectively. k onvalues were calculated using the relationship k d =k off/k on. Overall, the data show that the interactions of retinol with site 2 are looser as compared with site 1 although the association of the ligand with both sites are stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions. Binding of retinol in hydrophobic sites in a variety of proteins has been shown to lead to significant enhancement in the fluorescence of the ligand. In the case of IRBP, however, only site 1 seems to induce such a fluorescence enhancement while site 2 does not measurably affect the fluorescence of retinol. Considering that the fluorescence of retinol emanates from the isoprenoid chain of the molecule, a model that accounts for all of these observations can be put forward. It is thus reasonable to suggest that site 1 is comprised of a deeper pocket which accommodates both the β-ionone ring and the isoprenoid chain of retinol. Such a pocket will provide a hydrophobic environment for the ligand and will lead to a marked increase in its fluorescence. In contrast, site 2 may be a shallower pocket which interacts with the β-ionone moiety of retinol by hydrophobic association, but does not accommodate the fluorescent portion of the molecule. This model for the structure of site 2 implies that the polar head group of retinol will not be involved in protein-ligand interactions in this location. To further explore this hypothesis, the interactions of retinyl methyl ether, a retinol derivative lacking the hydroxyl head group, with IRBP were studied. Fluorescence titrations of IRBP with retinyl methyl ether are shown in Fig. 7. Similarly to studies with retinol, the interactions of retinyl methyl ether with IRBP were probed both by monitoring the fluorescence of the ligand (Fig. 7 A), and by monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon binding of this ligand (Fig.7 B). Also similarly to studies with retinol, fluorescence titrations with retinyl methyl ether indicated that the number of binding sites probed by the later method was double the number of binding sites observed by the former. Furthermore, the data yielded equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions of retinyl methyl ether with site 1 of 95 nm. The apparent mean dissociation constant of the ether derivative with both sites was found to be 142 nm (mean of two measurements). TheK d values characterizing the interactions of retinyl methyl ether with both of the IRBP retinoid-binding sites are thus essentially identical to those of retinol (see Table III). These observations indicate, in agreement with the above proposed model, that the -OH head group of retinol is not involved in the interactions of this ligand with either of the IRBP-binding sites. IRBP, a retinoid- and fatty acid-binding protein of the IPM, is believed to participate in the visual cycle by mediating rapid shuttling of retinoids between photoreceptors and RPE cells (1Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-386Google Scholar, 2Pepperberg D.R. Okajima T-I.L. Wiggert B. Ripps H. Crouch R.K. Chader G.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying the ability of IRBP to target specific retinoids to particular locations in the eye is not completely understood at present. One approach for obtaining better insights into the mechanism of action of IRBP is to investigate the interactions of this protein with its ligands and the factors that regulate these interactions. As discussed in the Introduction, available data on the interactions of retinoids with the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites suggest that while site 1 might serve as a passive reservoir that allows for elevated concentrations of particular retinoids within the IPM, the regulatory features of site 2 might comprise the mechanism by which IRBP specifically targets 11-cis-retinal to photoreceptor cells, while delivering all-trans-retinol from the photoreceptors to the RPE (6Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the effort to understand the functional roles of the two IRBP retinoid-binding sites, it is interesting to consider the structural basis for the distinct interactions of retinoids with the two sites. Mammalian IRBP has been shown to contain four repeats of homologous stretches. Each of these repeats is about 300 amino acids long and, together, they span most of the length of the protein. An additional 55-amino acid segment was found to comprise the carboxyl-terminal of the protein (28Borst D.E. Redmond T.M. Elser J.E. Gonda M.A. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Nickerson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1115-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fong S.-L. Bridges C.D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15330-15334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The locations of either the retinoid- or fatty acid-binding sites within this sequence are not known but it has been suggested that conservative hydrophobic sequences near the ends of each of the four repeats may comprise hydrophobic grooves involved in binding of these ligands (28Borst D.E. Redmond T.M. Elser J.E. Gonda M.A. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Nickerson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1115-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no evidence has been put forward to verify that the two retinoid-binding sites of IRBP are comprised of hydrophobic regions. In contrast, it has been pointed out that while the enhancement of the fluorescence of retinol upon binding in site 1 suggests that this site is indeed a hydrophobic pocket, the observation that the fluorescence of retinol is not affected by binding in site 2 might indicate that retinol interacts with this site by a different mode (17Chen Y. Saari J.C. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11311-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to further characterize differences between the modes by which retinol interacts with the two IRBP-binding sites. The data revealed that energy of activation of the reaction leading to dissociation of retinol from site 1 is significantly higher than that characterizing the dissociation of retinol from site 2. In addition, it was found that the enthalpic barrier for dissociation of retinol from site 1 is significantly larger, while the entropic barrier for this reaction is significantly smaller as compared with dissociation of the ligand from site 2 (Table I). The observations that both the magnitude and the nature of energy barriers that limit the rates of dissociation of retinol from the two sites are remarkably different substantiate the suggestion that the two sites are structurally distinct. In an additional set of experiments, the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions of retinol with the two IRBP sites at equilibrium were measured (Table II). The data clearly demonstrated that the main contribution to the forces that stabilize the interactions of retinol in both sites originates from entropic components. These observations reveal that the interaction energy is derived mainly from hydrophobic associations between the protein and the ligand bound in both sites (27Ross P.D. Subramanian S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3096-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). This conclusion is in agreement with the additional observations that retinyl methyl ether, a retinol derivative lacking the hydroxyl head group of the parent compound, binds to both of the IRBP retinoid-binding sites with affinities that are essentially identical to those of retinol. The head group of retinol is thus not required, and is unlikely to be involved in the association of retinoids in either binding site. The results of the present study indicate further that while both of the IRBP retinoid-binding sites interact with retinoids mainly by hydrophobic association, the structures of the two sites and their mode of interactions with retinoids are substantially different. As discussed above, binding of retinol in site 1 results in a significant enhancement in the fluorescence of the ligand, indicating that the isoprenoid chain of retinol is removed from the aqueous phase to a hydrophobic environment upon binding in this site. In contrast, association of retinol with site 2 does not affect the fluorescence of the ligand, suggesting that the isoprenoid moiety of retinol is not transferred to a hydrophobic environment upon binding in this site. Comparison between the kinetic parameters governing the interactions of retinol with the two sites (Table III) shows that site 2 binds as well as releases this ligand at significantly faster rates as compared with site 1, and thus that the interactions of retinol with site 2 are looser as compared with site 1. It is reasonable to suggest, in view of these observations, that site 1 might be a deep hydrophobic pocket which engulfs both the β-ionone ring and the isoprenoid chain of retinoids, while the hydrophobic region in site 2 is smaller and while it binds the β-ionone ring by hydrophobic interactions, it does not associate with the isoprenoid chain or the head group of the molecule. The observations that the enthalpic component contributing to the interactions of retinol in site 2 is somewhat larger as compared with site 1 (30 versus 12% of total binding energy), suggest further that the isoprenoid chain may be bound in an additional, more polar, region within site 2, perhaps by van der Waals interactions. An important question that remains open regarding structure-function relationship in IRBP is how the two dissimilar retinoid-binding sites of IRBP are constructed from the four highly homologous amino acid stretches within the protein sequence. It is also not clear at present how binding of DHA to the protein regulates the interactions of site 2 with 11-cis-retinal without affecting the interactions of all-trans-retinol in the same location. These questions are currently under investigation. We thank Drs. Hill and Shealy (Southern Research Institute) for providing retinyl methyl ether for this study."
https://openalex.org/W2087552340,"We have employed ESR spectroscopy using guanine nucleotides that contain a spin label at the 2′,3′-position of the ribose to investigate structural changes in the proto-oncogene product p21 ras that are dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis. The three nucleotide analogs used were 2′,3′-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid ester (SL) GTP, SL-GDP, and the non-hydrolyzable analog SL-guanylylimidodiphosphate. SL-GTP was hydrolyzed by p21 with rates similar to those for GTP hydrolysis and appears to be an excellent substrate analog. The ESR spectra of SL-GTP and SL-GDP in complex with p21 differ significantly when acquired at 0 °C or 5 °C indicating different environments (conformations) of the protein-bound radicals depending on the phosphorylation state of the bound nucleotide. We calculated the rate constant for the conformational change as deduced from the changes in the corresponding ESR spectra upon incubation of the p21·SL-GTP complex at 25 °C and compared it to the rate constant of hydrolysis of SL-GTP at the same temperature. The rate constant deduced from the ESR method was similar to that determined by a high performance liquid chromatography technique. The data are in agreement with the idea that a conformational change during GTP hydrolysis by p21 occurs simultaneously with the actual hydrolysis step."

J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The chromatographic properties of β casein kinase and its inability to phosphorylate α casein (10Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) distinguish it from casein kinase 1 (CK1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2), two ubiquitous protein kinases that also owe their names to their ability to phosphorylate caseins in vitro (28Pinna L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In contrast to the MAPK pathways, β casein kinase is not activated by mitogens, cellular stresses, or cytokines other than IL1 and TNF (26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To refer to this highly specific regulation and to avoid the confusing term “casein kinase,” it has recently been renamed TNF/IL1-activated protein (TIP) kinase (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TIP kinase is a cytosolic enzyme of about 100 kDa that may be part of larger aggregates of 200–600 kDa in vivo (10Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Its physiological substrates are unknown. Unlike the components of the MAPK cascades, it is not inactivated by phosphoprotein phosphatases in vitro and therefore appears to be regulated by a mechanism other than direct phosphorylation, perhaps via association with other cytosolic proteins (26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have now identified the main phosphorylation site of TIP kinase on β casein and have investigated the role of neighboring residues in the reaction. Our findings indicate that TIP kinase corresponds to a new type of dual specificity protein kinase, directed toward a novel sequence motif. Human recombinant IL1α and TNF-α expressed inEscherichia coli were purified as described previously (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed recombinant human cytosolic phospholipase A2 and IκBα proteins were kind gifts from Dr. Graham Ritchie (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK) and Dr. Martha Ladner (Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA), respectively. ATF2, p42 MAPK, p54 MAPK, p38 MAPK, MKK1, and MKK4 were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by standard methods. The cDNA encoding human MKK4 was generously given by Dr. L. B. Holzman (Division of Nephrology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI); that for rat p54 MAPK (stress-activated protein kinase β) by Dr. James R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); those for human MKK1 and p42 MAPK by Professor Christopher Marshall (Institute for Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK); and those for human ATF2 and p38 MAPK by Simon Lumb (Celltech Ltd, Slough, UK). The antiserum to the 223 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) was a generous gift from Dr. Holzman. The antibodies to peptides corresponding to residues 828–847 of mixed lineage kinase (MLK) 3 and residues 589–608 of receptor interacting protein (RIP) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Molecular mass standard proteins, β casein, and ATP were from Sigma (Poole, UK). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham International (Little Chalfont, UK). 2-Iodosobenzoic acid (IBA) was from Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). N-(9-Fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acids were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Beeston, UK). The proteolytic fragment of β casein, T1, was prepared by digestion of the protein withl-1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma), precipitation at pH 4.6, and anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q (Pharmacia-Biotech, Saint Albans, UK) as described previously (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were made on peptide amide linker-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, Hertford, UK) by the Fmoc method (29Fields G.B. Noble R. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar), with activation byO-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (PerSeptive Biosystems) (30Carpino L.A. El-Faham A. Minor C.A. Albericio F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1994; : 201-203Crossref Google Scholar). Syntheses were carried out either in a 9050 Plus automatic peptide synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems) or manually in a multiple peptide synthesis system (Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Northwich, UK). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Their purities and molecular weights were confirmed by analytical reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). MRC5 fibroblasts from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) containing 160 mg/ml crystapen, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cytosols of IL1-stimulated fibroblasts were chromatographed on the anion exchanger Resource Q (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as in Guesdon et al. (26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and fractions containing the kinase were pooled. The enzyme was then precipitated by addition of 0.33 volume of a chilled saturated solution of (NH4)2SO4. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the suspension was spun at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was usually resuspended in 0.25 volume of Resource Q chromatography buffer (26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) supplemented with 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Brij 35. In some experiments, the ammonium sulfate precipitates were resuspended in 0.05 volume (120 μl) of gel filtration buffer (Resource Q buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl and 0.05% Brij 35, v/v) and chromatographed on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column in the same buffer at 0.3 ml/min (26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected. Control preparations to assess the activity of contaminating kinases were made by applying the same purification procedure to cytosols of unstimulated cells (10Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These were done at room temperature in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 μm ATP, and 15 kBq/μl [γ-32P]ATP, except when labeling substrates for mapping, for which the ATP concentration was 1 μm (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped after 20–50 min by addition of twice-concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) at 100 °C, and the mixtures were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis of proteins (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was done on slab gels cast with a mixture of acrylamide and N,N-methylenebis-acrylamide (38:1 by weight). Acrylamide concentrations were 5% for electrophoresis of a phosphoprotein of about 95 kDa, called pp95, 10.5% for other proteins and 16% for IBA fragments of β casein (w/v). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried before autoradiography. Electrophoresis of CNBr fragments and synthetic peptides was done on urea-containing gels as described elsewhere (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled β casein was extracted from gel slices and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as in Guesdon et al. (10Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage by IBA (1 μg/ml) was carried out following published methods (31Carles C. Huet J.-C. Ribadeau-Dumas B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Mahoney W.C. Smith P.K. Hermodson M.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), β casein being at 1 μg/ml. The digests were desalted by gel filtration on columns of Sephadex G25 (Pharmacia). Cleavage by CNBr (53 mg/ml) was done in 70% formic acid and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 24 h; β casein was at 20 mg/ml. The reaction mixtures were then diluted 10 times in water, freeze-dried, and subjected to analytical high pressure liquid chromatography (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) on a Techoprep 10C18 column (HPLC Technology, Macclesfield, UK). Elution was by 25-ml linear gradients of 5 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For identification of the fragments, desalted digests or chromatography fractions were subjected to gel electrophoresis. The fragments were then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, detected by Coomassie Blue staining or autoradiography and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing as described previously (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Phosphorylations were quantified by counting the Cerenkov radiation from pieces of gels containing the substrates. Background phosphorylation by constitutively active contaminating kinases was measured in assays carried out with the control kinase preparations from unstimulated cells. Counts obtained with the TIP kinase preparation were corrected for background and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression with the program EnzFitter (33Leatherbarrow R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We started our investigation of the substrate specificity of TIP kinase by testing whether or not it could phosphorylate several proteins known to be involved in responses to IL1 and TNF, such as cytosolic phospholipase A2, the transcription regulators c-Jun, IκBα, and ATF2, the protein kinases p42 MAPK, p54 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and the activator of p42 MAPK, MKK1. The recombinant proteins and β casein were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by preparations of TIP kinase and by control preparations, made by the same procedure from unstimulated cells. As previously reported (10Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the main product of the phosphorylation of β casein by TIP kinase was a phosphoform of the protein, called R, which was electrophoretically retarded relative to the unphosphorylated casein (Fig. 1). An unretarded phosphoform, called U, was also observed, but was less abundant than the R form and phosphorylations by control preparations indicated that it was produced, in part, by contaminating protein kinases (Fig. 1). The only other substrate protein that was phosphorylated by the TIP kinase preparations was the recombinant p38 MAPK, but its phosphorylation was very weak and was also observed when control kinase preparations from unstimulated cells were used (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of p38 was thus due to a contaminating kinase, and none of the proteins tested were substrates of the IL1-activated enzyme. Other similar experiments showed that TIP kinase had no activity on the activator of p54 MAPK, MKK4, or on hsp27, myelin basic protein, phosvitin, or histone H1 (data not shown). We also attempted to identify substrates of TIP kinase in chromatography fractions of fibroblast cytosols that had been treated at 56 °C for 20 min to inactivate endogenous kinases, but this too was unsuccessful (data not shown). We thus decided to identify the site(s) phosphorylated by TIP kinase on β casein and to explore the role of adjacent residues in the reaction. The main phosphorylation sites of TIP kinase have previously been shown to be serines located in a 6.4-kDa tryptic fragment of β casein, called T1 (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The fragment, which is phosphorylated with kinetics similar to those of the whole protein (K m = 27 ± 6 μm), corresponds to residues 114–169 and contains seven serines (27Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 31Carles C. Huet J.-C. Ribadeau-Dumas B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To locate the main phosphorylation site more precisely, the R phosphoform of β casein was subjected to further mapping after cleavage by IBA and CNBr. Treatment of the R phosphoform with IBA generated two fragments of molecular masses 24 and 6 kDa; some intact β casein was also observed, indicating that cleavage was not complete under the conditions used (Fig. 2 A). The masses and amino-terminal sequences of the fragments confirmed that they resulted from cleavage of the protein on the carboxyl side of its single tryptophan, Trp143, in agreement with previous findings (31Carles C. Huet J.-C. Ribadeau-Dumas B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Only the 24-kDa amino-terminal fragment was labeled, indicating that phosphorylation was on the amino side of Trp143 (Fig. 2, A and C). Cleavage of R phosphoform by CNBr generated a complex mixture of fragments which was fractionated by HPLC. The 32P-labeled material eluted as a peak of retention time 14.5 min whose analysis by electrophoresis showed a single labeled fragment (Fig. 2 B). Its amino-terminal sequence, PFPKY, identified its amino-terminal residue as Pro110 (Fig. 2 B). Its carboxyl-terminal residue was likely to be the next methionine in the sequence of β casein, Met144 (31Carles C. Huet J.-C. Ribadeau-Dumas B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results placed the phosphorylation site between Pro110 and Trp143, in a region that contained three serines at positions 122, 124, and 142 (Fig. 2 C). To discriminate between the three candidates, we then tested the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides mimicking these regions of the β casein sequence. The first two peptides, called P1 and P2, corresponded, respectively, to residues 116–141 and 129–155 of β casein. Peptide P1 was phosphorylated by TIP kinase with kinetics similar to those measured with tryptic fragment T1 (Fig.3). P2 was also phosphorylated, although much less efficiently than P1 (Table I). This indicated that the main phosphorylation site had to be either Ser122 or Ser124 and that Ser142corresponded perhaps to a minor phosphorylation site. Variants of P1 in which the candidate phosphoacceptors were replaced by the non phosphorylatable residue, cysteine, were then tested. TIP kinase was unable to phosphorylate the variant peptide C124, in which Ser124 was replaced by cysteine, but phosphorylated peptide C122, in which Ser122 had been replaced by cysteine (Fig.3). This showed that Ser124 was the main phosphorylation site of TIP kinase on β casein and that Ser122 was not a target of the enzyme. Interestingly, kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of C122 showed a 7-fold decrease inK m value, relative to that of P1, with no change ofV max (Fig. 3, Table I), indicating that cysteine was strongly preferred to serine at position −2 (residue numbers are counted relative to the position of the phosphoacceptor amino acid).Table IIdentification of the main phosphorylation site with synthetic peptidesPeptideSequenceK mRelativeV maxRelativeV max/K mμmP1VEPFTESQSLTLTDVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH228 ± 71.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2P2DVENLHLPLPLLQSWMHQPHQPLPPTV-NH2700 ± 3000.41 ± 0.130.020 ± 0.003C122VEPFTECQSLTLTDVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH24.2 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.7Kinetic parameters of the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.”V max andV max/K m values are expressed relative to those of fragment T1, whose K m for TIP kinase has been determined as 27 μm previously (27Guesdon F.

The serine residues and the substitution to cysteine in C122 are underlined. To define the boundaries of the sequence motif recognized by TIP kinase, we synthesized a series of progressively shorter variants of P1, called D1 to D5, and compared their phosphorylations to that of the parent peptide. We avoided replacing Ser122 by Cys for synthetic convenience. Removal of two or four residues of the carboxyl end of P1 had no significant effect on the kinetics of phosphorylation (peptides D1 and D2, TableII), indicating that the residues on the carboxyl side of Leu137 were not required for phosphorylation of Ser124. Further shortening of the carboxyl-terminal end by two residues resulted in an increase inK m of about 10-fold and a commensurate decrease inV max/K m (peptide D3, TableII). Peptide D4, which had an even shorter carboxyl end, was not phosphorylated by TIP kinase (Table II). These results suggested that some of the residues located between Asn132 (position +8) and Pro138 (position +14) played an important role in the recognition of Ser124 by TIP kinase. Removal of four residues at the amino end of P1 increased K m by 50%, indicating that the residues on the amino side of Thr120 played only a minor role in the reaction (peptide D5, Table II).Table IIDeletions and substitutions of residues surrounding Ser124PeptideSequenceK mRelativeV maxRelativeV max/K mμmD1VEPFTESQSLTLTDVENLHLPLPL-NH231 ± 51.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.2D2VEPFTESQSLTLTDVENLHLPL-NH232 ± 20.83 ± 0.040.70 ± 0.04D3VEPFTESQSLTLTDVENLHL-NH2315 ± 510.72 ± 0.110.066 ± 0.006D4VEPFTESQSLTLTDVE-NH2np2-anp, no detectable phosphorylation.npnpD5TESQSLTLTDVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH247 ± 81.2 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1E1NEAQSLTATDVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH246 ± 10.74 ± 0.250.57 ± 0.18E2VEPFAECQSLNAADVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH25.9 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.35.5 ± 2.2E3VEPFNECQSLNANDVENLHLPLPLLQ-NH26.8 ± 0.20.87 ± 0.253.5 ± 1.0Kinetic parameters were determined as in Table I.V max andV max/K m values are expressed relative to those of fragment T1.
