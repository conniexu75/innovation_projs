https://openalex.org/W2996163077,"Information security is an important and critical subject of the current digital era. Nowadays, almost all information is digital in nature and security from hackers and eavesdroppers has become vital in civil (big giant corporations) as well as in defense organizations. One type of information in bit streams is in the form of digital images. In this article, an idea to combine Brownian motion with ternary unique orientation has been implemented which is related to random motion over time and spatial coordinates. Moreover, chaotic dynamical map has been used to add one more security level to the proposed encryption scheme. The proposed scheme is evaluated on different statistical tests and these results are compared with already existing benchmarks. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better security performances as compared to existing image enciphering schemes."

This study examined the relationship between maternal employment and nutrition status of U5 children in Uganda using the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) data. We used a weighted sample of 3531 children U5 years born to working women age 15-49. Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between maternal employment and nutritional outcomes while adjusting for other explanatory factors. Results show that children whose mothers had secondary education had lower odds of stunting and underweight compared with children whose mothers had no formal education. Children who had normal birth weight had lower odds of stunting, wasting and being underweight compared with children with low birth weight. Children whose mothers engaged in agriculture and manual work had higher odds of stunting compared with those whose mothers engaged in professional work. Additionally, children whose mothers were employed by nonfamily members had higher odds of wasting and being underweight compared with children whose mothers were employed by family members. Other determinants of child nutritional status included region, age of the mother, and age and sex of the child. Interventions aimed at improving the nutritional status of children of employed women should promote breastfeeding and flexible conditions in workplaces, target those of low socio-economic status and promote feeding programs and mosquito net use for both mothers and children."
https://openalex.org/W2995766479,"The widely accepted ""endozoochory syndrome"" is assigned to angiosperm diaspores with a fleshy, attractive tissue and implies the existence of adaptations for protection against digestion during gut passage. This syndrome has led diaspore fleshiness to be emphasized as the exclusive indicator of endozoochory in much of the ecology and biogeography research. Crucially, however, endozoochory in nature is not limited to frugivory, and diaspores without ""external flesh"" are commonly dispersed, often over long distances, via birds and mammals by granivory. A key question is: are such diaspores somehow less prepared from an architectural point of view to survive gut passage than fleshy diaspores? To answer this question, we selected 11 European angiosperm taxa that fall outside the classical endozoochory syndrome yet are known to be dispersed via endozoochory. We studied their seed coat/pericarp morphology and anatomy both before and after gut passage through granivorous waterfowl, and determined their seed survival and germinability. We found no fundamental differences in the mechanical architecture of the seed coat and pericarp between these plants dispersed by granivory and others dispersed by frugivory. Neither diaspore traits per se, nor dormancy type, were strong predictors of diaspore survival or degree of damage during gut passage through granivores, or of the influence of gut passage on germinability. Among our 11 taxa, survival of gut passage is enabled by the thick cuticle of the exotesta or epicarp; one or several lignified cell layers; and diverse combinations of other architectural elements. These protection structures are ubiquitous in angiosperms, and likely to have evolved in gymnosperms. Hence, many angiosperm diaspores, dry or fleshy, may be pre-adapted to endozoochory, but with differing degrees of specialization and adaptation to dispersal mechanisms such as frugivory and granivory. Our findings underline the broad ecological importance of ""non-classical endozoochory"" of diaspores that lack ""external flesh""."

Aboriginal Australians with chronic and end stage kidney disease have high health care access needs.To describe the experiences of health care users of a large government kidney healthcare service provider.Within a government renal health service in the Top-End of the Northern Territory, we undertook a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 26 adult clients from urban, regional and remote settings who were living with kidney health conditions.Client characteristics included a mean age of 55 years, 55% female and 81% identifying as Aboriginal. The kidney related conditions of client participants included CKD (11, 42.3%), haemodialysis (12, 46.2%), peritoneal dialysis (1, 3.9%), and transplant (2, 7.7%). Key themes emerging from patient interviews related to perceived gaps for clients and carers including: 1) knowledge gaps about the health condition, 2) the impact of relocation in order to access centrally-based renal care, 3) healthcare staff professionalism and qualities and 4) service environments. Overall, the experiences centred on a greater need for client-centred, respectful and culturally based healthcare support. Clients recommended the need for patient-led collective care, including sustaining an Indigenous Patient Reference Group to support ongoing healthcare service decision processes. Participants included in almost equal proportion, clients with CKD (without dialysis) and clients utilising renal replacement therapy, which adds significant weight to the client-identified recommendations for highest quality of kidney care across a wide spectrum of kidney function.Four major themes identified by clients related to their experience with renal care provided by this major regional health care provider: knowledge gaps of their own condition, the lived impacts of relocating to access health care, service environments, and Health Care Provider Quality. An Indigenous Patient Reference Group was one mechanism recommended to support the co-design of preferred care models."
https://openalex.org/W2994673288,"Cell-based tissue reconstruction is an important field of regenerative medicine. Stem and progenitor cells derived from tooth-associated tissues have strong regeneration potential. However, their in vivo application requires the development of novel scaffolds that will provide a suitable three-dimensional (3D) environment allowing not only the survival of the cells but eliciting their proliferation and differentiation. Our aim was to study the viability and differentiation capacity of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) cultured on recently developed biocompatible and biodegradable poly(aspartamide) (PASP)-based hydrogels. Viability and behavior of PDLCs were investigated on PASP-based hydrogels possessing different chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Based on our previous results, the effect of thiol group density in the polymer matrix on cell viability, morphology and differentiation ability is in the focus of our article. The chemical composition and 3D structures of the hydrogels were determined by FT Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Morphology of the cells was examined by phase contrast microscopy. To visualize cell growth and migration patterns through the hydrogels, two-photon microscopy were utilized. Cell viability analysis was performed according to a standardized protocol using WST-1 reagent. PDLCs were able to attach and grow on PASP-based hydrogels. An increase in gel stiffness enhanced adhesion and proliferation of the cells. However, the highest population of viable cells was observed on the PASP gels containing free thiol groups. The presence of thiol groups does not only enhance viability but also facilitates the osteogenic direction of the differentiating cells. These cell-gel structures seem to be highly promising for cell-based tissue reconstruction purposes in the field of regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2995917467,"Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle; after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing metrics of failure (so-called ""loss"" or ""win"") used in textual or visual classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful metric of success of a classifier."
https://openalex.org/W2995996623,"Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats belonging to the group of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy or prion diseases. The EU has adopted mandatory measures for scrapie surveillance to safeguard public and animal health because it is highly contagious and might decimate all genetic susceptible animals in affected flocks. Definite diagnosis of scrapie relies on the detection of the pathological prion protein in brain tissues and there are still no blood biomarkers available for making diagnosis in living animals that can be used for the screening of sheep in scrapie-affected flocks. Neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a valid biomarker for neuronal and axonal damages, can now be easily measured in blood by the ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Recent work reported that serum NfL is increased in neurodegenerative diseases, including human prion diseases, but no data are available for scrapie or other animal prion diseases. Here, we found that the median serum NfL concentration in scrapie animals (56.2, IQR 42.2–84.8, n = 9) was more than 15 times higher (p = 0.00084) than that found in control samples (3.4, IQR 3.0–26.3, n = 11). Moreover, serum NfL concentration in scrapie sheep with clinical signs (n = 2; 75.3, 15.7 pg/ml) did not significantly (p = 0.541; t-test) differ from scrapie animals without clinical signs (n = 7; 61.0, 10.7 pg/ml). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis estimated the cut-off value of 31 pg/ml serum NfL for distinguishing scrapie-infected sheep from controls. The application of this cut-off value gives an accuracy of the test of 95% (percent error of 5.23%). These data indicate that the Simoa test for serum NfL might be a useful screening method for detecting preclinical scrapie in living sheep. Finally, the preliminary data reported here need confirmation in large and more structured studies."
https://openalex.org/W2993703962,"A single HIV-1 variant establishes infection of the host after sexual contact. Identifying the phenotypic characteristics of these Transmitted Founder (T/F) viruses is important to understand the restriction mechanisms during transmission. Langerhans cells (LCs) are the mucosal dendritic cell subset that has been shown to have a protective role in HIV-1 transmission. Immature LCs efficiently capture and degrade HIV-1 via langerin-mediated restriction. Here we have investigated the capacity of T/F HIV-1 strains to infect mucosal Langerhans cells (LCs). Notably, most T/F variants efficiently infected immature LCs derived from skin and vaginal tissue in contrast to chronic HIV-1 laboratory strains. Next we screened a panel of T/F viruses and their matched 6-month consensus sequence viruses. Interestingly most T/F variants infected immature LCs whereas donor-matched 6-month consensus sequence viruses had lost the ability to infect LCs. However, we also identified 6-month consensus sequence viruses that had retained an ability to infect LCs similar to that of the donor-matched T/F virus. Moreover, some T/F viruses and 6-month consensus sequence viruses were unable to infect immature LCs. Further analyses indicated that T/F viruses are less sensitive to langerin-mediated restriction. These data suggest that T/F HIV-1 variants have the ability to infect immature LCs, which will facilitate transmission."

In addition, the different surgery types for nonmetastatic pancreatic head cancer (PHC) or body/tail cancer (PBTC) have different prognostic influences. We analyzed the association by stage between tumor location (head vs. body/tail) and survival of nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgery.We identified stages I to III pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgery from 2004 through 2015 by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for cancer-specific survival (CSS) were obtained using Cox regression.A total of 13517 patients or 86.6% had PHC. PHC patients were more likely to have an advanced tumor stage, higher tumor grade, and more frequent and a higher number of positive lymph nodes compared with PBTC patients. The PHC patients had a worse CSS than PBTC patients (P<0.001) and were predominantly at stage I (P = 0.008) and II (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PHC was an independent prognostic factor associated with a worse CSS in pancreatic cancer patients (HR 1.132, 95% CI 1.042-1.228, P = 0.003), predominantly at stage II (HR 1.128, 95% CI 1.030-1.235, P = 0.009).At a resectable early stage, the PHC patients had a worse CSS than PBTC patients after surgery. PHC was an independent prognostic factor associated with worse survival in pancreatic cancer patients, predominantly at stage II."
https://openalex.org/W2996436809,"Acknowledgements in scientific articles can be described as miscellaneous, their content ranging from pre-formulated financial disclosure statements to personal testimonies of gratitude. To improve understanding of the context and various uses of expressions found in acknowledgements, this study analyses their content qualitatively. The most frequent noun phrases from a Web of Science acknowledgements corpus were analysed to generate 13 categories. When 3,754 acknowledgement sentences were manually coded into the categories, three distinct axes emerged: the contributions, the disclaimers, and the authorial voice. Acknowledgements constitute a space where authors can detail the division of labour within collaborators of a research project. Results also show the importance of disclaimers as part of the current scholarly communication apparatus, an aspect which was not highlighted by previous analyses and typologies of acknowledgements. Alongside formal disclaimers and acknowledgements of various contributions, there seems to remain a need for a more personal space where the authors can speak for themselves, in their own name, on matters they judge worth mentioning."
https://openalex.org/W2994854239,"We present a simple to operate microfluidic chip system that allows for the extraction of miRNAs from cells with minimal hands-on time. The chip integrates thermoelectric lysis (TEL) of cells with native gel-electrophoretic elution (GEE) of released nucleic acids and uses non-toxic reagents while requiring a sample volume of only 5 μl. These properties as well as the fast process duration of 180 seconds make the system an ideal candidate to be part of fully integrated point-of-care applications for e.g. the diagnosis of cancerous tissue. GEE was characterized in comparison to state-of-the-art silica column (SC) based RNA recovery using the mirVana kit (Ambion) as a reference. A synthetic miRNA (miR16) as well as a synthetic snoRNA (SNORD48) were subjected to both GEE and SC. Subsequent detection by stem-loop RT-qPCR demonstrated a higher yield for miRNA recovery by GEE. SnoRNA recovery performance was found to be equal for GEE and SC, indicating yield dependence on RNA length. Coupled operation of the chip (TEL + GEE) was characterized using serial dilutions of 5 to 500 MCF7 cancer cells in suspension. Samples were split and cells were subjected to either on-chip extraction or SC. Eluted miRNAs were then detected by stem-loop RT-qPCR without any further pre-processing. The extraction yield from cells was found to be up to ~200-fold higher for the chip system under non-denaturing conditions. The ratio of eluted miRNAs is shown to be dependent on the degree of complexation with miRNA associated proteins by comparing miRNAs purified by GEE from heat-shock and proteinase-K based lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2995214385,"To assess and compare the prevalence of persistent hepatic abnormalities, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or hepatic fibrosis, among perinatally HIV-monoinfected Asian adolescents with history of abnormal hepatic enzymes to those without, using noninvasive diagnostic tools. A multicenter cohort study was conducted in Thailand and Indonesia. Adolescents aged 10-25 years who were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), had virologic suppression (HIV RNA<400 copies/mL within the past 6 months), and had no history of chronic hepatitis B/C infection were enrolled. Participants were pre-classified into 2 subgroups (1:1 ratio) as participants with history of elevated versus normal aminotransferase enzymes. NAFLD was defined as hepatic steatosis (any severity) evaluated by liver ultrasonography. Significant hepatic fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness ≥7.4 kPa evaluated by transient elastography. Participants who met the criteria for protocol-defined NAFLD and/or hepatic fibrosis were re-assessed to evaluate disease progression (persistent versus transient hepatic abnormalities) at one year later. Of 120 participants, 62 (51.7%) were male, 7 (5.8%) had central obesity, and 19 (15.8%) had insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] >3.16). At enrollment, the median age and duration of ART (IQR) were 17.0 (14.6-19.2) years and 10.5 (7.1-12.0) years, respectively. Persistent hepatic abnormalities were identified in 5/60 participants listed in the group having history of elevated aminotransferases, corresponding to the prevalence of 8.3% (95% CI: 2.8-18.4%), whereas none (0/60) were among the group having history of normal hepatic enzymes. All 5 participants had persistent aminotransferase elevation (≥2 episodes within the past 12 months). Baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >30 U/L (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 29.1; 95% CI: 1.7-511.8), and HOMA-IR >3.16 (aOR: 17.9; 95% CI: 1.1-289.7) were independently associated with persistent hepatic abnormalities. Among perinatally HIV-monoinfected Asian adolescents with history of elevated aminotransferase enzymes, persistent hepatic abnormalities are not uncommon. Screening for liver complications by noninvasive diagnostic tools might be considered in at risk individuals, including those with persistent ALT elevation and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2995599513,"Previous research has suggested that the short (S)-allele of the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) may confer “differential susceptibility” to environmental impact with regard to the expression of personality traits, depressivity and impulsivity. However, little is known about the role of 5-HTTLPR concerning the association between childhood adversity and empathy. Here, we analyzed samples of 137 healthy participants and 142 individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) focusing on the 5-HTTLPR genotype (S/L-carrier) and A/G SNP (rs25531), in relation to childhood maltreatment and empathy traits. Whereas no between-group difference in 5-HTTLPR genotype distribution emerged, the S-allele selectively moderated the impact of childhood maltreatment on empathic perspective taking, whereby low scores in childhood trauma were associated with superior perspective taking. In contrast, L-homozygotes seemed to be largely unresponsive to variation in environmental conditions in relation to empathy, suggesting that the S-allele confers “differential susceptibility”. Moreover, a moderation analysis and tests for differential susceptibility yielded similar results when transcriptional activity of the serotonin transporter gene was taken into account. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the S-allele of the 5-HTTLPR is responsive to early developmental contingencies for “better and worse”, i.e. conferring genetic plasticity, especially with regard to processes involving emotional resonance."
https://openalex.org/W2995829145,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a zoonotic pathogen which may cause tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in humans and animals. More than 10,000 cases of TBE are reported annually in Europe and Asia. However, the knowledge on TBE in animals is limited. Co-infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and louping ill virus (LIV), a close relative to TBEV, in sheep has been found to cause more severe disease than single LIV or A. phagocytophilum infection. The aim of this study was to investigate TBEV infection and co-infection of TBEV and A. phagocytophilum in lambs. A total of 30 lambs, aged five to six months, were used. The experiment was divided into two. In part one, pre- and post-infection of TBEV and A. phagocytophilum was investigated (group 1 to 4), while in part two, co-infection of TBEV and A. phagocytophilum was investigated (group 5 and 6). Blood samples were drawn, and rectal temperature was measured daily. Lambs inoculated with TBEV displayed no clinical symptoms, but had a short or non-detectable viremia by reverse transcription real-time PCR. All lambs inoculated with TBEV developed neutralizing TBEV antibodies. Our study is in accordance with previous studies, and indicates that TBEV rarely causes symptomatic disease in ruminants. All lambs inoculated with A. phagocytophilum developed fever and clinical symptoms of tick-borne fever, and A. phagocytophilum was present in the blood samples of all infected lambs, shown by qPCR. Significantly higher mean TBEV titer was detected in the group co-infected with TBEV and A. phagocytophilum, compared to the groups pre- or post-infected with A. phagocytophilum. These results indicate that co-infection with TBEV and A. phagocytophilum in sheep stimulates an increased TBEV antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W2996017951,"Lebiasinidae is a small fish family composed by miniature to small-sized fishes with few cytogenetic data (most of them limited to descriptions of diploid chromosome numbers), thus preventing any evolutionary comparative studies at the chromosomal level. In the present study, we are providing, the first cytogenetic data for the red spotted tetra, Copeina guttata, including the standard karyotype, C-banding, repetitive DNA mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), providing chromosomal patterns and novel insights into the karyotype differentiation of the family. Males and females share diploid chromosome number 2n = 42 and karyotype composed of 2 metacentric (m), 4 submetacentric (sm) and 36 subtelocentric to acrocentric (st-a) chromosomes. Blocks of constitutive heterochromatin were observed in the centromeric and interstitial regions of several chromosomes, in addition to a remarkably large distal block, heteromorphic in size, which fully corresponded with the 18S rDNA sites in the fourth chromosomal pair. This overlap was confirmed by 5S/18S rDNA dual-color FISH. On the other hand, 5S rDNA clusters were situated in the long and short arms of the 2nd and 15th pairs, respectively. No sex-linked karyotype differences were revealed by male/female CGH experiments. The genomic probes from other two lebiasinid species, Lebiasina melanoguttata and Pyrrhulina brevis, showed positive hybridization signals only in the NOR region in the genome of C. guttata. We demonstrated that karyotype diversification in lebiasinids was accompanied by a series of structural and numeric chromosome rearrangements of different types, including particularly fusions and fissions."
https://openalex.org/W2996492475,"Hyperglycemia is a hallmark of diabetes, which is associated with protein glycation and misfolding, impaired cell metabolism and altered signaling pathways result in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). We previously showed that L-lysine (Lys) inhibits the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, and protects diabetic rats and type 2 diabetic patients against diabetic complications. Here, we studied some molecular aspects of the Lys protective role in high glucose (HG)-induced toxicity in C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cell lines were differentiated into myotubes and adipocytes, respectively. Then, they were incubated with normal or high glucose (HG) concentrations in the absence/presence of Lys (1 mM). To investigate the role of HG and/or Lys on cell apoptosis, oxidative status, unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, we used the MTT assay and flow cytometry, spectrophotometry and fluorometry, RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. In both cell lines, HG significantly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis, accompanying with the significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore, the spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), at both mRNA and protein levels, the phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (p-eIf2α), and the Light chain 3 (LC3)II/LC3I ratio was also significantly increased. Lys alone had no significant effects on most of these parameters; but, treatment with HG plus Lys returned them all to, or close to, the normal values. The results indicated the protective role of Lys against glucotoxicity induced by HG in C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2996499215,"Morphological assessment at defined developmental stages is the most important method to select viable embryos for transfer and cryopreservation. Timing of different developmental stages in embryo development has been shown to correlate with its potential to develop into a blastocyst. However, improvements in pregnancy rates by using time-lapse techniques have been difficult to validate scientifically. Therefore, there is a need for new methods, preferably non-invasive methods based on metabolomics, genomics and proteomics, to improve the evaluation of embryo quality even further. The aim of this study was to investigate if different levels of caspase-3 and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), secreted by the embryo into the culture media, can be used as biomarkers of embryo quality. In this study, a total of 334 samples of culture media were collected from in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments at three different clinics. Protein analysis of the culture media was performed using multiplex proximity extension protein analysis to detect levels of caspase-3 and HRG in the embryo secretome. Protein levels were compared in secretome samples from high- and low-quality blastocysts and embryos that became arrested during development. Correlation between protein levels and time to morula formation was also analyzed. Furthermore, protein levels in secretomes from day-2 cultured embryos were compared on the basis of whether or not pregnancy was achieved. The results showed that caspase-3 levels were lower in secretomes from high-quality vs. low-quality blastocysts and those that became arrested (p ≤ 0.05 for both). In addition, higher HRG levels correlated with a shorter time to morula formation (p ≤ 0.001). Caspase-3 levels were also lower in secretomes from day-2 cultured embryos resulting in a pregnancy vs. those that did not (p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, it was shown that caspase-3 might be used as a marker for predicting potential success rate after transfer of day-2 cultured embryos, where a caspase-3 cutoff level of 0.02 gave a prediction probability of 68% (p = 0.038). In conclusion, in future prediction models, levels of caspase-3 and HRG might be used as potential markers of embryo quality, and secreted caspase-3 levels could to some extent predict the outcome after transfer of day-2 cultured embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2994876351,"Organisms are frequently exposed to mixtures of heavy metals because of their persistence in the environment. The mixture toxicity of heavy metals should therefore be evaluated to perform a rational environmental risk assessment for organisms. In this study, we determined the inhibition toxicity of five heavy metals (Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Fe3+ and Cr3+) and their binary mixtures to Photobacterium phosphoreum (P. phosphoreum). We obtained the following results: (1) the order of individual toxicity was Zn2+>Cu2+>Co2+>Cr3+>Fe3+, and (2) different combined effects (additive, synergistic and antagonistic) were observed in the binary mixtures of heavy metals, with toxicity unit (TU) values ranging from 0.15 to 3.50. To predict the mixture toxicity of heavy metals, we derived the ion characteristic parameters of heavy metal mixtures and explored the ion-characteristic-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model (R2 = 0.750, Q2 = 0.649). The developed QSAR model indicated that the mixture toxicity of heavy metals is related to the change in ionization potential ((ΔIP)mix), the first hydrolysis constant (log(KOH)mix) and the formation constant value ()."
https://openalex.org/W2995180903,"Infant temperament is theorized to lay the foundation for adult personality; however, many questions remain regarding personality in infancy, including the number of dimensions, extent to which they are adult-like, and their relation to other outcomes, such as mental and physical health. Here we tested whether adult-like personality dimensions are already present in infancy in a nonhuman primate species. We measured personality and subjective well-being in 7-month-old rhesus macaques (N = 55) using the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire and Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire, both of which were developed for adult primates based on human measures. Multiple human raters, who provided infants with daily care since birth, independently rated each infant. We found high interrater reliability. Results from a parallel analysis and scree plot indicated a five component structure, which, using principal components analysis, we found to be comprised of dimensions relating to Openness (e.g., curiosity, inquisitive, playfulness), Assertiveness (e.g., dominance, bullying, aggressive), Anxiety (e.g., vigilance, fearful), Friendliness (e.g., sociable, affectionate, sympathetic), and Intellect (e.g., organized, not erratic). These components are largely analogous to those in adult macaques, suggesting remarkably stable structural personality components across the lifespan. Infant macaques’ subjective well-being positively correlates with Openness and Assertiveness and negatively correlated with Anxiety, similar to findings in adult macaques and other primates. Together, these findings suggest that, in macaques, infant personality dimensions may be conceptually related to adult personality and challenge the view that infant temperament may be disorganized and not as meaningful as adult personality. Further research is necessary to explore the antecedents, predictive validity, and stability of these personality components across situations and with development."

https://openalex.org/W2996632140,"Introduction Young people worldwide are often reticent to access family planning services from public health facilities: instead, they choose to get contraception from private, retail pharmacies. In Kenya, certain contraceptives are available in pharmacies: these include injectables, which can be dispensed but not administered, according national guidelines. However, Kenya struggles with enforcement of its pharmacy regulations and addressing illegal activity. Therefore, in this qualitative study, we assessed private pharmacies as an existing source of injectable contraception for young Kenyans (age 18–24), and investigated the perceived quality of service provision. Methods This study used: focus group discussions (6) with young community members; in-depth interviews (18) with youth who had purchased contraception from pharmacies; key informant interviews with pharmacy personnel and pharmacy stakeholders (25); and a mystery shopper (visiting 45 pharmacies). Results The study found that for injectable contraception, private pharmacies had expanded to service provision, and pharmacy personnel’s roles had transcended formal or informal training previously received–young people could both purchase and be injected in many pharmacies. Pharmacies were perceived to lack consistent quality or strong regulation, resulting in young clients, pharmacy personnel, and regulators being concerned about illegal activity. Participants’ suggestions to improve pharmacy service quality and regulation compliance focused on empowering consumers to demand quality service; strengthening regulatory mechanisms; expanding training opportunities to personnel in private pharmacies; and establishing a quality-based ‘brand’ for pharmacies. Discussion Kenya’s recent commitments to universal health coverage and interest in revising pharmacy policy provide an opportunity to improve pharmacy quality. Multi-pronged initiatives with both public and private partners are needed to improve pharmacy practice, update and enforce regulations, and educate the public. Additionally, the advent of self-administrable injectables present a new possible role for pharmacies, and could offer young clients a clean, discreet place to self-inject, with pharmacy personnel serving as educators and dispensers."

In this study, we conducted a segmentation analysis of a large sample of older people based on their bio-psycho-social-needs and functioning. The aim of this study was to clarify differences in health care use and costs of the elderly in Germany. Methods Data was derived from the 8-year follow-up of the ESTHER study—a German epidemiological study of the elderly population. Trained medical doctors visited n = 3124 participants aged 57 to 84 years in their home. Bio-psycho-social health care needs were assessed using the INTERMED for the Elderly (IM-E) interview. Further information was measured using questionnaires or assessment scales (Barthel index, Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ) etc.). The segmentation analysis applied a factor mixture model (FMM) that combined both a confirmatory factor analysis and a latent class analysis. Results In total, n = 3017 persons were included in the study. Results of the latent class analysis indicated that a five-cluster-model best fit the data. The largest cluster (48%) can be described as healthy, one cluster (13.9%) shows minor physical complaints and higher social support, while the third cluster (24.3%) includes persons with only a few physical and psychological difficulties (“minor physical and psychological complaints”). One of the profiles (10.5%) showed high and complex bio-psycho-social health care needs (“complex needs”) while another profile (2.5%) can be labelled as “frail”. Mean values of all psychosomatic variables—including the variable health care costs—gradually increased over the five clusters. Use of mental health care was comparatively low in the more burdened clusters. In the profiles “minor physical and psychological complaints” and “complex needs”, only half of the persons suffering from a mental disorder were treated by a mental health professional; in the frail cluster, only a third of those with a depression or anxiety disorder received mental health care. Conclusions The segmentation of the older people of this study sample led to five different clusters that vary profoundly regarding their bio-psycho-social needs. Results indicate that elderly persons with complex bio-psycho-social needs do not receive appropriate mental health care."
https://openalex.org/W2995749651,"A multidisciplinary study (geomorphology, sedimentology and palynology) shows that the landscapes of the southwest coast of Corsica have been deeply modified by humans and the climate since 3000 BC. Significant and rapid landscape transformations are recorded between the Chalcolithic and the Middle Bronze Ages (3000-1300 BC). Several major (2.2 ka BC, 1.2 ka BC) and local (3000 BC) detrital events affected the Taravo Lower Valley in relation to global climatic changes and anthropic activities. The vegetation dynamics since 3000 BC show alternating phases of agriculture and abandonment until the complete disappearance of the original forest populations in the vicinity of the Canniccia Marshes. An early phase of Olea cultivation is recorded between 2900 and 2300 BC. Plant macro-remains indicate that cereals, vine and many species of Fabaceae were cultivated in the nearby of the archaeological sites during the middle to the late Chalcolithic Age. The event of 2.2 ka BC corresponds to an abandonment phase in the lower Taravo Valley. Pastoralism dominated agricultural activities between 2200 and 1700 BC. During Roman times, agriculture is characterized by olive and vine cultivation. A new peak of pastoralism and the cultivation of Castanea are noted during invasion times (500 to 1000 AD), showing that invasions didn't disturb agricultural activities in the Taravo Valley. During the Pisa Period (end of the 9th C. to then end of 13th C. AD), pastoralism declined and vine and cereals were cultivated in the very nearby of the Canniccia Marshes. During the Genoa Period upwards (end of the 13th C. to 1769 AD), a decline in agriculture and a recrudescence of the forest (maquis and pine) are recorded, leading to the settlement of a present-day vegetal landscape dominated by an Erica arborea maquis."

In particular, lung cancer diagnosis would benefit from segmentations reaching most distal airways. We present a method that combines descriptors of bronchi local appearance and graph global structural analysis to fine-tune thresholds on the descriptors adapted for each bronchial level. We have compared our method to the top performers of the EXACT09 challenge and to a commercial software for biopsy planning evaluated in an own-collected data-base of high resolution CT scans acquired under different breathing conditions. Results on EXACT09 data show that our method provides a high leakage reduction with minimum loss in airway detection. Results on our data-base show the reliability across varying breathing conditions and a competitive performance for biopsy planning compared to a commercial solution."
https://openalex.org/W2995365509,"The aim of our study was to elucidate the landscapes of genetic alterations of TSC1 and TSC2 as well as other possible non-TSC1/2 in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) patients. Sixty-one Chinese LAM patients' clinical information was collected. Tumor biopsies and matched leukocytes from these patients were retrospectively analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS), chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Eighty-six TSC1/2 variants were identified in 46 of the 61 LAM patients (75.4%) in which TSC2 and TSC1 variants were 88.37% and 11.63% respectively. The 86 variants are composed of (i) 52 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (including 30 novel variants), (ii) 23 indels (including 21deletions, and 2 insertions), (iii) a germline duplication of exon 31-42 of TSC2, (iv) a 2.68 Mb somatic duplication containing TSC2, and (v) 9 regions with copy-neutral loss of heterogeneity (CN-LOHs) present only in the LAM patients with single TSC1/2 mutations. Sixty-one non-TSC1/2 variants in 31 genes were identified in 37 LAM patients. Combined applications of different techniques are necessary to achieve maximal detection rate of TSC1/2 variants in LAM patients. Thirty novel TSC1/2 variants expands the spectrum of TSC1/2 in LAM patients. Identification of 61 non-TSC1/2 variants suggests that alternative genes might have contributed to the initiation and progression of LAM."

The interdisciplinary theory of statistical learning examines statistical learning as a mechanism of human learning. This study investigated how TP distribution and conditional entropy in TP of the melody and bass line in music interact with each other, using the highest and lowest pitches in Beethoven’s piano sonatas and Johann Sebastian Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier. Results for the two composers were similar. First, the results detected specific statistical characteristics that are unique to each melody and bass line as well as general statistical characteristics that are shared between the melody and bass line. Additionally, a correlation of the conditional entropies sampled from the TP distribution could be detected between the melody and bass line. This suggests that the variability of entropies interacts between the melody and bass line. In summary, this study suggested that TP distributions and the entropies of the melody and bass line interact with but are partly independent of each other."
https://openalex.org/W2996430217,"Leishmaniasis encompass a group of infectious parasitic diseases occurring in 97 endemic countries where over one billion people live in areas at risk of infection. It is in the World Health Organization list of neglected diseases and it is considered a serious public health problem, with more than 20,000 deaths a year and high morbidity. Infection by protozoa from the genus Leishmania can cause several forms of the disease, which may vary from a self-healing ulcer to fatal visceral infection. Leishmania species, as well as host immune response and genetics can modulate the course of the disease. Leishmania sp are obligatory intracellular parasites that have macrophages as their main host cell. Depending on the activation phenotype, these cells may have distinct roles in disease development, acting in parasite control or proliferation. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to analyze Leishmania amazonensis infection in primary macrophage cells obtained from mice with two distinct genetic backgrounds, ie. different susceptibility to the infection; evaluating the cause for that difference. After infection, peritoneal macrophages from the resistant C3H/He strain presented lower parasite load when compared to susceptible BALB/c macrophages. The same was also true when cells received a Th2 stimulus after infection, but the difference was abrogated under Th1 stimulus. Nitric oxide production and arginase activity was different between the strains under Th1 or Th2 stimulus, respectively, but iNOS inhibition was unable to suppress C3H/He resistance. Hydrogen peroxide production was also higher in C3H/He than BALB/c under Th1 stimulus, but it could not account for differences in susceptibility. These results led us to conclude that, although they have an important role in parasite control, neither NO nor H2O2 production can explain C3H/He resistance to infection. Other studies are needed to uncover different mechanisms of resistance/susceptibility to L. amazonensis."
https://openalex.org/W2996635247,"Resource availability during development shapes not only adult phenotype but also the phenotype of subsequent offspring. When resources are absent and periods of starvation occur in early life, such developmental stress often influences key life-history traits in a way that benefits individuals and their offspring when facing further bouts of starvation. Here we investigated the impacts of different starvation regimes during larval development on life-history traits and measures of consumption in the turnip sawfly, Athalia rosae (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae). We then assessed whether offspring of starved and non-starved parents differed in their own life-history if reared in conditions that either matched that of their parents or were a mismatch. Early life starvation effects were more pronounced within than across generations in A. rosae, with negative impacts on adult body mass and increases in developmental time, but no effects on adult longevity in either generation. We found some evidence of higher growth rates in larvae having experienced starvation, although this did not ameliorate the overall negative effect of larval starvation on adult size. However, further work is necessary to disentangle the effects of larval size and instar from those of starvation treatment. Finally, we found weak evidence for transgenerational effects on larval growth, with intra-generational larval starvation experience being more decisive for life-history traits. Our study demonstrates that intra-generational effects of starvation are stronger than transgenerational effects on life-history traits and consumption measures in A. rosae."
https://openalex.org/W2995736222,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing an epidemic of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a result of a rapid epidemiological transition. Little is known about the admission for CVD and outcome in rural and semi-urban settings in Cameroon in this era of epidemiological transition. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and the pattern of CVD admissions in the South West region of Cameroon.This retrospective descriptive study included all adult patients admitted for CVD in the medical unit of the Buea Regional Hospital between Jan 2016 and December 2017.Out of the 3140 patients admitted, 499(15.9%) had CVD. There were 304(60.9%) females. The mean age was 58.7±16.2 years. There was no age difference between men and women (59.7 years vs 58.1years, p = 0.29). The most commonly affected age group was those aged 50-59 years (22%). Heart failure (38.5%), stroke (33.3%) and uncontrolled hypertension (22.4%) were the most prevalent CVDs. The length of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 37 days with a median length of hospital stay of 7 days. In-hospital case fatality was 78(15.8%). Mortality was higher in women compared to men (9% vs 7%, p = 0.43). The case fatality for stroke was higher compared to case fatality for heart failure (21.7% vs 16.7%, p = 0.23).CVDs are a common cause of hospital admission in this semi-urban setting, dominated by heart failure. Women were disproportionately affected and it was associated with high mortality. Prevention, early detection and management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease are imperative given the growing burden of CVD in SSA to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality."

Backwashing pressure difference and backwashing time for two screen filters with one geometry and two different screens (178 μm and 124 μm) using two water qualities (tap water and sand–water mixture) were studied in a total of 88 runs (42 runs for tap water, 22 and 24 filtration cycles for sand–water mixture and backwashing, respectively). The backwashing pressure difference and backwashing time were calculated using the experimental data, and the results were largely in the range of measured values. Three constraint conditions (flowrate, sand condition and filtration time) of backwashing pressure difference were analysed, and the optimal values of backwashing pressure difference were given as 60.0 and 70.0 kPa for 178 μm and 124 μm filters, respectively. The backwashing time of the screen filter should be an optimal value that ensures that the pressure difference between the internal and external surfaces of the screen decreased to the initial value, and the sand concentration of the backwashed outlet decreased to a small, stable value. Based on the results of the backwashing experiment and prototype observation, the optimal backwashing time was given as 30 to 45 s for both screen filters."
https://openalex.org/W2994631257,"Robots are used for language tutoring increasingly often, and commonly programmed to display non-verbal communicative cues such as eye gaze and pointing during robot-child interactions. With a human speaker, children rely more strongly on non-verbal cues (pointing) than on verbal cues (labeling) if these cues are in conflict. However, we do not know how children weigh the non-verbal cues of a robot. Here, we assessed whether four- to six-year-old children (i) differed in their weighing of non-verbal cues (pointing, eye gaze) and verbal cues provided by a robot versus a human; (ii) weighed non-verbal cues differently depending on whether these contrasted with a novel or familiar label; and (iii) relied differently on a robot's non-verbal cues depending on the degree to which they attributed human-like properties to the robot. The results showed that children generally followed pointing over labeling, in line with earlier research. Children did not rely more strongly on the non-verbal cues of a robot versus those of a human. Regarding pointing, children who perceived the robot as more human-like relied on pointing more strongly when it contrasted with a novel label versus a familiar label, but children who perceived the robot as less human-like did not show this difference. Regarding eye gaze, children relied more strongly on the gaze cue when it contrasted with a novel versus a familiar label, and no effect of anthropomorphism was found. Taken together, these results show no difference in the degree to which children rely on non-verbal cues of a robot versus those of a human and provide preliminary evidence that differences in anthropomorphism may interact with children's reliance on a robot's non-verbal behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2995288358,"We evaluated to define the clinically significant chronic nausea in general population and to assess the prevalence of chronic unexplained nausea after exclusion of organic causes through the meticulous medical examination. Two phase studies were conducted. In phase 1, telephone survey was conducted to define the clinically significant nausea in 5000 representative subjects for a general population. Clinically significant nausea was identified by lowered quality of life if the frequency was 'more than one day per week'. Its prevalence was 1.6% (1.4-1.8%) and about 90% of nausea was not accompanied with vomiting. In phase 2, 5096 participants in a comprehensive health-screening cohort were enrolled. We investigated demographics, gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization symptoms and health related quality of life using validated questionnaire. All participants underwent meticulous medical examinations including endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, thyroid function test, and blood testing. Among a total of 5096 subjects (men 51.8%, mean age 47.5 ± 10.0 years), organic diseases associated with chronic nausea were reflux esophagitis, duodenal ulcer and hyperthyroidism. The prevalence of chronic unexplained nausea was 0.6% (95% CI 0.4-0.8%) and there were significant overlap with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. HRQoL is significantly lower in people with nausea occurring 'more than one day per week' in a general population. Most chronic nausea was not accompanied with vomiting. Chronic unexplained nausea is uncommon affecting only 0.6% of the population but are more likely to report functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2995972396,"Here, we analyzed the fast-twitch muscle of juvenile Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu) submitted to prolonged fasting (30d) and refeeding (6h, 24h, 48h and 30d). We measured the relative rate of weight and length increase (RRIlength and RRIweight), performed shotgun proteomic analysis and did Western blotting for PVALB after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding. We assessed the gene expression of igf-1, mafbx and pvalb after 30d of fasting and after 6h, 24h, 48h and 30d of refeeding. We performed a bioinformatic analysis to predict miRNAs that possibly control parvalbumin expression. After fasting, RRIlength, RRIweight and igf-1 expression decreased, while the mafbx expression increased, which suggest that prolonged fasting caused muscle atrophy. After 6h and 24h of refeeding, mafbx was not changed and igf-1 was downregulated, while after 48h of refeeding mafbx was downregulated and igf-1 was not changed. After 30d of refeeding, RRIlength and RRIweight were increased and igf-1 and mafbx expression were not changed. Proteomic analysis identified 99 proteins after 30d of fasting and 71 proteins after 30d of refeeding, of which 23 and 17, respectively, were differentially expressed. Most of these differentially expressed proteins were related to cytoskeleton, muscle contraction, and metabolism. Among these, parvalbumin (PVALB) was selected for further validation. The analysis showed that pvalb mRNA was downregulated after 6h and 24h of refeeding, but was not changed after 30d of fasting or 48h and 30d of refeeding. The Western blotting confirmed that PVALB protein was downregulated after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding. The downregulation of the protein and the unchanged expression of the mRNA after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding suggest a post-transcriptional regulation of PVALB. Our miRNA analysis predicted 444 unique miRNAs that may target pvalb. In conclusion, muscle atrophy and partial compensatory growth caused by prolonged fasting followed by refeeding affected the muscle proteome and PVALB expression."
https://openalex.org/W2995147642,"Background Despite the high burden of adverse adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes, it has remained a low political priority in Kenya. We examined factors that have shaped the lack of current political prioritization of adolescent SRH service provision. Methods We used the Shiffman and Smith policy framework consisting of four categories—actor power, ideas, political contexts, and issue characteristics—to analyse factors that have shaped political prioritization of adolescent SRH. We undertook semi-structured interviews with 14 members of adolescent SRH networks between February and April 2019 at the national level and conducted thematic analysis of the interviews. Findings Several factors hinder the attainment of political priority for adolescent SRH in Kenya. On actor power, the adolescent SRH community was diverse and united in adoption of international norms and policies, but lacked policy entrepreneurs to provide strong leadership, and policy windows were often missed. Regarding ideas, community members lacked consensus on a cohesive public positioning of the problem. On issue characteristics, the perception of adolescents as lacking political power made politicians reluctant to act on the existing data on the severity of adolescent SRH. There was also a lack of consensus on the nature of interventions to be implemented. Pertaining to political contexts, sectoral funding by donors and government treasury brought about tension within the different government ministries resulting in siloed approaches, lack of coordination and overall inefficiency. However, the SRH community has several strengths that augur well for future political support. These include the diverse multi-sectoral background of its members, commitment to improving adolescent SRH, and the potential to link with other health priorities such as maternal health and HIV/AIDS. Conclusion In order to increase political attention to adolescent SRH in Kenya, there is an urgent need for policy actors to: 1) create a more cohesive community of advocates across sectors, 2) develop a clearer public positioning of adolescent SRH, 3) agree on a set of precise approaches that will resonate with the political system, and 4) identify and nurture policy entrepreneurs to facilitate the coupling of adolescent SRH with potential solutions when windows of opportunity arise."
https://openalex.org/W2995186069,"Collective migration plays critical roles in animal development, physiological events, and cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of collective cell migration are not well understood. Drosophila border cells represent an excellent in vivo genetic model to study collective cell migration and identify novel regulatory genes for cell migration. Using the Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) system, we screened 240 P-element insertion lines to identify essential genes for border cell migration. Two genes were uncovered, including dlg5 (discs large 5) and CG31689. Further analysis showed that Dlg5 regulates the apical-basal polarity and cluster integrity in border cell clusters. Dlg5 is enriched in lateral surfaces between border cells and central polar cells but also shows punctate localization between border cells. We found that the distribution of Dlg5 in border cell clusters is regulated by Armadillo. Structure-function analysis revealed that the N-terminal Coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal PDZ3-PDZ4-SH3-GUK domains but not the PDZ1-PDZ2 domains of Dlg5 are required for BC migration. The Coiled-coil domain and the PDZ4-SH3-GUK domains are critical for Dlg5's cell surface localization in border cell clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2995764322,"Vermicomposting has been recommended as an eco-friendly method to transform organic waste into nutrient resources with minimum energy input. However, odor and pest issues associated with this method limit the use of vermicomposting, especially in indoor conditions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of applying hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to deodorize the vermicomposting process and improve the breeding environment for earthworms (Eisenia fetida). The deodorization performance of HOCl was compared by measuring the amount of ammonia (NH3) and amine (R-NH2) released from the decaying process of two types of food waste: HOCl-treated (HTW) waste and non-treated waste (NTW). The total and individual weights of earthworms in the waste treated with HOCl was measured to evaluate the impact on earthworm reproduction after applying HOCl. The results showed that HOCl application could reduce NH3 by 40% and R-NH2 by 80%, and increase the earthworm population size and total weight by up to 29% and 92%, respectively, compared to the control group. These results suggest that HOCl application is potentially an efficient method to control the odor and to boost earthworm reproduction and thus facilitate vermicomposting for improved food waste treatment and environmental quality."
https://openalex.org/W2995166826,"Slag, waste from the steel-making process, contains large amounts of calcium, magnesium, iron and other heavy metals. Because of its composition, high pH and low water retention ability, slag is considered inhospitable to plants. Nevertheless, the spontaneously generated plant communities on slag are surprisingly diverse, but the assembly and structure of such communities are poorly studied. Previous studies suggest reduced rates of succession due to low growth rate and slow accumulation of topsoil. To investigate whether slag communities display similar patterns, we used two former industrial sites on the South Side of Chicago, IL, both with high pH (8–9.2) sand content (80%) and calcium concentration (> 9000 ppm). We removed all vegetation from both slag and non-slag plots to test whether recovery differed over one growing season (4 months). To directly assess plant growth, selected focal species were planted on both sites and harvested. We show that recovery from removal differed at slag and non-slag sites: the recruitment process on slag, measured by percent vegetative cover and number of species in plots, was significantly slower at 6–8 weeks of the manipulation and beyond, suggesting a potential stage-dependent effect of slag on plant growth. Certain slag plots recorded less cover than non-slag plots by >30% at maximum difference. Functional trait analysis found that graminoid and early successional species preferentially colonized slag. Overall, slag plots recovered more slowly from disturbance, suggesting a slow succession process that would hinder natural recovery. However, slag also has the potential to serve as plant refugia, hosting flora of analogous habitats native to the area: one of our industrial sites hosts nearly 80% native species with two species of highest Floristic Quality Index (10). Restoration efforts should be informed by the slow process of natural recovery, while post-industrial sites in urban areas serve as potential native plant refugia."
https://openalex.org/W2995340091,"Integrating dynamic systems modeling and machine learning generates an exploratory nonlinear solution for analyzing dynamical systems-based data. Applying dynamical systems theory to the machine learning solution further provides a pathway to interpret the results. Using random forest models as an illustrative example, these models were able to recover the temporal dynamics of time series data simulated using a modified Cusp Catastrophe Monte Carlo. By extracting the points of no change (set points) and the predicted changes surrounding the set points, it is possible to characterize the topology of the system, both for systems governed by global equation forms and complex adaptive systems. RESULTS: The model for the simulation was able to recover the cusp catastrophe (i.e. the qualitative changes in the dynamics of the system) even when applied to data that have a significant amount of error variance. To further illustrate the approach, a real-world accelerometer example was examined, where the model differentiated between movement dynamics patterns by identifying set points related to cyclic motion during walking and attraction during stair climbing. These example findings suggest that integrating machine learning with dynamical systems modeling provides a viable means for classifying distinct temporal patterns, even when there is no governing equation for the nonlinear dynamics. Results of these integrated models yield solutions with both a prediction of where the system is going next and a decomposition of the topological features implied by the temporal dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2995439498,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), predominantly caused by Fusarium graminearum, has been categorized into three chemotypes depending on the major mycotoxin produced. The three mycotoxins, namely, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) and nivalenol (NIV) also determine their aggressiveness and response to fungicides. Furthermore, prevalence of these chemotypes changes over time and dynamic changes in chemotypes population in the field have been observed. The objective of this study was to identify spike culture derived variants (SCDV) exhibiting resistance to multiple chemotypes of F. graminearum. First, the optimal volume of inoculum for point inoculation of the spikelets was determined using the susceptible AC Nanda wheat genotype. Fifteen μL of 105 macroconidia/mL was deemed optimal based on FHB disease severity assessment with four chemotypes. Following optimal inoculum volume determination, five chemotypes (Carman-NIV, Carman-705-2-3-ADON, M9-07-1-3-ADON, M1-07-2-15-ADON and China-Fg809-15-ADON) were used to point inoculate AC Nanda spikelets to confirm the mycotoxin produced and FHB severity during infection. Upon confirmation of the mycotoxins produced by the chemotypes, 55 SCDV were utilized to evaluate FHB severity and mycotoxin concentrations. Of the 55 SCDV, five (213.4, 244.1, 245.6, 250.2 and 252.3) resistant lines were identified with resistance to multiple chemotypes and are currently being utilized in a breeding program to develop wheat varieties with improved FHB resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2996389909,"Fetal yawning is of interest because of its clinical, developmental and theoretical implications. However, the methodological challenges of identifying yawns from ultrasonographic scans have not been systematically addressed. We report two studies that examined the temporal dynamics of yawning in preterm neonates comparable in developmental level to fetuses observed in ultrasound studies (about 31 weeks PMA). In Study 1 we tested the reliability and construct validity of the only quantitative measure for identifying fetal yawns in the literature, by comparing its scores with a more detailed behavioral coding system (The System for Coding Perinatal Behavior, SCPB) adapted from the comprehensive, anatomically based Facial Action Coding System for Infants and Young Children (Baby FACS). The previously published measure yielded good reliability but poor specificity, resulting in over-representation of yawns. In Study 2 we developed and tested a new machine learning system based on support vector machines (SVM) for identifying yawns. The system displayed excellent specificity and sensitivity, proving it to be a reliable and valid tool for identifying yawns in fetuses and neonates. This achievement represents a first step towards a fully automated system for identifying yawns in the perinatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2995066446,"In striated muscles, molecular filaments are largely composed of long protein chains with extensive arrays of identically folded domains, referred to as ""beads-on-a-string"". It remains a largely unresolved question how these domains have developed a unique molecular profile such that each carries out a distinct function without false-positive readout. This study focuses on the M-band segment of the sarcomeric protein titin, which comprises ten identically folded immunoglobulin domains. Comparative analysis of high-resolution structures of six of these domains ‒ M1, M3, M4, M5, M7, and M10 ‒ reveals considerable structural diversity within three distinct loops and a non-conserved pattern of exposed cysteines. Our data allow to structurally interpreting distinct pathological readouts that result from titinopathy-associated variants. Our findings support general principles that could be used to identify individual structural/functional profiles of hundreds of identically folded protein domains within the sarcomere and other densely crowded cellular environments."
https://openalex.org/W2996131214,"In this work, we describe a systematic comparative genomic analysis of promiscuous domains in genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. A quantitative measure of domain promiscuity, the weighted domain architecture score (WDAS), was used and applied to 1317 domains in 1320 genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. A functional analysis associated with the WDAS per genome showed that 18 of 50 functional categories were identified as significantly enriched in the promiscuous domains; in particular, small-molecule binding domains, transferases domains, DNA binding domains (transcription factors), and signal transduction domains were identified as promiscuous. In contrast, non-promiscuous domains were identified as associated with 6 of 50 functional categories, and the category Function unknown was enriched. In addition, the WDASs of 52 domains correlated with genome size, i.e., WDAS values decreased as the genome size increased, suggesting that the number of combinations at larger domains increases, including domains in the superfamilies Winged helix-turn-helix and P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases. Finally, based on classification of the domains according to their ancestry, we determined that the set of 52 promiscuous domains are also ancient and abundant among all the genomes, in contrast to the non-promiscuous domains. In summary, we consider that the association between these two classes of protein domains (promiscuous and non-promiscuous) provides bacterial and archaeal cells with the ability to respond to diverse environmental challenges."

Both species have declined dramatically in both population size and numbers of populations. The Bohemian gentian rescue programme, which recommended appropriate management measures, was adopted in 2011. Here we study the ecology of this species, results of the rescue programme and explore the possibilities of using the experience resulting from this programme for improving the viability of the second species. Long-term monitoring of populations of the Bohemian gentian has shown that regular mowing or grazing together with careful litter removal and gap creation are necessary for its survival in the current climatic conditions. We found some ecological differences between these two closely related species of Gentianella. However, our empirical experience of the largest population of the Sturmian gentian at a site where it thrives, and general evidence that gaps are crucial for the successful establishment of Gentianella seedlings, indicate that regular mowing or grazing together with careful litter removal and creation of gaps, should also be recommended as in the case of the Bohemian gentian rescue programme. Artificial gaps are especially crucial for successful seedling regeneration in oligotrophic meadows with dense vegetation, where the last Sturmian gentian populations survive."

A micro- histological analysis of black-necked swan feces (N = 152) collected during six sampling occasions between 2012 and 2017 confirms the preferred consumption of E. densa and highlights the impact of temporal changes in the cover of these macrophytes on the swan’s diet. The dietary composition of black-necked swans appears as a reliable proxy for temporal changes in the distribution of the most common aquatic macrophytes in the Río Cruces wetland. These results highlight the importance of preserving shallow wetlands as the habitat for aquatic macrophytes that provide the main food source for these herbivorous water birds."
https://openalex.org/W2994776362,"Nowadays, location based service (LBS) is one of the most popular mobile apps and following with humongous of location data been produced. The publishing of location data can provide benefit for promoting the quality of service, optimizing the commercial environment as well as harmonizing the infrastructure construction. However, as location data may contain some sensitive or confidential information, the publishing may reveal privacy and bring hazards. So the published data had to be disposed to protect the privacy. In order to cope with this problem, a number of algorithms based on the strategy of k-anonymity were proposed, but this is not enough for the privacy protection, as the correlation between the sensitive region and the background knowledge can be used to infer the real location. Thus, consider about this condition, in this paper a ε-sensitive correlation privacy protection scheme is proposed, and provides correlation indistinguishable to the location data. In this scheme, entropy is first used to determine the location centroid of each cell to build up the voronoi diagram. Then the coordinate of the untreated location data that is located in the cell is transferred into the centroid vicinity. Accordingly, the sensitive correlation is destroyed by the coordinate of each published data. The process of transferring the location data is determined by metrics of ε-sensitive correlation privacy, and is rigorous in mathematical justification. At last, security analysis is proposed in this paper to verify the privacy ability of our proposed algorithm based on voronoi diagram and entropy, and then we utilize the comparative experiment to further affirm the advantage of this algorithm in the location data privacy protection as well as the availability of published data."
https://openalex.org/W2995381753,"The homeostatic iron regulator protein HFE is involved in regulation of iron acquisition for cells. The prevalence of two common HFE gene variants (H63D, C282Y) has been studied in many cancer types; however, the impact of HFE variants, sex and HFE gene expression in lung cancer has not been studied. We determined the prevalence of HFE variants and their impact on cancer phenotypes in lung cancer cell lines, in lung cancer patient specimens, and using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We found that seven out of ten human lung cancer cell lines carry the H63D or C282Y HFE variant. Analysis of lung cancer specimens from our institute (Penn State Hershey Medical Center) revealed a sex and genotype interaction risk for metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients; H63D HFE is associated with less metastasis in males compared to wild type (WT) HFE; however, females with the H63D HFE variant tend to develop more metastatic tumors than WT female patients. In the TCGA LUAD dataset, the H63D HFE variant was associated with poorer survival in females compared to females with WT HFE. The frequency of C282Y HFE is higher in female lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients of TCGA than males, however the C282Y HFE variant did not impact the survival of LUSC patients. In the TCGA LUSC dataset, C282Y HFE patients (especially females) had poorer survival than WT HFE patients. HFE expression level was not affected by HFE genotype status and did not impact patient's survival, regardless of sex. In summary, these data suggest that there is a sexually dimorphic effect of HFE polymorphisms in the survival and metastatic disease in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2995719557,"Several dictionary websites are available on the web to access semantic, synonymous, or spelling information about a given word. During nine years, we systematically recorded all the entered letter sequences from a French web dictionary. A total of 200 million orthographic forms were obtained allowing us to create a large-scale database of spelling errors that could inform psychological theories about spelling processes. To check the reliability of this big data methodology, we selected from this database a sample of 100 frequently misspelled words. A group of 100 French university students had to perform a spelling-to-dictation test on this list of words. The results showed a strong correlation between the two data sets on the frequencies of produced spellings (r = 0.82). Although the distributions of spelling errors were relatively consistent across the two databases, the proportion of correct responses revealed significant differences. Regression analyses allowed us to generate possible explanations for these differences in terms of task-dependent factors. We argue that comparing the results of these large-scale databases with those of standard and controlled experimental paradigms is certainly a good way to determine the conditions under which this big data methodology can be adequately used for informing psychological theories."
https://openalex.org/W2995873367,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health problem associated with considerable risk of mortality in different regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of HCV infection on all-cause and liver-related mortality, in a large cohort of blood donors in Brazil.This is a retrospective cohort study of blood donors from 1994 to 2013, at Fundação Pró-Sangue-Hemocentro de São Paulo (FPS). This cohort included 2,892 and 5,784 HCV antibody seropositive and seronegative donors, respectively. Records from the FPS database and the Mortality Information System (SIM: a national database in Brazil) were linked through a probabilistic record linkage (RL). Mortality outcomes were defined based on ICD-10 (10th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) codes listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for outcomes using Cox multiple regression models.When all causes of death were considered, RL identified 209 deaths (7.2%) among seropositive blood donors and 190 (3.3%) among seronegative blood donors. Donors seropositive for HCV infection had a 2.5 times higher risk of death due to all causes (95% CI: 1.76-2.62; p<0.001). When only liver-related causes of death were considered, RL identified 73 deaths among seropositive blood donors and only 6 among seronegative blood donors. Donors seropositive for HCV infection had a 23.4 times higher risk of death due to liver related causes (95% CI: 10.2-53.9; p<0.001). Donors seropositive for HCV had a 29.5 (95%CI: 3.9-221.7), 2.8 (95% CI: 1.4-5.5) and a 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.0) times higher risk of death due to hepatocellular carcinoma, infection or trauma, respectively, compared to seronegative donors.All-cause and liver-related mortality rate was increased among blood donors seropositive for HCV compared with the mortality rate among seronegative blood donors. Our data confirms HCV as a relevant cause of death in Brazil and also suggest that interventions directed at following patients even after access to specific drug treatment are urgent and necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2996027413,"Several methods to quantify the complexity of a time series have been proposed in the literature, which can be classified into three categories: structure/self-affinity, attractor in the phase space, and randomness. In 2009, Lacasa et al. proposed a new method for characterizing a time series called the natural visibility algorithm, which maps the data into a network. To further investigate the capabilities of this technique, in this work, we analyzed the monthly ambient temperature of 4 cities located in different climatic zones on the Peninsula of Yucatan, Mexico, using detrended fluctuation analysis (structure complexity), approximate entropy (randomness complexity) and the network approach. It was found that by measuring the complexity of the dynamics by structure or randomness, the magnitude was very similar between the cities in different climatic zones; however, by analyzing topological indices such as Laplacian energy and Shannon entropy to characterize networks, we found differences between those cities. With these results, we show that analysis using networks has considerable potential as a fourth way to quantify complexity and that it may be applied to more subtle complex systems such as physiological signals and their high impact on early warnings."
https://openalex.org/W2996616934,"Background Postpartum infections are a common cause of morbidity after childbirth. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase the risk for several infections in a non-pregnant population. Vitamin D deficiency has been described as common in pregnant women. Objective To investigate whether vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in labor was associated with an increased risk of overall postpartum infectious morbidity within eight weeks of delivery. A secondary aim was to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women in Linköping, Sweden at the time of delivery. Material and methods Serum vitamin D levels in labor were analyzed for 1397 women. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum levels <50 nmol/L. All ICD-10 codes given to the women eight weeks postpartum were reviewed and postpartum infections were defined as the presence of an ICD-10 code suggestive of infection. The prevalence of postpartum infections among women with sufficient vitamin D levels was compared with women with vitamin D deficiency. Adjusted Odds Ratios and 95% confidence intervals for postpartum infections were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Fifty eight per cent of the women had serum vitamin D levels <50 nmol/L. The proportion of women with vitamin D deficiency varied, as expected, with season. No association between vitamin D deficiency and postpartum infections was found. For vitamin D 25–50 nmol/L the adjusted Odds Ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.56–1.29) and for vitamin D <25 nmol/L the adjusted Odds Ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 0.66–2.03). Women who smoked or who had a cesarean section had an increased risk of postpartum infections. Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency was more common than previously reported in Swedish pregnant women. No association between vitamin D deficiency and postpartum infections was found. Other well-known risk factors for postpartum infection were identified."
