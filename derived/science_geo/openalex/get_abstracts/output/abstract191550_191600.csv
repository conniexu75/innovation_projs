In order to test this hypothesis, an apparatus was built to circulate CHI4, NH3, H2O, and H2 past an electric discharge. The resulting mixture has been tested for amino acids by paper chromatography. Electrical discharge was used to form free radicals instead of ultraviolet light, because quartz absorbs wavelengths short enough to cause photo-dissociation of the gases. Electrical discharge may have played a significant role in the formation of compounds in the"

As an introduced species it is a major component of pastures covering some 10 million acres in Australia, and has contributed largely to the development of the Australian sheep industry during the past thirty years."

He suggested that it might be due to an allergy associated with the small number of lung-worms that he noticed were present."

It is therefore important to point out that the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (an inter-departmental advisory body) considers the Royal Society's scheme to be unsuited to cartography. Far from letting things take their own course, the Permanent Committee has come to agreement with the United States Board on Geographic Names about the transliteration of Russian and Bulgarian. Serbian is officially written in both the Cyrillic and the Roman alphabets, and to transliterate Serbian geographical names into an English alphabet would produce objectionable variants of their official forms."
