https://openalex.org/W1991241547,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are associated with the formation in the brain of amyloid fibrils from beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein proteins, respectively. It is likely that oligomeric fibrillization intermediates (protofibrils), rather than the fibrils themselves, are pathogenic, but the mechanism by which they cause neuronal death remains a mystery. We show here that mutant amyloid proteins associated with familial Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases form morphologically indistinguishable annular protofibrils that resemble a class of pore-forming bacterial toxins, suggesting that inappropriate membrane permeabilization might be the cause of cell dysfunction and even cell death in amyloid diseases."

Here we provide evidence that a night of sleep results in a 20% increase in motor speed without loss of accuracy, while an equivalent period of time during wake provides no significant benefit. Furthermore, a significant correlation exists between the improved performance overnight and the amount of stage 2 NREM sleep, particularly late in the night. This finding of sleep-dependent motor skill improvement may have important implications for the efficient learning of all skilled actions in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2028363992,"In vitro studies indicate a role for the LIM kinase family in the regulation of cofilin phosphorylation and actin dynamics. In addition, abnormal expression of LIMK-1 is associated with Williams syndrome, a mental disorder with profound deficits in visuospatial cognition. However, the in vivo function of this family of kinases remains elusive. Using LIMK-1 knockout mice, we demonstrate a significant role for LIMK-1 in vivo in regulating cofilin and the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we show that the knockout mice exhibited significant abnormalities in spine morphology and in synaptic function, including enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation. The knockout mice also showed altered fear responses and spatial learning. These results indicate that LIMK-1 plays a critical role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and brain function."

https://openalex.org/W2066673889,"Synaptic remodeling has been postulated as a mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity, and cadherin adhesion molecules are thought to be a regulator of such a process. We examined the effects of cadherin blockage on synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. This blockade resulted in alterations of dendritic spine morphology, such as filopodia-like elongation of the spine and bifurcation of its head structure, along with concomitant disruption of the distribution of postsynaptic proteins. The accumulation of synapsin at presynaptic sites and synaptic vesicle recycling were also perturbed, although these synaptic responses to the cadherin blockade became less evident upon the maturation of the synapses. These findings suggest that cadherin regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis and related synaptic functions, presumably cooperating with cadherin-independent adhesive mechanisms to maintain spine-axon contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2074773299,"The state of a two-particle system is said to be entangled when its quantum-mechanical wavefunction cannot be factorized into two single-particle wavefunctions. This leads to one of the strongest counter-intuitive features of quantum mechanics, namely non-locality. Experimental realization of quantum entanglement is relatively easy for photons; a starting photon can spontaneously split into a pair of entangled photons inside a nonlinear crystal. Here we investigate the effects of nanostructured metal optical elements on the properties of entangled photons. To this end, we place optically thick metal films perforated with a periodic array of subwavelength holes in the paths of the two entangled photons. Such arrays convert photons into surface-plasmon waves--optically excited compressive charge density waves--which tunnel through the holes before reradiating as photons at the far side. We address the question of whether the entanglement survives such a conversion process. Our coincidence counting measurements show that it does, so demonstrating that the surface plasmons have a true quantum nature. Focusing one of the photon beams on its array reduces the quality of the entanglement. The propagation of the surface plasmons makes the array effectively act as a 'which way' detector."
https://openalex.org/W2073346616,"Plexins are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that, in the nervous system, mediate repulsive signals of semaphorins. However, the molecular nature of plexin-mediated signal transduction remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that plexin-B family members associate through their C termini with the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. Activation of plexin-B1 by semaphorin 4D regulates PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG activity leading to RhoA activation. In addition, a dominant-negative form of PDZ-RhoGEF blocks semaphorin 4D-induced growth cone collapse in primary hippocampal neurons. Our study indicates that the interaction of mammalian plexin-B family members with the multidomain proteins PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG represents an essential molecular link between plexin-B and localized, Rho-mediated downstream signaling events which underly various plexin-mediated cellular phenomena including axonal growth cone collapse."
https://openalex.org/W2108031268,"When maize seedlings were exposed to cold stress, a genome-wide demethylation occurred in root tissues. Screening of genomic DNA identified one particular fragment that was demethylated during chilling. This 1.8-kb fragment, designated ZmMI1, contained part of the coding region of a putative protein and part of a retrotransposon-like sequence. ZmMI1 was transcribed only under cold stress. Direct methylation mapping revealed that hypomethylated regions spanning 150 bases alternated with hypermethylated regions spanning 50 bases. Analysis of nuclear DNA digested with micrococcal nuclease indicated that these regions corresponded to nucleosome cores and linkers, respectively. Cold stress induced severe demethylation in core regions but left linker regions relatively intact. Thus, methylation and demethylation were periodic in nucleosomes. The following biological significance is conceivable. First, because DNA methylation in nucleosomes induces alteration of gene expression by changing chromatin structures, vast demethylation may serve as a common switch for many genes that are simultaneously controlled upon environmental cues. Second, because artificial demethylation induces heritable changes in plant phenotype (Sano, H., Kamada, I., Youssefian, S., Katsumi, M., and Wabilko, H. (1990)Mol. Gen. Genet. 220, 441–447), altered DNA methylation may result in epigenetic inheritance, in which gene expression is modified without changing the nucleotide sequence.

In vertebrates, m5C is located almost exclusively in CpG, whereas in plants it occurs in both CpG and CpNpG (1Gruenbaum Y. Naveh-Many T. Cedar H. Razin A. Nature. 1981; 292: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The distribution within the genome is non-random and varies depending on the tissue and the developmental stages. The physiological function of m5C is essentially to silence gene expression, which is important for host DNA defenses against incorporation of “parasitic” DNA (2Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 3Colot V. Rossignol J.L. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Two systems are involved: one directly blocks transcriptional machinery attached to promoter regions of genes by altering DNA structure and the other indirectly interferes with transcription by influencing nucleosome conformation and stability (4Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated the latter to occur frequently, as shown by various disorders due to abnormal chromosome structures that are caused by defective DNA methylation (5Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). One hallmark of cancer cells is local hypermethylation and global hypomethylation of chromosomal DNA (6Smith S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Abnormal methylation in the promoter regions of regulatory genes may indeed result in cancer development (7Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Using antisense inhibition of DNMT1, a maintenance type DNA methyltransferase, about 10% of all genes in cultured mouse cells were found to be activated (8Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemat R. Tudoe M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These observations confirmed that DNA methylation functions as a global repressor of gene expression (9Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). The reverse case, i.e. global demethylation has also been inferred to be critical during embryogenesis in mammals (9Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar, 10Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). What controls the on-off switch for DNA methylation, however, is still largely unclear. While a set of DNA methyltransferases has been identified in various organisms, including plants, the presence of DNA demethylases is controversial (7Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Among several candidate proteins, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase was shown to induce genome-wide demethylation upon transfection into mouse myoblasts (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism may be, reprogramming of DNA methylation appears to be fundamental in normal development (10Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar).Epigenetic inheritance is defined as change in gene expression without base sequence alteration (12Riggs A.D. Porter T.N. Russo V.E.A. Martienssen R.A. Riggs A.D. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 29-45Google Scholar). This typically occurs during somatic cell differentiation, in which the clonal expansion of a single cell leads to a diversity of cell types (13Holliday R. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 452-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such a cellular inheritance is common during ontogeny but is usually erased before gametes are produced (14Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). In plants, however, it has long been known that epigenetically acquired traits can be sexually transmitted, as exemplified by flax (Linum) (15Smith J.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 143: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this case, epigenetic changes were induced by external factors such as nutrients and temperature (16Durrant A. Heredity. 1962; 17: 27-61Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Cullis C.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1983; 1: 117-131Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consequently, the idea has been proposed that an environmental stimulus can induce heritable chromatin modifications as an adaptive response (18Jablonka E. Lamb M.J. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 139: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is established that some clonal epigenetic changes are mediated through DNA methylation (6Smith S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,13Holliday R. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 452-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but evidence is limited for involvement of the latter in inheritance of acquired characteristics (19Martienssen R.A. Colot V. Science. 2001; 293: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a single exposure of germinated rice seeds to the DNA demethylating agent, 5-azadeoxycytidine, induced dwarfism at maturity (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA isolated from dwarf plants showed a 16% reduction in the m5C content in comparison with DNA from untreated plants. Both hypomethylation and dwarfism were transmitted to progeny for at least three generations (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the acquired phenotype due to acquired changes in DNA methylation was heritable. However, whether or not such an epigenetic inheritance occurs under natural condition remained to be solved.In this report we provide support for the conclusion that levels of DNA methylation change in the cores of nucleosomes in maize root tissues in response to cold stress or environmental cues. This finding allowed us to speculate that DNA methylation may function as a common switch of gene expression and that naturally induced changes in DNA methylation may result in heritable epigenetic modification of gene expression.DISCUSSIONNucleosomes are organized into precise positions on DNA by signals in the sequence (31Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One such signal has been proposed to be m5C, but the experimental evidence is controversial. For example, opposite results as to preferential binding of histone H1 to methylated DNA have been reported (32McArthur M. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Campoy F.J. Meehan R.R. McKay S. Nixon J. Bird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26473-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and currently the interaction between histones and methylated DNA is in general not considered to be specific. However, under certain circumstances, nucleosome assembly appears to depend on CpG methylation (31Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Godde J.S. Kass S.U. Hirst M.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24325-24328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests a dynamic interaction between methylated DNA and proteins that constitute chromatin. Methylation of histones was shown to be essential for triggering DNA methylation in filamentous fungi, and it was suggested that propagation of DNA methylation patterns is dependent on feed-back loops between modification of chromatin proteins and DNA (35Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Our result showing periodic oscillation of DNA methylation within the nucleosomal structure is consistent with this view and further suggests a positive role for methylation in determining the chromatin infrastructure. Our findings also substantiate occurrence of demethylation upon environmental stress.During differentiation of mammalian cells, genome-wide loss of DNA methylation occurs, for which active or passive mechanisms have been proposed (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Zhu B. Benjamin D. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5031-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In active demethylation, m5C is enzymatically removed from DNA, and in passive demethylation, newly replicated DNA is not methylated (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results with maize indicate that genome-wide demethylation occurs, possibly through active demethylation, because chilled tissues immediately ceased DNA replication (28Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A rapid and active decrease in global DNA methylation was also observed during seed germination of Silene latifolia (37Zluvova J. Janousek B. Vyskot B. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Active demethylation is catalyzed by 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosidase (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Zhu B. Benjamin D. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5031-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although such activity has not yet been found in plants. A specific feature of our findings was that demethylation predominantly occurred at the nucleosome core regions as revealed by direct methylation mapping. A question arises, then, as to how such a differential demethylation pattern is formed. Currently we have no explanation for this, but some clues for speculation are available. For example, nucleosome cores are proposed to be located outside the 30-nm fiber, which is composed of a unit of six nucleosomes. Linker regions are connected by histone H1 inside the fiber. This structure makes 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase more accessible to the core than to the linker. Alternatively, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase may be selectively recruited to the core by specific protein(s) such as, for example, 5-methylcytosine binding proteins. Another distinct finding of the direct methylation mapping is ubiquitous demethylation at CpG, CpNpG and other sites, suggesting no restriction to only one strand of DNA. This means that, for remethylation, de novo methyltransferase activity is necessary. If this enzyme is absent in quiescent cells, for example, in root tissues, the methylated status can not be restored. This could account for the apparently progressive demethylation in cold-chased seedlings.While the average methylation level of total genomic DNA in untreated root tissues was ∼18%, that of ZmMI1 was 38%, 2-fold higher. This indicates a heterogeneous distribution of m5C in the genome, consistent with the histochemical observations, and suggests ZmMI1 to be located in heterochromatin. However, because demethylation occurred throughout the genome, including theZmMI1 sequence, the periodic methylation pattern found in the latter may be common to other parts of genome. If so, the occurrence of demethylation mainly in the core regions of nucleosomes could induce an alteration of chromatin structure and thus influence gene expression. Increase in ZmMI1 transcripts substantiates this hypothesis. The advantage of this feature is that expression of many genes could be simultaneously controlled. Indeed, it was estimated that plants may express as many as several hundred genes upon cold stress (38Thomashow M.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Somerville C.R. Arabidopsis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 807-834Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that plants have developed the methylation/demethylation system to simultaneously regulate a vast number of genes at once, rather than to individually regulate each gene. Alternatively, because ∼70% of the maize genome is composed of retroposon-like sequences (39Bennetzen J.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and because demethylation has been shown to reactivate transposons (40Dennis E.S. Brettell R.I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 362: 217-229Google Scholar), the global demethylation possibly transcriptionally activates such sequences to translocate, resulting in secondary activation/inactivation of other genes (41Miura A. Yonebayashi S. Watanabe K. Toyama T. Shimada H. Kakutani T. Nature. 2001; 411: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the reason why such demethylation occurs only in root tissues is not clear. One explanation might be that above-ground parts are equipped with a more complete self-defense system than those underground, as exemplified by the presence and absence of maintenance-type DNA methyltransferase in the respective tissues (28Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Heredity of epigenetic modification, or acquired traits, in response to environmental conditions has long been speculated, and DNA methylation has been proposed as one of its promoters (13Holliday R. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 452-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In animal cells, however, DNA methylation patterns are strictly regulated in somatic cells so that upon gametogenesis those that are acquired are usually completely erased and not transmitted to the progeny (14Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). In plants, the distinction between somatic and germ cells is less obvious in comparison with animals, making possible transmission of acquired DNA methylation patterns. We have experimentally shown this by treatment of germinated rice seeds with 5-azadeoxycytidine, a chemical that powerfully induces demethylation of DNA in vivo (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At maturity, plants exhibited a global demethylation and altered phenotypes, including dwarfism. The acquired traits and demethylation patterns were inherited for up to at least six generations. 2N. Steward, M. Ito, Y. Yamaguchi, N. Koizumi, and H. Sano, unpublished observation. Thus alteration of DNA methylation can induce changed expression of some genes, resulting in a new phenotype, both of which are heritable (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Our above-mentioned experiments suggested that the acquired trait due to an acquired methylation pattern is sexually transmittable, but evidence of methylation patterns changing depending on the environment was missing. The present study showed that this can indeed occur. However, maize roots are differentiated tissues consisting of somatic cells and they do not form germ cells. In this context, the demethylation pattern would not be transmittable to progeny. The fact that no obvious demethylation was observed in stem mesocotyl tissues, which contain cells with the potentiality to develop into germ cells, suggests that these latter are well protected against environmental stresses in terms of DNA methylation. However, if a DNA methylation pattern did change, it could result in heritable epimutations. If such mutations were advantageous for survival, they might persist for generations. An example is the flower morphology change inLinaria vulgaris, considered to be the result of hypermethylation of the Lcyc gene which occurred 250 years ago (42Cubas P. Vincent C. Coen E. Nature. 1999; 401: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Also, in plants, vegetative reproduction is not rare as seen with tuber propagation, making it possible to directly transmit altered methylation patterns to the next generation. We therefore speculate that Lamarckian inheritance does exist, being mediated through DNA methylation. DNA of higher eukaryotes is characterized by the presence of 5-methylcytosine (m5C)1 nucleotides, comprising up to 30% of the total cytosines. In vertebrates, m5C is located almost exclusively in CpG, whereas in plants it occurs in both CpG and CpNpG (1Gruenbaum Y. Naveh-Many T. Cedar H. Razin A. Nature. 1981; 292: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The distribution within the genome is non-random and varies depending on the tissue and the developmental stages. The physiological function of m5C is essentially to silence gene expression, which is important for host DNA defenses against incorporation of “parasitic” DNA (2Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H.

In plants, however, it has long been known that epigenetically acquired traits can be sexually transmitted, as exemplified by flax (Linum) (15Smith J.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 143: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this case, epigenetic changes were induced by external factors such as nutrients and temperature (16Durrant A. Heredity. 1962; 17: 27-61Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Cullis C.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1983; 1: 117-131Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consequently, the idea has been proposed that an environmental stimulus can induce heritable chromatin modifications as an adaptive response (18Jablonka E. Lamb M.J. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 139: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is established that some clonal epigenetic changes are mediated through DNA methylation (6Smith S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,13Holliday R. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 452-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but evidence is limited for involvement of the latter in inheritance of acquired characteristics (19Martienssen R.A. Colot V. Science. 2001; 293: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a single exposure of germinated rice seeds to the DNA demethylating agent, 5-azadeoxycytidine, induced dwarfism at maturity (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA isolated from dwarf plants showed a 16% reduction in the m5C content in comparison with DNA from untreated plants. Both hypomethylation and dwarfism were transmitted to progeny for at least three generations (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the acquired phenotype due to acquired changes in DNA methylation was heritable. However, whether or not such an epigenetic inheritance occurs under natural condition remained to be solved. In this report we provide support for the conclusion that levels of DNA methylation change in the cores of nucleosomes in maize root tissues in response to cold stress or environmental cues. This finding allowed us to speculate that DNA methylation may function as a common switch of gene expression and that naturally induced changes in DNA methylation may result in heritable epigenetic modification of gene expression. DISCUSSIONNucleosomes are organized into precise positions on DNA by signals in the sequence (31Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One such signal has been proposed to be m5C, but the experimental evidence is controversial. For example, opposite results as to preferential binding of histone H1 to methylated DNA have been reported (32McArthur M. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Campoy F.J. Meehan R.R. McKay S. Nixon J. Bird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26473-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and currently the interaction between histones and methylated DNA is in general not considered to be specific. However, under certain circumstances, nucleosome assembly appears to depend on CpG methylation (31Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Godde J.S. Kass S.U. Hirst M.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24325-24328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests a dynamic interaction between methylated DNA and proteins that constitute chromatin. Methylation of histones was shown to be essential for triggering DNA methylation in filamentous fungi, and it was suggested that propagation of DNA methylation patterns is dependent on feed-back loops between modification of chromatin proteins and DNA (35Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Our result showing periodic oscillation of DNA methylation within the nucleosomal structure is consistent with this view and further suggests a positive role for methylation in determining the chromatin infrastructure. Our findings also substantiate occurrence of demethylation upon environmental stress.During differentiation of mammalian cells, genome-wide loss of DNA methylation occurs, for which active or passive mechanisms have been proposed (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Zhu B. Benjamin D. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5031-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In active demethylation, m5C is enzymatically removed from DNA, and in passive demethylation, newly replicated DNA is not methylated (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results with maize indicate that genome-wide demethylation occurs, possibly through active demethylation, because chilled tissues immediately ceased DNA replication (28Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A rapid and active decrease in global DNA methylation was also observed during seed germination of Silene latifolia (37Zluvova J. Janousek B. Vyskot B. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Active demethylation is catalyzed by 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosidase (11Jost J.P. Oakeley E.J. Zhu B. Benjamin D. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost Y.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Zhu B. Benjamin D. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5031-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although such activity has not yet been found in plants. A specific feature of our findings was that demethylation predominantly occurred at the nucleosome core regions as revealed by direct methylation mapping. A question arises, then, as to how such a differential demethylation pattern is formed. Currently we have no explanation for this, but some clues for speculation are available. For example, nucleosome cores are proposed to be located outside the 30-nm fiber, which is composed of a unit of six nucleosomes. Linker regions are connected by histone H1 inside the fiber. This structure makes 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase more accessible to the core than to the linker. Alternatively, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase may be selectively recruited to the core by specific protein(s) such as, for example, 5-methylcytosine binding proteins. Another distinct finding of the direct methylation mapping is ubiquitous demethylation at CpG, CpNpG and other sites, suggesting no restriction to only one strand of DNA. This means that, for remethylation, de novo methyltransferase activity is necessary. If this enzyme is absent in quiescent cells, for example, in root tissues, the methylated status can not be restored. This could account for the apparently progressive demethylation in cold-chased seedlings.While the average methylation level of total genomic DNA in untreated root tissues was ∼18%, that of ZmMI1 was 38%, 2-fold higher. This indicates a heterogeneous distribution of m5C in the genome, consistent with the histochemical observations, and suggests ZmMI1 to be located in heterochromatin. However, because demethylation occurred throughout the genome, including theZmMI1 sequence, the periodic methylation pattern found in the latter may be common to other parts of genome. If so, the occurrence of demethylation mainly in the core regions of nucleosomes could induce an alteration of chromatin structure and thus influence gene expression. Increase in ZmMI1 transcripts substantiates this hypothesis. The advantage of this feature is that expression of many genes could be simultaneously controlled. Indeed, it was estimated that plants may express as many as several hundred genes upon cold stress (38Thomashow M.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Somerville C.R. Arabidopsis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 807-834Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that plants have developed the methylation/demethylation system to simultaneously regulate a vast number of genes at once, rather than to individually regulate each gene. Alternatively, because ∼70% of the maize genome is composed of retroposon-like sequences (39Bennetzen J.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and because demethylation has been shown to reactivate transposons (40Dennis E.S. Brettell R.I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 362: 217-229Google Scholar), the global demethylation possibly transcriptionally activates such sequences to translocate, resulting in secondary activation/inactivation of other genes (41Miura A. Yonebayashi S. Watanabe K. Toyama T. Shimada H. Kakutani T. Nature. 2001; 411: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the reason why such demethylation occurs only in root tissues is not clear. One explanation might be that above-ground parts are equipped with a more complete self-defense system than those underground, as exemplified by the presence and absence of maintenance-type DNA methyltransferase in the respective tissues (28Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Heredity of epigenetic modification, or acquired traits, in response to environmental conditions has long been speculated, and DNA methylation has been proposed as one of its promoters (13Holliday R. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 452-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In animal cells, however, DNA methylation patterns are strictly regulated in somatic cells so that upon gametogenesis those that are acquired are usually completely erased and not transmitted to the progeny (14Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). In plants, the distinction between somatic and germ cells is less obvious in comparison with animals, making possible transmission of acquired DNA methylation patterns. We have experimentally shown this by treatment of germinated rice seeds with 5-azadeoxycytidine, a chemical that powerfully induces demethylation of DNA in vivo (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At maturity, plants exhibited a global demethylation and altered phenotypes, including dwarfism. The acquired traits and demethylation patterns were inherited for up to at least six generations. 2N. Steward, M. Ito, Y. Yamaguchi, N. Koizumi, and H. Sano, unpublished observation. Thus alteration of DNA methylation can induce changed expression of some genes, resulting in a new phenotype, both of which are heritable (20Sano H. Kamada I. Youssefian S. Katsumi M. Wabilko H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 441-447Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Our above-mentioned experiments suggested that the acquired trait due to an acquired methylation pattern is sexually transmittable, but evidence of methylation patterns changing depending on the environment was missing. The present study showed that this can indeed occur. However, maize roots are differentiated tissues consisting of somatic cells and they do not form germ cells. In this context, the demethylation pattern would not be transmittable to progeny. The fact that no obvious demethylation was observed in stem mesocotyl tissues, which contain cells with the potentiality to develop into germ cells, suggests that these latter are well protected against environmental stresses in terms of DNA methylation. However, if a DNA methylation pattern did change, it could result in heritable epimutations. If such mutations were advantageous for survival, they might persist for generations. An example is the flower morphology change inLinaria vulgaris, considered to be the result of hypermethylation of the Lcyc gene which occurred 250 years ago (42Cubas P. Vincent C. Coen E. Nature. 1999; 401: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Also, in plants, vegetative reproduction is not rare as seen with tuber propagation, making it possible to directly transmit altered methylation patterns to the next generation. We therefore speculate that Lamarckian inheritance does exist, being mediated through DNA methylation. Nucleosomes are organized into precise positions on DNA by signals in the sequence (31Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One such signal has been proposed to be m5C, but the experimental evidence is controversial.

https://openalex.org/W2092235352,"Activity-induced changes in adhesion molecules may coordinate presynaptic and postsynaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that beta-catenin, which mediates interactions between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton, moves from dendritic shafts into spines upon depolarization, increasing its association with cadherins. beta-catenin's redistribution was mimicked or prevented by a tyrosine kinase or phosphatase inhibitor, respectively. Point mutations of beta-catenin's tyrosine 654 altered the shaft/spine distribution: Y654F-beta-catenin-GFP (phosphorylation-prevented) was concentrated in spines, whereas Y654E-beta-catenin-GFP (phosphorylation-mimic) accumulated in dendritic shafts. In Y654F-expressing neurons, the PSD-95 or associated synapsin-I clusters were larger than those observed in either wild-type-beta-catenin or also Y654E-expressing neurons. Y654F-expressing neurons exhibited a higher minifrequency. Thus, neural activity induces beta-catenin's redistribution into spines, where it interacts with cadherin to influence synaptic size and strength."

However, the roles of the various NGF-triggered signaling cascades in determining specific axon morphological features remain unknown. Here, we transfected activated and inhibitory mutants of Trk effectors into sensory neurons lacking the proapoptotic protein Bax. This allowed axon growth to be studied in the absence of NGF, enabling us to observe the contributions of individual signaling mediators. While Ras was both necessary and sufficient for NGF-stimulated axon growth, the Ras effectors Raf and Akt induced distinct morphologies. Activated Raf-1 caused axon lengthening comparable to NGF, while active Akt increased axon caliber and branching. Our results suggest that the different Trk effector pathways mediate distinct morphological aspects of developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2060764772,"The organization of macaque posterior parietal cortex (PPC) reflects its functional specialization in integrating polymodal sensory information for object recognition and manipulation. Neuropsychological and recent human imaging studies imply equivalencies between human and macaque PPC, and in particular, the cortex buried in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Using functional MRI, we tested the hypothesis that an area in human anterior intraparietal cortex is activated when healthy subjects perform a crossmodal visuo-tactile delayed matching-to-sample task with objects. Tactile or visual object presentation (encoding and recognition) both significantly activated anterior intraparietal cortex. As hypothesized, neural activity in this area was further enhanced when subjects transferred object information between modalities (crossmodal matching). Based on both the observed functional properties and the anatomical location, we suggest that this area in anterior IPS is the human equivalent of macaque area AIP."
https://openalex.org/W1994248356,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a highly bioactive sphingolipid involved in diverse biological processes leading to changes in cell growth, differentiation, motility, and survival. S1P generation is regulated via sphingosine kinase (SK), and many of its effects are mediated through extracelluar action on G-protein-coupled receptors. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms regulating SK, where this occurs in the cell, and whether this leads to release of S1P extracellularly. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), induced early activation of SK in HEK 293 cells, and this activation was more specific to the membrane-associated SK. Therefore, we next investigated whether PMA induced translocation of SK to the plasma membrane. PMA induced translocation of both endogenous and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human SK1 (hSK1) to the plasma membrane. PMA also induced phosphorylation of GFP-hSK1. The PMA-induced translocation was abrogated by preincubation with known PKC inhibitors (bisindoylmaleimide and calphostin-c) as well as by the indirect inhibitor of PKC, C6-ceramide, supporting a role for PKC in mediating translocation of SK to the plasma membrane. SK activity was not necessary for translocation, because a dominant negative G82D mutation also translocated in response to PMA. Importantly, PKC regulation of SK was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in S1P in the media. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which PKC regulates SK and increases secretion of S1P, allowing for autocrine/paracrine signaling.

Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). S1P has been shown to be secreted into serum from platelets; extracellular S1P, as a first messenger, binds members of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) receptor family (now termed S1P1, 2, 3, 4, and5) on the surface of endothelial cells, triggering such cellular processes as differentiation, migration, and mitogenesis (6Hla T. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). S1P is also suggested to act as a second messenger participating in signaling cascades leading to cytoskeletal changes, motility, release of intracellular calcium stores, and protection from apoptosis (7Mattie M.

Therefore, because of the involvement of S1P in such diverse and vital cellular processes, production of S1P through increased SK cellular activity has become the subject of much interest. Mammalian cells growing in culture possess intrinsic SK activity, generating low basal levels of S1P. Meanwhile, the agonist-induced increase in SK activity results in significant increase in S1P levels, responsible for cell signaling effects. Reported agonists of SK include platelet-derived growth factor (11Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (12Xia P.

However, the mechanisms by which SK is activated and where in the cell S1P is generated remain unknown. In this study we have addressed PMA-induced activation of SK. PMA stimulated a significant increase in SK activity associated with the membrane fraction of cell extracts. This activation was accompanied by translocation of SK to the plasma membrane and was associated with an increase in S1P secretion into the media. These results demonstrate for the first time PKC-mediated translocation of SK to the plasma membrane with a concomitant increase in secretion of S1P into the media, indicating that S1P may generate biological responses through an autocrine/paracrine signaling response. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and Hela cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Eagle's minimum essential medium, high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline, LipofectAMINE 2000, and pcDNA4-myc/HIS were purchased from Invitrogen. A23187, bisindoylmaleimide, calphostin-c, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Calbiochem. S1P, sphingosine, and C6-ceramide were purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 32Pi (10m Ci/ml) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [3-3H]d-erythro-sphingosine was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HEK 293 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Hela cells were cultured under similar conditions with high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were seeded 24 h before experimentation. Based on the complete coding sequence for human SK1 in GenBankTM (accession no.AF238083), gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-CGCCGCAGGGAATGACACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCTGTCCCCCAAAGCATAC-3′) were used to amplify the entire open reading frame by PCR from human fetal kidney Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH). An additional PCR reaction was required to clone the SK cDNA into theHindIII and EcoRI restriction sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), using the following primers: forward, 5′-TTAAAGCTTATGGATCCAGCGGGCGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTGAATTCTCATAAGGGCTCTTCGGCGGTGG-3′. Transient expression of SK was accomplished using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following 48 h of expression, transfection efficiencies were determined to be typically between 40–60%. SK activity was determined as previously described by Olivera et al. (19Olivera A. Kohama T., Tu, Z. Milstein S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were assayed using 1 mmd-erythro-sphingosine-bovine serum albumin (0.3%) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 20 mm) containing 200 mm MgCl2. Lipids were extracted and then resolved by TLC on silica gel G60 with 1-butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20, v/v). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell medium was replaced with phosphate-free medium. Following a 2-h incubation, 1 mCi of32Pi was added to the medium. After 2 h, cells were stimulated with vehicle or 300 nm PMA for 1 h. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm okadaic acid, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) containing protease inhibitors. Lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatant was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) conjugated to protein A for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was then resuspended in Laemmli buffer and separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by autoradiography. The antibody was prepared by the Medical University of South Carolina antibody facility. Briefly, a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the last 20 amino acids of the C-terminal (CVEPPPSWKPQQMPPPEEPL) of the hSK1 (GenBankTM accession no. AAF73423) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. Antiserum was affinity-purified over a cyanogen bromide-activated agarose column bound with the same oligopeptide and eluted with 100 mmglycine (pH 2.5). Blots were probed with 0.3 μg/ml preimmunized rabbit serum, 0.3 μg/ml immunized rabbit serum, immunized rabbit serum blocked with 2 μg/ml synthetic oligopeptide, or 0.2 μg/ml mouse anti-c-Myc (SC-40, Santa Cruz). Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and an ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 300 nm PMA for the indicated times. Cells were immediately washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm4-deoxypyridoxine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor). Cell suspensions were sonicated, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane fractions were resuspended in 350 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.8% Triton X-100, sonicated, and left on ice for 45 min. Triton-insoluble membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in 60 μl of lysis buffer. A dominant negative mutation was introduced into GFP-tagged SK in the pEGFP expression vector via mutagenic oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-ATGTCTGGAGACGATCTGATGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTCACCACCTCGTGCATCAGATCGTCTCCAG-3′), generating a substitution of Gly-82 to Asp as previously reported by Pitson et al. (20Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Approximately 2× 105 HEK 293 cells were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Mattek Corp.) 24 h prior to transfection. After 48 h, cells were viewed under an Olympus I× 70 confocal microscope with a Plan Apo ×60 oil objective (N.A. 1.4), and images were captured using PerkinElmer ultraview software that was set for 488 nm excitation and 516–560 nm emission for GFP fluorescent signal. Hela cells grown on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed and permeabilized for 20 min in 100% ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. Cells were blocked with 2.5% fetal bovine serum for 20 min prior to incubation with 7 μg/ml rabbit anti-hSK1 for 1 h and 10 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit conjugated with rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h, both diluted in 1.5% fetal bovine serum-phosphate-buffered saline. HEK 293 were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60 mm dish and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid as described above. After 48 h, the volume of media was adjusted to 2 ml, and cells were treated with 300 nm PMA for the indicated times. Ten minutes before the end of the time point, cells were pulsed with 300 nm[3H]d-erythro-sphingosine (2.5 μCi). Lipids were extracted by the addition of 2.5 volumes chloroform/butanol/HCl (50/50/1), and the organic layer was dried under nitrogen. Lipids were separated using thin layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/15 mm calcium chloride (60/35/8). Bands corresponding to S1P standards were scraped and the radioactivity measured using a scintillation counter. We tested the ability of the phorbol ester PMA to activate SK in HEK 293 cells. PMA treatment resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in whole cell lysate SK activity (Fig.1 A). Upon fractionation of control or PMA-treated cells into cytosolic and membrane fractions, there was a modest increase in SK activity in the cytosolic fraction and a significant increase in SK activity in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 B). This PMA-induced increase in membrane-associated SK activity paralleled the increase in plasma membrane-associated PKC activity following PMA treatment (data not shown). We wondered if the increase in membrane-associated SK activity was accompanied by SK translocation to the membrane upon PMA stimulation. To test this, we cloned hSK1 from human fetal kidney Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) and tagged the N terminus with GFP. Transient overexpression of hSK1-GFP significantly increased the whole cell lysate SK activity by more than 100-fold over vector control cells (data not shown), indicating that the GFP-tagged hSK1 was a functional fusion protein. Next, we treated HEK 293 cells expressing hSK1-GFP with PMA and followed the hSK1-GFP protein using confocal microscopy. Upon PMA stimulation, hSK1-GFP translocated to the plasma membrane; this was detectable as early as 15 min and was complete by 1 h (Fig.2). To determine whether translocation of GFP-hSK1 seen by confocal microscopy was mirrored by Western blot analysis, we developed a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of hSK1 (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblot analysis of overexpressed hSK1-GFP from fractionated HEK 293 cells demonstrated a 2-fold increase of hSK1-GFP in the membrane fraction in response to PMA treatment, with concomitant slight decrease in the cytosolic fraction and a significant decrease in the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction (Fig. 3, B andC). SK was previously shown to be cytosolic as well as to be associated with the cytoskeleton (21Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstein S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2002; 15: 2649-2659Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). From our data, it appears that the cytoskeletal pool of SK predominantly translocates to the plasma membrane in response to PMA.Figure 3PMA-induced accumulation of hSK1-GFP in the membrane fraction. A, HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3 (Lanes 2 and 5) or pcDNA3-hSK1 (Lanes 3, 6, and 8) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with a newly developed rabbit anti-hSK1 polyclonal antibody. Lane 6 illustrates immunospecific detection of overexpressed hSK1 (42.5 kDa), which was completely blocked by preabsorption with the immunization oligopeptide (Lane 8). Lanes 1, 4, and 7contain molecular weight markers. B, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-hSK1 and treated in the absence or presence of 300 nm PMA for 1 h. Samples were then fractionated into cytosol, membrane, and Triton-insoluble membrane extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts (40 μg) of each fraction were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-hSK1 antibody. C, immunoblots were analyzed by densitometric analysis. Relative values are reported compared with background.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, with the development of this highly immunospecific anti-hSK1 antibody, we tested the localization of endogenous SK within the cell in response to PMA. Utilizing the Hela cell line that expresses ample amounts of endogenous SK for immunocytochemical detection, significant levels of SK were found to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to PMA, similar to the effects seen with the overexpressed hSK1-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate for the first time that SK translocates to the plasma membrane in response to PMA stimulation. PMA is a known activator of PKC, leading to phosphorylation of substrates involved in various signal transduction pathways. To investigate whether SK was a potential substrate of PKC, cells overexpressing GFP-tagged hSK1 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of PMA or vehicle. Immunoprecipitated GFP-hSK1 showed more than a 3-fold increase in 32P incorporation upon treatment with PMA as compared with the vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5).In vitro PKC activity assays using GFP-hSK1 as a substrate were inconclusive (data not shown). To address the potential role of PKC in mediating SK translocation, we examined the effects of the direct PKC inhibitors (bisindoylmaleimide and calphostin- c) and the indirect inhibitor C6-ceramide on PMA-induced translocation of SK-GFP to the plasma membrane. Incubation of transiently transfected hSK1-GFP HEK 293 cells with either of two PKC activators, PMA or A23187 ionophore, induced translocation of hSK1-GFP to the plasma membrane. Thirty minutes of preincubation with any one of the above inhibitors prior to 1 h of stimulation with PMA nearly eradicated hSK1-GFP translocation to the plasma membrane (TableI). Therefore, these results demonstrate that PMA-induced SK translocation to the plasma membrane is dependent on activation of PKC.Table IEffects of PKC modulators on SK translocation in HEK 293 cellsTreatmentTranslocation%300 nmPMA64.3 ± 4.110 μmA23187Ionophore42.7 ± 6.3100 nm 4-α phorbol ester1.4 ± 0.53 μm bisindoylmaleimide + 300 nm PMA2.8 ± 1.21 μm calphostin-c + 300 nm PMA5.6 ± 2.740 μmC6-ceramide + 300 nm PMA2.7 ± 1.5Results indicate the mean and S.D. of three independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab Results indicate the mean and S.D. of three independent experiments. In each experiment, at least 300 cells were scored. Similar results were obtained by two independent investigators. To ascertain whether the activity of the SK enzyme was necessary for translocation, we constructed a catalytically inactive hSK1-GFP plasmid that incorporated a single point mutation (G82D), in accordance with published reports by Pitsonet al. (20Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transient expression of this construct in HEK 293 cells did not result in any change in basal activity of SK, thus demonstrating that it lacks activity. Importantly, this mutant abrogated PMA-induced stimulation of SK activity, confirming that it functions as a dominant negative mutant (Fig.6 A). PMA treatment of these cells clearly induced translocation of the catalytically inactive hSK1-GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6 B). Thus, SK activity is not required for PMA-induced translocation to the plasma membrane. Although it has been shown that stimulation of platelets results in release of preformed S1P, it is not known if newly synthesized S1P is secreted. We therefore wondered whether PMA regulation of SK was accompanied by S1P release into the media. To examine such potential regulation, a pulse labeling protocol was established to determine the fate of newly synthesized S1P in response to PMA. HEK 293 cells were treated with PMA followed by labeling with [3H]d-erythro-sphingosine for 10 min. PMA induced only a modest increase in the incorporation of label into intracellular S1P as compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig.7, A and B). In contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in S1P release into the media from PMA-treated cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7,A and B). Furthermore, PKC inhibitors (bisindoylmaleimide and calphostin) prevented the PMA-stimulated intracellular accumulation of S1P and dramatically reduced S1P release into the media (Fig. 7 C). These data imply that PMA-induced activation and translocation of SK to the plasma membrane are accompanied by S1P release into the media in a PKC-dependent manner, where it can then access cell surface receptors. In this study, we have demonstrated that PMA stimulates a significant increase in membrane-associated SK activity, and this increase is accompanied by a distinct translocation of SK to the plasma membrane. In addition we have shown that PMA induces phosphorylation of SK. PKC inhibitors block SK translocation, indicating that this event is mediated by PKC. Interestingly, SK catalytic activity is not required for its translocation, as shown by the ability of a dominant negative SK-GFP to translocate to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, SK activation and translocation by PMA stimulation resulted in a 4-fold increase in S1P secretion into the media. Taken together, these data present a novel mechanism of SK activation and show for the first time that this translocation is accompanied by release of S1P into the media. SK has been generally considered a cytosolic protein that is constitutively active, thus generating basal levels of S1P within the cell. In addition, SK is also thought to be a regulated protein in which incubation of cells with any of a number of known SK activators results in a transient increase in S1P over the basal levels, thereby initiating a cell signaling cascade leading to diverse biological processes including calcium mobilization, cell growth, differentiation, survival, motility, and cytoskeleton organization (6Hla T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although it is quite clear in the literature and from this study that agonists are able to induce SK activity within the cell, it is not clear how this activation occurs, where subcellularly S1P is being generated, or how S1P initiates cell signaling cascades that trigger such diverse biological responses. Here we have demonstrated for the first time that PMA-induced activation of SK1 leads to PKC-mediated translocation of SK to the plasma membrane and SK1 phosphorylation and is accompanied by secretion of S1P into extracellular media. Other work supports a role for agonist-induced translocation of SK to the membrane. In a study using platelet-derived growth factor, Rosenfeldt et al. (21Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstein S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2002; 15: 2649-2659Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrated an accumulation of SK at membrane ruffles, suggesting that localized S1P production aids in directional migration through binding to EDG-1 receptors. Other agonists activating SK could also be mediated by PKC-induced translocation of SK. In fact, while this work was in progress, Melendez and Khaw (22Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) showed that IgE cross-linking of FcεRI in mast cells was accompanied by SK translocation to the plasma membrane. The current results suggest that PKC activation may provide a direct mechanism for translocation of SK to the plasma membrane in response to many agents that activate phospholipase C/PKC. Our data demonstrating that SK is phosphorylated in response to PMA raise the possibility that SK is a direct substrate of PKC. At this point we cannot unequivocally rule on this possibility, because further in vitro studies on SK phosphorylation by PKC are required. Whether phosphorylation of SK is required for its translocation also is yet to be determined. These studies are now under way in our laboratory. Another mechanism by which SK could be found in the proximity of the cell membrane was suggested in a recent report by Ancellin et al. (23Ancellin N. Colmont C., Su, J., Li, Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.-S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) in which SK itself was shown to be exported extracellularly. However, in that study there was no indication of agonist induction of that process. In other work by Xia et al.(24), another mechanism of SK regulation was suggested in studies involving TNFα binding to its receptor, TNFR2. This initiates a signaling cascade by which SK interacts directly with TRAF2, a component of the TNF receptor signaling pathway, and stimulates SK activity, ultimately leading to activation of NF-κB and protection from apoptosis (24Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that SK activation in the proximity of the plasma membrane may be a prerequisite for it to access its substrate sphingosine. Whether the substrate for SK, sphingosine, is available at the plasma membrane remains to be determined. Several studies suggest that sphingomyelinases and ceramidases are activated in response to the same inducers that stimulate SK (11Olivera A. Spiegel S.

These studies are consistent with S1P being generated in a location conducive for swift secretion out of the cell. Insight into a possible mechanism of S1P release comes from a study we reported previously (30Boujaoude L.C. Bradshaw-Wilder C. Mao C. Cohn J. Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

One could envision a bidirectional mode of transport of S1P through CFTR, or through another known or not yet identified transporter by which the cell may secrete S1P in response to SK agonists to generate biological activity through EDG receptors. In summary, we present a novel mechanism by which PMA activates SK and induces translocation to the plasma membrane in a PKC-dependent manner. This translocation is accompanied by secretion of S1P into the media, suggesting autocrine/paracrine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1991211989,"Regulated delivery and removal of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors (GluRs) from postsynaptic elements has been proposed as a mechanism for regulating synaptic strength. Here we test the role of ubiquitin in regulating synapses that contain a C. elegans GluR, GLR-1. GLR-1 receptors were ubiquitinated in vivo. Mutations that decreased ubiquitination of GLR-1 increased the abundance of GLR-1 at synapses and altered locomotion behavior in a manner that is consistent with increased synaptic strength. By contrast, overexpression of ubiquitin decreased the abundance of GLR-1 at synapses and decreased the density of GLR-1-containing synapses, and these effects were prevented by mutations in the unc-11 gene, which encodes a clathrin adaptin protein (AP180). These results suggest that ubiquitination of GLR-1 receptors regulates synaptic strength and the formation or stability of GLR-1-containing synapses."
https://openalex.org/W207752236,"Mental imagery, the generation and manipulation of mental representations in the absence of sensory stimulation, is a core element of numerous cognitive processes. We investigate the cortical mechanisms underlying imagery and spatial analysis in the visual domain using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during the mental clock task. The time-resolved analysis of cortical activation from auditory perception to motor response reveals a sequential activation of the left and right posterior parietal cortex, suggesting that these regions perform distinct functions in this imagery task. This is confirmed by a trial-by-trial analysis of correlations between reaction time and onset, width, and amplitude of the hemodynamic response. These findings pose neurophysiological constraints on cognitive models of mental imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2087877452,"Hot, X-ray-emitting plasma permeates clusters of galaxies. The X-ray surface brightness often shows a peak near the centre of the cluster that is coincident with a drop in the entropy of the gas. This has been taken as evidence for a 'cooling flow', where the gas cools by radiating away its energy, and then falls to the centre. Searches for this cool gas have revealed significantly less than predicted, indicating that the mass deposition rate is much lower than expected. Most clusters with cooling flows, however, also host an active galactic nucleus at their centres. These active galactic nuclei can inflate large bubbles of hot plasma that subsequently rise through the cluster 'atmosphere', thus stirring the cooling gas and adding energy. Here we report highly resolved hydrodynamic simulations which show that buoyant bubbles increase the cooling time in the inner regions of clusters and significantly reduce the deposition of cold gas."
https://openalex.org/W2133773424,"Cytochromes P450 of the CYP2Cand CYP4A gene subfamilies metabolize arachidonic acid to 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and to 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), respectively. Abundant functional studies indicate that EETs and HETEs display powerful and often opposing biological activities as mediators of ion channel activity and regulators of vascular tone and systemic blood pressures. Incubation of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs with microsomal and purified forms of rat CYP4A isoforms led to rapid NADPH-dependent metabolism to the corresponding 19- and 20-hydroxylated EETs. Comparisons of reaction rates and catalytic efficiency with those of arachidonic and lauric acids showed that EETs are one of the best endogenous substrates so far described for rat CYP4A isoforms. CYP4A1 exhibited a preference for 8,9-EET, whereas CYP4A2, CYP4A3, and CYP4A8 preferred 11,12-EET. In general, the closer the oxido ring is to the carboxylic acid functionality, the higher the rate of EET metabolism and the lower the regiospecificity for the EET ω-carbon. Analysis of cis-parinaric acid displacement from the ligand-binding domain of the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α showed that ω-hydroxylated 14,15-EET bound to this receptor with high affinity (K i = 3 ± 1 nm).

Based on biochemical and functional correlates of CYP4A renal expression, 20-HETE biosynthesis, and the onset of systemic high blood pressure in the SHR/WKY rat model of spontaneous hypertension, a pro-hypertensive role for 20-HETE and CYP4A isoforms was proposed (14McGiff J.C.

The cytochrome P450 AA epoxygenase catalyzes the in vivoregio- and enantioselective metabolism of AA to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) (16Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Studies with microsomal and/or purified cytochrome P450 preparations showed that the AA epoxygenases belong to theCYP2 gene family and that CYP2C isoforms account for most of the epoxygenase activity in rat and human kidney and liver (16Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The biological activities attributed to the EETs include mitogenesis; vasodilatation; modulation of cellular Ca2+, Na+, and K+ fluxes; and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (14McGiff J.C.

The extensive studies of the functional properties of the cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids have shown that the metabolites of the epoxygenase and ω/ω-1-hydroxylase branches of the cytochrome P450 AA monooxygenase display powerful but often opposing biological activities (14McGiff J.C.

Using recombinant human wild type and mutant MBD3 proteins, we demonstrated that atypical amino acids found in MBD3 MBD, namely, His-30 and Phe-34, are responsible for the inability of MBD3 to bind to mCpG. Interestingly, although H30K/F34Y MBD3 mutant protein binds to mCpG efficiently in vitro, it was not localized at the mCpG-rich pericentromeric regions in mouse cells.

MBD3 was identified as a component of the NuRD/Mi2 complex that shows chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. We demonstrated that MBD3 MBD is necessary and sufficient for binding to HDAC1 and MTA2, two components of the NuRD/Mi2 complex.

DNA methylation is the major modification in eukaryote genomes. This modification occurs predominantly at position 5 of cytosine when followed by guanosine (CpG site) in vertebrates. Approximately 60–90% of the total CpG sites is methylated in vertebrates. One of the direct consequences of mCpG is the transcriptional repression of nearby genes. Several molecular mechanisms are thought to be responsible for this methylcytosine-mediated gene repression. Among them, the repression mediated by mCpG-binding proteins has been most extensively studied. Five mCpG-binding proteins, MBD1–4 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, mCpG-binding domain; mCpG, methylated CpG; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; U, unmethylated probe; M, methylated probe; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; wt, wild type; N, N-terminal; HA, haemagglutinin A. 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, mCpG-binding domain; mCpG, methylated CpG; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; U, unmethylated probe; M, methylated probe; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; wt, wild type; N, N-terminal; HA, haemagglutinin A. and MeCP2, have been identified in mammals and are collectively called MBD family proteins because these proteins share the mCpG-binding domain (1Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). MBD4 recognizes the T/G mismatched base pair, and is a component of the DNA repair machinery (3Hendrich B. Hardeland U., Ng, H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 4Riccio A. Aaltonen L.A. Godwin A.K. Loukola A. Percesepe A. Salovaara R. Masciullo V.

MBD1, MBD2, and MeCP2 have been well characterized for their gene-repressing activities. These proteins bind to mCpG via MBD and recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes to the binding sites via their separate domain called TRD (transcriptional repression domain). The deacetylation by HDAC of the core histones H3 and H4 is partly responsible for the gene repression mediated by these MBD proteins (1Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 5Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to these well characterized MBD proteins, the function of MBD3 remains unclear. Although MBD2 and MBD3 are highly homologous in and outside MBD, experiments performedin vitro and in vivo failed to demonstrate the mCpG-binding activity of recombinant mouse MBD3 (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). A controversy arose when Xenopus MBD3 was isolated and demonstrated to possess mCpG-binding activity (8Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have pointed out that amino acids in MBDs critical for binding to mCpG are present in Xenopus MBD3 but not in mammalian MBD3. These amino acid substitutions are likely responsible for the inability of mammalian MBD3 to bind to mCpG (9Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Wakefield R.I. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the NuRD/Mi2 complex contains MBD3 as a component (8Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y., Ng, H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The complex consists of Rpd3-like histone deacetylase, RbAp46/p48, MTA2, CHD4/Mi2beta, and MBD3 and possesses DNA-dependent ATPase, chromatin remodeling activity, and histone deacetylase activity (12Guschin D. Wade P.A. Kikyo N. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5238-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the NuRD/Mi2 complex plays a role in gene repression through histone deacetylation and chromatin packaging in methyl-CpG-rich regions (13Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the role of MBD3 in the NuRD/Mi2 complex is again controversial. In one study, it was shown that the human NuRD/Mi2 complex does not bind to mCpG, but is recruited to mCpG by interacting with the authentic mCpG-binding protein MBD2 (11Zhang Y., Ng, H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 14Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, the Xenopus NuRD/Mi2 complex and its component xMBD3 were shown to have specific mCpG-binding activity on their own (8Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed at clarifying the mCpG-binding activity of human MBD3. Specifically, we constructed mutant MBD3 proteins in which atypical amino acids occupying the critical residues in other MBD proteins were “corrected” to the conserved amino acids. We found that such MBD3 mutants indeed showed specific binding activity to mCpGin vitro as proposed previously. However, unexpectedly, such mutants did not associate with murine pericentromeric regions that are highly rich in mCpG. These results suggest that other factors are necessary for the targeting of MBD proteins in vivo in addition to the mCpG-binding activity. Mutant MBD3 cDNAs having point mutations were generated by the site-directed mutagenesis kit (TaKaRa). Other truncated cDNAs were generated by PCR. All cDNAs were confirmed for nucleotide sequences. Recombinant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli using pGEX5x-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pET32c (Novagen) vectors. For the analysis of subcellular localization, cDNAs encoding MBD2b and MBD3 tagged with the HA epitope at their N termini were subcloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), transfected, and expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. GST-fused recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli XLIblue MRF′ (Stratagene) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged MTA2 and HDAC1 proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3). The cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with the complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). After centrifugation, the supernatant was found not to contain soluble recombinant proteins. The pellet was dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), and 0.5% Triton X-100. These solutions were dialyzed against 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After removing insoluble materials by ultracentrifugation, partially purified MTA2 or HDAC1 was obtained. GST-fused MBD3 proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 60 min in PBS. After washing the beads twice with PBS to remove unbound GST-fused proteins, the beads were incubated with target proteins suspended in the binding buffer (PBS with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche)). The binding buffer for HDAC1 contained 0.3 m NaCl. After washing the beads three times with the binding buffer, the protein bound to the beads was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. EMSA was performed essentially as previously described (15Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that the buffer contained 20 ng of sonicated E. coli genomic DNA in 20 μl of binding reaction mixture. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides used as the probe was: 5′-GCCTTCAGACCCGGAGATCCAG-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-ACTGGGATCTCCCGGTCTGAAGG-3′ (lower strand). The two underlined cytosines were unmethylated in the unmethylated probe (U) and both methylated in the methylated probe (M). Approximately 100 ng of recombinant proteins was added to 20 μl of the reaction mixture containing the probes. Protein-DNA complexes were fractionated in 4% polyacrylamide gel supplemented with 3% glycerol in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. The gel was analyzed using a phosphoimager (Fuji, BAS-2000). After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were treated twice with TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 followed by incubation with anti-HA antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at room temperature and mounted on slides with the mounting medium containing DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). The samples were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). The purified GST-fused recombinant proteins and 0.1 pmol of labeled oligonucleotides were incubated in 100 μl of PBS with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 30 min. After a brief centrifugation to sediment the beads, the supernatant was collected for scintillation counting. After washing three times with PBS to remove unbound oligonucleotides, the beads were suspended in PBS. The slurry and the supernatant were transferred to Ready Cap (Beckman) and subjected to scintillation counting. DNA-binding efficiency was calculated as Efficiency = Ppt/(Sup+Ppt), where Sup is the count of the first supernatant and Ppt is that of the slurry (beads). An NMR study revealed that five amino acid residues in the MBD domain of human MBD1 play important roles in recognizing the methyl groups of mCpG/mCpG (16Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues, Val-20, Arg-22, Tyr-34, Arg-44, and Ser-45, are highly conserved in MBD family members. Interestingly, these residues are also conserved in xMBD3 but not in human and mouse MBD3s where Tyr-34 is replaced with Phe-34 (the numbering of equivalent amino acids in MBD1 and MBD3 is the same). In addition, the same study showed that Arg-30 of MBD1 MBD interacts with the DNA backbone. Basic amino acids are present at this position in most MBD proteins including xMBD3. However, mammalian MBD3s contain an atypical residue, His, at this position. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these two amino acid substitutions specific to mammalian MBD3 might be responsible for the reported inability of the protein to bind to mCpG (9Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we prepared three human MBD3 mutants (Fig. 1 A). MBD3-H30K and MBD3-F34Y encode mutant MBD3s in which His-30 and Phe-34 are replaced with Lys and Tyr, respectively. MBD3-H30K/F34Y encodes mutant MBD3 having both substitutions. These mutants were designed to correct the MBD3-specific atypical residues to conserved ones. The N-terminal 92 amino acids of wild type and mutant MBD3s were expressed in E. coli as N-terminally GST-fused proteins. These fusion proteins contain the entire MBD3 MBD that comprises the N-terminal 75 amino acids. The recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Fig. 1 B), and subjected to EMSA (Fig. 1 C). A 23-bp oligonucleotide containing a single CpG site at the center was used as a probe for EMSA. Two versions of oligonucleotides, U and M, were used. The single CpG/CpG is methylated not in U but in both strands in M. The GST-fused N-terminal wild type MBD3 (GST-wt(N)) produced a shifted band upon incubation with the labeled M probe. However, this shifted band was competed at similar efficiencies by a 100-fold excess of either unlabeled M or U. Thus, it was concluded that GST-wt(N) binds to DNA in a methylation-independent manner, as reported previously (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The GST-fused N-terminal MBD3-H30K (GST-H30K(N)) behaved in a manner similar to GST-wt(N). In contrast, the GST-fused N-terminal MBD-F34Y (GST-F34Y(N)) produced a shifted band upon incubation with the labeled M probe, and significantly, this band was competed more efficiently by 100-fold excess of unlabeled M than by unlabeled U. Therefore, it was suggested that substituting Tyr for Phe at residue 34 of MBD3 significantly increased the mCpG-specific DNA-binding activity. The GST-fused N-terminal MBD-H30K/F34Y (GST-H30K/F34Y(N)) showed essentially similar DNA-binding activities to those of GST-F34Y(N). Because the above experiments did not give a quantitative idea of the DNA-binding activities of mutant proteins, we quantitatively measured the DNA-binding efficiency of those proteins. Different amounts of purified GST-MBD fusion proteins were incubated with 1 nmof labeled U or M oligonucleotides in the absence of any cold DNA. The fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads, and both pellet fractions and supernatant fractions were scintillation-counted for the labeled probes. The bound fraction of the DNA probe was determined from the following equation: Bound Fraction = Ppt/(Sup+ Ppt), where Ppt and Sup represent the scintillation counts of Ppt and Sup, respectively. The values obtained in this way are plotted against the protein concentration (Fig.2). Both GST-wt(N) and GST-H30K(N) did not show significant binding to either U or M in this assay (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, GST-F34Y(N) showed weak but significant binding to the M probe (Fig. 2 C). It was not possible to deduce the K d value for this binding, however, because protein-DNA-binding was not saturated in the range of protein concentrations examined. Interestingly, GST-H30K/F34Y(N) showed a remarkable increase both in the binding affinity to DNA and in the specificity to bind to M rather than to U. K dbetween GST-H30K/F34Y(N) and M was estimated to be 9.32 × 10−8m (Fig. 2 D). In a similar experiment, K d between M and the GST-fused MBD domain of MBD2b (amino acids 1–88, the region equivalent to the MBD3 MBD used in this study), a well characterized methyl-DNA-binding protein (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), was estimated to be 2.67 × 10−8m (Fig. 2 E). Therefore, simultaneous substitutions of H30K and F34Y conferred to MBD3 a methyl-DNA-specific binding activity that was comparable with that of MBD2b. These results supported the previous hypothesis that the two atypical amino acids at residues 30 and 34 are responsible for the inability of MBD3 to bind to mCpG specifically. It was reported that Tyr-34 in MBD1 plays important roles both directly and indirectly in MBD1-mCpG binding (16Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Given the positive roles of this residue, it was expected that the substitution of Ala instead of Tyr for Phe-34 would not improve the DNA-binding activity of MBD3. Unexpectedly, however, GST-fused F34A(N) showed significantly higher DNA-binding activity than GST-wt(N) (Fig.3, A and B). Interestingly, GST-F34A(N) did not show any specificity to U or M, suggesting that Tyr-34 may be important for the mCpG-specific binding activity. The equivalent mutant of MBD2b, GST-MBD2b Y34A(N), also showed DNA-binding activity comparable with that of GST-F34A(N) (Fig.3, A and C). Similar observations have been previously reported for MeCP2. MeCP2 that had mutations at Tyr-123, the equivalent residue of Tyr-34 in MBD1, showed a reduced but significant binding activity to mCpG (18Free A. Wakefield R.I. Smith B.O. Dryden D.T. Barlow P.N. Bird A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of these results is that Phe-34 in MBD3 has an inhibitory effect on nonspecific DNA-binding activity, and substituting any amino acid for this residue may lead to the recovery of the nonspecific DNA-binding activity. Questions regarding the ability of MBD3 to bind with mCpG in vivo were raised in an experiment in which MBD3-GFP proteins were expressed in mouse cells (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In mouse cells, ∼50% of total mCpG is concentrated at pericentromeric regions that consist of the major satellite DNA. Pericentromeric regions are easily detected in interphase cells by virtue of their being brightly stained by DAPI. In a previous study (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar,22Nan X. Tate P., Li, E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), it was found that overexpressed mouse MBD1, MBD2, MBD4, and rat MeCP2 were localized at pericentromeric regions, supporting the proficient mCpG-binding activity of these proteins in vivo. In contrast, the overexpressed MBD3 protein was not localized at pericentromeric regions and instead was homogeneously distributed in the nuclei when MBD3 was expressed at a low level or accumulated as nuclear foci when it was expressed at a high level. Together with the data that human MBD3 does not bind to mCpG in vitro, it was concluded that MBD3 does not function as an mCpG-binding proteinin vivo (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell.

Because we have found that the H30K/F34Y MBD3 mutant binds to mCpG efficiently in vitro, we were interested in examining whether or not this mutant protein associated with mCpG in vivo. The MBD domains of wild type and mutant human MBD3s, as well as MBD2b, were overexpressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells as HA-tagged proteins by transient DNA transfection. The cells were stained with DAPI for pericentromeric regions and with anti-HA antibodies for MBD localization (Fig. 4). MBD2b MBD was localized at the pericentromeric regions (Fig. 4, c), whereas wild type MBD3-derived MBD were distributed diffusely in the nuclei, as expected (Fig. 4, a). Neither H30K, F34Y (data not shown), nor H30K/F34Y mutant MBD3 MBD (Fig. 4, b) co-localized at the pericentromeric regions. Because MBD3 H30K/F34Y specifically binds to mCpG in vitro (Fig. 2 E), these results suggested that the ability of MBD proteins to associate with mCpG in vivo is not a simple reflection of the ability of these proteins to bind to mCpG in vitro. Next, we performed similar analyses for the mutated versions of MBD2b. MBD2b MBD carrying the two substitutions found in wild type MBD3 (MBD2b K30H/Y34F(N)) was not co-localized at the pericentromeric regions, as expected (Fig. 4, e). Unexpectedly, MBD2b Y34F, which binds to DNA in an mCpG-independent manner (Fig. 3 D), was co-localized at the pericentromeric regions (Fig. 4, d). Because MBD2b Y34F and MBD2b K30H/Y34F showed similar binding behaviors (i.e. mCpG-independent DNA-binding activity) (Fig. 3,D and E), the different localizations of these two versions of MBD2b MBD in vivo again suggest the presence of other factors that determine the localization of MBD proteinsin vivo in addition to the binding ability of the protein to DNA measured in vitro. MBD4 specifically recognizes the mCpG/TpG mismatch sequence (3Hendrich B. Hardeland U., Ng, H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 4Riccio A.

Genet. 1999; 23: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because we found that MBD3 MBD did not bind to mCpG/mCpG specifically, we next examined the possibility that MBD3 binds to the mCpG/TpG mismatch sequences using the assay system described in Fig. 2. GST-fused recombinant protein of MBD4 MBD binds to an oligonucleotide containing CpG/TpG and at a higher affinity to one containing mCpG/TpG, as expected (Fig.5 A). Under the same conditions, GST-fused MBD3 MBD did not bind to either CpG/TpG or mCpG/TpG. Recently, it was reported that a minor population of methylcytosine in the genome of mouse embryonic cells is present as CpA-dinucleotides (19Ramsahoye B.H. Biniszkiewicz D. Lyko F. Clark V. Bird A.P. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5237-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). We also tested the possibility that MBD3 MBD might bind specifically to this sequence. The recombinant MBD3 MBD protein did not show appreciable binding ability to either an mCpA/TpG- or a CpA/TpG-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that MBD3 does not recognize these relatively minor populations of methylcytosine in the genome. MBD3 was identified as a component of the NuRD/Mi2 complex (8Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y., Ng, H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In vitro, it was shown that human MBD3 directly binds to many NuRD/Mi2 components, including MTA2, HDAC1, RbAp46, and RbAp48. We examined regions in MBD3 responsible for binding to MTA2 and HDAC1. MBD3 (also called MBD3a) (11Zhang Y., Ng, H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) and its deletion mutants were expressed as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig.6 A). MBD3 proteins were incubated with recombinant full-length MTA2 or HDAC1 and sedimented with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads. After washing the beads, MBD3 and associated proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE. All MBD3 proteins were confirmed for their expression and absorption by glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Fig. 6, B andC). Both MTA2 and HDAC1 were associated with all versions of MBD3 except one that lacks the N-terminal 92 amino acids that contain MBD (ΔN92). Reciprocally, the MBD3 mutant consisting of MBD only (ΔC93) associated with MTA2 and HDAC1. Therefore, MBD is necessary and sufficient for binding to MTA2 and HDAC1. However, a significant reduction of the recovery of MTA2 and HDAC1 was observed in an experiment using ΔC174 compared with that in experiments using mutants with shorter C-terminal deletions (such as ΔC221). Therefore, it was suggested that there might be a region facilitating MTA2- and HDAC1-MBD3 association in amino acids 174–220. We also examined whether MBD3 H30K/F34Y, a proficient type of the protein in methyl-CpG binding, associates with MTA2 and HDAC1 or not (Fig. 6 D). The results showed that this mutant protein interacts with MTA2 and HDAC1 as efficiently as the wild type MBD3. In this study, we demonstrated that human MBD3 has no appreciable mCpG-specific DNA-binding activity. The lack of DNA-binding activity in MBD3 appears to be due to two reasons. First, the amino acid substitution of the well conserved Lys-30 and Tyr-34 in MBD3 is the major reason why MBD3 lost its mCpG-specific DNA-binding activity. This was proven by the fact that simultaneous corrections of these amino acids to the conserved residues resulted in conferring significant mCpG-binding activity to MBD3. Second, the presence of Phe at residue 34 positively inhibits the potential DNA-binding activity of MBD3 because the F34A mutant showed significant DNA-binding activity, albeit nonspecific to methyl or non-methyl CpG. One potential explanation for the lack of any DNA-binding activity in the presence of Phe at residue 34 is that this bulky amino acid may significantly change the structural framework of the protein. However, given that MBD2b Y34F and MBD2b K30H/Y34F bind to DNA nonspecifically (Fig. 3, D andE), the effect of Phe at residue 34 appears to be context-dependent. Collectively, the presence of Tyr at residue 34 (and equivalent positions) in conventional MBDs is important for conferring mCpG specificity, a biochemical result consistent with that of the structural study (16Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Another unexpected finding is that even if the H30K/F34Y MBD3 mutant protein showed significant mCpG-binding activity in vitro, when expressed in vivo it did not associate with the mCpG-rich pericentromeric regions in NIH 3T3 cells. This observation led us to suggest that thein vitro binding activity of the MBD proteins does not directly lead to the association of the proteins with the mCpG-rich regions in vivo. MBD2b and MBD3 are highly homologous (71% identity), and MBD2 and MBD3 genes have very similar genome structures although mapped to different chromosomes in mouse and human (20Hendrich B. Abbott C. McQueen H. Chambers D. Cross S. Bird A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that these genes have diverged from a relatively recent common ancestor (20Hendrich B. Abbott C. McQueen H. Chambers D. Cross S. Bird A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Why then did MBD3 lose its DNA-binding activity during evolution, and does it function as a core component of the NuRD/Mi2 complex while maintaining MBD? In this study, we demonstrated that MBD3 MBD is necessary and sufficient for the physical interaction with MTA2 and HDAC1. We believe that this secondary role played by MBD is the reason why MBD3 has evolutionarily conserved the apparently “useless” MBD. The dual roles of MBD, namely binding to mCpG and interacting with NuRD/Mi2 components, are not exclusive of each other because we have noted that the MBD3 H30K/F34Y mutant protein associates with MTA2 or HDAC1 (Fig.6 D) and that MBD2b MBD also interacts with MTA2 and HDAC1in vitro. 2M. Saito and F. Ishikawa, unpublished data. However, we do not know whether one MBD molecule simultaneously interacts with mCpG and proteins or not. The substitutions at Lys-30 and Tyr-34 to His-30 and Phe-34, respectively, should have specified the role of MBD3 as a protein-interacting protein rather than as a DNA-binding protein. Previously (15Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we have shown that MBD2 and MBD3 form a heterodimer via an interaction between the coiled-coil domains of the two proteins. Therefore, it can be imagined that the ancestor of MBD2/MBD3 forms a similar dimer that has two mCpG-interacting domains in one complex. During the course of evolution, MBD3 MBD lost its mCpG-binding activity and became specialized as an adaptor protein for MTA2 and HDAC1. The current MBD2-MBD3 heterodimer has a single mCpG-interacting domain provided by MBD2 and two potential MTA2/HDAC1-interacting domains provided by MBD2 and MBD3. However, it is possible that the ability of MBD2 to bind to MTA2 or HDAC1 is not functional in vivobecause the same region binds to mCpG. There are other examples of domain structures that are evolutionarily conserved while losing their original function. PAF400, a component of the PCAF complex, has a typical domain characterizing the ATM family (21Vassilev A. Yamauchi J. Kotani T. Prives C. Avantaggiati M.L. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 869-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the PAF400 ATM kinase-like domain has mutations at amino acid residues responsible for the kinase activity, and indeed, no catalytic activity was demonstrated with PAF400. As proposed for MBD3 in this study, a second important role may be achieved by the catalytically inactive ATM domain of PAF400. One unexpected observation was that the H30K/F34Y MBD3 mutant did not associate with the mCpG-rich pericentromeric regions in NIH 3T3 cells. Two possibilities can be envisioned. First, it is possible that the MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4 proteins, which show proficient pericentromeric association in vivo, may have a second domain in addition to MBD that facilitates the localization of proteins at specific regions in vivo. MBD3 may not have this second domain. There have been precedent studies suggesting this possibility. It was reported that when a MeCP2 mutant protein that had a deletion in MBD was overexpressed, a small fraction of the protein still associated with the pericentromeric regions. This result suggested the presence of a second domain in MeCP2 that MBD-independently facilitated the localization of MeCP2 at the pericentromeric regions (22Nan X. Tate P., Li, E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In another study, it was found that GFP-MBD1 localization at the pericentromeric regions did not change markedly in DNMT1 −/− ES cells that contained a very low level of mCpG (2Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the localization of MBD1 at the pericentromeric regions might be partly mCpG-independent. The second possibility is that MBD3 may have an additional domain that facilitates the recruitment of the protein to the NuRD·Mi2 complex, and this domain is not present in other MBD proteins. Recently, the zinc-finger protein called p66 was identified as a component of the MeCP1 complex. p66 also binds to MBD3, but not to MBD2, and possibly determines the intra-nuclear localization of MBD3 (23Feng Q. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). p66 or its related proteins may be a candidate for the factor that positively influences the localization of MBD3 in the NuRD·Mi2 complex and outside the pericentromeric regions. Interestingly, MBD2b MBD Y34F accumulated at the pericentromeric regions although it had no mCpG-specific DNA-binding activity. This result suggests that the mCpG-specific DNA-binding activity is largely dispensable for the pericentromeric localization of MBD proteins and supports the notion that a second determinant is required for the correct targeting of the protein in vivo. Because we have not identified any mutant MBD that lacks nonspecific DNA-binding activity but retains the ability to accumulate at the pericentromeric regions, it remains unclear whether the nonspecific DNA-binding activity of MBD proteins is required for the heterochromatin targetingin vivo or not. The second mutation of K30H in MBD2b abolished the pericentromeric accumulation of the protein when it was present simultaneously with Y34F. This observation suggests that a region distinct from MBD but overlapping with Lys-30 may be important to recruit wild type MBD2 to the mCpG-rich regions in vivo, according to the first hypothesis. Although both MBD2b MBD and MBD3 H30K/F34Y associate with MTA2 and HDAC1 in vitro (discussed above), MBD2b MBD is localized at the pericentromeric regions, whereas MBD3 H30K/F34Y is not. This observation indicates that the interaction of MBD with MTA2 and HDAC1 in vitro is not the determinant of the protein localization in vivo. Therefore, there should be a second domain in MBD3 outside of amino acid 30 or 34 that is recognized by the NuRD/Mi2 complex, according to the second hypothesis. In this study, we have expressed and analyzed recombinant proteins containing the MBDs of MBD2b and MBD3 but lacking unique regions such as the glutamate-rich C-terminal tail in MBD3. Therefore, the additional domain unique to MBD2b or MBD3 should reside in the highly conserved MBDs. No noticeable sequence was recognized in the MBD sequences of MBD2b and MBD3, however. Further studies are necessary to determine why the H30K/F34Y MBD3 mutant did not associate with the mCpG-rich region in vivo. We thank Dr. Yi Zhang for providing mouse MTA2 cDNA. We thank F. Nishizaki, A. Orii, and A. Katayama for excellent secretarial work and M. Tamura for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2147865003,"Fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) belongs to a distinct subclass of FGFs that is expressed in the developing and adult CNS. We disrupted the Fgf14 gene and introduced an Fgf14(N-beta-Gal) allele that abolished Fgf14 expression and generated a fusion protein (FGF14N-beta-gal) containing the first exon of FGF14 and beta-galactosidase. Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder. Neuropharmacological studies showed that Fgf14-deficient mice have reduced responses to dopamine agonists. The paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder phenocopies a form of dystonia, a disease often associated with dysfunction of the putamen. Strikingly, the FGF14N-beta-gal chimeric protein was efficiently transported into neuronal processes in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Together, these studies identify a novel function for FGF14 in neuronal signaling and implicate FGF14 in axonal trafficking and synaptosomal function."
https://openalex.org/W2095042541,"The relative contribution of kainate receptors to ongoing glutamatergic activity is at present unknown. We report the presence of spontaneous, miniature, and minimal stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that are mediated solely by kainate receptors (EPSC(kainate)) or by both AMPA and kainate receptors (EPSC(AMPA/kainate)). EPSC(kainate) and EPSC(AMPA/kainate) are selectively enriched in CA1 interneurons and mossy fibers synapses of CA3 pyramidal neurons, respectively. In CA1 interneurons, the decay time constant of EPSC(kainate) (circa 10 ms) is comparable to values obtained in heterologous expression systems. In both hippocampal neurons, the quantal release of glutamate generates kainate receptor-mediated EPSCs that provide as much as half of the total glutamatergic current. Kainate receptors are, therefore, key players of the ongoing glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus."

Low temperature is a major environmental limitation on plant geographical distribution and productivity.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, a similar acclimation process termed the “cold shock response” under low temperatures (18Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and has been extensively characterized in Escherichia coli (19Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). CspA, the major cold shock protein of E. coli, accounts for more than 10% of total protein synthesis during the cold acclimation phase (20Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). ThecspA gene has been cloned and sequenced, and primer extension studies have confirmed that cspA transcript levels also increase in response to cold shock (21Tanabe H. Goldstein J. Yang M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3867-3873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli CspA binds to RNA to destabilize secondary structures; therefore, it was proposed that high levels of CspA could facilitate translation at low temperatures by eliminating secondary structures in mRNA (22Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Such a function is critical for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperatures and may also have an effect on transcription. In addition, recent reports revealed that CspA functions as a transcription anti-terminator and is responsible for the expression of a set of cold-responsive genes (23Bae W. Xia B. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of a wheat CA-related gene, WCSP1, which encodes a putative protein with high sequence similarity with the bacterial Csp protein family and retroviral CCHC-type zinc finger proteins. We demonstrate that WCSP1 is a novel eukaryotic cold-regulated nucleic acid-binding protein capable of binding ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA homopolymers. Collectively, the in vitro nucleotide binding functions, structural similarity to CspA, and responsiveness to low temperature suggest that WCSP1 may be involved in the regulation of CA-related genes. Winter wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chihoku) were used as the source of plant tissue for all experiments. Prolonged temperature experiments for RNA and protein analyses utilized germinated seeds that were planted in commercial potting mix, irrigated with tap water, and grown in a growth chamber that was maintained under 22 °C/18 °C (16 h day/8 h night) cycles for 14 days. Cold acclimation was stimulated by transferring plants to 6 °C/2 °C (8 h day/16 h night) cycles in an environmentally controlled growth room. Plants were harvested prior to and after 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, and 18 days of cold treatment. Crown tissue was harvested, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processed for RNA extraction as described below. For protein analysis, seedlings were shifted (21 days after germination) from non-acclimating conditions to 4 °C (constant) with 8 h day/16 h night photoperiods. Crown tissue was harvested prior to and 2, 5, 10, 20, and 47 days after transfer to cold-acclimating conditions and immediately plunged in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until processed for total protein extraction as described below. All plants used to monitor the response to short term stress treatments were grown hydroponically. Surface-sterilized seeds were imbibed in the dark for 12 h and evenly distributed atop a plastic mesh grid supported by a container filled with tap water. The container was maintained in a growth chamber at 25 °C under continuous illumination. After growing for 7 days, wheat seedlings were subjected to environmental stress treatments. Low temperature, heat, ABA, salinity, and dehydration treatments were conducted by transferring mesh grids to separate containers with tap water (4 or 42 °C), 50 μm ABA solution, 200 mm NaCl, and no water, respectively. Root and shoot tissue was harvested prior to and 1, 2, 6, 10, and 24 h post-transfer. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until processed for RNA extraction. Isolation of the cDNA clone was performed using a macro-array approach. Briefly, plasmid clones representing a cDNA library constructed from cold-acclimated crown tissue were denatured and slot-blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) with a vacuum immunoblotter (ATTO; Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were subsequently UV-fixed and used for differential hybridization with total RNA, which was isolated from cold- and non-acclimated crown tissue (as described below). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from both cold- and non-acclimated crown tissues, random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP, and used for blot hybridization. Hybridization and washes were performed according to standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Signals from arrayed DNA were quantified by a BAS1000 image analyzer (Fuji Film; Tokyo, Japan), and clones that interacted strongly with cold-acclimated RNA were subsequently sequenced as described below. The cloned DNA insert identified from library screening was completely sequenced using a Thermo Sequence v2.0 kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a 373A DNA sequencer model (Applied Biosystems; San Jose, CA). DNA sequence analysis was performed with DNASIS software (Hitachi; Yokohama, Japan), and the sequence alignment was generated with CLUSTAL X (25Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35291) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was calculated by the Neighbor-Joining method and displayed using TreeView software (26Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from wheat root, shoot, and crown tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated in 1.0% formamide-agarose gels and subsequently transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) containing salmon testes DNA (10 μg/ml) was used for both pre-hybridization and hybridization at 65 °C overnight. RNA blots were subsequently washed once with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR x-ray film (Kodak; New Haven, CT) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Seventeen consecutive amino acids (GFISPEDGSEDLFVHQS) were selected from within the RNP-1 and RNP-2 regions of WCSP1 (see Fig. 1 A) and produced as a synthetic peptide (an N-terminal cysteine residue was added for coupling to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein). The peptide (CGFISPEDGSEDLFVHQS) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits for the production of polyclonal antibodies. The peptide was coupled to Sepharose 4B via the N-terminal cysteine residue and used for affinity purification of immune serum. Peptide synthesis, polyclonal antibody production, and affinity purification were performed by Alpha Diagnostics International (San Antonio, TX). Harvested crown tissue (grown as described above) was ground with liquid nitrogen, and ∼200 mg was boiled for 5 min with SDS-extraction buffer and supplemented with 1× Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Extracted total proteins were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Five volumes of ice-cold acetone were added to the collected supernatant, and samples were maintained at −20 °C for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and used for subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (15 μg/μl per lane). Anti-peptide primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (AmershamBiosciences) were used (1:2,000) for detection of WCSP1-like translation product with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A full-length WCSP1 fusion protein construct (GST:WCSP1) was created by incorporating an in-frame N-terminal BamHI site and utilizing a pre-existing C-terminal XhoI site for cloning into the pGEX6P-3 expression vector. A GeneEditor in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis kit was used (Promega; Madison, WI) for the creation of the N-terminal restriction site with a mutagenic primer (5′-GTCCTTCGGTTTCGGGGATCCAAGATGGGGGAGAGG-3′). Plasmid DNA was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into predigested pGEX6P-3 vector. A truncated mutant (GST:TGA-132) lacking C-terminal zinc fingers was created by introducing a stop codon at amino acid position 132 with a mutagenic primer (5′-CCGTGGATGATACAAGTGC-3′) and utilizing the cloned GST:WCSP1 construct as the template for mutation. Mutant constructs were confirmed with complete sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination reaction. E. coli BL21-DE3 (Novagen; Madison, WI) competent cells that were transformed with either GST:WCSP1, GST:TGA-132, or control pGEX6P-3 vector were grown in 2× YT media until the OD reached 0.6, and recombinant protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cultures were subsequently grown for 1 additional hour at 37 °C, after which cells were pelleted, resuspended, in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted with sonication. Lysed samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by batch purification with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted GST, GST:WCSP1, and GST:TGA-132 fusion proteins were applied to Centricon YM-30 spin columns (Millipore; Bedford, MA), concentrated, and washed five times with an equal volume of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentration was estimated using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye for visualization of recombinant protein purity. Gel retardation analysis was performed as described previously (28Lee F.J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sapp M. Knippers R. Richter A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6803-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. 150 ng of either single-stranded (M13mp8) or double-stranded (M13mp8 RFI) DNA (Nippon Gene; Toyama, Japan) was incubated with GST fusion proteins (GST:WCSP1 or GST:TGA-132), which were added to binding reactions in amounts ranging from 0, 7, 70, 350, to 700 pmol. Purified GST was used as a negative control and incorporated as 700 pmol in binding reactions. Nucleotides and proteins were incubated in 15 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and maintained on ice for 30 min. To test relative affinities of ssDNA and dsDNA binding, 350 pmol of GST:WCSP1 was added to assays and incubated with nucleotides (150 ng) in binding buffer with variable final concentrations of KCl (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mm). All binding reactions were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose) and were resolved with 50 volts for 60 min. DNA gel shifts were subsequently visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Ribohomopolymer binding assays were performed as described previously (30Li J. Jia D. Chen X. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2269-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Yang Y.Y. Yin G.L. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13254-13259Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with a modification in the scale of binding reactions. 5 pmol of either GST:WCSP1, GST:TGA-132, or GST alone was added to 5 μl of ribohomopolymer-agarose beads (prepared in the same concentration as described previously, (30Li J. Jia D. Chen X. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2269-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) in 20 μl of RHPA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) with a final NaCl concentration of either 125 or 250 mm and 1 mg/ml heparin. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and subsequently washed three times in 1× RHPA buffer with final NaCl concentrations of either 125 or 250 mm. After the last wash, samples were dried in an Iwaki HVC-500 halogen vacuum concentrator (Tokyo, Japan) and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. For each construct, 10% of input protein (0.5 pmol) was resuspended in 100 μl of 1X SDS sample buffer to serve as a control for the affinity of recombinant proteins to ribohomopolymer-agarose beads. 20 μl of boiled samples (input controls and recovered proteins) were utilized for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and subsequent protein blot analyses with goat-anti-GST primary antibodies (1:2,000) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey-anti-goat secondary antibodies (1:2,000). Protein blot analysis was performed with the ECL detection system. A cDNA clone that accumulates in cold-acclimated crown tissue was isolated by differential screening of a cDNA macro-array with cold- and non-acclimated radio-labeled total RNA. The clone contained a 690-bp open reading frame that encodes a putative 21.4-kDa translation product (WCSP1). The deduced amino acid sequence was high in glycine content (43%) and lacked any possible sorting sequences such as nuclear localization and secretion signals (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, WCSP1 is characterized by multiple distinct functional domains (Fig.1). The N terminus contains a cold shock domain (CSD) with two consensus RNA-binding motifs (RNP1 and RNP2, Fig.2 A), which are among the most widely found and conserved RNA binding sequences known (32Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the CSD, a large glycine-rich region is interspersed by three C-terminal CCHC-type zinc finger motifs (Figs. 1 and 2 A). The CCHC-type zinc fingers bear resemblance to those contained within retroviral nucleocapsid protein (33Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 34Sato S.M. Sargent T.D. Development. 1991; 112: 747-753PubMed Google Scholar, 35Webb J.R. McMaster W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13994-14002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are interspersed with glycine-rich domains. Homology searches indicated that the WCSP1 amino acid sequence was highly conserved with glycine-rich proteins (GRP) fromArabidopsis thaliana GRP-2 and GRP-2b (36de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) andNicotiana sylvestris GRP-2 (37Obokata J. Ohme M. Hayashida N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 953-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A), whose functions are unknown. The three domains in WCSP1 are also the components of the GRP-2 proteins of Arabidopsis and N. sylvestris; however, they contain two CCHC-type zinc fingers interspersed within the glycine-rich regions (Fig. 2 A). Striking homology was also found with the E. coli CspA cold shock protein family (Fig. 2 A). The CSD has been identified in many RNA/DNA-binding proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (38Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and CSD sequences of several CSD proteins including bacterial cold shock proteins have been compared. A phylogenetic tree revealed that WCSP1 belongs to the same group as the previously characterized GRPs of plants (Fig. 2 B). In addition, there appears to an additional group of CSD proteins in plants because theArabidopsis genome sequence revealed two additional clones,T05494 and T00837 (Fig. 2 B). Northern blot analyses were performed to assessWCSP1 expression during a prolonged period of CA (Fig.3 A). WCSP1transcript accumulation in crown tissue was observed at low levels before initiation of cold acclimation and WCSP1 expression steadily increased throughout the 18-day testing period (Fig.3 A). Short term cold treatment was used to refine the critical time period for WCSP1 induction in response to low temperature (Fig. 3 B). Shoot and root samples from hydroponically cold-treated seedlings determined that WCSP1mRNA induction occurs within hours subsequent to low temperature exposure. WCSP1 mRNA levels were slightly higher in roots than shoots, but their induction patterns were similar during the 24-h testing period (Fig. 3 B). Hydroponically grown seedlings were utilized to reveal the response ofWCSP1 to multiple environmental stresses (Fig.4). As compared with low temperature-induced expression patterns, no detectable cumulative induction pattern was found for WCSP1 transcript within the 24-h testing period for environmental stress applications (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data support the notion that WCSP1 may function in association to low temperature response and may act independently of other major environmental stresses. For the investigation of WCSP1 protein levels in response to cold acclimation, we utilized an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody that was raised against an amino acid sequence within the RNA binding domain of WCPS1 (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis of equally loaded total protein extracts revealed two protein bands of 27 and 25 kDa, which were detected with antiserum (Fig.5). Both protein bands demonstrated a gradual increase in response to prolonged periods of cold acclimation. Striking homology was found within the CSD and CCHC zinc finger motifs of WCSP1 (Fig.2 A) to the well characterized E. coli Csp family proteins (22Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and retroviral transcription factors, both of which have been found to bind ssDNA and RNA. Because of the unique nature of multiple nucleotide binding domains in WCSP1, interspersed glycine-rich regions, and multiple CCHC-type zinc fingers, the capacity to bind dsDNA was tested also. Recombinant GST:WCSP1 and a mutant fusion protein (GST:TGA-132), which lacked C-terminal zinc fingers (Fig.1 B), were purified to near homogeneity. An empty pGEX6P-3 vector was used for the purification of GST and as a negative control in the DNA and RNA binding assays (Fig6). DNA binding assays that utilized M13 mp8 phage DNA determined that WCSP1 is capable of binding both ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig.7) with high affinity. Gel shifting was apparent when 7 pmol of purified GST:WCSP1 proteins was added to binding reactions. When the quantity of GST:WCSP1 was increased in individual binding reactions, successive retardation of nucleotide migration was observed with both ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig.7 A). Conversely, when 700 pmol of GST was added to the binding reaction as a negative control, neither ssDNA nor dsDNA shifted (Fig. 7, A and C). Relative affinity of nucleotide-protein complexes was assessed by incorporating a range of salt concentration into binding reactions. GST:WCSP1 fusion proteins maintained association to both ssDNA and dsDNA in KCl concentrations up to 400 mm. GST:TGA-132, which contains a premature stop codon immediately before C-terminal zinc fingers, was used to separately evaluate the contribution of the cold shock domain and CCHC zinc fingers for the affinity to ssDNA and dsDNA. When increasing amounts of GST:TGA-132 fusion proteins were added to ssDNA, nucleotide-protein complex retardation was shifted in a fashion similar to that of GST:WCSP1. However, the affinity of GST:TGA-132 fusion proteins to dsDNA was severely compromised (Fig. 7 C). Usage of ribohomopolymer-agarose beads determined that GST:WCSP1 and the truncated GST:TGA-132 are both capable of binding RNA. Both fusion proteins displayed a preference for binding poly(G) and poly(U) and were detected above 10% control inputs (Fig.8). Alteration of salt concentration in binding and washing buffers did not compromise the fusion protein affinity for ribohomopolymers. GST, which was used as a negative control in binding reactions, failed to associate with RNA homopolymers. Collectively, these functional analyses indicate that the cold shock domain of WCSP1 is likely critical for ssDNA/RNA binding affinity. Secondly, multiple C-terminal CCHC zinc fingers and flexible interspersed glycine-rich regions facilitate binding to dsDNA. Winter wheat has the capacity to become highly freeze-tolerant during the cold acclimation phase; however, the molecular mechanisms of this process are still largely unknown. Because of the intricacies of CA, it is important to increase the number of identified CA-related genes/proteins in an attempt to eventually obtain a comprehensive understanding of CA. Here within, we describe a member of a novel class of plant cold acclimation-related genes, WCSP1, and an initial functional characterization of the gene product. In E. coli, downshifts in growth temperature induce cellular adaptation to low temperature (18Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cold-induced proteins, including a ribosome-associated protein (CsdA), a ribonuclease (PNP), a recombination factor (RecA), and a nucleoid-associated protein (H-NS) as well as CspA family proteins have been identified and extensively characterized (18Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When comparing characterized cold-induced proteins between plants and E. coli, there are few similarities. This observation, however, is in contrast to the highly conserved heat shock protein family (39Karlin S. Brocchieri L. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As a result, it is of great interest to determine whether there is a common mechanism of cold acclimation exhibited by both bacteria and plants. The CspA protein family members are ∼7 kDa and contain only a CSD. Eukaryotic homologues, however, contain an N-terminal CSD and additional carboxyl-terminal domains such as basic/aromatic islands, Arg-Gly repeat motifs, and CCHC-type zinc fingers (40Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). E. coli CspA binds to ssDNA/RNA without apparent sequence specificity and has been proposed to function as an RNA chaperone that facilitates efficient translation at low temperature (22Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Two internal highly conserved consensus RNA-binding motifs (RNP-1 and RNP-2) are critical for CSD nucleotide binding activity (41Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A recent"
https://openalex.org/W1999824728,"The functional relevance of brain activity during visuospatial tasks was investigated by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The cognitive tasks involved visuospatial operations on visually presented and mentally imagined material (""mental clock task""). While visuospatial operations were associated with activation of the intraparietal sulcus region bilaterally, only the group which received rTMS to the right parietal lobe showed an impairment of performance during and immediately after rTMS. This functional parietal asymmetry might indicate a capacity of the right parietal lobe to compensate for a temporary suppression of the left. This is compatible with current theories of spatial hemineglect and constitutes a constraint for models of distributed information processing in the parietal lobes."
https://openalex.org/W1975543396,"Here we present the identification and characterization of dHb9, the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate Hb9, which encodes a factor central to motorneuron (MN) development. We show that dHb9 regulates neuronal fate by restricting expression of Lim3 and Even-skipped (Eve), two homeodomain (HD) proteins required for development of distinct neuronal classes. Also, dHb9 and Lim3 are activated independently of each other in a virtually identical population of ventrally and laterally projecting MNs. Surprisingly, dHb9 represses Lim3 cell nonautonomously in a subset of dorsally projecting MNs, revealing a novel role for intercellular signaling in the establishment of neuronal fate in Drosophila. Lastly, we provide evidence that dHb9 and Eve regulate each other's expression through Groucho-dependent crossrepression. This mutually antagonistic relationship bears similarity to the crossrepressive relationships between pairs of HD proteins that pattern the vertebrate neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W2005633855,"No direct evidence has been found for expression of functional AMPA receptors by dorsal root ganglion neurons despite immunocytochemical evidence suggesting they are present. Here we report evidence for expression of functional AMPA receptors by a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion neurons. The AMPA receptors are most prominently located near central terminals of primary afferent fibers. AMPA and kainate receptors were detected by recording receptor-mediated depolarization of the central terminals under selective pharmacological conditions. We demonstrate that activation of presynaptic AMPA receptors by exogenous agonists causes inhibition of glutamate release from the terminals, possibly via primary afferent depolarization (PAD). These results challenge the traditional view that GABA and GABAA receptors exclusively mediate PAD, and indicate that PAD is also mediated by glutamate acting on presynaptically localized AMPA and kainate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2122727823,"We reported previously that exogenously added human group V phospholipase A2(hVPLA2) could elicit leukotriene B4(LTB4) biosynthesis in human neutrophils (Han, S. K., Kim, K. P., Koduri, R., Bittova, L., Munoz, N. M., Leff, A. R., Wilton, D. C., Gelb, M. H., and Cho, W. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11881–11888). To determine the mechanism of the hVPLA2-induced LTB4biosynthesis in neutrophils, we thoroughly examined the effects of hVPLA2 and their lipid products on the activity of group IVA cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and LTB4biosynthesis under different conditions. As low as 1 nmexogenous hVPLA2 was able to induce the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and LTB4. Typically, AA and LTB4 were released in two phases, which were synchronized with a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) near the perinuclear region and cPLA2 phosphorylation. A cellular PLA2 assay showed that hVPLA2 acted primarily on the outer plasma membrane, liberating fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), whereas cPLA2 acted on the perinuclear membrane. Lyso-PC and polyunsaturated fatty acids including AA activated cPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase by increasing [Ca2+]i and inducing cPLA2 phosphorylation, which then led to LTB4biosynthesis. The delayed phase was triggered by the binding of secreted LTB4 to the cell surface LTB4receptor, which resulted in a rise in [Ca2+]i and cPLA2phosphorylation through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. These results indicate that a main role of exogenous hVPLA2 in neutrophil activation and LTB4 biosynthesis is to activate cPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase primarily by liberating from the outer plasma membrane lyso-PC that induces [Ca2+]i increase and cPLA2 phosphorylation and that hVPLA2-induced LTB4 production is augmented by the positive feedback activation of cPLA2 by LTB4. We reported previously that exogenously added human group V phospholipase A2(hVPLA2) could elicit leukotriene B4(LTB4) biosynthesis in human neutrophils (Han, S. K., Kim, K.

Multiple forms of mammalian PLA2 have been identified from mammalian tissues, which include several forms of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) (1Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), group IVA Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (2Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Recent studies have indicated that sPLA2s work in concert with cPLA2 to induce eicosanoid formation in different cells (4Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Neutrophils are inflammatory cells that release AA and 5-lipoxygenase products, most notably leukotriene B4(LTB4), upon activation by various agonists, including a bacterial peptide, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). It was reported that human neutrophils contain several forms of endogenous PLA2s, including cPLA2, iPLA2, and group V and group X sPLA2s (7Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P. Borregaard N. Reithmeier R. Lindsay T.F. Lichtenberger C. Reinisch W. Lambeau G. Arm J. Tischfield J. Gelb M.H. Rubin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5061-5073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, roles of these PLA2s in inflammatory actions of neutrophils, biosynthesis and release of LTB4 in particular, have not been elucidated fully. Based on the effects of exogenously added sPLA2, AA, and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) products on cPLA2 activity, it was postulated earlier that stimulus-induced AA release or exocytosis of sPLA2 activates cPLA2 by initiating the formation of LTB4 which leads to the phosphorylation of cPLA2 (8Wijkander J. O'Flaherty J.T. Nixon A.B. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, both sPLA2 and cPLA2 were shown to be involved in the fMLP-stimulated AA release from human neutrophils (9Marshall J. Krump E. Lindsay T. Downey G. Ford D.A. Zhu P. Walker P. Rubin B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it was reported that fMLP-induced secretion of group V sPLA2 from human neutrophils did not lead to LTB4 biosynthesis (7Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P.

Instead, cPLA2 was reported to be entirely responsible for the fMLP-stimulated LTB4 release from human neutrophils (7Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P. Borregaard N.

To understand better the interplay between sPLA2 and cPLA2 in leukotriene biosynthesis in neutrophils, we thoroughly examined the effects of sPLA2s and their lipid products on cPLA2activity and leukotriene biosynthesis under different conditions. Results not only account for the discrepancy in previous reports but also provide new insights into the mechanism by which sPLA2and cPLA2 work in concert to achieve effective and controlled leukotriene biosynthesis in neutrophils.

Human neutrophils were prepared from heparinized venous blood collected from healthy medication-free donors by dextran sedimentation, followed by isolymph centrifugation and removal of remaining red blood cells by hypotonic lysis (14Hansel T.T. de Vries I.J.M. Iff T. Rihs S. Wandzilak M. Betz S. Blaser K. Walker C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 145: 105-110Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The resultant cell population consisted of >95% neutrophils with >98% viability as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Dual radiolabeling of neutrophils was achieved by incubating 107 cells with [3H]AA and [14C]OA (0.1 μCi/ml each) in calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 3 h. [3H]AA and [14C]OA that had not been incorporated into cellular lipids were removed by washing the cells three times with HBSS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Radiolabeled cells (106) were resuspended in 160 μl of HBSS containing 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 0.2% BSA, preincubated with a selected inhibitor for 20 min at 37 °C if necessary, and then were stimulated with hVPLA2. The reaction was quenched by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet and the medium was measured separately by a two-channel liquid scintillation counter. LTB4 levels were determined using a LTB4 enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman and then corrected for background signals from control cells that were not treated with hVPLA2. Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells) were stimulated with varying concentrations of hVPLA2. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 ml of ice-cold water, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated briefly. The resulting cell lysate was pretreated with 10 μl of dithiothreitol (final concentration 10 mm) on ice for 5 min to inactivate sPLA2, and 10 μl of 1 mm CaCl2(final concentration 0.1 mm) was then added to each sample. The cPLA2 substrate solution was prepared by drying a chloroform solution of [14C]SAPC under a stream of N2 and suspending the film in 100 μl of 10% aqueous ethanol by vortexing. The reaction was initiated by adding a 10 μl-portion of the substrate solution (final concentration 9 μm) to each cell lysate. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and was quenched by adding 560 μl of Dole's reagent (heptane, 2-propanol, 1 nH2SO4, 400:390:10 (v/v)), followed by 110 μl of H2O, vortexed for 20 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g. The 180-μl upper layer was transferred to 800 μl of hexane containing 25 mg of silica gel. The 800-μl samples was then mixed with 2 ml of scintillation fluids, and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Aliquots of neutrophils (2 × 106 cells/sample) were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 s, and cell pellets were lysed by the addition of the ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid). After 20 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min) to remove nuclear and cellular debris. Supernatants were mixed with the gel loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. Equivalent amounts of protein (∼50 μg) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% of cPLA2 and 12% for p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases). Electrotransfer of protein from the gel to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was achieved using a semidry system (400 mA, 60 min). The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA for 60 min, then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-cPLA2, Anti-Active™-ERK1/2, or Anti-Active™-p38 antibody). Measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using Fluo-4 AM as the indicator. Neutrophils (107cells/ml) were incubated in HBSS containing 1.2 mmCa2+, 1% BSA, and 2 μm Fluo-4 for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were seeded into each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass filled with 400 μl of HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10 min. After washing once with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 10 nmhVPLA2 (or 3 μm lyso-PC, 3 μmAA, 0.3 μm LTB4) was added, and the fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4 was monitored with a 488 nm argon/krypton laser and a 530 nm linepass filter. A 63× (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. [Ca2+]i was calibrated as described previously using the reported calcium dissociation constant value (i.e. 345 nm) of Fluo-4 (15Gee K.R. Brown K.A. Chen W.N. Bishop-Stewart J. Gray D. Johnson I. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (106 cells/ml) were seeded into each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass filled with 400 μl of HBSS and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10 min. After the cells were washed once with HBSS, they were overlaid with 10 μl of PED6 vesicle solution (0.75 mm POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED6/DiIC12 (107:31:20:1:1 in a mol ratio) mixed vesicles in HBSS) and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After rinsing the labeled cells six times with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 10 nm hVPLA2 was added to cells. Imaging was done with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate the background autofluorescence. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the BODIPY™ group of the hydrolyzed PED6 to DiIC12 was monitored with a 488 nm argon/krypton laser and a 585 nm linepass filter. A 63× (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all experiments. The analysis of leukotriene composition secreted to the growth medium was performed as reported previously (16Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol.

After neutrophils (108 cells) were incubated with 1 or 10 nm hVPLA2, they were treated with 2 volumes of ice-cold methanol containing 5 ng of internal standard, prostaglandin B2 (PGB2). The samples were diluted with water to a final methanol concentration lower than 20%, and extraction was quickly carried out using a Supelclean LC-18 solid phase cartridge (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA). The retained material was eluted using 90% aqueous methanol. After evaporation of solvent, the dried extract was solubilized in 100 μl of solvent A (methanol/acetonitrile/water/acetic acid, 10:10:80:0.02, v/v/v/v, pH 5.5, adjusted with ammonium hydroxide), injected into a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (5 × 150 mm; Waters, Milford, MA) that was interfaced directly with the electrospray source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass Qurattro II). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (acetonitrile/methanol, 65:35) from 40 to 100% at a flow rate of 100 μl/min over 30 min. Each leukotriene peak was analyzed by mass spectrometry measuring the ion abundance for the following collision-induced transformation at the corresponding retention times: LTB4 and 6-trans-LTB4 isomers (m/z335 → 195), 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (m/z351 → 195), 20-carboxy-LTB4 (m/z365 → 195). Quantitation of individual peaks was carried out using their mass ion abundance relative to that of PGB2. We showed previously that exogenously added hVPLA2 triggers AA release and LTB4 secretion from unprimed human neutrophils (10Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To understand better the mechanism of hVPLA2-induced LTB4biosynthesis, we carefully examined the time course of the fatty acid and LTB4 release from neutrophils in the presence of varying concentrations of exogenously added hVPLA2. First, we measured the hVPLA2 concentration dependence of fatty acid release from neutrophils double labeled with [3H]AA and [14C]OA. Because of the high AA specificity of cPLA2 and lack of fatty acid selectivity of sPLA2s, the [3H]AA release in this system would reflect both sPLA2 and cPLA2 activities, whereas the [14C]OA release would largely represent sPLA2 activity. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, the [3H]AA release was detected at a lower hVPLA2 concentration than was [14C]OA release. For instance, at 1 nmhVPLA2 the [3H]AA release was twice larger than the control, whereas the [14C]OA release was essentially the same as the control. At 100 nmhVPLA2, however, both [3H]AA and [14C]OA releases were about three times higher than the control. This suggests that at lower concentrations of exogenously added hVPLA2, cPLA2 is mainly responsible for the AA release, whereas at higher concentrations (i.e. ≥10 nm) hVPLA2 also contributes to the overall AA release. Although it is difficult to monitor the secretion of endogenous hVPLA2 in response to the exogenously added hVPLA2, the contribution of the former to the AA release should be insignificant under our experimental conditions. This is because at lower concentrations of exogenously added hVPLA2, cPLA2 plays a predominant role in overall AA release, whereas at higher concentrations (i.e.>10 nm) of exogenously added hVPLA2, the amount of secreted endogenous hVPLA2 (∼1.5 nm) (7Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P. Borregaard N. Reithmeier R. Lindsay T.F. Lichtenberger C. Reinisch W. Lambeau G. Arm J. Tischfield J. Gelb M.H. Rubin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5061-5073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) should be much smaller than that of exogenous hVPLA2. As reported previously (10Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.P. Rafter J.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), hIIaPLA2 up to 100 nm had little effect on fatty acid release under the same conditions, underscoring the unique ability of hVPLA2 to release fatty acid from unprimed neutrophils. We then measured the LTB4 release from neutrophils as a function of hVPLA2 concentration (Fig.1 B). Unlike the AA release that occurred with as low as 1 nm exogenously added hVPLA2, the LTB4 release was not detectable at 1 nmhVPLA2. However, the LTB4 release was clearly seen with ≥10 nm hVPLA2. As reported earlier (10Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 100 nm hVPLA2 was about half as effective as 1 μm fMLP + 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B in inducing the LTB4 release. As a negative control, hIIaPLA2 up to 100 nm was shown to have little effect on LTB4 release. Together, these data suggest that the release of AA and LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils have disparate dependence on hVPLA2concentration acting on their cell surfaces. We then monitored the kinetics of fatty acid release from dual labeled neutrophils by 10 nm hVPLA2. As shown in Fig.2 A, the [14C]OA release showed simple saturation kinetics, whereas the [3H]AA release exhibited more complex two-phase kinetics under the same conditions, suggesting that at least two distinct pathways are involved in the latter case. The early phase of [3H]AA release reached a plateau in 10–20 min, as was the case with the [14C]OA release; however, the delayed phase of [3H]AA release followed after ∼20 min and extended for about 1 h. When neutrophils were incubated with a cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3 (25 μm) (18Street I.P. Lin H.K. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weech P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) or surfactin (10 μm) (19Kim K. Jung S.Y. Lee D.K. Jung J.K. Park J.K. Kim D.K. Lee C.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), prior to the addition of hVPLA2, the delayed phase AA release was abrogated, whereas the early phase AA release was modestly (about 30%) reduced. On the other hand, OA release remained essentially unchanged after treatment with cPLA2 inhibitors. An iPLA2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone (10 μm) had little effect on the time course of fatty acid release (data not shown). In conjunction with the data shown in Fig. 1, these data suggest that in the presence of 10 nm exogenous hVPLA2, both hVPLA2and cPLA2 are involved in the early phase of [3H]AA release, whereas cPLA2 is primarily responsible for the delayed phase of [3H]AA release. The involvement of hVPLA2 only in the early phase of AA release is also consistent with our previous finding that the exogenously added hVPLA2 is internalized and degraded in neutrophils within the first 10 min under similar experimental conditions (11Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also monitored the time course of LTB4 release by 1–100 nm exogenous hVPLA2 under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2 B). With 10 nmhVPLA2, the LTB4 release reached a saturation in 5–10 min, consistent with the early phase AA release curve, and started to decline until it increased again at 15–20 min, which is approximately synchronized with the delayed phase AA release. The delayed phase LTB4 release was much more pronounced with 100 nm hVPLA2. Importantly, treatment of neutrophils with AACOCF3 abrogated the LTB4release, indicating that cPLA2 is mainly responsible for LTB4 biosynthesis under these conditions. With 1 nm hVPLA2, the LTB4 release rapidly reached a maximal point at 5 min and then decreased to a basal level after 10 min, which is consistent with the lack of LTB4release at 10 min shown in Fig. 1 B. These data indicate, however, that as low as 1 nm exogenous hVPLA2can stimulate the LTB4 biosynthesis. In neutrophils AA is transformed into several different 5-LO products including LTB4 (16Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Also, LTB4 is known to be degraded and inactivated by microsomal ω-oxidation and peroxisomal β-oxidation in myeloid cells (16Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To understand better the fate of AA liberated in neutrophils, we analyzed the composition of lipid products that neutrophils released to the medium when they were challenged with 1 and 10 nm exogenous hVPLA2, respectively. The chromatogram in Fig.3 A shows that at 1 nm hVPLA2 two main leukotriene products are 20-carboxy-LTB4 and 20-hydroxy-LTB4, which are produced as a consequence of LTB4 oxidation (16Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data thus confirm that even 1 nm exogenous hVPLA2 can induce the biosynthesis of a considerable amount of LTB4. It appears, however, that LTB4 is degraded relatively rapidly to oxidation products that do not cross-react with the LTB4 antibody used in the commercial LTB4 detection kit, hence there is no LTB4signal with 1 nm hVPLA2 in Fig. 1 B. With 10 nm hVPLA2, LTB4 was clearly seen along with other leukotrienes. As was the case with 1 nm hVPLA2, 20-carboxy-LTB4 was the most abundant component. Accumulating evidence has indicated that cPLA2 plays a pivotal role in the receptor-mediated mobilization of AA and eicosanoid biosynthesis in neutrophils (7Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E.

Elastic resilience and structural integrity of lung, skin, and large blood vessels in vertebrates are imparted by elastic fibers. These fibers are composed of an amorphous component made entirely of the protein elastin and a microfibrillar component. Microfibrils, which are individually 10–12 nm in diameter, are in turn composed of a number of glycoproteins (1Clare E.G. Ooita J. Peered A.J. Connective Tissue Disease.

The largest microfibrillar proteins identified are the fibrillins, having a high cysteine content and an extended thread-like shape (6Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder linked to the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15 characterized by vascular and skeletal abnomalities (10Lee B. Godfrey M.

A similar disorder, congenital contractural arachnodactyly, is linked to the fibrillin-2 gene on chromosome 5 (10Lee B. Godfrey M. Vitale E. Hori H. Mattei M. Sarfarazi M. Tsipouras P. Ramirez F. Hollister D.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Collectively, these disorders demonstrate the critical contribution of the fibrillins to tissue integrity. Extraction of elastin-rich bovine nuchal ligament has resulted in the identification of a number of other microfibrillar proteins (14Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among others, these include microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) and MAGP-2 (15Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumartilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The requirement for reducing agents in their extraction suggests that intermolecular disulfide bonding is important for microfibril assembly. MAGP-1 and -2 share limited homology confined to a region containing 7 conserved cysteine residues located in the C-terminal half of the molecule. MAGP-2 also contains an RGD motif near its N terminus not conserved in MAGP-1, which mediates adhesion of various cell types (17Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ultrastructurally, microfibrils appear as beads on a string. Fibrillin is thought to comprise most or all of the mass of the “string,” and immunolocalization studies have shown that MAGP-1 is found at the beads (18Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies have not been done for MAGP-2, although the structural homology with MAGP-1 implies that MAGP-2 may perform a similar function. Various models have emerged regarding the arrangement of fibrillin molecules within microfibrils. Labeling studies have suggested that some cysteine residues in fibrillin are free outside the cell, as fibrillin becomes incorporated into a disulfide-bonded network in the extracellular matrix (14Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sakai L.Y. Tamburro A. Davidson J.M. Elastin: Chemical and Biological Aspects. Congedo Editore, Galatina, Italy1990: 213-227Google Scholar). Disulfide bonding of fibrillin into dimers was suggested from immunoprecipitation studies (20Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 167-173PubMed Google Scholar), and it is now recognized that fibrillin molecules can form homodimers (21Trask T.M. Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Ashworth J.L. Murphy G. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Shapiro S.D. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Biochem.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2205-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dimers can form between homologous regions of fibrillin, as well as between N- and C-terminal regions (24Ashworth J.L. Kelly V. Rock M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4163-4171PubMed Google Scholar). Staining of microfibrils with monoclonal antibodies to fibrillin suggests that fibrillins are ordered in a head to tail parallel arrangement within microfibrils (7Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

Garrone R. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Sherratt M.J. Wess T.J. Baldock C. Ashworth J.L. Purslow P. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Micron. 2001; 32: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Epitope mapping studies have suggested that stacking of fibrillin molecules within microfibrils occurs in an unstaggered arrangement (25Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, transglutaminase cross-link data have suggested a staggered arrangement of fibrillin molecules (28Qian R.Q. Glanville R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15841-15847Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the ability of N- and C-terminal regions to dimerize supports this model (24Ashworth J.L. Kelly V. Rock M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4163-4171PubMed Google Scholar). A staggered arrangement is also suggested from solution structure models (29Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether both fibrillins can contribute to a single microfibril. Little is known about the involvement of the other microfibrillar proteins in fiber assembly, with few exceptions. MAGP-1 has been proposed to bind a C-terminal region of tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, as antibodies to either MAGP-1 or tropoelastin which disrupt this interaction prevent deposition of tropoelastin into the fiber (30Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, other studies (32Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have indicated that although MAGP-1 can bind intact tropoelastin, N- and C-terminal halves of elastin generated by proteolytic digestion are unable to bind MAGP-1 alone, suggesting a complex mechanism of interaction. Both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 interact with tropoelastin through a region near the N terminus of fibrillin (33Trask T.M. Trask B.C. Ritty T.M. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24400-24406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to associate with fibrillin at the beads, with chondroitinase treatment disrupting the bead structure (34Kielty C.M. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan decorin has also been shown to interact with MAGP-1, and the two can form a ternary complex with fibrillin-1 (35Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Versican can also interact directly with fibrillin in a calcium-dependent manner and has been suggested to form a bridge between fibrillin-containing microfibrils and other connective tissue networks (36Isogai Z. Aspberg A. Keene D.R. Ono R.N. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4565-4572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Certain fibrillin-1 peptides have been found to bind fibulin-2, another putative microfibrillar component (37Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Gohring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify ligands for MAGP-2, a recently described microfibrillar protein. The C-terminal half of MAGP-2 was found to interact with fibrillin-1 and -2, as well as fibulin-1, another component of elastic fibers. These findings suggest that MAGP-2 may be important in the assembly of microfibrils. An EST clone encoding mouse MAGP-2 (GenBankTM accession number AA153960) was identified and sequenced in its entirety (38Frankfater C. Maus E. Gaal K. Segade F. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Shipley J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A 568-bpPstI fragment beginning at bp 279 in the cDNA and encoding the last 92 amino acids of the protein was subcloned in-frame into the yeast two-hybrid GAL4 DNA binding domain vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). A mouse 17-day total embryo cDNA library in the two-hybrid GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH ML4006AB) was amplified following the manufacturer's instructions. For each library screen, 1 mg of DNA binding domain/bait vector and 0.5 mg of activation domain/library vector were cotransformed into 8 ml of yeast competent cells. Transformation mixtures were spread on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine to select for the bait and library plasmids, respectively, and to determine the cotransformation efficiency. A total of ∼250,000 cotransformed colonies were screened for bait/ligand interactions by plating on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine supplemented with 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which results in selection of interacting clones by expression of theHIS3 reporter. Colonies growing on plates lacking all three amino acids were further screened for β-galactosidase activity (a second reporter) using a colony lift assay and following the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast DNA was harvested from double-positive clones and used to transform bacterial KC8 cells to recover GAL4 activation domain/library cDNA plasmids. Inserts from all isolated clones were sequenced from both ends using vector-specific primers. The identity of individual clones was determined using the BLAST program to screen the GenBankTM. Regions encoding discreet fibrillin-1 and -2 domains were amplified using mouse fibrillin cDNA templates and subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD424 (CLONTECH). Fragments were subcloned directionally using EcoRI and BamHI, except for the exon 16–38 fragment, which was digested with XhoI and subcloned into the SalI site. Primers for amplification of fibrillin-1 domains were as follows: 5′-GTTTAGGAATTCGATTTGCGAATGAGCTACTGCTATGCGAAG-3′ and 5′-CAAACTGGATCCTCAAACTGCTGAGTCATCAGGGC-3′ (penultimate 8 Cys); 5′-GTATAGGAATTCGATATGGACGAATGCAAAGA-3′ and 5′-AACACTGGATCCTCACAAGCACTCATCCTGAGTGG-3′ (5 EGF); 5′-CAACAGGAATTCGACAACCGGGAAGGGTACTG-3′ and 5′-CCTACTGGATCCTCATGCTCCATTGGTCATGAATC-3′ (last 8 Cys); 5′-CTGTAGGAATTCGATGTCGATGAATGCAAGGT-3′ and 5′-GAAACTGGATCCTCAAAGACAATGCCCTTGGCCTA-3′ (7 EGF); 5′-CTGTCCGAATTCCCTGTCTGTGAAAGTGGCTGT-3′ and 5′-CAAACTGGATCCTCAAACACACCAACGTCCGTCTAG-3′ (exons 5–15); 5′-CACACACTCGAGACACACACATGCGGAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-CCTTACTCTCGAGTCATTCCAATATAACGGTGATGGGATTTGGACGAAAACCTTCTCCTCCAGGGCAAAG-3′ (exons 16–38); and 5′-CTACAGGAATTCGACATCGATGAGTGCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTAACTGGATCCTCAATTGCATTGACCTGTGGAGGT-3′ (exons 39–44). Primers for amplification of fibrillin-2 were as follows: 5′-CAACAGGAATTCGACAACCGCCAGGGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-TCTACTGGATCCTCATCTTCCATCAGTGGCGTATC-3′ (last 8 Cys); 5′-TACCATGAATTCGATATCGATGAATGTAAGGT-3′ and 5′-CAGACTGGATCCTCAGACACAGTGGCCCTGTCCCA-3′ (7 EGF). Two additional constructs for MAGP-2 were generated in the pGBT9 yeast two-hybrid DNA binding domain vector. The first, encoding a region containing the 7 cysteine residues conserved with MAGP-1, was constructed by digesting the MAGP-2 bait construct (described above) with StuI and MscI, removing the 339-bp fragment encoding the last 28 amino acids of the protein, and religating. A construct expressing these last 28 residues was generated by digesting the mouse MAGP-2 cDNA with StuI and SspI and subcloning the 442-bp fragment into the SmaI site of pGBT9. DNA binding domain and activation domain constructs were used to cotransform yeast following the manufacturer's instructions, selected on media lacking leucine and tryptophan, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as outlined below. Colonies from the original library screen that grew on media lacking histidine were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Colonies were restreaked on triple dropout media. Three colonies from each restreaked plate (from one original colony) were grown overnight in liquid selection media (−Leu, −Trp). These cultures were used to reinoculate YPD media and grown to log phase the day of the assay. Cells were centrifuged and washed in Z buffer, lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, and diluted in Z buffer containing 0.24% 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was started by the addition of O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) to a final concentration of 0.67 mg/ml. Reactions were stopped by addition of 0.4 ml of Na2CO3 after yellow color development, and supernatants were read at A 420. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed in units, with 1 unit defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ONPG per min per cell. The mouse MAGP-2 EST clone contained an XhoI cloning site at its 5′ end. A C-terminal Myc epitope tag fusion was generated by amplifying with a T7 primer (flanking the 5′-cloning site) and the primer 5′-CTTACTCTCGAGTCATTCATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCCATCAGACCATCGGGTCTCTGCA-3′, which includes a Myc tag, a stop codon, and an XhoI site 3′ to the Myc tag. The PCR product (∼600 bp) was digested withXhoI and subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector (39Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A human fibrillin-1 minigene construct (mFib-1) was used that contains an internal deletion of exons 16–49. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. 5 × 105 cells were plated into 60-mm dishes 16 h prior to transfection, and cells were transfected using a DEAE-dextran procedure followed by a 3-h treatment with 100 μm chloroquine (40Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar,41Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either the MAGP-2 construct (1 μg), fibrillin construct (10 μg), both constructs (1 μg of MAGP-2 + 9 μg of fibrillin), or mock-transfected (no DNA). Cells were metabolically labeled 60 h post-transfection. Briefly, cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cystine (Invitrogen) and labeled overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus cystine supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (ICN). Following labeling, media were collected, and 10× immunoprecipitation buffer was added to bring the media to 1× (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Media were precleared by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with either 5 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or 5 μl of antiserum raised against human fibrillin-1. Immune precipitates were collected by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h followed by centrifugation for 30 s at 15,000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with wash buffer (0.4% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography with Amplify (AmershamBiosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins within elastic microfibrils that bind MAGP-2, as well as other potential ligands. The MAGP-2 bait is shown in Fig.1. The homology between MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 was confined to the C-terminal half of the molecule, which defines the bait (arrow). Based on the homology, we would predict that the two MAGPs might bind to common ligands through C-terminal domains and unique ligands through N-terminal domains. A 17-day mouse embryo cDNA library in the two-hybrid GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH) was chosen for screening based uponin situ hybridization data indicating that many elastic fiber proteins, which represent likely potential ligands, are abundantly expressed at this stage in the developing mouse (not shown). By using the C-terminal half of mouse MAGP-2 as the bait, 30 clones of 250,000 screened were found to interact with the bait based on the ability to activate the HIS3 reporter via the GAL4-responsive GAL1 promoter, resulting in growth on media lacking histidine. The yeast strain used, HF7c, also contains a lacZreporter under the control of three GAL4-binding sites. Of these 30 clones, 13 were also visibly positive for β-galactosidase activity using a colony lift assay. Plasmids encoding the respective ligands, as GAL4 activation domain fusion constructs, were isolated from each of these yeast clones. Upon sequencing, 11 of the 13 double positive clones were identified as previously cloned cDNAs by BLAST sequence similarity searching of the GenBankTM data base. The identity of these cDNAs are shown in TableI. Six of the 13 clones encoded known microfibrillar proteins (fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, and fibulin-1), with five of these encoding fibrillin-1 or -2. All of these proteins contain multiple copies of EGF-like repeats. Two of the other clones identified, jagged-1 and MEGF-6, also contain similar repeats, implying that MAGP-2 interacts with EGF-like motifs within these proteins.Table ISummary of yeast two-hybrid screening results with MAGP-2CloneIdentity of isolated clones8Fibrillin-11Fibrillin-23Fibrillin-25Fibrillin-230Fibrillin-29Fibulin-17Jagged-115MEGF-66Von Willebrand factor21Glycogenin10HMG144Unknown29UnknownThirteen clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen were positive for both histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity. Sequence from both ends of each clone was utilized to identify clones by BLAST sequence similarity searching. Two clones were not present in the GenBankTM. Open table in a new tab Thirteen clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen were positive for both histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity. Sequence from both ends of each clone was utilized to identify clones by BLAST sequence similarity searching. Two clones were not present in the GenBankTM. The 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the fibrillin-1 and -2 clones identified in the screen were determined, and the region of fibrillin encoded by each clone is shown in Fig. 2 A. In all cases, the clones corresponded to EGF repeat containing regions located near the C terminus of fibrillin. The fact that similar regions of fibrillin-1 and -2 were identified using the C-terminal MAGP-2 bait suggests that the site(s) on fibrillin involved in binding is highly conserved between fibrillin-1 and -2. Interestingly, none of the clones contained the C-terminal domain of fibrillin, composed of ∼182 residues, 50% of which are completely conserved between fibrillin-1 and -2. This C-terminal domain is encoded by exons 64 and 65, the final two exons. We are not aware of any mRNA forms of either fibrillin-1 or -2 reported to terminate 5′ to this C-terminal domain. Although it is possible that the 3′ end of the fibrillin clones identified in the screen were the result of nuclease cleavage, the finding that all of these clones lack the material that encodes the C-terminal domain suggests that similar truncated forms of the fibrillins may existin vivo. Based on the identification of the EGF repeat-containing proteins jagged-1 and MEGF-6 as MAGP-2 ligands, it appeared likely that one or more EGF repeats in fibrillin-1 and -2 were responsible for MAGP-2 binding. We therefore generated deletion constructs of the fibrillin-1 and -2 clones isolated in the screen and tested these individually for the ability to bind MAGP-2 in the two-hybrid assay. The fibrillin-1 clone identified (clone 8) contained two discrete regions of EGF-like repeats, one with 5 tandem repeats and another with 7 tandem repeats. In addition, this clone contained two separate 8-cysteine domains that are unique to the fibrillins and latent transforming growth factor-β-binding proteins. The smallest of the fibrillin-2 clones identified contained one 8-cysteine domain as well as the domain containing 7 tandem EGF-like repeats. When these regions were tested individually for the ability to bind MAGP-2, only the region containing the C-terminal 7 tandem EGF-like repeats conferred binding (Fig.2 B). This was true for both fibrillin-1 and -2. Although the mouse embryo library that was screened was primed with a combination of both oligo(dT) and random primers, we were unaware of whether or not clones encoding fibrillin fragments encompassing other parts of the molecule were present in the library. We therefore made additional fibrillin-1 constructs to investigate potential binding of MAGP-2 to other parts of fibrillin. Three constructs were made that encompass exons 5–15, 16–38, and 39–44 of mouse fibrillin-1. Together with the fibrillin-1 clone isolated in the library screen, these constructs cover more than 80% of the mature molecule. The relative ability of these fibrillin fragments to interact with the MAGP-2 bait was assessed in the yeast two-hybrid assay using the β-galactosidase reporter (Fig. 2 B). Relative to the clone isolated in the library screen, none of the three new constructs were able to interact significantly with the MAGP-2 bait. These three constructs collectively contain 26 EGF-like repeats. The inability of the these constructs as well as the 5 EGF constructs of fibrillin-1 to bind MAGP-2 strongly suggests that the interaction with the 7 EGF region is specific. This region is distinct from the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 reported by others to bind MAGP-1 (32Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As the MAGP-2 bait used to screen the library contains a core region containing significant homology with MAGP-1, as well as a C-terminal region with no homology to MAGP-1, we investigated which region was responsible for binding. Upon expression of these regions separately in the two-hybrid assay with the fibrillin-1 and -2 clones identified in the screen, the binding activity is clearly localized to the region containing homology with MAGP-1 (Fig. 3). This suggests that MAGP-1 and -2 interact with fibrillin through this conserved region containing 7 common cysteine residues. In order to verify that MAGP-2 and fibrillin can interact in the context of mammalian cells, we coexpressed both proteins in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4).

Absorption spectroscopy data demonstrate the oxidation of two Fe(II) per H2O2 at the ferroxidase center, thus avoiding hydroxyl radical production via Fenton chemistry. The oxidation reaction with H2O2 corresponds to [Fe(II)2-P]Z + H2O2→ [Fe(III)2O-P]Z + H2O, where [Fe(II)2-P]Z represents a diferrous ferroxidase center complex of the protein P with net charge Z and [Fe(III)2O-P]Z a μ-oxo-bridged diferric ferroxidase complex. The mineralization reaction is given by 2Fe2+ + H2O2 + 2H2O → 2FeOOH(core) + 4H+, where two Fe(II) are again oxidized by one H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide is shown to be an intermediate product of dioxygen reduction when O2 is used as the oxidant in both the ferroxidation and mineralization reactions. Most of the H2O2produced from O2 is rapidly consumed in a subsequent ferroxidase reaction with Fe(II) to produce H2O. EPR spin trapping experiments show that the presence of EcBFR greatly attenuates the production of hydroxyl radical during Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2, consistent with the ability of the bacterioferritin to facilitate the pairwise oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2, thus avoiding odd electron reduction products of oxygen and therefore oxidative damage to the protein and cellular components through oxygen radical chemistry.

Ferritins from Escherichia coliare of two types: the non-heme bacterial ferritins EcFtnA1and EcFtnB, and the heme-containing bacterioferritin EcBFR. Although EcFtnA is a true ferritin with an iron storage role, the function of EcBFR is less clear (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both types of ferritin are composed of 24 identical subunits each containing ferroxidase and nucleation sites (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb.

These sites are important for rapid oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and its subsequent hydrolysis to form a mineral core on the inner surface of the protein. In theE. coli bacterioferritin, up to 12 protoporphyrin IX heme groups of unknown function bind between 2-fold symmetry-related subunits and are ligated by methionines Met-52 and Met-52′. Although the hemes do not possess catalase activity, they may be involved in mediating iron-core reduction and iron release from the protein (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb.

The three-dimensional structures of ferritins from different origins are highly conserved despite homology as low as 15% in amino acid sequence in some cases. The typical 24-mer ferritins assemble in highly stable complexes with 4/3/2 symmetry, forming a large central cavity of about 80 Å diameter which can accommodate up to 4500 iron atoms as a ferric hydrous oxide mineral core. Whereas ferritins from various organisms share many common structural features, their chemistries of iron deposition differ significantly (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb.

Most notably, hydrogen peroxide is the product of dioxygen reduction in the ferroxidase reaction of mammalian ferritins, whereas water is produced in EcBFR and in the 12-mer ferritin from Listeria innocua (LiFtn) (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D.

J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To account for the complete reduction of O2 to H2O in EcBFR, two ferroxidation mechanisms have been proposed (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), one involving a high valent iron oxidation state (Fe4+) similar to that of the di-iron enzymes ribonucleotide reductase and methane monooxygenase (12Riggs-Gelasco P.M. Shu L. Chen S. Burdi D. Huynh B.H. Que Jr., L. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120 (and references cited therein): 849-860Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Hsu H.-F. Dong Y. Shu L. Young V.G. Que Jr., L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121 (and references cited therein): 5230-5237Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the other involving the reduction of O2 to H2O2 at one di-iron ferroxidase center followed by rapid reduction of H2O2 to H2O at a second di-iron ferroxidase center. The previous observation that H2O2 is a better oxidant for Fe(II) in bacterioferritin than O2 (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is consistent with the latter mechanism and has implications for the role of the protein in avoiding Fenton chemistry inherent in the odd electron oxidation of iron(II) by H2O2 (Equation 1). Fe2++H2O2→Fe3++HO−+HO·Equation 1 To date, there has been no study demonstrating the production of H2O2 in EcBFR when O2 is the Fe(II) oxidant nor has the reaction between Fe(II) and H2O2 in EcBFR been examined in any detail. We describe here experiments that further explore the iron redox chemistry of EcBFR. The data reveal that H2O2 is a better oxidant than O2 for Fe(II) at the dinuclear ferroxidase center and that Fe(II) is oxidized pairwise by H2O2, thus avoiding hydroxyl radical production through Fenton chemistry (Equation 1). A stoichiometry of one H2O2 per two Fe(II) oxidized is also obtained in the mineralization reaction of EcBFR. Ultraviolet spectroscopic titration data in conjunction with the observed hydrolysis chemistry suggest formation of a μ-oxo-bridged complex at the ferroxidase center of the protein when either H2O2 or O2 are oxidants for Fe(II). A fluorescence assay demonstrates that H2O2 is an intermediate product of O2 reduction during both the ferroxidase and mineralization reactions. Most of this H2O2 is then rapidly consumed in subsequent Fe(II) oxidation without generating radicals, an indication that the protein is capable of nullifying the toxic combination of Fe(II) and H2O2. The purification of EcBFR from cell extracts obtained from an overexpression system was achieved by methods described previously (14Andrews S.C., Le Brun N.E. Barynin V. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23268-23274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but using an overexpression system different from the earlier one,i.e. a pET vector instead of the previous pALTER. Plasmid pGS758 (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which contained the gene for E. colibacterioferritin, was digested with NdeI/EcoRI, and the fragment containing the bfr gene was ligated into pET21a (Novagen) digested with NdeI/EcoRI. The resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). 250-ml cultures were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 650 nm of 0.8–0.9 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). After induction for 3 h, cells were harvested, washed, and stored at −70 °C until use. The heme content of the purified EcBFR was ∼2.5 heme per 24-mer. Non-heme iron was removed from EcBFR by reduction with sodium dithionite and complexation with 2,2′-bipyridyl (15Bauminger E.R. Harrison P.M. Hechel D. Nowik I. Treffry A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1118: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorptivity of 33,000 cm−1m−1at 280 nm for the apoprotein (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or by the Advanced Protein Assay (www.cytoskelton.com, patent pending). Freshly prepared stock solutions of H2O2 were assayed by the amount of O2 produced upon addition of catalase as measured by Clark-type electrode oximetry or from its absorbance at 240 nm (ε = 43.6 cm−1m−1). The enzyme catalase (EC 1.11.1.6, 65,000 units/mg) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assay kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and EMPO from Oxis Research (Portland, OR). All other compounds including Mes and Mops buffers, sodium chloride, and ferrous sulfate were of reagent grade quality. The use and standardization reactions of the oxygen electrode/pH-stat apparatus are described in detail elsewhere (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For the anaerobic experiments, all solutions were thoroughly deoxygenated using high purity grade argon gas (99.995%, <5 ppm O2). The evolution of O2 after the addition of catalase to H2O2 containing EcBFR solutions or O2 consumption during Fe(II) oxidation in EcBFR was followed either at room temperature (22 °C) or at 25 °C by a Clark-type oxygen microelectrode. Typical conditions for measurements were 1 μm protein in 100 mm NaCl and 0.3 mm Mes, pH 6.5 to 7.0 (controlled by the pH-stat), with increments of 24–48 Fe(II)/protein, added as freshly prepared ferrous sulfate solution at pH 3.5 (J. T. Baker Inc.). The addition of 0.3 mm Mes buffer to the protein solution improved the stability of the pH-stat control without significantly buffering the solution. Background corrections for the free acid in the ferrous sulfate solutions were made in all calculations. Conditions for each experiment are given in the figure legends. The ultraviolet-visible difference spectrophotometric titrations of Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 in EcBFR were performed on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. For the anaerobic experiments, 1 ml of deoxygenated apo-EcBFR solution was added to an argon-purged quartz cuvette with a micro stir bar at the bottom. A constant positive atmosphere of pure argon was maintained through the rubber septum of the cuvette during the experiment to avoid oxygen diffusion into the cell. An apoprotein solution in the same buffer was used as a blank for absorbance measurements. The experiments were terminated when no further increase in the absorbance was seen following the addition of Fe(II) to the protein solution. EPR measurements were carried out on a laboratory assembled EPR spectrophotometer described elsewhere (16Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1587-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the EMPO spin trapping experiments for hydroxyl radical (17Zhang H. Joseph J. Vasquez-Vivar J. Karoui H. Nsanzumuhire C. Martasek P. Tordo P. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the spectra were recorded immediately after the addition of the last reagent. The conditions of the experiment and the parameters of the spectrometer are indicated in the figure legends. In the Amplex fluorescence assay for H2O2, 50 mm Mops buffer, pH 7.4, was used in place of the 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, supplied with the assay kit in order to avoid possible interference by the phosphate on the iron chemistry in ferritin. Fluorescence standard curves were constructed using duplicate samples and measured at the same time as the unknowns which were both incubated for 30 min at room temperature and protected from light. Fluorescence intensity was measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. The detection limit of the Amplex H2O2 fluorescence assay and the standard deviation in the fluorescence intensity measurements are reported elsewhere (18Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous studies of iron uptake by EcBFR using O2 as oxidant have shown that Fe(II) binding at the dinuclear centers of the protein followed by its rapid oxidation and core formation occur in three distinct phases (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Le Brun N.E. Wilson M.T. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We describe the stoichiometric equations and the kinetics of iron oxidation and hydrolysis in EcBFR using H2O2 as the oxidant. We demonstrate for the first time that H2O2 is an intermediate product of iron oxidation by O2 in EcBFR and report that bacterioferritin minimizes the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Equation 1) facilitating pairwise oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2. The number of protons produced upon Fe(II) binding to the protein followed by oxidation with H2O2 was monitored by titration with standard NaOH (5 mm) to maintain the pH at 7.0 with the pH-stat apparatus. The anaerobic addition of 24 Fe(II) to the apoprotein in the absence of H2O2 resulted in the production of two protons per Fe(II) added (first and second injections, Fig.1), consistent with previous results obtained with EcBFR at pH 6.5 (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 2To accurately measure the number of protons released upon Fe2+ binding, a pH-stat proportional band setting of 1.0 was used, and a relatively slow response was seen. However, the rapid response reported in Ref. 6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar was due to the smaller proportional band setting of 0.2 required to measure the initial rate of proton production. The binding reaction for this first step is thus written as shown in Equation 2, 2Fe2++PZ→[Fe(II)2−P]Z+4H+Equation 2 where [Fe(II)2-P]Z represents a diFe(II)-protein complex at the ferroxidase center. To determine the number of protons produced during Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 in EcBFR, excess H2O2 (10 H2O2/Fe(II)) was added to the protein solution containing 48 Fe(II)/shell, added in increments of 24 Fe(II)/shell as shown in Fig. 1. The amount of base delivered after the addition of H2O2 (third injection, Fig. 1) corresponds to that required to neutralize the free acid in the hydrogen peroxide solution, which was prepared at pH 3.5 in deoxygenated water. In another experiment, either 24 or 48 Fe(II)/shell were added anaerobically to the protein solution followed immediately by the addition of H2O2. In both cases, no H+ was produced. The anaerobic addition of Fe(II) to EcBFR showed no UV absorbance, but upon the addition of H2O2 to the protein solution containing 48 Fe(II)/shell, a band with a maximum absorbance at 295 nm emerged (Fig. 2,inset). The spectrometric titration shown in Fig. 2 has a discontinuity in absorbance at 0.5 H2O2/Fe(II), indicating that one H2O2 oxidizes two Fe(II). 3The increase in absorbance beyond the 48 Fe(II)/protein ratio seen in Figs. 2 and 5 was due to the slight excess of H2O2 needed to fully oxidize all the iron added and does not indicate a two-step oxidation process. The ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ was determined from the intercept of the two computed tangents. Because two Fe(II) are oxidized by one H2O2 and no H+is generated upon H2O2 addition, we write Equation 3 for the oxidation reaction as follows: [Fe(II)2−PZ]+H2O2→[Fe(III)2O­P]z+H2OEquation 3 where [Fe(III)2O-P]Z represents a μ-oxo-bridged species at the dinuclear center of the protein. The absorptivity for the observed oxidation product [Fe(III)2O-P]Z is 3460m−1 cm−1 per iron at 295 nm, which is very similar to the value of 3380 m−1cm−1 observed for EcBFR when O2 was the oxidant (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar spectrometric titrations have been reported for human H-chain and horse spleen ferritins with absorptivities of 2990 and 3540 m−1 cm−1, respectively (9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Absorbances within this spectral region of ferritins and other dinuclear Fe(III)-proteins generally arise from μ-oxo-bridged Fe(III) dimer species (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D.

Therefore, we attribute the absorbing species seen in Fig. 2 to a μ-oxo-bridged dinuclear complex formed at the ferroxidase center of the protein. This assignment is also based on data from a preliminary Mössbauer study with EcBFR (23Hawkins C. Treffry A. Mackey J.B. Williams J.M. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Il. Nuovo Cimento. 1996; 18D: 347-352Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and spectrometric titration data for EcBFR using O2 as the Fe(II) oxidant (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In order to determine the Fe(II)/protein stoichiometry for Fe(II) oxidation, a careful anaerobic spectrometric titration of EcBFR with Fe(II) followed by addition of H2O2 was carried out. Excess H2O2 was added to different samples of apo-EcBFR previously loaded with various amounts of Fe(II) (see Fig.3 legend). A discontinuity in absorbance at 48 Fe(II)/protein (Fig. 3) is evident, consistent with the binding and oxidation of two iron at each of the 24 ferroxidase centers of the protein. Similar UV titrations have been reported (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for the ferroxidation reactions of EcBFR and HuHF with O2 as the oxidant. The result in Fig. 3 implies that the 24 ferroxidase centers of EcBFR are involved in the rapid pairwise oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 and that Equation 3 corresponds to the ferroxidation reaction. Fig. 4 shows the effect of catalase on the amount of unreacted H2O2 when 48 Fe(II)/protein shell are added anaerobically to 1 μmEcBFR followed by 48 μm H2O2. For the addition sequence EcBFR + 48 Fe(II) + 48 H2O2 + catalase (added 150 s later), about 12 μm O2 is produced, implying that 24 μm H2O2 had reacted with Fe(II) to give an Fe(II)/H2O2 stoichiometry of 2:1 (Fig. 4), a result in accord with the absorbance measurements of Fig.2. In the control experiment, evolution of 24 μmO2 was observed when 48 μmH2O2 were added to buffer alone followed by catalase as expected from the disproportionation reaction of H2O2 (Equation 4), H2O2→H2O+½O2Equation 4 EcBFR has a specific activity of ∼2 O2/subunit/min at pH 7.0 (two Fe(II)/subunit) when O2 is the oxidant for Fe(II) (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine the relative reactivities of H2O2 versus O2 toward Fe(II) oxidation in EcBFR, 48 Fe(II)/shell were added to a protein sample containing both 48 μm H2O2(48 H2O2/shell) and 260 μmO2 (260 O2/shell). 4A small amount of Fe(II) added to the apoprotein undergoes Fenton chemistry in the presence of H2O2 (see EPR results). Therefore, the greater reactivity of H2O2 versusO2 has contributions from the pairwise oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 at the ferroxidase center of the protein and from Fe(II) reaction with H2O2 via Fenton reaction. In a series of three experiments, an average of 30 ± 5% of the oxygen was consumed relative to that in the control experiment where H2O2 was absent. In another series of experiments, 160 Fe(II)/shell were added to the apoprotein in the presence of 260 μm O2 (2600 O2/shell) and 270 μmH2O2 (2700 H2O2/shell). In this case only 8.5% of the O2 was consumed compared with the control experiment in the absence of H2O2. In these experiments the amount of each oxidant was sufficient to oxidize all the iron present in the solution. Both types of experiments indicate that in EcBFR H2O2 is a 10-fold faster oxidant of Fe(II) than O2 and thus is a superior substrate for the ferroxidation reaction. The stoichiometry of Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 was also determined when Fe(II) was added beyond the 48 Fe(II)/shell required for saturation of the ferroxidase sites. The anaerobic addition of 500 Fe(II)/protein followed by H2O2 titration resulted in an increase in the absorbance intensity (Fig.5, inset), giving a ratio of two Fe(II)/H2O2 (Fig. 5). The absorptivity of the mineralized iron was determined to be 2310m−1 cm−1 at 295 nm and is similar to the value of 2030 m−1 cm−1obtained for EcBFR when O2 was the oxidant (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar values have been observed for μ-oxo-bridged Fe(III) clusters in other proteins and model complexes (9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Que Jr., L. True A.E. Lippard S.J. Progress in Inorganic Chemistry: Bioinorganic Chemistry.

To determine the number of protons produced during the mineralization reaction with H2O2 as the oxidant, 48 Fe(II)/shell were oxidized anaerobically by 24 μmH2O2 (24 H2O2/shell, 2 Fe(II)/H2O2) followed by the anaerobic addition of an additional 48 Fe(II)/shell 5 min later and then 48 μm H2O2 (48 H2O2/shell). A value of 2.0 ± 0.1 H+/Fe(II) was obtained. In another experiment, a stoichiometry of H+/Fe(II) = 2.3 ± 0.2 was obtained after the anaerobic addition of 220 Fe(II)/shell to 0.2 μm apo-EcBFR followed by 44 μmH2O2 (220 H2O2/shell). In both samples, enough H2O2 was added to oxidize all of the iron present. Accordingly, we write the net mineralization reaction for EcBFR as Equation 5, 2Fe2++H2O2+2H2O→2FeOOH(core)+4H+Equation 5 where FeOOH(core) is a mineral core with UV absorption properties similar to that observed previously (6Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for bacterioferritins and mammalian ferritins when O2 was used as the oxidant. Experiments were also performed to determine whether H2O2 is produced as an intermediate during the ferroxidation reaction of Fe(II) with O2 as the oxidant. Fig. 6 illustrates the fluorescence standard curve for H2O2 measurements when the Amplex Red reagent/horseradish peroxidase mixture was added to the protein solution before the addition of 48 Fe(II)/shell. After subtracting the blank correction (apoprotein plus the fluorescence reagents), an average of one H2O2 per 9.1 ± 0.1 Fe(II) oxidized was detected (n = 2). Because there are competing reactions for the H2O2produced (disproportionation, reaction with Fe(II), etc.), the value from the fluorescence assay is a lower limit to the true amount of H2O2 produced in EcBFR. H2O2 production was also observed during the mineralization reaction of EcBFR in air. For the addition sequence, apo-EcBFR + 48 or 96 Fe(II)/shell + fluorescence reagents (5 min later) + another 48 or 96 Fe(II)/shell, or the sequence, apo-EcBFR + fluorescence reagents + 96 Fe(II)/shell, an average of 1 H2O2 per 18 Fe(II) oxidized was detected. The control reaction (7.2 or 14.4 μm Fe(II) in oxygenated buffer in the presence of the fluorescence reagents) did not show the production of H2O2. The conditions for these experiments are indicated in the legend of Fig. 6. These results taken together indicate that H2O2 is an intermediate product during Fe(II) oxidation in both the ferroxidation and mineralization phases of EcBFR. The oxidation stoichiometry of two Fe(II)/H2O2 (Fig. 2) implies that Fenton chemistry should minimally occur in EcBFR. EPR spin trapping experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether hydroxyl radical production is attenuated by the presence of the protein. All solutions were thoroughly deoxygenated with argon before each experiment. A control reaction corresponding to the addition sequence, DTPA + EMPO + H2O2 + Fe(II) in Mops buffer, pH 7.4, was recorded (Fig. 7, spectrum A). The strong EPR signal seen in spectrum A reflects the efficiency of the 1 electron oxidation of the Fe(II)-DTPA complex in generating a hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction (17Zhang H.

https://openalex.org/W2019614954,"The oil bodies of rapeseeds contain a triacylglycerol matrix surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids embedded with abundant structural alkaline proteins termed oleosins and some other minor proteins. Oleosins are unusual proteins because they contain a 70–80-residue uninterrupted nonpolar domain flanked by relatively polar C- and N-terminal domains. Although the hydrophilic N-terminal domain had been studied, the structural feature of the central hydrophobic domain remains unclear due to its high hydrophobicity. In the present study, we reported the generation, purification, and characterization of a 9-kDa central hydrophobic domain from rapeseed oleosin (19 kDa). The 9-kDa central hydrophobic domain was produced by selectively degrading the N and C termini with enzymes and then purifying the digest by SDS-PAGE and electroelution. We have also reconstituted the central domain into liposomes and synthetic oil bodies to determine the secondary structure of the domain using CD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The spectra obtained from CD and FTIR were analyzed with reference to structural information of the N-terminal domain and the full-length rapeseed oleosin. Both CD and FTIR analysis revealed that 50–63% of the domain was composed of β-sheet structure. Detailed analysis of the FTIR spectra indicated that 80% of the β-sheet structure, present in the central domain, was arranged in parallel to the intermolecular β-sheet structure. Therefore, interactions between adjacent oleosin proteins would give rise to a stable β-sheet structure that would extend around the surface of the seed oil bodies stabilizing them in emulsion systems. The strategies used in our present study are significant in that it could be generally used to study difficult proteins with different independent structural domains, especially with long hydrophobic domains.

Fourier transform infrared bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline Most eukaryotic organisms can either store or transport lipids in the form of small (0.2–2 μm) triacylglycerol-rich, spherical lipid bodies (1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 299-324PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid oil body has a relatively simple structure, made up of triacylglycerol, a phospholipid monolayer, and oleosin. However, its ontogeny is poorly understood. Storage lipids are found in the seeds of most higher plants. These are typically present as triacylglycerol-containing bodies of 0.5–2 μmdiameter bound by a monomolecular phospholipid annulus into which is embedded a layer of specific amphipathic proteins, the oleosins (2Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 4Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. Shewry P.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This storage oil serves as a carbon source and energy reserve that is mobilized following seed germination. In some plant species, such as rapeseed and sunflower, the seed oil content can be as high as 40–60% fresh weight, and oleosins constitute 10–20% of the total seed protein (5Murphy D.J. Cummins I. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 2063-2069Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oleosins were initially defined as seed-specific proteins, associated exclusively with the surfaces of storage oil bodies in plants. The precise function and structure of oleosins have still not been elucidated. It is believed that they are responsible for the maintenance of a population of discrete small diameter oil bodies found in seed tissues, particularly during the dehydration process that accompanies seed maturation in most plant species (6Hills M.J. Watson M.D. Murphy D.J. Planta. 1993; 189: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Murphy D.J. Ross J.H.E. Pritchard H.W. Kader J.C. Mazliak P. Plant Lipid Metabolism. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 558-560Crossref Google Scholar). In the absence of such stabilizing entities, the oil bodies would tend to coalesce during water removal to form an amorphous mass of lipid, which would have a very low surface area/volume ratio (8Cummins I. Zhills M.J. Ross J.H.E. Hobbs D.H. Watson M.D. Murphy D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 23: 1015-1027Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This would severely impede the action of the lipases in mobilizing storage lipids following seed germination, because lipases are interfacial enzymes, whose activity is dependent on the available surface area of substrates (9Mukherjee K.D. Hills M.J. Woolley P. Patersen S.B. Lipases-Their Structure, Biochemistry, and Application. Cambridge University Press, UK1993: 49-75Google Scholar). Amino acid data derived from the studies of more than 40 different seed oleosins revealed that oleosin possesses a characteristic central hydrophobic domain containing ∼70 uninterrupted and uncharged residues. This is the longest hydrophobic domain that has yet been found in any naturally occurring proteins. The central hydrophobic domain is flanked by relatively polar C-terminal and N-terminal domains. These domains are very diverse in their amino acid compositions. Oleosins are amphipathic proteins but they do not behave like bilayer membrane proteins, because they are localized at a single lipid/water interface between the triacylglycerol core of the oil body and the surrounding aqueous cytoplasm. Oleosins therefore have some analogies with other interfacial or monolayer-associated proteins, such as apolipoproteins, that are involved in lipid transport of mammalian circulatory systems (1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 299-324PubMed Google Scholar) and hydrophobins found in fungi (10Wessels J.G.H. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Oleosins appear to act as a natural emulsifying and stabilizing agent at an oil/water interface. This suggests a possible biotechnological application for oleosins in the stabilization of emulsion systems, in industries such as food processing, pharmaceutical manufacture, and oil spillage treatment. In addition, oleosins have recently been proposed as a carrier for the expression and purification of recombinant pharmaceutical peptides and industrial enzymes (11Van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Bio-Technology. 1995; 13: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Parmenter D.L. Boothe J.G. Van Rooijen G.J.H. Yeung E.C. Moloney M.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is considerable interest in understanding the secondary structure of oleosin and how oleosin interacts with oil bodies. We have studied previously (13Li M. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Wilson R. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8245-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the secondary structure of a full-length 19-kDa oleosin protein from rapeseed. In addition, we have also examined a recombinant protein corresponding to the 6-kDa polar N-terminal domain of sunflower oleosin (14Li M. Keddie J.S. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17504-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were performed using CD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)1 spectroscopy. The emerging model for the structure of oleosin is that of a central hydrophobic domain (mostly made up of extended β-structure) probably embedded into the lipidic core of oil bodies in vivo. However, the structure of the central domain remains unclear due to difficulties involved in producing and purifying the central domain. We have tried to express this central domain in Escherichia coli, in yeast, and in cell-free translation systems. These attempts were unsuccessful because the central domain was highly hydrophobic and produced extremely low yields. In contrast, the secondary structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which flank the central domain, have now been established. These domains contained more α-helix and unordered structures that are located on the surface of oil bodies and may also extend out from the surface of the oil bodies (13Li M. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Wilson R. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8245-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li M. Keddie J.S. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17504-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most investigators accept the general feature of this model, it has been suggested that the central hydrophobic domain could contain a hairpin loop. This loop is centered on three conserved proline residues that form an anti-parallel β-sheet structure (3Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar), rather than forming a single parallel β-sheet structure as proposed in our original model (13Li M. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Wilson R. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8245-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on safflower and sunflower oil bodies have led some researchers to suggest that the central domain was composed of mainly α-helices (15Lacey D.J. Wellner N. Beaudoin F. Napier J.A. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, these models have not yet been verified by experimental evidence because it is difficult to produce and reconstitute pure central hydrophobic domain of oleosin. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to generate and purify the central hydrophobic domain and to elucidate the secondary structure of liposome or the oil bodies-reconstituted central domain by CD and FTIR. In many proteins that contain structurally distinct regions, the different domains fold independently to form separate but linked units of the protein. Hence, the structure of individual protein domains may be studied in isolation to circumvent some substantial difficulties (16Orban J. Alexander P. Bryan P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Ashton R.W., Ni, F. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4426-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Ritco-Vonsovici M. Minard P. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16543-16551Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This allows for the unequivocal assignment of particular structures to particular domains. Because oil bodies from rapeseed were difficult to purify to homogeneity and the oleosin obtained from these purified natural oil bodies was always contaminated with other proteins as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, the natural oil bodies were corrupted, and the intact oleosin protein was purified by SDS-PAGE coupled with electroeluting. This purified oleosin was used in subsequent reconstitution, selective enzyme digestion, and secondary structure determination in this study. Equally importantly, the use of a reconstituted system, resembling as much as possible the in vivo system, allows for the highest probability that proteins are folded into a native conformation. The results presented here show that the purified central hydrophobic domain is mostly made up of an extended parallel β-sheet with relatively minor amounts of anti-parallel structure. The significance of these findings for oleosin-oil body interactions is discussed. Oleosins were obtained from mature seeds of Brassica napus. The lipid l-α-phosphatidylcholine type IX-E from egg yolk and trioleoylglycerol were obtained from Sigma, as was protease K. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Oil body membrane proteins were purified from rapeseeds as described previously (13Li M. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Wilson R. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8245-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the resuspended oil body membrane proteins. The sample was then boiled for 5 min, vortexed briefly, and loaded onto a preparative SDS-PAGE gel containing 12% acrylamide (19Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gels were rinsed with double distilled H2O, and a strip of the gel was cut with a razor for staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Gel slices, containing the 19-kDa protein, were localized by Western blotting, and the corresponding areas of the original gel were excised for electroelution. The eluting buffer consisted of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. The purity of the eluted oleosin was checked by analytical SDS-PAGE (18Ritco-Vonsovici M. Minard P. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16543-16551Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The eluted 19-kDa oleosin was precipitated by adding 2.5–3 volumes of ice-cold acetone and mixing thoroughly. The acetone/eluate mixture was allowed to precipitate for 2 h at −80 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the acetone supernatant poured off, and the tubes inverted to drain. The precipitate was then solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The dissolved protein sample was placed into a dialysis tube and dialyzed against refolding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm sodium cholate, and 1 mm EDTA for 72 h. The buffer was changed 4 times at 4 °C. Lipid films were prepared by drying 20 mg of phospholipids in chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, followed by lyophilization overnight. Solvent-free phosphatidylcholine was solubilized in a small volume of sodium cholate made up in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (22Au D.M.Y. Cummins I. Murphy D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The preparation was mixed vigorously until a clear solution was obtained with a final phosphatidylcholine concentration of 20 mg/ml. A greater than 4-fold excess (w/w) of sodium cholate was used to dissolve the phospholipid. The concentration of cholate was confirmed to be above its critical micellar concentration of 7 mm. The purified and refolded oleosin protein in refolding buffer and trioleoylglycerol was then added to produce a final phospholipid/oil/polypeptide ratio by weight of 1:20:2. The solution was sonicated for 5 min to form a uniform suspension. The suspension was dialyzed against 5 changes of buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) and followed by sonication for 5 min. The phospholipid/oil/protein suspension was then centrifuged for 30 min at 5,000 × g. The reconstituted oil bodies were collected by floatation and washed in refolding buffer to remove oil-free proteins. Finally the oil bodies were resuspended in 10% sucrose made up in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The mixtures were again sonicated for 30 s and allowed to stand for 2 h. The reconstituted phospholipid-oil-oleosin complexes were then analyzed by immunocytochemistry and FTIR spectroscopy. Reconstituted oil body preparations were resuspended in LMP-agarose. The preparation was fixed in glutaraldehyde and embedded in LR white resin as described previously (21Murphy D.J. Cummins I. Plant Sci. 1989; 60: 47-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sections of 100 nm thickness were cut on a MT6000 Ultramicrotome and mounted on to nickel grids (300 mesh). The grids were submersed for 40 min in a solution of 150 mm NaO buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA. The grids were then incubated with anti-oleosin polyclonal rabbit antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in PBS buffer, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA) for 1 h. The grids were washed 4 times in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA, and then incubated for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 12 nm colloidal gold particles (diluted 1:40 with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA). The grids were poststained for 15 min in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and 2 min in Reynold's lead citrate. The sections were examined on a Philips 400 transmission electron microscope. The rapeseed 9-kDa central domain was prepared by treating purified full-length 19-kDa rapeseed oleosin, reconstituted into phospholipid/oil bodies as described above, with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 4 h at 25 °C. This treatment resulted in the preferential digestion of the hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains. The lipid-embedded central domain was inaccessible to the protease (22Au D.M.Y. Cummins I. Murphy D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,23Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 262-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The digested oil body samples were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in 10% sucrose (prepared in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). The identity of the rapeseed central domain polypeptide that remained trapped in the purified oil bodies was verified by sequencing of the first 12 residues from its N terminus. The secondary structure of the central domain (trapped in oil bodies and produced by selective protease digestion) was determined by FTIR, as dry films and in aqueous medium. The spectra for test samples were compared with those obtained for pure oil (control) to identify the bands obtained from the central peptide. The central domain trapped in the oil bodies was recovered by depriving the polypeptide of oil, and the recovered central domain was then reconstituted into liposomes for the secondary structural determination by CD (14Li M. Keddie J.S. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17504-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.80Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained using on a Jasco J-600A spectropolarimeter (wavelength range 260–185 nm), under constant nitrogen flush and using 1 mm cells at 20 °C. The data were recorded on-line using an IBM computer. The spectra presented are derived from an average of 4 scans recorded at 10 nm/min. Instrument sensitivity of ± 20 millidegrees full scale was routinely used, along with a 4-s time constant (24Clark D.C. Smith L.J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1989; 37: 627Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The instrument was regularly calibrated using ammonium d-10-camphorsulfonate (25Takakuwa T. Konno T. Meguro H. Anal. Sci. 1975; 1: 215-218Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) andd-pantolactone (26Konno T. Meguro H. Tuzimura K. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 67: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The complex solution contained liposome-reconstituted (0.1 mg/ml) purified central domain or 19-kDa oleosin. Base line was corrected with phospholipid solutions in the absence of protein. The CD data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity (Q, degrees·cm2·mol−1). The molar ellipticities (Q) can be determined from Q = MRW·Q°/10 J.C. MRW is the mean residue weight determined from analysis of the amino acid composition; Q° is the measured ellipticity in degrees; J is the light path in cm; and C is the protein concentration in g/ml. Data, at appropriate intervals between 260 and 185 nm, were analyzed by standard linear combination methods. The principle of this technique involves fitting the experimental spectrum with the basis spectra for secondary structure motifs by a least square curve-fitting method. The basis spectra were prepared from reference spectra obtained from soluble proteins with established three-dimensional structures, determined by x-ray crystallography. The reference set of proteins used in the estimation of protein secondary structure by CD spectroscopy was further enlarged to 37 proteins using additional published data (27Sreerama N.

The SELCON3 program, different reference sets, and related data files were adopted from the websites: lamar.colostate.edu/∼sreeram/SELCON3 (27Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W.

In the self-consistent method (SELCON3) (33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) the spectrum of the protein analyzed was compared with the structure of the reference protein having the CD spectrum most similar to that of the protein analyzed to make an initial guess for the unknown secondary structure. The matrix equation relating the CD spectra to the secondary structure was solved by the singular value decomposition algorithm (34Forsythe G.E. Malcolm M.A. Moler C.B. Computer Methods for Mathematical Computations. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1977: 192-236Google Scholar). In addition, this program returned estimates for the fractions of α-helix (regular α-helix + distorted α-helix), β-sheet (regular β-strand + distorted β-strand), β-turn, and unordered secondary structure motifs. The FTIR spectra for the central domain of oleosin and intact 19-kDa oleosin (in either artificial oil bodies or liposomes) were measured at room temperature on a Bio-Rad FTS60 spectrometer, using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector (resolution of 2 cm−1) and Win-IR software. Triangular apodization was employed. The samples were introduced to the spectrometer in solution form. A total of 1200 scans was collected for each spectrum to get a reasonable signal/noise ratio. Difference spectra were obtained by digitally subtracting solvent spectra and phospholipid/oil body (containing no protein) spectra. Each sample solution was determined in three batches. The individual spectrum of three determinations for each sample was obtained and averaged to produce a single spectrum. The data were processed using GRAMS/32 (Galactic Industries). Second derivative spectral analysis and Fourier self-deconvolution were used to locate the position of the overlapping components of the amide I band, to confirm band center frequencies and assign them to different secondary structures. Secondary structure components were accomplished by least squares iteration. Gaussian band shapes were assumed for the deconvoluted components. The amide bands I (80% C=O stretch, near 1650.0 cm−1), II (60% N–H bend and 40% C–N stretch, near 1550.0 cm−1), and III (40% C–N stretch, 30% N–H bend, near 1300.0 cm−1) are normally used to study protein secondary structure. Identification of particular frequencies with secondary structures was made by reference to spectra of homopolypeptides and proteins with primarily α-helical or β-sheet structures and proteins with known structures. Data analysis and band decomposition have been described previously (35Renugopalakrishnan V. Rapaka R.S. Collette T.W. Carreira L.A. Bhatnagar R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Spectrosc. 1991; 45: 1665-1673Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, for analysis of each component in the spectra, four parameters were considered as follows: band position, band height, bandwidth, and band shape. Deconvolution and derivatization were employed to resolve the number and position of component bands. Initial heights were set at 90% of those of the original spectrum for the bands in the center and the edges, and 70% of the original heights for the other bands (39Abbott T.P. Wolf W.J., Wu, Y.V. Butterfield R.O. Kleiman R. Appl. Spectrosc. 1991; 45: 1665-1673Crossref Google Scholar). Bandwidth estimates were obtained through derivative spectra, and the Gaussian components were used. The decomposition method assumes that the extinction coefficient is the same for the different structural components. Thus, intensities are proportional to the fraction of each secondary structure. Curve fitting was performed in two steps. (i) The band position was fixed, allowing width and heights to approach final values. (ii) Band positions were allowed to change. The fitting results were further evaluated by overlapping the reconstituted overall curve on the original spectra and examining the residual obtained by subtracting the fitting from the original curves. The conformational assignments of amide I, II, and III bands used in this study were as described previously (35Renugopalakrishnan V. Rapaka R.S. Collette T.W. Carreira L.A. Bhatnagar R.S. Biochem.

The fractional secondary structure contents of the test samples used for the calibration of the partial least square analysis were tabulated from the output of the DSSP program (44Kabsch W. Sander C.

https://openalex.org/W2070006462,"CDX1 is a homeobox protein that inhibits proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and regulates intestine-specific genes involved in differentiation. CDX1 expression is developmentally and spatially regulated, and its expression is aberrantly down-regulated in colorectal cancers and colon cancer-derived cell lines. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of CDX1gene expression. In this study, we characterized the CDX1 gene structure and identified that its gene promoter contained a typical CpG island with a CpG observed/expected ratio of 0.80, suggesting that the CDX1 gene is a target of aberrant methylation. Alterations of DNA methylation in the CDX1gene promoter were investigated in a series of colorectal cancer cell lines. Combined BisulfiteRestriction Analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that the CDX1 promoter is methylated in CDX1 non-expressing colorectal cancer cell lines but not in human normal colon tissue and T84 cells, which express CDX1. Treatment with 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azaC), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, induced CDX1 expression in the colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, de novo methylation was determined by establishing stably transfected clones of theCDX1 promoter in SW480 cells and demethylation by 5-azaC-activated reporter gene expression. These results indicate that aberrant methylation of the CpG island in the CDX1 promoter is one of the mechanisms that mediate CDX1 down-regulation in colorectal cancer cell lines.

In the genome of higher eukaryotes, cytosines may be methylated in CpG sequences at locations throughout the genome (1Razin A. Shemer R. Hum. Mol.

In contrast, small regions of DNA called CpG islands are often unmethylated in normal tissues and are located in the promoter sequences in half of human genes. Recently, many studies have shown that hypermethylation in CpG islands is found in some tumors, which is associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, including RB (4Stirzaker C.

It directs intestine-specific gene transcription and regulates the intestinal epithelial cell phenotype (15Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell.

Previously, we demonstrated that murine Cdx1 overexpression in rat normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) regulates proliferation as a result of inducing cell cycle arrest. This antiproliferative effect may be mediated through down-regulation of the d-type cyclins (18Lynch J. Suh E.R. Silberg D.G. Rulyak S. Blanchard N. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4499-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Cdx1 gene is expressed in a complex pattern during intestinal development. In mouse embryogenesis, Cdx1 protein is first observed at 12.5 postcoitum in the distal developing intestine. Expression of Cdx1 increases from 13.5 to 14.5 postcoitum during the time of transition from a stratified endoderm to the columnar epithelium of the intestine (19Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cdx1 expression continues in the intestinal epithelium throughout life, predominantly in the crypt. The same pattern of CDX1 expression was found in the human small intestine and colon (20Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our studies and those of others have demonstrated that CDX1 expression is markedly down-regulated in both adenomas and carcinomas of the colon (20Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the developmental and spatial patterns of the CDX1 expression in normal intestine or what induces the down-regulation in colonic adenomas and cancers. In this study, we hypothesized that CDX1 expression in colorectal cancer cell lines may be in some cases silenced by methylation of the CpG island in the gene promoter. We characterized the CDX1gene structure and identified the CDX1 gene promoter containing CpG islands. A series of colorectal cancer cell lines was tested for aberrant methylation on the CDX1 gene promoter and associated inactivation of CDX1 expression as a possible mechanism of the down-regulation of CDX1 gene expression in colon cancer. Our results indicate that CDX1 expression is inactivated in association with aberrant methylation in colorectal cancer cell lines. KSBN1 was constructed by subcloning aBamHI fragment containing −1066 + 802 nucleotides relative to the transcriptional start site of the CDX1 gene from 201E12 (22Bonner C.A. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) into Bluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A series of luciferase reporter genes containing deletions of theCDX1 promoter was constructed by subcloning aBamHI-SphI, XbaI-SphI, orDraIII-NheI fragment from KSBN1 into pGLBasic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to generate −1066CDX1Luc,1 −600CDX1Luc, or −394CDX1Luc, respectively. SW480, HCT116, HeLa, DLD1, Colo205, Caco2, and T84 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). RKO was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital. SW480 cells were maintained in Kennett's medium supplemented with 1×l-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and T84 cells in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. ColoDM, Caco2, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and DLD1 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum. 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin were added to each medium. Cells (∼107cells) in 100-mm dishes were washed with PBS, lysed with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and homogenized using a type B pestle. Human tissue was obtained in accordance with institutional regulations. 10 mg of human normal colon tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer using a prechilled Dounce homogenizer. Whole cell protein fractions were obtained by centrifuging homogenized lysates at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. 20 μg of whole cell protein was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for several hours at room temperature with PBS/milk and then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal Cdx1 antibody (20Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and monoclonal actin antibody (Sigma) were used as the primary antibody. After washing the membranes three times for 10 min with PBS/milk, the blots were incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase; AmershamBiosciences) for 45 min at room temperature and developed with the ECL-Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). Primer extension was performed as described previously (23Traber P.G., Wu, G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In brief, oligonucleotide primer (PECDX1: 5′-TCCTTGTCCAGCACATAGC-3′) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled PECDX1 (50,000 cpm) was annealed to 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HCT116 and T84 cell lines at 50 °C for 3 h. The annealed primer was extended with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by hydrolyzing mRNA in 0.1 m NaOH. cDNA was precipitated in ethanol and separated in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The sequencing reaction with PECDX1 on a genomic subclone (KSBN1) was loaded on the side for size control. Plasmid DNA was transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). For stable transfection, pGLBasic, −600CDX1Luc, or RVCDX1Luc was cotransfected with pLXSP containing a puromycin-resistant gene into SW480 cells. Cells were split and selected in medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. For transient transfections, cells were transfected with deletional constructs using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and the supernatant was analyzed for luciferase activity using a microtiter plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies Inc., Franklin, MA). Transfection efficiency was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Cells were grown in medium containing final concentrations of 1, 3, or 5 μm 5-azaC (Sigma) for 72 h. RNA was isolated from cells that were treated with 3 and 5 μm 5-azaC. If needed, TSA (final concentration, 300 nm) was added to the appropriate dishes, and the incubation was continued for another 24 h. RNA from cultured cells was prepared as described previously (20Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Possible contamination of DNA was eliminated by treating the RNA samples with DNase I, and samples were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). Two μl of RT reaction was used for PCR reaction. Amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The following specific PCR primers were used: CDX13NT5, 5′-GTTGGATAAAGACCTTCCAGC-3′; CDX13NT3, 5′-TGAGGGCTGTGATTCTGTAACC-3′; H36B5, 5′-ATGTGAAGTCACTGTGCCAG-3′; H36B3, 5′-CTCAGGATTTCAATGGTGCC-3′; GAPDH5, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′; GAPDH3, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′. Sodium bisulfite modification of genomic DNA and PCR were performed as described previously (24Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 25Toyota M. Issa J.P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of genomic DNA was denatured with 2 m NaOH for 10 min and then treated with 3 msodium bisulfite (Sigma) (pH 5.0) and 10 mm hydroquinone for 20 h at 50 °C. After treatment, DNA was purified using a Wizard DNA Clean-up kit (Sigma) and desulfonated with 0.3 mNaOH. Bisulfite-treated DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of sterile distilled water. PCR amplification was performed with ∼200 ng of treated DNA as the template. The sequence of interest in the bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified with bisulfite specific primers. PCR was performed as described previously (26Herman J.G. Jen J. Merlo A. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 722-727PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty percent of the PCR products was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, precipitated with ethanol, and separated by 6% PAGE. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the intensity was calculated by densitometry using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Bisulfite-specific primers are: bisulfite1F, 5′-TTGTTTTTTATTTTAAGTTGGTTATTG-3′; bisulfite1B, 5′-AAAAATAAACTAACCAAAACCTAAAAA-3′; bisulfite2F, 5′-TTATTTTTTTTAGGTTTTGGTTAGTT-3′; bisulfite2B, 5′-CCACCCAAACCTTTTATAACTC-3′. Amplified bisulfite PCR products were subcloned into the TA vector system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transformation, DNA was prepared by Qiaprep spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA sequence analysis was carried out by automated DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) at the Sequencing Facility of the Department of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. The complete genomic structure of CDX1 was characterized by restriction enzyme mapping using a cosmid clone containing human CDX1 genomic DNA (201E12; a generous gift from Dr. Cynthia Bonner (22Bonner C.A. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1, all 3 exons of CDX1are located in the 201E12 that contained 15 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 8 kb of 3′-flanking sequences relative to exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. The total sequence of the 201E12 is located in the BAC5m9 from chromosome 5 (LBNL H220; Human Genome Center, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Primer extension analysis was performed to determine the 5′ end of the CDX1 transcript (Fig.1 B). Two transcriptional initiation sites were detected, and the major site was located 97 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site, which is similar to the start site described previously in the mouse Cdx1 gene (27Hu Y. Kazenwadel J. James R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27214-27225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A TATA consensus sequence (TATAAA) is located 27 nucleotides 5′ to the transcriptional start site. There is 88% homology between the mouse and human CDX1 promoter regions within 200 nucleotides of the transcriptional start site (Fig.1 C). We examined CDX1 protein expression in a series of colorectal cancer cell lines. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig.2 A, T84 cells expressed high levels of CDX1 protein; however, Caco2, SW480, HCT116, ColoDM, and DLD1 cells contained no expression. Therefore, the majority of colorectal cancer cell lines tested do not express CDX1 protein. HeLa cells, a cervical cancer cell line, was used as a negative non-intestinal control since we assumed that they lacked an intestine-specific transcription machinery that was required for CDX1 gene expression. The level of CDX1 mRNA in each cell line was similar to the protein pattern (data not shown). Deletion constructs of the CDX1 gene promoter linked to the luciferase reporter were transiently transfected into the colorectal cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 B, T84, Coco2, SW480, and HCT116 cells had a markedly increased transcriptional activity, and ColoDM and DLD1 cells revealed moderate activity of the CDX1promoter constructs when compared with an inverted promoter construct (RV-3000CDX1Luc). Most of the luciferase activity resided in the construct that contained nucleotides −394 to +75. The result suggests that the CDX1 promoter contained elements that were able to direct transcription in intestinal cell lines. However, there were similar levels of transcriptional activation in all intestinal cell lines although only T84 cells expressed the CDX1 gene. In contrast, HeLa cells that were used for a negative control showed little induction on transcriptional activity of the CDX1promoter when compared with a RV-3000CDX1Luc. Based upon the transfection data, we postulated that CDX1 gene expression could be repressed in non-expressing cells through promoter methylation without affecting the transiently transfected constructs. TheCDX1 gene contains a typical CpG island (28Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar) with a CpG observed/expected ratio of 0.80 and a GC content of 73% spanning a region −400 nucleotides to the transcriptional start site. Therefore, we examined the methylation status of specific sites between nucleotides −415 and −16 within this CpG island in normal colon and colorectal cancer cell lines by bisulfite PCR (Fig.3 A). The genomic DNA samples isolated from cell lines as well as normal colon tissue were treated with sodium bisulfite and amplified by PCR. The amplified products were digested with restriction enzymes specific for the methylated alleles. As shown in Fig. 3 B, there were very low methylation levels at a few sites in normal colon as well as in T84 and Colo205 cells. By contrast, this same region was highly methylated (70–100%) in HCT116, Caco2, RKO, and ColoDM cells and moderately methylated (30–69%) in SW480 and DLD1 cells. We next employed sodium bisulfite sequencing to examine the methylation status of 33 CpG sites within the CpG island of the CDX1 gene promoter for further detail using a normal colon sample and representative colorectal cancer cell lines (T84, HCT116, and SW480). In normal colon and T84, which were unmethylated by bisulfite PCR, a slight level of methylation was detected in 26 and 15 of 330 CpG sites in 10 alleles sequenced, respectively. In contrast, HCT116, with 96% of methylation by bisulfite PCR, also showed a high degree of methylation at all the CpG sites examined (327 of 330 sites in 10 alleles). The SW480 cell line showed moderate methylation with 211 of 330 sites in 10 alleles, demonstrating 64% methylation. 5-azaC is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that can be used as a demethylating agent in replicating cells (29Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lantry L.E. Zhang Z. Crist K.A. Wang Y. Kelloff G.J. Lubet R.A. You M. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further explore the correlation between methylation of the CDX1 gene and silencing of CDX1 gene expression, six colorectal cancer cell lines were grown in the presence of 5-azaC to achieve demethylation of genomic DNA. RT-PCR analysis showed that CDX1 expression was induced in HCT116, Caco2, DLD1, ColoDM, SW480, and RKO cells, whereas untreated samples with high levels of promoter methylation showed no detectable mRNA level. T84 and Colo205 cells expressed CDX1 gene without treatment (Fig. 4). These results suggest that methylation plays a role in silencing CDX1 gene expression in the colorectal cancer cell lines tested. To obtain further functional evidence of the importance of promoter methylation, we tested de novo methylation by using established stably transfected clones with the CDX1 gene promoter. The construct containing −600 to +75 of theCDX1 gene linked to the luciferase reporter (−600CDX1Luc) was stably transfected into SW480 cells. Constructs without the promoter (vector) or an inverted −600 + 75 of the CDX1 linked to the luciferase reporter (RVCDX1Luc) were also transfected as controls. Individual clones were selected, grown in the presence or absence of 5-azaC, and analyzed for luciferase expression. As shown in Table I, luciferase activity of the clones containing −600CDX1Luc had similar levels as the clones containing RVCDX1Luc. This result differed from transient transfections, which demonstrated 20-fold higher activity of −600CDX1Luc when compared with the RVCDX1Luc (data not shown). Furthermore, the clones containing −600CDX1Luc gave an 11-fold induction in promoter activity due to demethylation after treatment with 5-azaC, whereas clones containing RVCDX1Luc showed a background level of fold induction when compared with clones transfected with pGL2 basic vector (Fig. 5). The result provided functional evidences on inactivation of the CDX1gene promoter by de novo methylation, which could be reversed by demethylation with 5-azaC.Table IRe-activation of CDX1 promoter in SW480 stable clones after treatment with 5-azaCClone1-aSW480 clones transfected with the 600 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking sequence of the CDX1promoter linked to the luciferase reporter genes (clone series C), the inverted promoter construct (R), and reporter construct without promoter (G).

Open table in a new tab There is accumulating evidence that DNA methylation plays a role in cancer pathophysiology and that promoter hypermethylation is often an early event in tumor progression. Earlier studies suggested that hypomethylation was involved in carcinogenesis through the activation of oncogenes, such as ras (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it is increasingly apparent that aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of certain tumor suppressor genes leads to loss of gene function in certain tumors. In colorectal cancers, APC, p16INK4A, THBS1, HIC1, N33, COX2, CACNA1G, MYOD, and VERSICAN are hypermethylated in CpG islands in their promoters (32Ahuja N., Li, Q. Mohan A.L. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5489-5494PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that CDX1 inhibits cell proliferation, and its expression is reduced in the majority of colon cancers. In this study, we show that the CpG islands of theCDX1 gene promoter are a target of aberrant methylation, resulting in silencing the expression in CDX1 in the human colorectal cancer cell lines tested. These results suggest that methylation plays a significant role in the modulation of CDX1 transcription in colon-derived cancer cell lines and possibly in colon cancer. There are several possibilities to explain methylation-mediated gene repression in colorectal cancer cell lines. First, methylation can directly interfere with the DNA binding of specific transcription factors. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the CDX1 gene shows that there are a number of potential cis-regulatory elements including SP1, AP1, CDX, and TCF4 binding sites. However, our study shows that the frequency of methylation within the 5′-flanking region of the CDX1 gene is not sequence-specific but region- and cell type-specific. Second, methylation may result from the accessibility of promoter accessible to methyltransferase or methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBDs) as a secondary event due to the lack of transcription factors. However, this is unlikely to be true in the repression of the CDX1 expression since our data from transient transfection demonstrated that all necessary transcription factors were present to activate the minimal promoter of the CDX1 gene in the colorectal cancer cell lines tested. Third, methylation may play a role in transcriptional repression through alteration of the chromatin structure, which influences gene accessibility to the necessary transcription machinery. Recently, the methyl-CpG-binding proteins (i.e. MBDs and MeCP2) have been shown to participate in protein complexes that recruit active corepressor complexes containing histone deacethylases (33Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 34Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). We tested this possibility by treating cells with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In our preliminary experiment, we treated non-CDX1-expressing colorectal cancer cells with TSA alone, but it failed to activate CDX1 expression in colorectal cancer cell lines (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of TSA following demethylation with 5-azaC did not increase the level of CDX1 expression activated by 5-azaC alone, suggesting that methylation-mediated repression might be sufficient to silence CDX1 gene expression. It has been reported that mammalian DNA methyltransferase (DMNT1) can bind transcriptional co-repressors and directly repress gene transcription (35Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) in addition to the fact that DNA methyltransferases can bind histone deacetylases (36Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 37Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transcriptional silencing mechanism through methylation may be complex, and it is likely that more than one mechanism is involved in silencing CDX1 gene expression in colorectal cancer cell lines. Promoter hypermethylation-mediated loss of gene function appears to be essential for certain genetic events that derive from tumor progression. For example, MLH1 hypermethylation may occur prior to the onset of microsatellite instability (MIN+) (12Esteller M. Catasus L. Matias-Guiu X. Mutter G.L. Prat J. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1767-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The MIN phenotype can be seen in almost all colon cancer samples from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and in 15–20% of sporadic colorectal cancers (2Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). In addition, MIN+ is one of the fundamental pathways of chromosomal instability in colon cancers that hasten the process of tumorigenesis. Previous studies have revealed that the MIN phenotype has a high level of methylation of genes (38Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Our study did not find an association of methylation with the MIN phenotype. A group of genes, including p16INK4A, MLH1, and others, appear to be coordinately methylated in colon cancer (25Toyota M. Issa J.P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which suggests that a subset of colon tumors including MIN+arises through pathways that involve a certain predisposition to epigenetic gene silencing. However, it remains to be determined whether hypermethylation of the CDX1 gene promoter occurs independently or is predisposed by certain factors during colon tumorigenesis. In summary, our data demonstrate that theCDX1 promoter is aberrantly hypermethylated in colorectal cancer cell lines and suggest that it may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of colon cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2163643060,"Genetic evidence suggests that the SPP1-encoded gene 35 product (G35P) is essential for phage DNA replication. Purified G35P binds single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and double-strand (dsDNA) and specifically interacts with SPP1-encoded replicative DNA helicase G40P and SSB protein G36P. G35P promotes joint molecule formation between a circular ssDNA and a homologous linear dsDNA with an ssDNA tail. Joint molecule formation requires a metal ion but is independent of a nucleotide cofactor. Joint molecules formed during these reactions contain a displaced linear ssDNA strand. Electron microscopic analysis shows that G35P forms a multimeric ring structure in ssDNA tails of dsDNA molecules and left-handed filaments on ssDNA. G35P promotes strand annealing at the AT-rich region of SPP1 oriL on a supercoiled template. These results altogether are consistent with the hypothesis that the homologous pairing catalyzed by G35P is an integral part of SPP1 DNA replication.

However, two SPP1 replication origins, which are 32 kb away from each other (oriL and oriR) in a linear molecule, have been mapped (3–6; see Fig. 1 below). Previously, it has been shown that G38P, G39P, and G40P are the only SPP1-encoded functions necessary and sufficient to drive theta replication from the cis-acting oriL region in an otherwise non-replicative element in B. subtilis cells (7Missich R. Weise F. Chai S. Lurz R. Pedré X. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accumulation of ring-to-ring, theta type, SPP1 replication intermediates, however, has not been observed by electron microscopy examination of SPP1-infected cells (3Ganesan A.T. Andersen J.J. Luh J. Effron M. Schlessinger D. Microbiology 1976. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.1976: 319-325Google Scholar). Upon infection, SPP1 circular and sigma molecules were detected, but branched replication intermediates have not been observed (3Ganesan A.T. Andersen J.J. Luh J. Effron M. Schlessinger D.

The generation of concatemeric SPP1 DNA is at least dependent on phage-encoded (G38P, G39P, G40P, G34.1P, G35P, and G36P, see Fig. 1 below) and host-encoded (DNA PolIII, DnaG, and DNA topoisomerases) replication proteins but is independent of host-encoded components of the primosome (e.g. DnaB, DnaD, and DnaI) and recombination proteins (RecA, AddAB, and RecF) (5Burger K.J.

Analysis of SPP1 conditional-lethal mutants for their capacity to synthesize phage DNA has lead to the identification of two different complementation groups. Whereas mutants in genes 38,39, and 40 show a block in DNA replication, mutants in genes 34.1 and 35 show a normal initiation but a replication arrest phenotype (5Burger K.J. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen.

Genes38, 39, and 40 and genes34.1, 35, 36, and 36.1 are early transcribed genes that form part of two different operons (Fig.1 A). G36P, which is a helix-destabilizing single-stranded binding protein and shares 46% identity with B. subtilis SSB protein, does not seem to be essential under laboratory growth conditions (10Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activity of G36.1P, which shares a significant degree of identity with group I endonuclease proteins, remains to be characterized. The initiation of theta-type replication at SPP1 oriL has been defined. In vitro studies reveal that multiple copies of G38P bound to its cognate site (AB and ab boxes, Fig.1 B) induce local unwinding of the adjacent AT-rich sequence (DUE region) present within oriL or oriR (7, see Fig. 1 B). The helicase loader, G39P, specifically interacts with the replisome organizer, G38P, and with G40P·ATP (6Pedré X. Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

However, very little is known about the mechanism(s) involved in the recover of collapsed replication forks and in the generation of linear concatemeric SPP1 DNA. The picture of how replication proceeds has changed over the last decade (reviewed in Refs. 15Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cox M.M.

Dev. 2000; 10: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is now assumed that the one or replication forks formed at the replication origin become inactivated at high frequency, for example as a result of roadblocks in or on the template strands. In bacteria, the repair of this stalled replication fork requires the RecA, RecBCD, RecF, RecG, and/or RuvABC recombination proteins that may create a d-loop that is recognized by a component of the primosome (see Refs. 15Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J.

It has been shown that the PriA protein bound to the branched DNA molecule (recombination intermediate) directs the assembly of a new replication fork at the site through the loading of a primosome for theta type DNA replication (17Marians K.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that recombination intermediates formed between a linear duplex and supercoiled DNA are substrates for a DNA synthesis reaction where products longer than unit length are generated (18Xu L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14321-14328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the presence of redundant pathways that could account for the recovery of an arrested replication fork and for the accumulation of concatemeric SPP1 DNA cannot be ruled out, we have previously shown that SPP1 replication does not require host-encoded homologous recombination proteins and components of the d-loop primosome assembly (Refs. 19Viret J.-F. Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 20Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, and this work). Furthermore, there are several lines of evidence that support the idea that SPP1 encodes in its genome recombination functions that may drive the restart of stalled replication forks and the switch from theta to sigma type of replication. First, plasmid transduction is markedly increased when homology between the plasmid and SPP1 is provided (9Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Trautner T.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, SPP1 infection triggers the appearance of long concatemeric plasmid linear molecules whose synthesis is dependent on homology, and phage-encoded functions, but independent of host-encoded recombination or primosome assembly functions (e.g. RecA, DnaB, etc.), whereas in non-infected cells synthesis of concatemeric plasmid molecules is dependent of both RecA and DnaB (21Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4651-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Stiege A.C. Chai S. Weise F. Trautner T.A. Gene. 1997; 204: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that SPP1 may encode for a system that coordinates the processing of inactivated replication forks and the subsequent fork reactivation and the synthesis of concatemeric SPP1 DNA. G35P and G34.1P share an overall identity of 40 and 18% with the Escherichia coli recombination proteins RecT and RecE, respectively. RecT is a SSA protein and RecE is an ATP-independent 5′→3′ exonuclease, both encoded by the defective lambdoib Rac prophage (reviewed in Ref. 15Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the homologous recombination systems of lambdoid phages (e.g.λ-red, P22-erf, etc.) that are required for growth in recA mutants (reviewed in Refs. 23Skalka A.M. Grell R.F. Mechanisms in Recombination. Plenum Publishing, New York1974: 421-432Crossref Google Scholar and 24Skalka A.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1977; 78: 201-237PubMed Google Scholar), G35P and G34.1P are essential SPP1 replication proteins in both wt and recA host strains (3Ganesan A.T. Andersen J.J. Luh J. Effron M. Schlessinger D. Microbiology 1976. American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.1976: 319-325Google Scholar, 5Burger K.J. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen.

Sedimentation studies of DNA synthesized by SPP1tsI20F (impaired in G34.1P, see Fig.1 A) or SPP1tsI17 (impaired in gene 35) in wt-infected cells, at the restrictive temperature, revealed that only a small percentage of the phage DNA can be recovered in a fast sedimenting form (concatemeric DNA). In both cases SPP1 particles of less than unit length (30–35 kb in size) accumulated (5Burger K.J. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 166: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consistent with this DNA arrest phenotype, and considering the unidirectional movement of the SPP1 replication fork, we can assume, that any event initiated at oriL stops 30–35 kb away, in G35P and G34.1P mutants at non-permissive temperature, suggesting that G35P and G34.1P are involved in fork reactivation and the generation of concatemeric DNA. Furthermore, this distance is consistent with the hypothesis that G38P bound atoriR might work as a roadblock that would collapse any replication fork started at oriL, being the generated replication intermediates of ∼32 kb (22Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Stiege A.C. Chai S. Weise F. Trautner T.A. Gene. 1997; 204: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To understand how concatemeric DNA initiates, we began the characterization of G35P. We found that G35P binds ssDNA and forms filaments. G35P preferentially catalyzes, in an ATP-independent manner, SSA between a circular ssDNA and a homologous 3′ tail of linear dsDNA. G35P preferentially catalyzes SSA between a 3′-ssDNA and the homologous AT-rich region of oriL on a supercoiled molecule and specifically interacts with the G40P DNA helicase and G36P SSB proteins. The results presented provide the first evidence that the SPP1 replication/recombination protein, G35P, might direct the assembly of the hexameric replicative helicase G40P at a d-loop structure by a new primosome assembly mechanism that does not require the primosome assembly proteins of B. subtilis.

Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) have been previously described. The plating efficiency of an SPP1 stock was measured in four independent experiments for wt, priA1, and priA1 dnaB75 strains. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and rifampicin were from Calbiochem. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from MBI or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [α-32P]dATP, [γ-32P]ATP, Sephadex G-100, DEAE, Superose 12, and Q-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphocellulose was from Whatman. PEI was from Sigma. The 6065-bpHindII-MscI-cleaved M13mp18 duplex DNA fragment was gel-purified. Linear 6065-bp M13mp18 DNA molecules having an ssDNA 3′ termini (3′-tailed dsDNA) or an ssDNA 5′ terminus (5′-tailed dsDNA) were prepared by incubation of DNA with T7 gene 6 exonuclease or withE. coli ExoIII, respectively. About 50% of both substrates had an ssDNA tail with a length of ∼140 nt, measured as the percent of substrate resistant to PvuI orBglI digestion, which are located 140 or 170 bp, respectively, from the restriction site dsDNA end. Viral M13mp18 DNA was first annealed with a 20-nt oligonucleotide containing the EcoRI restriction site and then linearized with EcoRI. The DNA ends were blunted in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, and the labeled viral M13mp18 linear ssDNA was purified. The 194-nt γ-32P-labeledEcoRI-FspI ssDNA was prepared by annealing 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GCAACTGTTGGGAAGGGCG-3′) to Rf M13mp18 and extending it by PCR up to the EcoRI site, and the product was gel-purified. Oligonucleotides 1 through 4 were prepared by annealing 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides to pCB163 and extended by PCR as follows: oligonucleotide 1 (230-mer), the 5′-TACCTCCCGGACAATATTAG-3′ primer was extended up to the StyI site; oligonucleotide 2 (215-mer), 5′-ATTGTCCGGGAGGTAGTCGGAG-3′ extended up to the HincII site; oligonucleotide 3 (215-mer), 5′-GACGGCCTTAAATAGTCATCGCCC-3′ extended up to the SspI site. Oligonucleotide 4 (230-mer), 5′-GTAAACAATTTCCTCAAACTCTGCC-3′ extended up to the SspI site. The oligonucleotides 1 through 4 were gel-purified. The concentration of DNA is expressed as moles of nt for ssDNA or moles of bp for dsDNA. G38P, G39P, and G40P were purified as previously described (6Pedré X. Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1324-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Ayora S. Lange U. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). G36P purification will be described elsewhere. SPP1 G35P was purified to apparent homogeneity from anE. coli BL21(DE3) strain lacking the Rac-defective prophage. Soluble G35P was precipitated by PEI. G35P was recovered from the pellet by addition of 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol) containing 500 mm AS. The proteins of the supernatant, free of cell debris, DNA, and E. coli RecA protein, were precipitated twice by addition of solid AS to a final concentration of 60% saturation. Dialyzed G35P was purified in three different chromatographic steps (phosphocellulose, DEAE, and Q-Sepharose). The sequence of the first 15 amino-terminal residues of the purified protein was determined. The amino-terminal sequence of the G35P polypeptide was identical to the sequence predicted from the gene 35 (10Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except that the initiator methionine was not present. The molar extinction coefficient for G35P was calculated to be 22390 m−1 cm−1, as described previously (11Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The G35P concentration was determined by using the above molar extinction coefficient and is expressed as moles of protein dimers. The native molecular mass of G35P was determined by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. Chromatography was carried out in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5% glycerol) containing 100 mm NaCl and the presence or the absence of 5 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the A 280 was measured. G35P (7 or 30 μm) was applied onto the column. A standard curve of K av versuslog10 of relative mobility was determined as recommended byAmersham Biosciences. Protein standards were: chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; BSA, 68 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; and catalase, 232 kDa. The formation of G35P·M13mp18 γ-32P·ssDNA or G35P·M13mp18 α-32P·dsDNA complexes was measured in buffer B (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol) in the presence or the absence of 5 mm MgCl2 by using alkali-treated filters (Millipore, type HAWP 0.45 μm) as described by Missich et al. (7Missich R. Weise F. Chai S. Lurz R. Pedré X. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in duplicate. The 194-nt γ-32P-EcoRI-FspI ssDNA or 194-bp α-32P-EcoRI-FspI dsDNA fragments (1 μm) were used to analyze the binding of G35P to DNA through EMSA in buffer B in the presence or the absence of MgCl2. The reaction was stopped and separated in a 6% ndPAGE under high ionic strength conditions as previously described (7Missich R. Weise F. Chai S. Lurz R. Pedré X. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gels were run for 3 h at 150 V at 4 °C and dried prior to autoradiography. G35P or BSA proteins (6 μm) were covalently cross-linked to the Affi-Gel-10 (1 ml) resin as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). G36P, G38P, G39P, or G40P (1 μm) was loaded onto the column that had been equilibrated with binding buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm βME, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1% CHAPS) containing 50 mm NaCl. Columns were washed with 20 column volumes of buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl. Bound fractions were eluted with 5 volumes of buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. Fractions of 100 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The assay measures the formation of a stable complex between linear 6065-bp M13mp18 dsDNA (30 μm) bearing an ssDNA termini (3′-tailed or 5′-tailed dsDNA) or blunt-ended dsDNA and circular M13mp18 ssDNA (30 μm). Both substrates were incubated with increasing concentrations of G35P (48 nm to 1.56 μm) in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm βME, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol) containing 25 or 100 mm NaCl, during 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K, and the samples were fractionated by AGE (0.8%) with EtBr (11Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The gel was photographed under UV irradiation. Joint molecules were quantified by densitometry of photographic negatives. A labeled oligonucleotide 1 to 4 (120 nm, in nt) and supercoiled homologous pCB163 (8.4 μm, in bp) were incubated with 62 nm G35P in buffer D containing 100 mm NaCl at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K, and samples were separated by AGE. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The signal was quantified using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Reactions (10 μl) containing 3′-tailed dsDNA (30 μm) and circular M13mp18 ssDNA (30 μm) were incubated with G35P (780 nm) for 10 min at 30 °C under standard strand exchange conditions in 50 mm NaCl. For the analysis of the joint molecules, upon deproteinization, cytochrome c spreading in the presence of 50% formamide and carbonate buffer on a water hypophase was used as described by Spiess and Lurz (27Spiess E. Lurz R. Meth. Microbiol. 1988; 20: 293-323Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The protein·DNA complexes, which were separated from unbound protein by Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration, were fixed with glutaraldehyde and adsorption to mica and prepared for EM as described previously (27Spiess E. Lurz R. Meth. Microbiol. 1988; 20: 293-323Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Single particle image analysis was performed on images of unfixed, negatively stained samples as previously described (28Yang S., Yu, X. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), using a reference-free algorithm to generate averages (29Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Joint molecules were prepared with supercoiled plasmid pCB163, oligonucleotides 1–4, and G35P, in the presence of 1 mm ATP, as described before. After incubation during 15 min at 30 °C, G40P (80 nm) was added, and the reaction was continued for another 10 min at 30 °C. Aliquots of the reaction were taken and deproteinized to analyze and quantify the extent of thed-loops formed, and isolation of G40P bound to the joint molecules from unbound G40P was performed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL-6B as previously described (11Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). G40P was detected in the different fractions by Western blot. Soluble G35P, which was purified to 99% homogeneity as assayed by SDS-PAGE and quantitative analysis of the amino-terminal amino-acid sequence, was assayed for its ability to act as dsDNA or ssDNA nuclease (exo- or endonuclease), to hydrolyze ATP in the presence or absence of ssDNA or dsDNA, to unwind DNA, to bind ssDNA or dsDNA, and to interact with SPP1-encoded replication proteins. From these activities tested we observed that purified G35P protein is able to bind DNA and to interact with at least G40P and G36P. G35P consists of 287 amino acid residues corresponding to a molecular mass of 32,000 Da (10Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The native molecular mass of purified G35P was estimated by size fractionation through a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. In the presence or in the absence of 5 mm MgCl2, at low G35P concentrations (7 μm), G35P elutes in two peaks of similar area, one narrow peak corresponding toM r 65,000 and one broad peak corresponding toM r 250,000–350,000. At high G35P concentrations (30 μm), G35P elutes mainly in a broad peak, with M r 250,000–350,000, in the presence or in the absence of MgCl2. If we assume that G35P is spherical in shape, it is likely that, under the G35P concentrations assayed, G35P is in an equilibrium between a dimer and a higher order oligomer in solution. We cannot rule out, however, that G35P is an elongated monomer with a large Stokes radius. The affinity of G35P for linear 7,250-nt M13mp18 ssDNA (1 μm) was determined by filter binding assays by following the rate of complex formation as a function of G35P concentration (Fig.2 A). G35P·ssDNA complex formation was not linear at low protein concentrations and appeared to be sigmoidal at high G35P concentrations. TheK app of the G35P·ssDNA complex, which in this case is equal to protein concentration midpoint, was estimated to be ∼ 14 nm and ∼ 26 nm at pH 7.5, 30 °C in buffer B in the absence and the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, respectively. It is likely, therefore, that, both in the absence or presence of 5 mm MgCl2, G35P interacts with ssDNA with a weak cooperativity. To analyze the type of complexes formed by G35P with ssDNA, EMSA was used. G35P does not bind to segments as short as the 26-nt ssDNA fragment of different sequence, indicating that there is a minimum length required for stable binding, but the formation of G35P·194-nt ssDNA complexes was observed by EMSA (Fig. 2 B). At molar ratio of 1 G35P per 80-nt or 40-nt (1:80 or 1:40), G35P forms multiple and diffuse complexes with the 194-nt32P·ssDNA, whereas at higher molar ratios (1:20 and 1:10) one discrete complex was observed (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 3, and 10). TheK app value of the G35P·ssDNA complex was estimated by EMSA to be ∼18 and ∼36 nm at pH 7.5, 30 °C in buffer B in the absence and the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, respectively. The affinity of G35P for linear 7250-bp M13mp18 dsDNA (1 μm) was determined by filter binding assays also in the absence or the presence of Mg2+ (5 mmMgCl2) (Fig. 2 A). The G35P·dsDNA complex retained by the filter was less than 65%. In the plateau region, where all the blunted linear dsDNA is presumably saturated with G35P, only 55–62% retention are observed, even at a G35P concentration"

In this report, we examined the role of Cdc27 on the structure and activity of pol δ. We show that the four-subunit complex is monomeric in structure, in contrast to the previous report that it was a dimer (Zuo, S., Bermudez, V., Zhang, G., Kelman, Z., and Hurwitz, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5153–5162). This discrepancy between the earlier and recent observations was traced to the marked asymmetric shape of Cdc27. Cdc27 contains two critical domains that govern its role in activating pol δ. The N-terminal region (amino acids (aa) 1–160) binds to Cdc1 and its extreme C-terminal end (aa 362–369) interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Mutants of S. pombe pol δ, containing truncated Cdc27 derivatives deficient in binding to PCNA, supported DNA replication less processively than the wild-type complex. Fusion of a minimal PCNA-binding motif (aa 352–372) to C-terminally truncated Cdc27 derivatives restored processive DNA synthesis in vitro. In vivo, the introduction of these fused Cdc27 derivatives into cdc27Δ cells conferred viability.

The precise function of these smaller subunits is of considerable importance because they influence the activity of these enzymes and contribute to the interactions of the polymerase with other replication components such as SV40 T antigen, Dna2 which influences Okazaki fragment processing, and components of the eukaryotic pre-replication complex (4Donreiter J.

The precise role of pol δ and pol ε in the synthesis of leading and lagging strands, however, remains unclear. In the SV40 replication pathway, pol δ plays a more important role than pol ε in supporting SV40 DNA replication (1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev.

S. pombe pol δ is a heterotetramer composed of four subunits (4S) of 125 (pol 3), 55 (Cdc1), 45 (Cdc27), and 22 kDa (Cdm1) (16MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A.

Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, purified pol δ is a heterotrimer, consisting of 3S, Pol3p, Pol31p, and Pol32p (20Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) which are homologues of the S. pombe subunits, pol 3, Cdc1, and Cdc27, respectively. As in S. pombe, Pol3p and Pol31p are essential, whereas Pol32p is not, although pol32Δcells grow poorly and display DNA replication defects (20Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, the heterotrimeric S. cerevisiae pol δ is highly processive, whereas the heterodimer, Pol3p-Pol31p, is less processive, in keeping with observations made in S. pombe. Whereas in early reports, mammalian pol δ was shown to contain two subunits, the p125 catalytic subunit and the 55-kDa Cdc1 homologue (21Zhou J.Q., He, H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), later studies (22Ducoux M. Urbach S. Baldacci G. Hubscher U. Koundrioukoff S. Christensen J. Hughes P. J. Biol.

These included, in addition to p125 and p55, two additional subunits, p66 and p12, with homology to Cdc27 and Cdm1, respectively. Recently, reconstitution of the cloned human pol δ 4S complex as well as a 3S complex, p125-p50-p66, was reported (25Podust V.N. Chang L.-S. Ott R. Dianov G.L. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3894-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The addition of the p12 subunit (homologous to Cdm1) to the 3S complex stimulated the activity of the complex. To date, no homologue of Cdm1 or p12 has been identified in S. cerevisiae. Three additional proteins are required to maximize the activities associated with pol δ and pol ε. These include replication protein A (to at least remove secondary structure impediments along the primer template DNA and prevent spurious binding of polymerase), RFC (the clamp loader), and PCNA (the sliding clamp). RFC, which interacts with PCNA, loads the clamp onto the 3′-end of a primer template in an ATP-dependent manner. PCNA, a ring-shaped homotrimer, encircles the DNA and acts to tether the pol δ complex to the primed DNA template thus permitting processive DNA synthesis (1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The subunits Cdc27, Pol32p, and mammalian p66 all contain a short PCNA-binding sequence at their C termini, resembling the eight-residue PCNA-binding motif found in p21 (Waf1/Cip1) (18Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. Macneill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49258-49266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, the large catalytic subunit of S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and mammals contains a weak PCNA-binding motif near their N terminus (26Parker A., Gu, Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,27Zhang P., Mo, J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N., Xu, H. Lee M. J. Biol.

However, pol δ preparations devoid of the strong PCNA-binding subunit (Cdc27, Pol32p, and p66) are considerably less processive (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Studies in S. pombe, carried out both in vitroand in vivo, have shown that Cdc27 interacts directly with PCNA (18Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. Macneill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the PCNA-binding motif present at the C terminus of Cdc27 is required for this reaction. Furthermore, this C-terminal motif is essential in vivo suggesting that in its absence the processivity of the 4S S. pombe pol δ complex is probably compromised. In this report, we have examined this problem in vitro using cloned 4S complexes containing C-terminal truncated Cdc27 derivatives. We report that in the absence of the C-terminal PCNA-binding region, pol δ is less processive than the wild-type 4S complex. The fusion of the PCNA-binding motif to a truncated Cdc27 subunit, possessing the Cdc1-binding domain, restores the processivity of the 4S complex. The biological relevancy of this finding was examined in vivo. S. pombe cdc27Δ cells, which are inviable (18Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. Macneill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were rescued by the expression of truncated Cdc27 derivatives covalently fused to the PCNA-binding motif but not by derivatives devoid of this motif. Based on gel filtration experiments, we reported previously that the 4S complex was a dimer, whereas the 3S S. pombe pol δ complex, devoid of Cdc27, was a monomer (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have reinvestigated the quaternary structure of these complexes, and we now show that both the 4S and 3S S. pombe pol δ complexes are monomeric in structure. By combining both size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analyses, we find that the Cdc27 subunit is elongated with a frictional ratio (f/f 0) of 1.85. Thus, S. pombe pol δ complexes, which include Cdc27, are highly asymmetric in shape but appear to be monomers rather than multimers, as suggested previously. Similar findings have been reported for the Pol32p subunit of S. cerevisiae, indicating thatS. cerevisiae pol δ exists as a monomer rather than as a dimer in solution (28Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4384-4388Google Scholar). Poly(dA)4000 and oligo(dT)12–18 were obtained from Life Sciences (St. Petersburg, FL) and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs were from Amersham Biosciences. S. pombe RFC was purified from S. pombe cells, and recombinant S. pombe PCNA was isolated from Escherichia coli as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB was from AmershamBiosciences or a generous gift of Dr. M. O'Donnell (Rockefeller University). Polyclonal antibodies against p125, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 were prepared as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. Macneill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing p125, Cdc1, Cdm1, and full-length Cdc27 were generated using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses expressing the various Cdc27 derivatives described here (see Fig. 1 A) were generated by PCR cloning using pFastBacHtb-Cdc27 as template. For N-terminal truncations, a forward primer containing BamHI site 5′ to the ATG codon that was in-frame to the region that was amplified, and a pFastBacHtb reverse primer was used in the PCR amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI site of pFastBacHTb. For the C-terminal truncations, the pFastBacHTb forward primer was used as 5′ primer, and the reverse primer contained the TAA stop codon in-frame to the region that was amplified and a 3′XbaI site. The PCR products were cloned into theBamHI and XbaI site of pFastBacHtb. The Cdc27 construct that resulted in the D6M deletion mutant (containing amino acids 1–241 fused to amino acids 352–372) was generated by PCR using a mutagenic primer with the sequence, 5′-GATCTGAAAAATATTAAGAAGAATACTG-3′. The D7M deletion mutant (aa 1–160 fused to aa 352–372) was generated by using a mutagenic primer with the sequence, 5′-GAAAAAGGCACCTTCAAAGAAGAATACTG-3. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced using these pFastBacHtb-Cdc27 derivatives according to manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression Systems, Invitrogen). Monolayer high five insect cells were grown at 27 °C to near 80% confluence in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. High five cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding a single pol δ subunit or infected with multiple viruses to produce various pol δ complexes, as described (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Infected cells were incubated at 27 °C for 64–72 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1800 ×g) for 15 min at 4 °C as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Various subunits and complexes of S. pombe pol δ were purified from infected cells as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Stokes radii of Cdc27 and pol δ were determined from their elution profile from a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The column was developed at a rate of 30 μl/min and fractions (50 μl) were collected. The K av for each protein or protein complex was calculated from its elution profile and included and excluded volumes of the column. The Stokes radius of each protein was determined from a standard linear plot of (−logK av)1/2 versusStokes radius using molecular weight markers. Sedimentation values of proteins were determined as described previously (29Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight was calculated using the Monty-Siegal equation (28Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4384-4388Google Scholar):M app = 6 πηNas divided by (1 − νρ), where η = viscosity of the medium, N= Avogadro's number, a = Stokes radius,s = sedimentation coefficient, ν = partial specific volume, and ρ = density of the medium. The frictional ratio (f/f 0), which estimates the deviation of the protein from a globular structure, was determined by the equationf/f 0 =a/(3νM/4πN)1/3. High five insect cells (2 × 105) were infected with baculoviruses that expressed Cdc1 and His-Cdc27 or the indicated truncated His-Cdc27 derivatives. Cells were collected 72 h post-infection, resuspended in 1.2 ml of Buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mm benzamidine) supplemented with 25 mmimidazole and then subjected to a brief sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant (15.6 mg of protein in 0.65 ml) was incubated with 100 μl of Ni2+ beads (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 4 h and centrifuged, and the pelleted beads were washed four times with 1 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 m imidazole yielding 60 μg of protein in a volume of 100 μl. An aliquot of the eluted protein (0.7 μg) was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using Cdc1-specific antibodies. Replication assays using poly(dA)4000-oligo(dT)12–18 were carried out as described previously (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in the presence of S. pombePCNA and S. pombe RFC. The PCNA-dependent pol δ-catalyzed elongation of poly(dA)-oligo(dT) in the absence of RFC was carried out in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 40 mm Bicine-Tris buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm DTT, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 30 μm[α-32P]dTTP (5–8000 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml BSA, 12.5 μm poly(dA)4000-oligo(dT)12–18, 50 ng of S. pombe PCNA, and S. pombe pol δ as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and an aliquot was used to measure the amount of 32P incorporated into poly(dT). Elongation assays were used to evaluate the activity and processivity of the multiple pol δ complexes. In this assay, the rate of elongation of singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of E. coli SSB, S. pombe RFC, and S. pombe PCNA was used. Standard reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.01% BSA, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP (1–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 10 fmol of singly primed M13 DNA, 0.25 μg of E. coli SSB, 50 ng of S. pombePCNA, 10–20 fmol of S. pombe RFC and pol δ as indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, as indicated, halted with 10 mm EDTA, and separated by electrophoresis through an alkaline-agarose gel (1–1.5%), followed by autoradiography. Nucleotide incorporation into DNA was quantitated by DEAE-cellulose paper adsorption. The different Cdc27 derivatives used in this study are shown in Fig.1 A. The proteins designated D6M and D7M in Fig. 1 A, containing aa 1–241 and 1–160, respectively, were fused in-frame to the C-terminal 21 aa of Cdc27-(352–372). Each protein was expressed in the baculovirus insect cell system and purified. All preparations yielded predominantly a single band after SDS-PAGE analysis (some of which are shown in Fig.1 B), with the exception of the Cdc27-D6M derivative, which yielded three protein bands (Fig. 1 B). These three protein bands were immunoreactive to polyclonal antibodies specific for Cdc27, and their migration was not altered by λ phosphatase treatment (data not presented). We noted previously that Cdc27 (a 45-kDa protein, based on its aa content) migrates aberrantly during SDS-PAGE analysis (like a 54-kDa protein) (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a number of the Cdc27 derivatives described in Fig.1 A also migrated slower than predicted. This was true of Cdc27-D1, Cdc27-D2, and Cdc27-DF6. The migration of the truncated derivative D3, as well as further C-terminal truncated proteins, was as expected. These findings suggest that the amino acid sequence between 281 and 372 may contribute to the aberrant mobility of Cdc27. The quaternary structure of the 4S and 3S S. pombe pol δ complexes as well as the different Cdc27 derivatives were examined. Their Stokes radii (Fig. 1 C) and sedimentation values (summarized in Fig. 1 D) were determined by their elution properties from a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column and sedimentation in glycerol gradients, respectively. The gel filtration chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses were carried out at protein concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 12 μm. No significant concentration-dependent changes were observed in the Stokes radii and sedimentation values. Based on the Monty-Siegal equation, which includes both the sedimentation value and the Stokes radius, the 4S complex had an apparent molecular mass of 210 kDa which agreed fairly well with the predicted molecular mass of 240 kDa, based on the amino acid content of all four subunits present in stoichiometric amounts (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of the 3S complex, 161 kDa, was also close to the predicted molecular weight of this complex (195 kDa). The 4S and 3S complexes sedimented in glycerol gradients with the same sedimentation value but differed significantly in their Stokes radii (56.8 and 46.8 Å, respectively). This difference led to the earlier conclusion that the 4S and 3S complexes were dimeric and monomeric, respectively (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous gel filtration studies with the individual soluble subunits ofS. pombe pol δ, Cdm1, Cdc1, and Cdc27 (the pol 3 subunit alone was insoluble) indicated that Cdm1 and Cdc1 were monomeric and Cdc27 was tetrameric in structure (17Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In light of the above finding, the hydrodynamic properties of Cdc27 were reinvestigated. As shown in Fig. 1 D, based on both the Stokes radius and sedimentation value, the apparent molecular mass of Cdc27 was 73 kDa, approximately halfway between that predicted of a monomer (45 kDa) and a dimer (91 kDa). The calculated frictional ratio of Cdc27 was 1.85, suggesting a highly elongated protein. The D1-Cdc27 derivative (aa 1–362) exhibited hydrodynamic properties similar to full-length Cdc27. However, upon further truncation the Stokes radii of the Cdc27 derivatives decreased somewhat, and their properties were more in accord with a monomeric structure (Fig.1 D). All Cdc27 derivatives that interacted with Cdc1 yielded a monomeric heterodimer with little discrepancy between their predicted and apparent molecular weights (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). These results indicate that complexes containing Cdc27 and its derivative are highly elongated, a property contributing to their aberrant elution from sizing columns. In keeping with this notion, quaternary structure of the 4S-D6M complex was the same as the 4S complex with full-length Cdc27 (Fig. 1 D). The interaction of Cdc27 and its derivatives with Cdc1 and PCNA were examined. Cdc1 interacted with all Cdc27 derivatives containing the N-terminal aa 1–160 but not with mutants lacking this region (Fig. 2 A), in keeping with previous observations (18Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. Macneill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, whereas the D6-Cdc27 derivative did not bind PCNA, D6M, a fusion protein between D6 and the 20 aa regained the ability to interact with PCNA. We also determined the region in Cdc27 required for its interaction with pol δ by coinfecting insect cells with baculoviruses expressing the p125, Cdc1, and Cdm1 subunits and a virus expressing either full-length His6-Cdc27, His6-FLAG2-D7-Cdc27 (aa 1–160) containing only the Cdc1-binding domain, or His6-DF6-Cdc27 (aa 160–372) that included the PCNA-binding motif. Nickel-agarose pull-down experiments demonstrated that both Cdc27 and the D7-Cdc27 formed 4S complexes, whereas DF6 did not interact with the other subunits (data not presented). To determine whether DF6 (C-terminal half of Cdc27) could be included in the pol δ complex in the presence of the N-terminal half of Cdc27, His6-FLAG2-D7 and His6-DF6 were coexpressed with the three other subunits of pol δ in insect cells, and extracts were subjected to consecutive nickel-agarose and FLAG-agarose pull-downs. DF6 was not included in the pol δ complex even in the presence of the D7-C"

They are conserved across the plant and animal kingdoms, and to date, five distinct SCAMPs have been reported in mammals with SCAMPs 1–4 being ubiquitously expressed and SCAMP5 being neuron-specific (22Hubbard C.

SCAMPs 1–3 are ∼38 kDa, whereas SCAMPs 4 and 5 are ∼25 kDa. The larger SCAMPs (SCAMPs 1–3) have an extended cytoplasmic N terminus that is lacking in the smaller ones and contains domains that have been implicated as sites of interactions with other proteins (22Hubbard C.

Local structural differences within the N termini of SCAMPs 1–3 and at the extreme C termini of all SCAMPs distinguish the isoforms. Although their function has remained elusive, recent studies have suggested their possible action in membrane fusion. Sequence and topological analysis has revealed that the likely functional domain of SCAMPs is its membrane core, which features three highly conserved, cytoplasmically oriented amphipathic segments closely linking the transmembrane spans and positioned at the membrane surface (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like other fusion-supporting proteins, SCAMPs oligomerize in situ and in vitro(26Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1533-1541PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wu T.T. Castle J.D. Mol. Biol.

Castle, unpublished observations. and assembly of multiple transmembrane spans and amphiphilic segments might promote bilayer reorganization leading to fusion pore formation, stabilization, and/or expansion. Indeed, a gene ablation study has shown that mast cells of SCAMP1-null mice exhibit increased exocytotic reversal, suggesting reduced stabilization of fusion pores (28Fernandez-Chacon R. de Toledo G.A. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32551-32554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have been examining the roles of both SNAREs and SCAMPs in exocytosis in mast cells. Previously, we have shown that relocation of the SNARE, SNAP-23, along the cell surface and to granule membranes is required for exocytosis (27Wu T.T. Castle J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1661-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have begun to consider the function of SCAMPs. We have focused on SCAMP2, which like SCAMP1 is prominent in mast cells and is localized to intracellular organelles including secretory granules and in part to plasma membranes where the concentration of SCAMPs has not been recognized previously. Our findings demonstrate partial colocalization of plasma membrane SCAMPs with SNAP-23 and syntaxin4 and their coimmunoprecipitation with SNAP-23. They also identify a cytoplasmically oriented segment linking transmembrane spans 2 and 3 of SCAMP2 as a potent, sequence-specific and late-acting inhibitor of exocytosis when examined as a synthetic peptide. Inhibition is an order of magnitude stronger than for the corresponding peptide of SCAMP1. We suggest that SCAMP2 may play a critical role in completing exocytosis, which can be competed by the peptide and that the peptide may be a useful new tool for examining the molecular composition of granule-to-plasma membrane and granule-to-granule fusion sites. Sprague-Dawley retired breeder male rats were from Hilltop Inc. Streptolysin O (SLO) was from Murex Diagnostics Ltd. (Dartford, UK). GTPγS and GDPβS were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All SCAMP peptides were synthesized and characterized at the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Protein kinase C inhibitory peptide 19–31 (RFARKGALRQKNV) was from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal anti-SCAMP antibody 7C12, having an epitope within the N termini of SCAMPs 1–3 was characterized previously (19Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-SCAMP antibody 1ω was described previously (26Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1533-1541PubMed Google Scholar); rabbit antibodies 2τ and 3β were raised against peptides (C)FSQGIFSSRTFHR of SCAMP2 and (C)QHRPSRQYATLDVY of SCAMP3. The avidities of anti-SCAMP antibodies were compared by using them on Western blots of known amounts of recombinant polypeptides encoding the relevant epitopes. The bound antibodies were detected and quantitated using125I-labeled secondary antibody and PhosphorImaging. Anti-SNAP-23 (C-terminal peptide) antibody was described (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-syntaxin 4 was the gift of Drs. Pam Tuma and Ann Hubbard (The Johns Hopkins Medical School). Antibody against phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate was obtained from Perspective Biosystems (Framingham, MA) and was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal antibody against Thy1 was from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Fluorescent-labeled antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); and 125I-goat anti-rabbit IgG was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Rho GTPase was from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). The protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate was obtained from Sigma. Mast cells were purified and permeabilized with SLO as described (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Amounts of SLO used are specified in the figure legends. Aliquots (10 μl) of cell suspension (1 × 104 cells) were added to 40 μl of K-GB buffer (137 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing various additives: 3 mm EGTA (for control samples) or EGTA-Ca (pCa = 5 or 5.5 for Ca2+-stimulated samples), 100 μm GTPγS (for GTPγS-stimulated samples), and 1 or 3 mm ATP (for GTPγS- and Ca2+-stimulated samples, respectively). Peptides or antibodies were also added at this step as noted. After 10 min on ice, samples were transferred to 37 °C for specified times to trigger secretion and then returned to ice. Following centrifugation, 10 μl of each supernatant was removed for assaying hexosaminidase (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and stimulated secretion was expressed as percent of total activity (cells + supernatant) present in the supernatant. Results were from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as means ± S.E. All peptides were stored at −20 °C either desiccated or for 1 week as stocks in 0.3 m Pipes, pH 6.8. One peptide (CWYRPIYKAFR) derived from SCAMP2 was used most frequently and was stored in solution over longer periods without change in its inhibitory potency. In desiccated form, its structure has remained unaltered over 3 years as determined by mass spectroscopy. Immunolocalization of SCAMPs was performed on mast cells that were attached to glass coverslips in protein-free medium, fixed in 3% formaldehyde on ice, and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin. Alternatively, antibodies were internalized by SLO-permeabilized cells and examined without fixation as described previously (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Images were recorded with a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope. For immunoelectron microscopic studies, anti-SCAMP and 2o antibody conjugates (1.4 nm gold; Nanoprobes, Inc.) were internalized by unfixed SLO-permeabilized mast cells and examined following fixation, silver intensification (4–7 min), embedding, and sectioning (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken of unstained specimens. Isolated mast cell granules (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) were washed by centrifugation in CB (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm Pipes, 5.6 mmglucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8), blocked (5% goat serum in CB), and labeled with monoclonal antibody 7C12 (5 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgG-10 nm gold (1:25) with intervening washes in CB. The granules were then fixed in buffered 3% glutaraldehyde and 1% OsO4, dehydrated in acetone, embedded, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate (50% methanol) and aqueous lead citrate. For conventional EM, permeabilized and incubated mast cells were fixed and processed as for isolated granules. For quantitative measurements on random-sampled cells, individual sections were collected at 20 μm (>1 cell diameter) intervals with one section per grid. Grids were scanned, and each cell with a full profile and central nucleus was photographed at fixed magnification. Evaluations on 36 images each of control and peptide-treated/stimulated cells were made as indicated in Fig. 4. To test for interactions of SCAMPs with SNAP-23 in mast cells, samples of 3 × 106cells were treated 5 min at room temperature with 0.5 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate, sedimented, and then solubilized 30 min on ice in 1 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin). After sedimenting insoluble material (15 min, 11,000 × g), the clarified lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg of anti-SNAP-23 or nonimmune rabbit IgG. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the solubilization solution and once with PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride). Adsorbed proteins were eluted in sample buffer containing 4% SDS, Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), and 50 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. We carried out a variety of localization studies using Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and cell fractionation to assess the distribution of SCAMPs in mast cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, mast cells contained SCAMPs 1–3. We have focused on SCAMPs 1 and 2 because they are much more abundant than SCAMP3, which was detected using an antibody, 3β, having an avidity that is higher than the avidities of the other two SCAMP antibodies (avidities were compared by quantitative Western blotting; see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunofluorescence on fixed and permeabilized cells showed that both of these SCAMPs detected together (monoclonal antibody 7C12) or individually (antibodies 1ω, 2τ) exhibit punctate labeling throughout the cytoplasm to the border of the cell (Fig. 1 B). SCAMPs were evident in purified granules and were directly localized on granule membranes (Fig. 1,A and C). From the recovery of purified granules determined by hexosaminidase assay (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we estimate that ∼25% of mast cell SCAMPs are associated with granules. Immunolabeling by antibody uptake into SLO-permeabilized unfixed cells, a procedure applied extensively for studies of SNAP-23 (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), detected SCAMPs deep in the cytoplasm poorly but was especially useful for highlighting SCAMPs near the cell periphery. Limited internal labeling appeared to be due to low antigen accessibility as it could be improved (although at the expense of granule integrity over the lengthy labeling protocol) either by substituting digitonin for SLO during permeabilization or by performing antibody uptake in the presence of Ca2+/ATP.2 SCAMPs at the periphery appeared in foci at the cell surface in both fixed/permeabilized and SLO-permeabilized unfixed specimens. Many of these foci exhibited overlap with SNAP-23 (Fig. 1 D), and the codistribution with plasma membrane SNAREs, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 was much more apparent in the SLO-permeabilized unfixed cells (Fig. 1,E and F). For the latter observation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the SLO treatment itself might have contributed to an enhanced colocalization. However, we believe that plasma membrane SCAMPs are likely to be associated with the SNAREs because it is possible to detect specific coimmunoprecipitation of SCAMPs 1 and 2 with SNAP-23 under conditions where no binding is detected using nonimmune IgG, and the mast cell plasma membrane protein Thy1 is not appreciably associated with the immune complexes (Fig.1 G). We confirmed the presence of SCAMPs in both granules and plasma membrane by immunogold labeling, which is illustrated for SCAMP2 (Fig.2). Notably, labeling was observed on granule membranes and plasma membranes often at sites where granules are close to the cell surface. Together, these studies verify granule association of SCAMPs and document a previously unreported low level incidence in the plasma membrane where they colocalize at least in part and associate with exocytotic machinery near prospective fusion sites. We have sought structural similarities among 11 SCAMPs spanning the plant and animal kingdoms. Comparison has revealed conservation in overall length (except for SCAMP 4 (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and SCAMP5 (23Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7941-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and sequence, both focally within the N-terminal one-third and broadly within the C-terminal two-thirds of the structure (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Significantly, SCAMPs 4 and 5 lack the N-terminal third and mainly compose the C-terminal two-thirds of other SCAMPs. Thus we assume that the functional domain resides within this common portion, which by similarity analysis contains conserved transmembrane spans and three highly conserved amphiphilic segments D–F (Fig.3 A). The latter all face the cytoplasm and are immediately proximal to the first transmembrane span (D), between spans 2 and 3 (E), and immediately distal to the fourth span (F) (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). E is most highly conserved (Fig. 3 B), and we have given peptides within this segment (called E peptides) highest priority in addressing SCAMP function. Initially, we have examined a potential role in exocytosis using SLO-permeabilized mast cells. Synthetic peptides corresponding to different segments of SCAMP were screened as secretory inhibitors by adding them to permeabilized cells and then assaying Ca2+- or GTPγS-stimulated release of hexosaminidase. E peptide inhibited exocytosis by both stimuli and was strongest for the peptides from mammalian SCAMPs 2 and 3, as compared with mammalian SCAMP1 (Gly replacing Lys, residue 8) andCaenorhabditis elegans SCAMP (Phe replacing Cys, residue 1). Fig. 3 C illustrates this selectivity. Here we used concentrations of 30 and 10 μm of the peptides during GTPγS (100 μm) and Ca2+ (10 μm) stimulation (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), respectively, as we have consistently observed distinct sensitivities to inhibition when the two secretory stimuli are examined comparatively (see below). The SCAMP1 and nematode versions of E peptide exhibited increased inhibition at a concentration of 100 μm. E peptide of SCAMP1 reduced Ca2+-stimulated secretion to 24 ± 1% of control whereas the nematode version reduced secretion to 44 ± 12% (mean ± range, two experiments for each). Several studies that we performed attested further to the sequence specificity of the inhibitory effect. First, a scrambled sequence of SCAMP2 E peptide was not inhibitory (not shown). Second, an “offset” peptide lacking CWY at the N terminus and including FR at the C terminus and having the same net charge was not inhibitory at 500 μm (not shown). Third, the inhibitory effect was greatly attenuated by replacing selected amino acids but not by truncating the C terminus, which reduces the amphiphilic character of the peptide (see below). Finally, the MARCKs peptide (KKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK), which binds membranes that contain acidic phospholipids (31Kim J. Blackshear P. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), is not inhibitory at 500 μm (not shown). In the following studies, we have focused on the E peptide of SCAMP2 because of its potency as an exocytotic inhibitor. Inhibition of secretion stimulated by Ca2+ and by GTPγS as a function of the concentration of E peptide was assayed biochemically (Fig. 4 A) and by phase microscopy (not shown). Ca2+-stimulated secretion consistently was more sensitive to the peptide than was GTPγS-stimulated secretion. For example, 10 and 30 μm E peptide reduced Ca2+-stimulated secretion to ∼40 and <20%, respectively, of the maximum stimulated secretion observed in the absence of peptide, whereas the same peptide concentrations reduced GTPγS-stimulated secretion to ∼80 and 32%, respectively (Fig.4 A). Whereas the difference in sensitivity of the two types of stimulation supports the possibility that the peptide has a specific rather than a nonspecific action, insight regarding the basis of the distinction is lacking at present. C-terminal deletions of 4 and 7 residues from the 15-residue E peptide of SCAMP2 had little effect (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, replacement of N-terminal Cys by Ala and of subsequent WY residues by AA dramatically decreased inhibition (Fig. 4 B). Inhibition was also substantially reduced by substituting separately Ile6 by Ala and Lys8 by Ala in the 8-residue E peptide (CWYRPIYK) and Arg4-Pro5 together by AA in the 11-residue E peptide (CWYRPIYKAFR) (not shown). These analyses underscore the sequence specificity of the inhibitory effect and the importance of the peptide's first eight residues. To clarify where peptide inhibition was occurring along distal signaling pathways emanating from Ca2+ and GTPγS stimuli, four different experimental approaches were used. First, unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with and without E peptide were compared by EM. In unstimulated cells, most of the granules were intact with uniform electron dense content (Fig.5 A). In GTPγS-stimulated cells, membrane-bounded sacs connected to the cell surface and filled with partially dispersed contents of multiple granules were indicative of compound exocytosis (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, inclusion of E peptide with GTPγS prevented discharge and preserved the appearance of unstimulated cells (Fig. 5 C). However, closer examination (Fig. 5 D) and quantitative measurements (Fig. 5,E and F) revealed key differences from controls. Although the total number of granules per cross-sectional cell profile and the number of peripheral granules were unchanged (Fig.5 E), peptide-blocked stimulation caused increased membrane contact (granule-to-plasma membrane and granule-to-granule; Fig. 5,D and F), implying accumulation of tethered or docked granules without fusion. In mast cells, we have shown that relocation of SNAP-23 from cell surface folds to putative fusion sites is required for compound exocytosis presumably for trans-SNARE complex formation (30Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To reach this conclusion, we induced relocation of SNAP-23 on ice and added SNAP-23 antibody to block subsequent exocytosis at 37 °C. Thus in a second approach, we tested whether the E peptide also was inhibitory after SNAP-23 relocation as would be expected if blockade is beyond docking of fusion partners. We incubated permeabilized cells 30 min on ice with Ca2+/ATP, added E peptide, and warmed to 37 °C, and we compared the resulting inhibition to that when E peptide was added before Ca2+/ATP. In both cases, inhibition was thorough (Fig.6 A), signifying that E peptide blocked beyond SNAP-23 relocation. In a third approach, we evaluated inhibition by peptide in relation to the ATP-dependent step of exocytosis, which is generally thought to correspond to priming of the exocytotic machinery, a step that precedes triggering by Ca2+ or GTPγS (32Martin T.F.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In mast cells, it is possible to trigger exocytosis using Ca2+ and GTPγS following ATP depletion (33Koffer A. Churcher Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that if priming is a step in the secretory response of the mas"

Both wild type and mutant Gβγ subunits activated phospholipase C β2 with similar potencies; however, the S67K mutant showed reduced maximal activity. These data establish a pattern where mutations can alter the Gβγ regulation of a specific effector function without affecting other Gβγ-mediated functions.

Several reports have investigated the molecular sites of interactions between Gβγ and their effectors, but the exact molecular mechanism by which Gβγ alters effector function remains unclear. In one case, the co-crystal structure of the Gβ1γ2 and phosducin has been determined (2Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This structure points to multiple interactions between the two proteins concentrated in at least two distinct domains. Other studies using indirect approaches including mutagenesis have corroborated this design for Gβγ interaction with its effectors (2Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 3Buck E., Li, J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R.

Most of these studies have identified multiple sites on Gβγ as well as on each effector, where such interactions may occur. We have recently reported multiple sites of interactions between GIRK channels and Gβγ subunits based on chimeric analysis and mutagenesis studies (6He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7He C. Yan X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7348-7355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, we showed that there are at least three interaction sites on the GIRK channel that are crucial both for binding to Gβγ and for transducing the Gβγ effects on channel activity. Recently, we also identified eight residues on Gβ1 that are important in functional interactions with GIRK1 channels (8Mirshahi T. Robillard L. Zhang H. Hebert T.E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7348-7355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These amino acids reside on distinct domains of the G protein as assessed from the known crystal structure (9Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 10Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion of multiple interactions between the two proteins. Although several interaction points between Gβγ and effectors have been identified, the functional significance of these multiple interactions remains unclear. Furthermore, effector-specific interaction domains on Gβγ have not been defined. Here, we have tested three mutants located on separate surfaces of Gβ for interactions with GIRK channels, N-type calcium channels, and PLCβ2. One of these mutants, Gβ1(S67K)γ2 showed specific functional defects in regulating each of these three effectors without affecting other Gβγ functional interactions with these effectors. All of the cDNAs used were subcloned into pGEMHE to accommodate sufficient expression in oocytes. Mutations were made using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using high fidelity Pfu polymerase for 12–16 cycles only. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Cornell University Sequencing Facilities, Ithaca, NY). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding wild type β1, β1(S67K), β1(S98T), and β1(T128F) were generated using the Bac to Bac Expression System (Invitrogen). G protein βγ complexes were purified by co-expression of β1 with hexahistidine-tagged γ2. The C-terminal (amino acids 191–419) and the N-terminal (amino acids 1–92) domains of GIRK4 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). GIRK4C protein was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and the protein was purified from the soluble extract. GIRK4N protein was induced with 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h and purified from inclusion bodies. After solubilization with 5 m urea, the protein was refolded by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20% glycerol followed by dialysis against PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Binding of Gβγ to GST-GIRK4C or GST-GIRK4N was assayed essentially as described (6He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-GIRK (10 μm) was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% lubrol. Unbound protein was removed by centrifugation. Gβγ (1 μm) was added to glutathione fusion protein and allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound Gβγ was removed by centrifugation, and the glutathione-bound protein complexes were washed with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.01% lubrol. Protein was eluted by heating at 70 °C for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Gβ1 was detected by immunoblot using an antibody directed against the C-terminal peptide of Gβ1. cDNA constructs were linearized and subjected to in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resulting cRNAs were quantified by comparison of two dilutions to a standard on a formaldehyde gel. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis frogs, enzymatically digested with collagenase and incubated in ND-96 solution containing calcium and nutrients (11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with cRNAs, 2 ng each of GIRK4(S143T) and 2 ng of each G protein subunit or mutant. Following injection, oocytes were kept for 48–96 h in an 18 °C incubator before recordings. The Gβγ subunits used for the PLC assay and inside-out patch experiments were generated using the BaculoGold Expression System (PharMingen) and were purified by co-expression of a hexahistidine-tagged γ2 as described by Kozasa and Gilman (12Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) except that lubrol was replaced with CHAPS in the final washes. Final protein concentrations were estimated against known amounts of BSA standard on SDS-PAGE following Coomassie staining. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out as previously described (13Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocytes were placed in a chamber and perfused with a solution containing high potassium (96 mm). Currents were recorded using a voltage step protocol from –100 to +50 mV (control current), and barium (3 mm) was used to measure the leftover current that was not inwardly rectifying (barium-insensitive current). We determined the inwardly rectifying current by subtracting barium-insensitive current from the control current. Macro-patch channel activity was recorded on devitellinized oocytes using the inside-out mode of standard patch clamp methods as described (14Zhang H., He, C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 96 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solutions contained 96 mm KCl, 10 mmHEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 20 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% CHAPS, pH 7.4. The purified Gβγ subunits were diluted to 16 nm in the bath solution. Recordings were made at a holding membrane potential of –80 mV. Recordings were made using the EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and PULSE/PULSEFIT (v.7.6) data acquisition software (Heka Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were stored on the hard disk of a PC-compatible computer and plotted using Microcal Origin. The sampling rate was 10 Hz for most recordings. For recordings from N-type channels, α1b, α2δ, and β3 subunits of calcium channels were expressed at a ratio of 3:1:4 respectively with a total cRNA of 6 ng/oocyte. G protein subunits were expressed similar to those for GIRK channel recordings. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from oocytes were performed 5–7 days after injections in external solutions containing: 50 mmNaC2H3O2, 40 mmBa(C2H3O2)2, 2 mmKOAC, 5 mm HEPES pH 7.5 (Ba(OH)2). For recordings, the oocytes were held at –100 mV, and a voltage step to +10 mV was used to activate N-type channels. For pre-pulse facilitation, a depolarizing step to +100 mV was used 1 min after the first activating pulse, followed by a 5-ms refractory period and a +10-mV activating pulse. Basal currents were measured as the maximal current level during the first activation pulse. Facilitation is defined as the percentage of the amplitude of the second activating pulse compared with the first. The PLC assay was performed as described (3Buck E., Li, J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sf9 cell membranes expressing PLCβ2 were incubated with a mixture of [3H]PIP2 and excess cold-phospholipids in the presence or absence of G protein subunits. A control tube with no PLC added was used to measure background. Reactions were started by addition of 0.5 mm calcium and incubated at 32 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of methanol/chloroform mixture and EGTA. Tubes were centrifuged, the aqueous phase collected, and radioactive counts of 400 μl of the aqueous phase were determined in a scintillation counter. All the counts were collected, and the blank was subtracted. Generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was measured as [3H]counts per minute in the aqueous phase. Dose-response curves were fitted using the sigmoidal curve-fitting routines in Microcal Origin 6.0, and EC50 values were calculated. We previously reported that the Gβ1 S67K, T128F, and S98T mutants failed to activate heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. Fig.1 A shows the position of these residues on three distinct surfaces of Gβ1 as determined from the crystal structure of Gβ1γ2 (9Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Here, we use GIRK4(S143T) (denoted as GIRK4*), a homomeric-active GIRK4 channel with a mutation in the pore-helix (11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), to test the effectiveness of these Gβγ mutants to enhance basal currents. We have previously shown that homomeric GIRK4* channels behave similarly to the GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromers and are therefore functionally interchangeable (15Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the effectiveness of different Gβ subunits co-expressed with Gγ2 to enhance GIRK4* currents in oocytes. For comparison, currents at –80 mV were normalized to the levels of GIRK4* expressed alone. Wild type Gβ1γ2 enhanced basal GIRK4* currents significantly, whereas the mutants failed to do so. This is similar to our findings in GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channels (8Mirshahi T. Robillard L. Zhang H. Hebert T.E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7348-7355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To address whether these functional defects were due to a lack of channel binding, we tested the binding of these three mutants to the N and C termini of GIRK4. Fig. 1 C shows the results from one such experiment. GST was used as negative control. Wild type Gβ1 as well as mutants Gβ1(S67K), Gβ1(S98T), and Gβ1(T128F), all bound both the N and C termini of GIRK4. Although some differences in channel binding could be detected between Gβ1(S67K) and wild type Gβ1, precise quantitation of such differences was not attempted. Similar experiments showed proper binding of the wild type and the three mutants to the N and C termini of GIRK1 (data not shown). These data indicate that the functional defects in these mutants were not due to a lack of binding to the channel. We next tested in inside-out patches the activity of purified wild type and mutant Gβ1γ2 proteins on GIRK4* channels expressed in oocytes. Sodium, which interacts directly with GIRK4* (13Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,16Ho I.H.M. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and activates currents independently of Gβγ (13Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was used to test current levels before and after application of purified Gβγ. We have previously shown that Gβγ can enhance activation of K+ channels by sodium in a synergistic way. Therefore measuring activation of the channel by sodium after application of Gβγ can serve as an indicator for interactions between the channel and Gβγ. Fig. 2shows results from inside-out patches in oocytes. Channel activity was tested by a brief bath application of 30 mm sodium; after washout of sodium, 16 nm purified Gβγ protein was applied to the patch. Wild type Gβ1γ2activated the channel within 2 min of application. Maximal Gβγ activation was obtained in 10–12 min. Gβγ washout resulted in a small reduction in the K+ current indicating that most of the Gβγ was still on the channel. A second application of sodium activated the channel to a much higher level than the initial sodium application before the Gβ1γ2 application (Fig. 2 A). This is consistent with our previous data showing synergism between sodium and Gβγ activation of the GIRK channels (18Petit Jacques J. Sui J. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutants S98T and T128F also activated the channel in all patches that were tested; however, the activation was smaller, and mutants could be washed out with faster kinetics compared with the wild type Gβγ (Fig. 2 A). Again in both cases, an enhancement in the sodium response was observed after activation with the mutant proteins. The Gβ1(S67K) mutant on the other hand failed to activate the channel in half of the patches tested, whereas the activation in the other half of the patches was minor (Fig. 2 B). However, in all patches regardless of the ability of S67K to activate GIRK* currents, the Na+ response was enhanced following application of S67K (Fig. 2 A). Summary data show the direct channel activation by Gβγ and mutants (Fig. 2 B) and the Gβγ enhancement of the Na+ activity (Fig.2 C). These results indicate that S67K induces the conformational changes on the channel that are necessary to enhance the Na+ activation but are not sufficient to cause channel activation. Furthermore, in those patches where channel activity was stimulated by S67K, this activity was smaller (Fig. 2 B) and reversed upon washout with faster kinetics compared with the wild type Gβ1γ2 (data not shown), again suggesting a different functional interaction between the channel and this mutant as compared with the wild type Gβ1γ2. We next set out to test the possible role of these three residues in interactions with other effectors of Gβγ. Gβγ normally inhibits N-type calcium channels. A strong depolarizing pre-pulse relieves this inhibition (19Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The Gβγ inhibition of N-type channels plays an important role in neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability (20Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Distinct interactions between N-type channels and different Gβ subtypes have been previously reported (21Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the interactions of wild type Gβ1γ2 as well as the three mutants S67K, S98T, and T128F with N-type channels expressed in Xenopusoocytes. We co-injected in oocytes mRNAs for the α1b, α2δ, and β3 subunits of calcium channels along with the different G protein subunit combinations and tested for inhibition of basal currents as well as pre-pulse facilitation of these currents in oocytes. Fig. 3 Ashows recordings in the absence and presence of a depolarizing pre-pulse for all combinations tested. All expressed Gβγ proteins, wild type and mutants, led to a significant reduction in basal calcium channel activity (Fig. 3 B). Because Gβγ interaction with N-type channels leads to current inhibition, this suggested that all tested Gβγ proteins interact with the channel. In the absence of co-expressed Gβγ the depolarizing pre-pulse did not lead to facilitation of the current. Pre-pulse facilitation was observed in oocytes expressing Gβ1γ2, Gβ1(S98T)γ2 and Gβ1(T128F)γ2. A summary of these data is shown in Fig. 3 C. Both S98T and T128F mutants showed facilitation that was not significantly different from the wild type Gβ1γ2 (p > 0.05, unpairedt test). In oocytes expressing Gβ1(S67K)γ2 basal current inhibition was similar to other mutants (∼50%, Fig. 3 B); however, no pre-pulse facilitation was observed (Fig. 3 C). The inhibition of basal current by Gβ1(67K)γ2clearly shows that it interacts with the channel, but the lack of facilitation suggests that this mutation has altered the functional interactions between the Gβγ and the Ca2+ channel. Gβγ subunits activate several subtypes of phospholipase Cβ through direct protein-protein interactions (22Morris A.J. Scarlata S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Several sites both on the G protein and PLCβ have been identified to be crucial for the functional interaction of the two proteins (3Buck E., Li, J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Panchenko M.P. Saxena K., Li, Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested the effectiveness of our three mutants, S67K, S98T, and T128F in activating PLCβ2. Wild type and mutant Gβγ subunits were purified from Sf9 cells and used in a PLC assay of PIP2 hydrolysis. Crude Sf9 cell membranes expressing PLCβ2 were used. This preparation displays some basal activity that can be enhanced by Gβγ subunits (3Buck E., Li, J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed and Fig.4 shows the results from one such experiment. All mutants stimulated enzyme activity with similar potency indicating that all three mutants interact properly with PLCβ2. Interestingly, Gβ1(S67K)γ2 showed reduced maximal activation of PLCβ2, suggesting partial activation of the enzyme and a potential role for this residue in functional interactions between the two proteins. The βγ subunits of G proteins interact at multiple sites with their effectors. Here we provide evidence that there are independent activating domains within Gβγ that control distinct functions within a given effector. Ser-67 is a surface-exposed residue on Gβ1; mutation of this residue to lysine led to alteration in certain Gβγ actions on effectors without affecting others. Although binding of this mutant to the channel was similar to the control and it showed enhancement of the Na+ activation of GIRK channels, it failed to directly activate K+ currents in whole-cell or inside-out patch recordings. This clearly demonstrates that although Ser-67 resides in a domain that is critical for direct activation of GIRK channels, its mutation does not interfere with either binding of Gβγ to the channel or Gβγ interactions that are required to enhance the effectiveness of Na+. Therefore, the Gβγ domain required for direct activation of the GIRK channels is distinct from regions that are sufficient for binding of the channel. Furthermore, enhancement of the Na+ effect by Gβγ requires interactions between Gβγ and the channel that are distinct from those involved in direct Gβγ-mediated activation of K+ currents. N-type calcium currents are basally inhibited in the presence of Gβγ. A depolarizing pulse applied to the membrane before channel activation can relieve this inhibition. We tested the effects of mutations at three surface-exposed residues on Gβ1 in interactions with N-type channels. All three mutants caused reduction of basal currents similar to the wild type Gβγ. Interestingly, pre-pulse depolarization did not relieve the inhibition by the S67K mutant, whereas the other two mutants behaved like wild type Gβγ. Here, we observe dual interactions of Gβγ with the channel, first inhibiting basal activity and second a voltage-sensitive “unbinding” and relief of the basal inhibition. The mutant S67K is immune to the voltage-dependent relief although it effectively interacts and inhibits the channel. Again we observe a separation of the two functional effects of Gβγ and the involvement of Ser-67 in one but not the other. Finally, each of the three critical surface-exposed residues activated PLCβ2 with potencies similar to that of the wild type Gβγ. However, S67K showed reduced maximal activity. Reduced maximal activity indicates that this mutant cannot fully activate PLC even though it binds normally as indicated by its potency. This suggests that serine 67 is involved in activation of PLC by Gβγ. These functionally critical residues that we identified on the three-dimensional structure of Gβ1 are located on multiple surfaces of Gβ1 supporting the biochemical evidence of multiple interaction points between effectors and Gβ1. Multiple interaction sites of Gβγ have also been found with phosducin (2Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using peptides derived from different regions of Gβ as well as mutagenesis it has been suggested that multiple domains of Gβ interact with PLCβ (3Buck E., Li, J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Panchenko M.P. Saxena K., Li, Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

Our data not only support multiple Gβ/effector interactions, but in addition they demonstrate for the first time that unique and separate molecular determinants of Gβ regulate specific effector functions. We thank Drs. Elizabeth Buck and Ravi Iyengar for guidance with the PLC assay. We thank Dr. Lutz Birnbaumer for providing the Ca2+ channel clones."

Although the lack of nurr1 expression has dramatic consequences for these cells either in terms of differentiation or survival, the mechanisms by which nurr1 controls gene transcription still remain unclear. In the intent to understand better the modalities of action of this nuclear receptor, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the transcriptional effects and DNA binding properties of nurr1 as a monomer or when forming dimers with the different isotypes of the retinoic X receptor (RXR). Here, we show that nurr1 acts as a gene activator independently of RXR and through an AF2-independent mechanism. In addition, heterodimerization with RXR is isotype-specific, involves multiple domains in the C-terminal region of nurr1, and requires RXR binding to DNA. RXRα-nurr1 and RXRγ-nurr1 heterodimers bind direct repeat response elements and display no specific requirements with respect to half-site spacing. However, the retinoid responsiveness of DNA-bound heterodimers requires the reiteration of at least three nurr1 binding sites, thereby limiting retinoid-induced nurr1 transcriptional activity to specific direct response elements.

However, in light of its important role in dopaminergic phenotype maintenance and its gene expression in several brain regions in adult tissue (13Xiao Q. Castillo S.O. Nikodem V.M.

Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar), binds as a monomer to the nerve growth factor inducible-β DNA binding sequence AAAGGTCA (NBRE (16Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J.

Furthermore, nurr1 also activates transcription by interacting with the 9-cis- retinoic acid receptor (RXR (18Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar)) and forms heterodimers permissive to retinoids on multimerized AGGTCA response elements (17Castro D.S. Arvidsson M.

However, retinoid-mediated transcription is not observed for natural nurr1-regulated genes containing functional NBREs in their promoter (10Sacchetti P. Mitchell T.R. Granneman J.G. Bannon M.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).RXR acts as a critical partner for several other NRs and forms either silent or 9-cis-retinoic acid-responsive heterodimers, depending on the dimer partner (22Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Characterization of the RXR-nurr1 DNA binding properties showed that RXR-nurr1 dimers bind preferentially to DR5 response element, in a manner reminiscent of the RXR-all-trans-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) dimer (20Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, the nurr1 C-terminal transactivation domain AF2 is required for RXR-nurr1 dimer formation (17Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson B.M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), unlike other RXR-containing heterodimers. The exact interaction modalities among nurr1, RXR, and their potential target recognition sequences need further analysis. Notably, the recent identification of a brain-specific ligand for RXR-nurr1 heterodimers (23de Urquiza A.M. Liu S. Sjoberg M. Zetterstrom R.H. Griffiths W. Sjovall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) suggests that RXR ligands may play a crucial role in regulating nurr1 transcriptional activity and prompts the identification of functional target genes for this RXR-nurr1 regulatory complex.In this study, we characterized the dimerization process between nurr1 and RXR by analyzing transcriptional activities and DNA binding properties of these receptors in PC12 cells, a pheochromocytoma cell line with neuronal characteristics and the ability to express nurr1 (1Law S.W. Conneely O.M. Demayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nurr1 interacted specifically with the RXR isotypes α and γ, but not β, and two regions in the C-terminal region of nurr1 are necessary for dimerization with RXR. RXR-nurr1 heterodimers displayed low stringency with respect to DR half-site spacing. Formation of DNA-bound heterodimers on DR with spacing ranging from 10 to 27 bases was detected, but these dimers were refractory to retinoid stimulation in transcription assays. In addition, our studies reiterate the function of nurr1 as a monomeric protein because preventing nurr1 interaction with RXR through modification of putative dimerization interfaces did not alter its transcription activating function.DISCUSSIONOur data show for the first time that nurr1 heterodimerizes selectively with RXRα and RXRγ, but not RXRβ on the NBRE3x (Figs.2 and 3 B) as well as on a DR5 (data not shown). This isotype-specific interaction is an important element to bear in mind when searching for target genes for these putative transcriptional regulatory complexes. In fact, data available on the expression of the RXR isotypes show a different spatial distribution of these receptors in adult brain (29Krezel W. Kastner P. Chambon P. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Zetterstrom R.H. Lindqvist E. Mata D.U. Tomac A. Eriksson U. Perlmann T. Olson L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), with high protein expression levels of RXRγ concentrated in the corpus striatum, the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary and a lower but more ubiquitous expression of RXRα throughout the brain (29Krezel W. Kastner P. Chambon P. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consequently, based on nurr1 mRNA localization (13Xiao Q. Castillo S.O. Nikodem V.M. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Zetterstrom R.H. Williams R. Perlmann T. Olson L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the potential genes regulated by RXR-nurr1 heterodimers would be located in the olfactory bulb, specific subregions of the cortex, and the hippocampus for RXRα and the hypothalamus for RXRγ. These predictions take into account the important differences that have been reported between localization of mRNAs encoding for RXR receptors and actual protein expression (29Krezel W. Kastner P. Chambon P. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because such differences could be applicable to other species, clearly further studies should be performed to characterize the protein distributions of nurr1 and RXR isotypes in human brain, data not yet available, to identify which brain pathways could be regulated by retinoids. In light of the importance of nurr1 for dopaminergic cell survival and phenotypic expression (5Wallen A. Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Arvidsson M. Olson L. Perlmann T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and high level of expression of the nurr1 protein in human substantia nigra (11Bannon M.J. Pruetz B. Manning-Bog A.B. Whitty C.J. Michelhaugh S.K. Sacchetti P. Granneman J.G. Mash D.C. Schmidt C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6382-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the absence of RXR proteins in the mesencephalic region (29Krezel W. Kastner P. Chambon P. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) seems an important feature to define the functional role of nurr1 in dopaminergic pathways. This would suggest that nurr1 regulates mesencephalic dopaminergic-specific genes via a RXR- and retinoid-independent mechanism. This conclusion seems supported by the fact that expression of the human dopamine transporter gene is enhanced in the presence of nurr1, but not of RXRα (10Sacchetti P. Mitchell T.R. Granneman J.G. Bannon M.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).The response to retinoids of RXR-nurr1 heterodimers requires the AF2 domain of RXR (Fig. 2), suggesting that retinoid control of nurr1 pathways will require the presence of RXR. Our data show that the AF2 domain of RXRα is a requirement only for rexinoid-induced transcription and that it is not a prerequisite for RXR-nurr1 heterodimer formation, as observed by EMSA (Fig. 3 C). Thus, our data confirm that RXR is not silent in these heterodimers and that retinoids are potential nurr1 modulators in RXR-expressing cell types.The role of the RXR AF2 domain is different from what we and others (17Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson B.M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) observed for the nurr1 AF2 domain. Deletion of the nurr1 AF2 domain prevented dimerization with RXR (Fig. 4, lane 11), suggesting that this domain has a unique function in this receptor, unusual for NRs and for RXR-containing dimers. This conclusion had been suggested previously but then dismissed (17Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson B.M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by hypothesizing that this deletion altered the nurr1 LBD structural integrity, which in turn affected other receptor functions, such as DNA binding. However, truncation of nurr1 AF2 did not alter the DNA binding capacities of nurr1 alone (Fig. 4) or its transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). In addition, another interaction domain is located within the LBD of nurr1, in a region described previously for other NRs as the dimerization interface domain (32Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to prevent heterodimer formation by mutating few amino acids in the LBD of nurr1 and RXR (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that RXR and nurr1 interact with each other similarly to other RXR heterodimers, such as RAR-RXR. In our hands, neither point mutations in the LBD nor the absence of the AF2 domain altered functional and DNA binding properties of nurr1 alone, confirming that this receptor is a strong activator on its own, which can act independently of its dimerization partner.Our data demonstrate that the simultaneous binding of nurr1 and RXR to DNA is required for the formation of stable heterodimers on DR response elements because no RXR-nurr1 complex is detected when the RXR P box is altered (Fig. 4 B). This conclusion is strengthened further by the lack of rexinoid responsiveness of the NBRE1x reporter gene and the inability of RXR to associate to nurr1 bound to this monovalent response element. Based on two-hybrid experiments in mammalian cells, nurr1 has been reported to form rexinoid-responsive units with RXRα and thus to interact with RXR in a DNA-independent manner.(19Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 20Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, in vitro protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that structural requirements for RXR-nurr1 interaction in the absence of DNA are distinct from those involved in RXR-nurr1-DNA complex formation. Indeed, glutathioneS-transferase pulldown assays showed that nurr1ΔAF2, as well as RXRαdim− and nurr1dim− mutants, formed heterodimers as efficiently as their wt counterpart (data not shown). Our data therefore suggest the inability of these receptors to bind as dimers on a single AAAGGTCA element and favor a classical nuclear receptor heterodimerization mechanism between these two receptors. Thus, the target genes must contain DR elements to be regulated by RXR-nurr1 dimer complexes.Our studies further document that DNA binding of RXR-nurr1 dimers is more permissive than other nuclear receptor dimers in terms of spacing between repeated elements. Previous data showed a preference for DNA-bound heterodimers on DR5 and DR6 elements (20Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); however, we observe here the formation of heterodimers exhibiting similar binding affinities on DR10, 11, and as far as DR27 DNA elements (Fig. 7). These results underline a significant plasticity of LBD dimerization interface(s) between nurr1 and RXR which allow stabilization of the dimers on these unusual response elements. The use of two strong dimerization interfaces makes it conceivable that the strong protein-protein interaction would allow cooperative binding on widely spaced elements by inducing DNA bending in the long spacer between repeat sites.Interestingly, rexinoid responsiveness of RXR-nurr1 heterodimers is limited to a subset of response elements because only multimerized DR5 response elements (our data and (20Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)) or NBRE3x (our data and (19Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar)) are activated by rexinoids. Despite the interaction between these receptors and DNA, it is plausible that RXR undergoes such important conformational changes imposed by the geometry of the response element that they would prevent ligand binding. This could be viewed as another mechanism to control unwanted dimer activation, but it implicates a different method of selection of correctly spaced response elements, at least for these types of dimers. It remains still unclear how nurr1 and RXR can bind to the NBRE3x element forming stable and functional dimers, whereas binding to only two of the three repeats does not allow transduction of the retinoid signal. Quite intriguingly, the reiteration of DNA binding sites has been shown to be required for optimal RXR-mediated transcription on the CRBP2 gene promoter and other artificial reporter genes. Moreover, the ability of RXR to bind cooperatively as tetramers to these reiterated RXREs is isotype-selective, with RXRβ being significantly less prone to form such tetramers (35Lin B.C. Wong C.W. Chen H.W. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9860-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ability of RXR to form dimers of dimers is mediated notably by the AF2 activating domain (helix 11), and deletion or mutation of this region prevents RXR tetramer formation (37Gampe R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus analogies of the RXR system with the RXR-nurr1 system which we describe in this paper are striking and warrant further investigations to elucidate the interplay of nurr1 and RXR on reiterated response elements.In conclusion, we have determined important new features of the mechanism of dimerization between nurr1 and its potential transcriptional regulator partner RXR. Nurr1 interacts exclusively with RXRα and γ, and nurr1 mutants unable to heterodimerize with RXR are still strong transactivators, suggesting that this nuclear receptor functions through two distinct mechanisms of action which are probably implicated in the regulation of different brain signaling pathways. The conclusion that both receptors need to interact with DNA to form functional complexes and that only specific DR elements can transduce retinoid signaling will help identification of potential target genes for these complexes in regions coexpressing the different receptors. Because our functional data were collected in a single cell type, our conclusions need to be extended to other neuronal cell lines. The search for target genes warrants further studies because nurr1 is a tissue-specific factor that could be targeted in the development of drugs to cure severe neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. The nuclear receptor nurr1 (NR4A2) is a brain-specific transcription factor (1Law S.W. Conneely O.M. Demayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

Expression of the human telomerase (hTERT) gene in sheep fibroblasts reconstitutes telomerase activity and extends their lifespan. However, telomere length is not maintained in all cell lines, even though in vitro telomerase activity is restored in all of them. Cell lines expressing higher levels of hTERT mRNA do not exhibit telomere erosion or genomic instability. By contrast, fibroblasts expressing lower levels of hTERT do exhibit telomere shortening, although the telomeres eventually stabilize at a shorter length. The shorter telomere lengths and the extent of karyotypic abnormalities are both functions of hTERT expression level. We conclude that telomerase activity is required to bypass senescence but is not sufficient to prevent telomere erosion and genomic instability at lower levels of expression.

Ratliff R.L. Moyzis R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). They are essential elements that protect chromosomal ends from nuclease degradation, interchromosomal fusion, and improper recombination, thereby, contributing to genome stability. Telomerase is a specialized cellular ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric repeats onto chromosomal ends (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 3Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). It consists of two main components that are required for core enzyme activity, which is measured by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)1 assay. These are a telomerase RNA, used as template for the addition of new telomeric repeats, and a catalytic protein subunit (TERT). In humans, telomerase is preferentially expressed in germ-line cells and in early embryonic tissues but is not detectable in somatic cells (4Wright W.E. Piatyszek M.A. Rainey W.E. Byrd W. Shay J.W. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). In the absence of telomerase activity, somatic cells undergo a progressive shortening of telomeres with each cell division, because DNA polymerase is unable to replicate the chromosomal ends completely. Eventually when the telomeres on one or more chromosomes become critically short, the cells stop dividing and enter replicative senescence (5Hemann M.T. Strong M.A. Hao L.Y. Greider C.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 6Lansdorp P.M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 118: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Telomerase catalytic protein subunit (TERT) has been indicated as a key factor limiting telomerase activity in human somatic cells, because the RNA subunit is constitutively expressed at a low basal level in cells (7Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by experiments showing that forced expression of hTERT in human fibroblast, epithelial, endothelial, and osteoblast cells reconstitutes telomerase activity and extends their proliferative lifespan (8Bodnar A.G.

However, telomere lengths are not always maintained in these cells, despite the fact that telomerase activity is restored. Similarly, the telomeres of many tumor cell lines are shorter than those in normal cells despite the fact that they have high levels of telomerase activity. For example, telomeres in colorectal and ovarian carcinoma tissues are shorter than in the corresponding normal tissue from the same individual (14Hastie N.D. Dempster M. Dunlop M.G. Thompson A.M. Green D.K. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 15Counter C.M. Hirte H.W. Bacchetti S. Harley C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2900-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). It has been accepted generally that telomere length in human cells is controlled by a homeostatic mechanism that involves telomerase and other factors, such as the TTAGGG-repeat binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2 (16Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), but it is not fully understood how these factors cooperate with each other or whether other factors are involved. We have shown recently that sheep fibroblasts are similar to human fibroblasts in several aspects of telomere biology and replicative senescence. 2W. Cui, D. Wylie, S. Aslam, A. Dinnyes, T. King, I. Wilmut, and A. J. Clark, manuscript in preparation. Thus, they have no detectable telomerase activity and undergo only a limited number of cell divisions before entering replicative senescence. Telomere lengths in these cells shorten with cell proliferation at a rate of 50–200 bp per cell division. Finally, forcing hTERT expression in transfected cells restores telomerase activity and extends their proliferative lifespan. In this report, we have followed the continuous growth of these cells for more than 15 months and investigated the telomere maintenance and karyotypic stability as a function of hTERT mRNA and protein levels, as well as telomerase catalytic activity in cell lysates. Our results show that the expression of hTERT reconstitutes telomerase catalytic activity, resulting in cell immortalization. At higher levels of hTERT expression full-length telomeres are maintained and karyotypic stability is preserved. At lower levels, telomere erosion and genomic stability occur to an extent that is directly determined by the level of hTERT expression. Sheep fibroblasts, BW6F2, were isolated from a day 35 Black Welsh eviscerated fetus as described previously (17Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Glasgow minimal essential medium (Sigma), supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum (Globe Farm, Surrey, UK) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Plasmid GRN145 was kindly provided by the Geron Corp., which contains hTERT cDNA driven by myeloproliferative sarcoma virus promoter and puromycin-resistant gene driven by the SV40 promoter (8Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). An empty vector control was constructed by digesting GRN145 plasmid with EcoRI followed by re-ligation to remove the hTERT cDNA fragment. Linearized plasmids were electroporated at 250 microfarads/400 V to BW6F2 cells at passage 6. Cells were then plated into 96-well plates at 5000 cells per well. Puromycin (750 ng to 1 μg/ml) was added into medium 48 h after transfection to select puromycin-resistant colonies. Each colony was expanded to confluence in a T75 flask, from which 3 × 105 cells were plated into a T25 flask, and the growth curve was started at this point. The growth curve of the parental mass culture, BW6F2, was started at passage 6, which is the stage the transfection was carried out. Cells were sub-cultured twice weekly and maintained at log phase growth. Telomerase activity of cell extracts was analyzed by telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay as described previously (18Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Each reaction product was resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gel and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (AmershamBiosciences) and visualized by scanning. To quantify the activities, cell extracts from 0.01 μg to 1 μg were used for TRAP assay, and telomerase activity was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of telomere ladder over the intensity of 36 bp of internal control band. The TRAP assay was calibrated by quantifying activity in serial dilutions of cell extracts. Although the activities decreased with dilution in each cell line within a narrow range, the differences in activity between the various cell lines were consistent at each dilution. Genomic DNA from cultured cells was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction using tubes containing phase lock gel (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Telomere length was determined by telomere restriction fragment (TRF) Southern blot analysis with either [γ-32P]ATP or digoxigenin labeled (TTAGGG)3 probe as described previously (20Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4632) Google Scholar). Mean TRF was calculated as described previously (12Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S. Johnson M.

Sheep fibroblasts were harvested after sub-culturing in growth medium for 26 h and incubated in 0.075 m KCl at room temperature for about 10 min. Subsequently, cells were fixed in methanol-acetic acid (3:1, v/v) and were dropped onto clean microscopic slides. FISH was carried out as described before (21Lansdorp P.M. Verwoerd N.P. van de Rijke F.M. Dragowska V. Little M.T. Dirks R.W. Raap A.K. Tanke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated telomere peptide nucleic acid probe (Dako, Denmark). The slides were mounted in Vectashield containing 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For karyotype analysis, slides with metaphase spreads were stained in 5% Gurrs R66 Giemsa at room temperature for 8 min and mounted with DPX mountant. Thirty cells were analyzed from each culture. Cells were trypsinized and counted then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was extracted with RNAzol B and digested with DNase I. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA by reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl volume with oligo(Pd(T)15). Each PCR was carried out with 5 μl of the reverse transcription product and amplified for 26 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The primer sequences used are as follows: hTERT-W1, 5′-AGCGACTACTCCAGCTATG-3′; hTERT-W2, 5′-GTTCTTGGCTTTCAGGATGG-3′; sheep GAPDH-F, 5′-TGTCCGTTGTGGATCTGACC-3′; sheep GAPDH-R, 5′-CGTACCAGGAAATGAGCTTGAC-3′. Real-time qRT-PCR primers and TaqMan probes were selected for hTERT and sheep GAPDH using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Forward primer for hTERT, 5′-TCAACCGCGGCTTCAAG-3′; the reverse primer, 5′-TCCAGAAACAGGCTGTGACACT-3′. The hTERT TaqMan probe was 5′-Fam-TTGCGACGCATGTTCCTCCCAG-Tamara-3′. Forward primer for sheep GAPDH, 5′-TTGTCTCCTGCGACTTC-AACA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACCAGGAAATGAGCTTGACAAAG-3′. The TaqMan probe for sheep GAPDH was 5′-Vic-CGACACTCACTCTTCTACCTTCGATGCTGG-Tamara-3′. Each reaction contained 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 300 nm forward and reverse primers, 200 nm TaqMan probe(s), and 1 μl of reverse transcription product diluted 1:30–60. Assays were performed in quadruplicate using an Applied Biosystems Model 7700 sequence detection system. All data were normalized to sheep GAPDH internal mRNA control (ΔΔCT analysis). The same real-time PCR was also performed with hTERT cDNA plasmid at concentration equivalent to 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 copies per cell, and a standard curve was generated. The hTERT mRNA copy number was calculated with the standard curve. Protein extracts were prepared from logarithmically growing cells by lysis in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA). Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Protein (40 μg) was separated on a SDS 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin, blots were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-hTERT antibody 1A4 (from Geron Corp., Menlo Park, CA) at 1:10,000 dilution in the blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed and incubated with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. The signals were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were cultured in glass chamber slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 9 min after washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with blocking solution, TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min and then with mouse monoclonal anti-hTERT antibody 1A4 at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution) for 1 h. The signals were detected by incubation with Streptavidin Texas red (Vector laboratories) at 1:200 dilutions for 20 min, and the slides were mounted with Vectashield containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Primary cultures of sheep fetal fibroblasts show similar characteristics to human fibroblasts in that there is no detectable telomerase activity by TRAP assay and the cells undergo only a limited number of cell divisions.2 Stable transfection and expression of human telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT in these cells reconstituted telomerase activity (Fig. 1 A) and extended their proliferative lifespan. The proliferative capacities of these colonies have been followed for more than 400 days of continuous culture. They maintained a steady growth rate, similar to young fibroblasts and have accumulated 400–500 population doublings (PDs) to date. This is between 8- and 25-fold more than the population doublings achieved by empty vector-transfected clones or clones without hTERT expression, which only grew for a maximum of 61 PDs and then senesced (Fig. 1 B). This is also more than 3-fold that of the parental mass culture, BW6F2, which senesced after 110 PDs (Fig.1 B). hTERT-expressing clones exhibited a similar morphology to young fibroblasts even at high PDs and were negative with senescence associated β-galactosidase staining.2 Therefore, we consider these cells to be functionally immortal. The most obvious function of active telomerase is to add telomeric repeats to telomere ends to prevent telomeres from shortening. From a number of recent reports, however, it is unclear whether reconstituted telomerase catalytic activity as measured by TRAP assay is always sufficient to maintain telomere lengths in somatic cells (8Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar, 9Counter C.M.

In some experiments, overexpression of hTERT reconstituted telomerase catalytic activity, indefinitely extended proliferative lifespan, and maintained the telomere length (8Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M.

By contrast, in other experiments, forced expression of hTERT, although extending proliferative lifespan, did not maintain telomere length (10Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,12Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S. Johnson M. Holt S.E. Liss H.S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. J. Biol.

To assess the effects of reconstituted telomerase catalytic activity on telomere length in the hTERT-expressing sheep fibroblasts, the telomere lengths were measured by Southern blot with a (TTAGGG)3 probe, and the mean TRF was calculated. We measured telomere lengths at the beginning of the growth curve and after about 260–280 days in culture (Fig.2 A). The results showed that all clones have similar telomere length at early passage (PDs = 2). However, after more than 200 cell divisions, some clones (2-1, 2-5, and 2-7) maintained the telomere length (Fig. 2 A, lane 3–8), whereas others (1-1, 2-8, 2-12, and 2-13) exhibited telomere shortening (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–2 and9–14). These results were confirmed by telomere FISH analysis (Fig. 2 B). Clones 1-1, 2-8, 2-12, and 2-13 had much lower telomere signals in compare with clones 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7. Telomere lengths in these cell lines were re-analyzed after further population doublings. In each line, the telomeres became stabilized at a characteristic length, although there was considerable variation between individual cell lines (Fig. 2 C and TableI). Clones 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7 maintained their telomere lengths at ∼21.0 kb throughout culture. Telomere lengths were the same as they were at the earlier passages (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–6) and, moreover, were the same as those in early passage primary parental cells (Fig. 2 C,lane 15). Clones 1-1, 2-8, and 2-12, in which the telomeres had already shortened, did not exhibit further shortening of telomeres and showed no significant difference in telomere length at the two later passages (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–12). By contrast, clone 2-13 continued to exhibit further shortening (Fig.2 C, lane 13 versus 14), but this subsequently stabilized after approximately four hundred population doublings (data not shown). In the cell lines that exhibited telomere shortening, the new, stabilized telomere lengths varied considerably, with mean TRF at about 8.4, 10.8, 14.6, and 6.0 kb in clones 1-1, 2-8, 2-12, and 2-13, respectively (Table I). The stabilized mean TRF in clones 1-1 and 2-13 were substantially shorter than that in parental mass culture, BW6F2, at the time of senescence (mean TRF = 11.3 kb) (Fig. 2 C, lane 16) even though these cell lines still grew vigorously.Table ISummary of hTERT-expressing sheep fibroblast clonesCell cloneMean TRF1-aRepresents the mean TRF at which telomeres are stabilized in each cell line.TRAP assay1-bDefines TRAP activity in human tumor cell line 293 as 100% and PDs as defined in the growth curves.Relative hTERT mRNA expression1-cThe expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR, normalized to the internal GAPDH mRNA level and calculated relative to clone 2–13.hTERT mRNA Per cell1-dhTERT mRNA per cell was measured by qRT-PCR and calculated by reference to a standard curve for hTERT plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).PDs = 0PDs > 200kb%1–18.430482.60.342–120.751465873.5375.082–521.039521278.387.242–721.230525752.6345.142–810.852398.1%0.582–1214.660559.30.652–136.038301.00.08BW6F2 (young)20.9000.02BW6F2 (senescent)11.30ND1-eND, not done.ND1-a Represents the mean TRF at which telomeres are stabilized in each cell line.1-b Defines TRAP activity in human tumor cell line 293 as 100% and PDs as defined in the growth curves.1-c The expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR, normalized to the internal GAPDH mRNA level and calculated relative to clone 2–13.1-d hTERT mRNA per cell was measured by qRT-PCR and calculated by reference to a standard curve for hTERT plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).1-e ND, not done. Open table in a new tab We next addressed whether the telomere length maintenance was correlated with the levels of telomerase catalytic activity in extracts from these various cell lines. Telomerase catalytic activity was measured by TRAP assay in these clones at early and later passages, and their relative levels were calculated to that in human tumor cell line 293 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the clones showed relatively high levels of telomerase catalytic activity, between 30 and 60% of that measured in 293 cells (Table I). The range was narrow, and there was no more than a 2-fold difference in telomerase activity between the highest and lowest expressing cell lines. No consistent increase or decrease of telomerase activity was observed after cell passages. The TRAP activity measured in later passage cells, when telomere length had been maintained or was stabilized at a shorter length, showed a moderately strong correlation with the mean TRFs at this stage (r = 0.696). Expression of hTERT mRNA in the later passages (PDs > 250) was first analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in each of the cell lines. In contrast to the TRAP assays the RT-PCR showed there was a broad range of steady-state hTERT mRNA levels (Fig.3 A). Thus in lines 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7 hTERT transcripts were readily detected after 26 PCR cycles, whereas they were only just detectable in lines 2-8 and 2-12. In lines 1-1 and 2-13 as well as in human 293 cells (not shown) the steady-state mRNA level of hTERT were so low that the transcript could not be detected under these conditions. However, when the RT-PCR was repeated using 35 cycles of amplification all samples, including 1-1 and 2-13 and human 293 cells showed detectable hTERT transcripts. To confirm these results and to quantitate the steady-state mRNA levels accurately, we carried out real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on these samples. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B and tabulated in Table I. They show that the steady-state levels of hTERT mRNA vary over an enormous, 6000-fold range in these lines. Assigning a relative value of 1 to the lowest expressor (2-13) we grouped the lines into three classes according to the level of expression: very low (1–3, in lines 1-1 and 2-13); low (8–10, lines 2-8 and 2-12), and high (1000–6000, in lines 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7) and corresponded to the result obtained by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.3 A). We also independently measured the copy number of hTERT mRNA per cell in these clones using real-time quantitative PCR with diluted hTERT cDNA plasmid as standard curve. The results are shown in Table I. The low and very low hTERT expression clones had less than one copy of hTERT mRNA transcript per cell, whereas the highly expressing clones were estimated to contain 80–400 copies per cell. hTERT protein levels were measured in the cell extracts of each of the lines at both early (∼4 PDs), middle (105–165 PDs), and later passages (270–360 PDs) by Western blotting using an antibody against hTERT. In all Western blotting experiments clones 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7 showed detectable levels of the correctly sized 127-kDa hTERT protein, whereas, no detectable level of hTERT protein was found in the other clones (Fig. 4 A). Human tumor cell line 293, which has high telomerase catalytic activity, did not exhibit detectable levels of hTERT protein (Fig. 4 A,lane 9). Although initially surprising to us, this observation is consistent with recent reports using a different hTERT antibody in Western blotting experiments, which, again, failed to detect hTERT protein in 293 cells, despite high levels of telomerase catalytic activity (23Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein expression was also investigated by immunocytochemistry. Cell lines 2-1, 2-5, and 2-7, in which hTERT was detectable Western blotting showed strong nuclear staining, whereas cells from the other clones, including human tumor 293 were negative (Fig. 4 B). Our measurements on hTERT mRNA and protein levels are fully consistent, and the three cell lines expressing high steady-state levels of hTERT mRNA were the only ones with detectable level of hTERT protein. Indeed, the lowest expressor of these three lines (2-5, which had about 1/5 the steady-state hTERT mRNA level as compared with the other two, Table I) also had the lowest level of detectable hTERT protein (Fig. 4 A). We conclude that there is a large range of hTERT expression in these cell lines that is reflected in both the steady-state mRNA and protein levels but not in the telomerase catalytic activity. Shortening of telomeres during extended culture correlated with the hTERT mRNA levels. Thus lines 2-8 and 2-12, which had low levels of hTERT mRNA and undetectable levels of hTERT protein, exhibited telomere shortening, and the telomeres were stabilized with a mean TRF greater than 10 kb. Lines 1-1 and 2-13, having even lower levels of hTERT mRNA, also exhibited telomere shortening. Their telomeres shortened to an even greater extent than 2-8 or 2-12 and only stabilized when the mean TRF was below 10 kb. In these four lowly expressing lines there was a very strong correlation (r = 0.940) between the steady-state mRNA levels and the stabilized telomere length. By contrast, the cell lines exhibiting high steady-state hTERT mRNA levels and detectable hTERT protein (2-1, 2-5, and 2-7) did not undergo telomere shortening and maintained full-length telomere throughout the extended culture period. Recent reports in yeast and plants suggest that the telomeres play an important role in genome stability (25Hackett J.A. Feldser D.M. Greider C.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Riha K. McKnight T.D. Griffing L.R. Shippen D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1797-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of hTERT expression on the genome stability of the stably transfected sheep fibroblast, we examined the chromosomes in these cell lines by cytogenetic analysis (Table II). At beginning of their proliferative lifespan, all hTERT-transfected clones showed normal karyotype (Fig. 5 A). However, after about 220 population doublings, clones 1-1 and 2-13, started to exhibit a high frequency of abnormal karyotype (20% or more cells). These abnormalities included abnormal sub-metrocentric, dicentric, and ring chromosomes (Fig. 5, B–D), which likely resulted from chromosomal end-to-end fusions. The frequency of thes"

The accuracy for A opposite G was not altered in the exonuclease-deficientpol2–4 pol ε; however, G:G and T:G misincorporation rates increased 40- and 73-fold, respectively. Thepol2C1089Y pol ε mutant also exhibited increased G:G and T:G misincorporation rates, 22- and 10-fold, respectively, whereas A:G misincorporation did not differ from that of wild type.

The precise roles of pol δ and pol ε during leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis have not yet been defined; however, genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that lagging strand DNA synthesis is carried out by pol α and pol δ (5Waga S.

S. pombe pol δ has one additional subunit, Cmt1 (9Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified yeast pol δ requires accessory factors including PCNA1 and RFC to catalyze processive DNA synthesis (8Gerik K.J., Li, X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). pol δ possesses a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, which performs proofreading/editing during DNA synthesis (10Morrison A.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae pol ε is also a multi-subunit protein complex that includes Pol2, Dpb2, Dpb3, and Dpb4 and like pol δ has a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (1Sugino A. Trends Biochem.

Ohara T. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21332-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although pol ε requires PCNA and RFC complex to catalyze processive DNA synthesis on singly primed single-stranded viral DNA (13Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these cofactors may not be required for processive DNA synthesis in vivo. Pol2 is the catalytic subunit of pol ε and is encoded by the POL2 gene (15Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), which is essential for cell growth and required for chromosomal DNA replication (16Araki H. Ropp P.A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The second subunit of pol ε, Dpb2, is encoded by the DPB2 gene and is also essential for yeast cell growth and for chromosomal DNA replication (17Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DPB3 and DPB4 genes encode the third and fourth subunits of pol ε, respectively (18Araki H. Hamatake R.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These genes are not essential for cell growth, although they play an important role in stabilizing the subunit structure of pol ε and in interactions between pol ε and other DNA replication proteins (19Ohya T. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pol ε interacts with Dpb11 and Sld2, proteins that play an important role in recruiting replication proteins to the replication origin before DNA elongation starts (4Masumoto H.

Recent studies in S. cerevisiae and S. pombesuggest that pol ε may not play an essential enzymatic role during DNA replication. The essential function of pol ε may relate to its noncatalytic C-terminal domain (22Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

Deletion of the polymerase catalytic domain of pol ε is not lethal and does not block chromosomal DNA replication (22Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

However, a pol2deletion mutant is temperature-sensitive, exhibits severe defects in chromosomal DNA replication at the permissive temperature, and undergoes premature senescence (25Ohya T.

This suggests that other DNA polymerases can substitute for the polymerase function of pol ε but that another unspecified function of pol ε is essential in yeast. Yeast deficient in the 3′-5′ exonuclease activities of either pol δ or pol ε are spontaneous mutators (26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutation near the DNA polymerase domain of pol ε is also a +1 frameshift mutator (27Kirchner J.M. Tran H. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1623-1632PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that both pol δ and pol ε participate in chromosomal DNA replication. Despite extensive characterization of pol δ and ε (1Sugino A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Hubscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu.

Surprisingly, S. pombe pol δ has relatively low fidelity even in the presence of its 3′-5′ exonuclease (32Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Previous studies characterized the S. cerevisiae pol ε mutant pol2–4, which is a mutator and lacks the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen.

Fast protein liquid chromatography-purified nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. The template/primer DNA was a synthetic 100-mer template annealed to a complementary 30-mer primer or to a 35-mer primer containing a single noncomplementary base at its 3′-end. The 30-mer primer is complementary to DNA sequence in the middle of the template, forming a template/primer with a 35-nucleotide ssDNA overhang on the 5′- and 3′-sides (29Bloom L.B. Chen X.

A gel-based fidelity assay was used to determine the kinetics of incorporation of dNTPs opposite the target site (29Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Primer extension reactions for pol ε were performed as follows: The template/primer DNA and the dNTP to be incorporated opposite the target were mixed together in the reaction buffer. S. cerevisiae pol ε and the running-start nucleotide (dATP) were added to initiate the reaction. Reactions proceeded for 3 min at 30 °C and incorporation of dCMP or misincorporation of dNMP was measured opposite G. Incorporation of the correct nucleotide was measured under single-hit conditions (i.e. most template/primer DNA molecules encounter a polymerase only once). The final reaction conditions included 50 μm dATP, 10 nm template/primer DNA, 10 μg/ml (0.2 unit/ml) S. cerevisiae pol ε, and dNTP as indicated in the figures. Control reactions were for 3 min using only dATP to verify that dATP was not misincorporated opposite the target G. Reactions were terminated, and reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Band intensities were integrated and quantified on a Fuji Image analyzer as described previously (29Bloom L.B.

Assay for the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity associated with pol ε was performed by two different ways. One way was the previously published method (12Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Aliquots (2 μl) were removed from the reaction and quenched with 5 μl of 20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide at the appropriate time points. Reaction products were separated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 m urea for 3 h at 1600 V.

This study examines the fidelity of wild-type and mutant S. cerevisiae pol ε HE (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the same sequence context used in previous studies of the fidelity of E. coli pol III HE (29Bloom L.B.

Base substitution fidelity measurements were performed with wild-type pol ε HE are described in Fig. 1 (note that all experiments described below were carried out with polymerase HE). When the reaction was initiated, wild-type pol ε extended the 32P-labeled primer by incorporating four running-start As. The fidelity of pol ε was then measured at the fifth template nucleotide, which was a target G. The template DNA sequence is shown along the right sideof the assay gel in Fig. 1 A. In the presence of dCTP, pol ε incorporated four running-start As and then a C opposite the target G. In addition, a very faint band was detected at the next template C; incorporation opposite downstream template nucleotides T, G, and T increased with increasing dCTP (Fig. 1 A, dCTP lane). The amount of shortened primer degraded to the first upstream template G also increased with increasing dCTP (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the pol ε 3′-5′ exonuclease acts as a proofreading exonuclease during DNA synthesis by pol ε. Reactions were also carried out in the presence of dGTP, dTTP, and dATP (Fig. 1 A). The amount of extended primer was quantified, and the misincorporation efficiency was estimated as described previously (29Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J.

The nucleotide misincorporation rate for pol ε was 0.47 × 10−5 for G:G mismatches, 0.15 × 10−5 for T:G mismatches, and less than 0.01 × 10−5 for A:G mismatches (Fig. 1 B and TableI). Highly represented degradation products (asterisks in Fig. 1 A) correspond to sites of degradation and incorporation in the presence of dGTP or dTTP. Thus, the fidelity of wild-type pol ε is considerably higher than the fidelity of S. pombe pol δ (32Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

This mutant pol ε has no detectable nuclease activity (TableII) and does not degrade the32P-labeled primer under the conditions in which its fidelity was measured (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the extension products from polymerase reactions with the mutant enzyme. In the presence of the control level of dATP, the32P-labeled primer was extended by four As up to the target template G, and limited misincorporation was observed at the target template G (Fig. 3 A,Control lane). Increasing the dATP led to a misincorporation rate comparable with the wild-type enzyme (0.029 × 10−5). However, the G:G and T:G misincorporation rates were 19.2 × 10−5 and 11.0 × 10−5, respectively (40- and 73-fold higher than wild-type pol ε) (Fig.3 B and Table I), and misincorporation of C opposite the next C was greatly increased. These results indicate that pol ε 3′-5′ exonuclease activity efficiently removes a mismatched nucleotide during DNA synthesis and that pol ε has a low A:G misincorporation rate.Table IINuclease activity associated with S. cerevisiae pol ɛpol ɛDNA polymerase activity2-aDNA polymerase activity was measured as described previously (12) using poly(dA)-1000/(dT)10 (20:1) as a template/primer and about 0.1 unit of pol ɛ.Exonuclease activity2-bExonuclease activity was also measured in the reaction mixture containing 3H-labeled E. coli DNA (which was preheated at 95°C for 5 min and quickly ice-chilled) and 0.1 unit of pol ɛ at 30°C for 30 min (12).Ratio (relative) Exo/PolpmolpmolWild type10031.50.315 (1)pol2–41022.00.019 (0.06)pol2C1089Y10535.30.336 (1.07)pol2–4 pol2C1089Y103<1.0<0.010 (<0.03)2-a DNA polymerase activity was measured as described previously (12Hamatake R.K.

Tran H. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1623-1632PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical features of this and the double mutant pol2–4 pol2C1089Ywere examined. We noticed that the processivity ofpol2C1089Y or pol2–4 pol2C1089Y pol ε was almost the same as wild-type pol ε using poly(dA)1000/(dT)10 (20:1) as a template/primer under the condition previously described (12Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The misincorporation rates of pol2C1089Y or pol2–4 pol2C1089Y pol ε were determined as described above (Figs.4 and 5, and Table I). The G:G and T:G misincorporation rate of pol ε pol2C1089Y was 10.3 × 10−5 (22-fold higher than wild type) and 1.52 × 10−5 (10-fold higher than wild type), respectively. In contrast, the A:G misincorporation rate was 0.016 × 10−5 (similar to wild type). The lack of proofreading in the double mutant led to only modest increases: however, there is no increase beyond that due to the proofreading mutation alone (Table I). These results may indicate that the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the pol2C1089Y mutant is insufficient to remove a mismatched nucleotide during DNA synthesis. One possible explanation for this result is that thepol2C1089Y mutant undergoes a conformational change that affects the enzyme's ability to switch from DNA synthesis mode to editing mode when a mismatched nucleotide is incorporated. Therefore, the intrinsic misincorporation might be compromised, but instead the establishment of the mutation could be altered. This idea was tested by challenging the enzyme with a primer/template DNA substrate with a single 3′-terminal mismatched base. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The pol2C1089Y andpol2C1089Ypol2–4 mutant pol ε extend the mismatched primer efficiently, but pol2–4 mutant pol ε extends the mismatched primer very inefficiently. In contrast, these enzymes extend the matched primer with the same efficiency (Fig. 6). Note that regardless of the matched or mismatched primer used for the extension reactions, we observed a short time lag before pol ε starts DNA synthesis (Fig. 6). These results suggest that thepol2C1089Y mutation may affect the proofreading exonuclease activity during DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, the mutantpol2C1089Y has near wild-type exonuclease activity on a single-stranded DNA substrate (Fig. 2 and Table II).Figure 5Fidelity of pol ε from pol2–4 pol2C1089Y double mutant cells.

Tran H. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1623-1632PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was found to have only modest effects on forward mutation in the CAN1 locus (27Kirchner J.M. Tran H. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1623-1632PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined it in a URA3 forward mutation assay (26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); mutations were selected as resistant to 5-FOA. As expected, the mutation rate of pol2–4 mutant was ∼10-fold higher than wild type (5 × 10−7) (TableIII). The spontaneous mutation rate of the pol2C1089Y mutant is 1000-fold higher than wild type (5 × 10−5 versus 0.005 × 10−5). The presence of pol2–4 mutation increased the rate a further 5-fold (25 × 10−5).Table IIISpontaneous mutation frequency of pol2 mutantsStrainSpontaneous mutation frequency/108 cellsrelevant genotyperelative frequencyWild type [CG379 (pep4::URA3)]5 (1)pol2–448 (9.6)pol2-C1089Y (CG379 (pol2-C1089Y::URA3))5000 (1000)pol2–4 pol2-C1089Y (CG379 (pol2-C1089Y::URA3)pol2–4)25000 (5000) Open table in a new tab The mutations were characterized by sequencing 43 randomly pickedura3 mutants from the forward mutation assay with wild type, 100 from the pol2C1089Y, and 106 from pol2–4 pol2C1089Y mutant cells (see previously published method (24Feng W. D'Urso G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4495-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 7, 22 (21%) of 107 mutants from pol2C1089Y were +1 frameshift mutations, and one (0.9%) was a −1 frameshift mutation. The remaining 84 (78%) were single nucleotide substitution mutations. On the other hand, 17 (17%) of 100 mutants from the pol2–4 pol2C1089Y double mutant were +1 frameshift, 83 (83%) were single-nucleotide substitution mutations, and no −1 frameshift mutation was found. The high frequency of +1 frameshift mutations is specific for pol2C1089Y and is not observed with wild-type pol ε (black lowercase lettersin Fig. 7) or the pol2–4 pol ε mutant (see ref. 26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). More importantly, the mutation specificity of pol2C1089Y andpol2–4 pol2C1089Y was not changed significantly. Processive DNA polymerases have enhanced template/primer binding and a decreased probability of dissociating from the template/primer. These enzymes are inherently prone to misincorporating an incorrect DNA base or a nucleotide analogue and to immortalizing the misincorporation by continued DNA synthesis. The polymerase-associated 3′-5′ exonuclease is ideally suited to minimize replication errors (i.e. pol δ- or pol ε-associated proofreading exonuclease). DNA polymerases α, β, and recently discovered lesion bypass polymerases such as pol η, κ, and ζ are not highly processive, lack intrinsic 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, and have low fidelity (34Johnson R.E.

Despite the importance of this enzyme, little is known regarding its fidelityin vitro and in vivo. This study has examined the fidelity of wild-type or mutant pol ε using a previously characterized gel-based assay system (29Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17677-17682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Wild-type pol ε extended the primer 35 nucleotides to the end of the template in 3 min (Fig. 1) in the absence of any additional cofactors. For the wild-type enzyme, f inc for nucleotide misincorporation was 0.15 × 10−5 (T:G), 0.47 × 10−5(G:G), and 0.015 × 10−5 (A:G); for thepol2–4 mutant, f inc was 11.0 × 10−5 (T;G), 19.2 × 10−5 (G:G), and 0.03 × 10−5 (A:G) (Fig. 1, Table I), indicating that, the G:G and T:G misincorporation frequencies increase significantly in 3′-5′-exonuclease-deficient pol ε and that the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity is required for high fidelity DNA synthesis by pol ε. Nucleotide misincorporation rates were increased in the pol ε mutantpol2C1089Y relative to wild type. The observation that the level in the double mutant pol2–4 pol2C1089Y was not greatly increased suggests that the mutant pol2C1089Y is specifically deficient in 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity or that the errors appearing in the mutant are not subject to proofreading. However, the mutant pol2C1089Y pol ε exhibits almost the same specific activity of exonuclease as that of wild-type pol ε (Fig. 2 and Table II) and excises misincorporated nucleotides during DNA synthesis (Fig. 4). One possible explanation is that the pol2C1089Y mutant is defective in coordinating processive DNA synthesis with the excision of misincorporated nucleotides. The pol ε catalytic subunit contains a 3′-5′ proofreading exonuclease domain at the N terminus (10Morrison A. Bell J. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the known crystal structures of family B members, this domain is folded around a central β-sheet that contains the active site and, together with the exonuclease domain, creates a ring-shaped structure with a central hole, where the template/primer duplex DNA is positioned. The catalytic mechanism leading to the removal of the last incorporated nucleotide by the exonuclease activity is a phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by two metal ions, analogous to the one responsible for polymerization (38Johnston K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A model between the polymerase and exonuclease activities of family B polymerases can be constructed by comparing the structure of RB69 in its polymerizing (39Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and editing (40Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) modes. A mismatched base pair prevents the fingers from rotating toward the palm to bind the incoming dNTP. This leaves the 3′ mismatched end available for binding to the exonuclease active site, which removes the wrong nucleotide. During the switch between the polymerizing and editing modes, the DNA moves toward the exonuclease active site with a rotation in the double-helix axis. This movement is aided by the tip of the thumb subdomain, which holds contact with the DNA during the movement, guiding it on a path between the two sites. Based on the results presented in this study, it is possible that the pol2C1089Ymutation disrupts coordination between processive DNA synthesis and the proofreading exonuclease of pol ε, which may be a role of the thumb subdomain. S. cerevisiae has another major DNA replication polymerase, pol δ. The fidelity of pol δ from S. cerevisiae has not yet been characterized. However, the fidelity of S. cerevisiae pol ε can be compared with the fidelity of S. pombe pol δ, which was studied previously in the presence of PCNA, RFC, and E. coli single stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) using the same primer/template DNA substrate (32Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17677-17682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fidelity of S. cerevisiae pol ε is considerably higher than S. pombe pol δ. The fidelity of S. cerevisiae pol ε was 31-fold (T:G mismatch), 11-fold (G:G mismatch), or 30-fold (A:G mismatch) higher than for S. pombe pol δ. It has been reported that S. pombe pol δ has only a weak 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and is unable to correct polymerase insertion errors efficiently in the presence or absence of accessory proteins (32Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17677-17682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the difference in fidelity of these two enzymes may reflect the weak 3′-5′ exonuclease of S. pombe pol δ. Interestingly, the fidelity of 3′-5′ exonuclease-deficient pol2–4 mutant pol ε (Fig. 3) is comparable with that of S. pombe pol δ in the presence of PCNA, RFC, and SSB. The fidelity of the pol2–4mutant is 4.1- and 0.3-fold higher for T:G and G:G mismatches, respectively, and 15-fold higher for A:G mismatches. However, our preliminary results show that S. cerevisiae pol δ has a very active 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, which has a ratio between the polymerase activity and the exonuclease activity similar to that ofS. cerevisiae pol ε, but its fidelity under the processive conditions (with PCNA or PCNA and RFC) is lower than the fidelity ofS. cerevisiae pol ε. 2K. Hashimoto, K. Shimizu, and A. Sugino, unpublished results. The error rates ofS. cerevisiae pol δ HE, which consists of three subunits (12Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J.

Previous studies showed that 3′-5′ exonuclease-deficient forms of pol ε or pol δ (pol2–4 or pol3–01) are spontaneous mutators. However, the spontaneous mutation frequency of the pol δ mutant is ∼10 times higher than the pol ε mutant (26Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This difference in in vivo spontaneous mutation frequency may directly reflect the difference in the intrinsic fidelity of pol ε and pol δ but not the extent to which a DNA polymerase synthesizes inside the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2155720843,"We have utilized electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study secondary structure, subunit interaction, and molecular orientation of vimentin molecules within intact intermediate filaments and assembly intermediates. Spectroscopy data prove α-helical coiled-coil structures at individual amino acids 316–336 located in rod 2B. Analysis of positions 305, 309, and 312 identify this region as conforming to the helical pattern identified within 316–336 and thus demonstrates that, contrary to some previous predictions, this region is in an α-helical conformation. We show that by varying the position of the spin label, we can identify both intra- and inter-dimer interactions. With a label attached to the outside of the α-helix, we have been able to measure interactions between positions 348 of separate dimers as they align together in intact filaments, identifying the exact point of overlap. By mixing different spin-labeled proteins, we demonstrate that the interaction at position 348 is the result of an anti-parallel arrangement of dimers. This approach provides high resolution structural information (<2 nm resolution), can be used to identify molecular arrangements between subunits in an intact intermediate filament, and should be applicable to other noncrystallizable filamentous systems as well as to the study of protein fibrils. We have utilized electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study secondary structure, subunit interaction, and molecular orientation of vimentin molecules within intact intermediate filaments and assembly intermediates. Spectroscopy data prove α-helical coiled-coil structures at individual amino acids 316–336 located in rod 2B. Analysis of positions 305, 309, and 312 identify this region as conforming to the helical pattern identified within 316–336 and thus demonstrates that, contrary to some previous predictions, this region is in an α-helical conformation.

However, the mechanism(s) by which mutations produce disease has not been elucidated because the crystal structure has not been solved for any IF protein (6Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), although partial sequences have been solved (7Herrmann H. Strelkov S.V. Feja B. Rogers K.R. Brettel M. Lustig A. Häner M.

Primary sequence analysis suggests that all IF proteins have a central rod domain composed principally of what is predicted to be an α-helical sequence flanked by variably sized head and tail domains (Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the IF protein vimentin) (9Hanukoglu I. Fuchs E. Cell. 1983; 33: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Steinert P.M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R.

In rare instances, the tail may be absent (12Bader B.L. Magin T.M. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. Embo J. 1986; 5: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Hess J.F. Casselman J.T. FitzGerald P.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The central rod domain is relatively uniform in size (about 310 amino acids) and format, consisting of four coil domains separated by three short linker domains (14Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 16Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The former are mainly characterized by a primary sequence containing a heptad repeat pattern (designated as residuesa–g), a signature for an α-helical coiled-coil dimer (17Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, 18Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biol. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this motif, the a andd positions are usually occupied by hydrophobic side chains, which promote the coiled association between two parallel α-helices. Circular dichroism studies of IFs confirm the presence of substantial levels of α-helical content, but without a solved crystal structure the exact identification of α-helical and non-helical regions within the central rod domain is imprecise. Extensive cross-linking studies have been conducted to determine the arrangement of proteins in IFs (19Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D. Parry D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although data have been generated that are consistent with the initial formation of an in-parallel and in-register dimer and the subsequent assembly of these dimers, the interpretation of such data is not always straightforward and must be made cautiously. For example, cross-links between Cys328 of vimentin have been interpreted as occurring between chains within a dimer (intra-dimer), as well as between chains of separate dimers (inter-dimer) (21Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. Lustig A. Schulthess T. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These same issues, protein solubility and the inability to achieve crystallization, have plagued efforts to illuminate the molecular structure and interactions of membrane proteins. However, discrete structural information of membrane protein architecture has been achieved through site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). We report here the use of these techniques to ask specific questions about the architecture of IF proteins and the arrangement of proteins within IFs. Generally, SDSL is performed by engineering a unique cysteine amino acid into the peptide chain at a chosen position and modifying the free sulfhydryl with a thiol-specific nitroxide spin label. Subsequent EPR spectra of the spin-labeled side chain can be interpreted to provide information relevant to the relationship of protein structure and function (23Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 24Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Side chain dynamics measured from the EPR line shape data reflect backbone and contact-limited motions, information used to elucidate local secondary structure as well as protein folding and assembly (25Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction between site-directed spin labels is used to determine spatial relationships in proteins, information required to solve structure at the tertiary and quaternary levels. Because of its sensitivity and capability for real-time measurements under physiological conditions, EPR spectroscopy is particularly attractive for investigating conformational dynamics and mapping protein associations (24Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The ocular lens is composed of a large central mass of fiber cells expressing the IF proteins vimentin, filensin, and phakinin (CP49) surrounded by a single layer of lens epithelial cells expressing the IF protein vimentin (26Sandilands A. Masaki S. Quinlan R.A. Herrmann H. Harris J.R. Intermediate Filaments Subcellular Biochemistry. 31. Plenum Press, New York1998: 291-318Google Scholar). Vimentin is homopolymeric, whereas filensin and CP49 are copolymers. A mouse vimentin knockout displayed no obvious phenotype, but mutations in the fiber cell-specific protein CP49 can cause cataracts in humans (27Colucci-Guyon E. Portier M.M. Dunia I. Paulin D. Pournin S. Babinet C. Cell. 1994; 79: 679-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 28Conley Y.P. Erturk D. Keverline A. Mah T.S. Keravala A. Barnes L.R. Bruchis A. Hess J.F.

As a precursor to the analysis of CP49 and filensin structure and assembly, we performed experiments with the homopolymeric IF protein vimentin as a model system. This report documents the utility of an SDSL-EPR-based approach to study IF assembly, documenting α-helical coiled-coil structures at individual amino acids and identifying arrangements of molecules within an intact filament. Vimentin was produced by bacterial expression using pET vectors and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction; the vimentin expression construct was generously provided by Roy Quinlan (University of Durham, Durham, UK). Mutants were created with a Stratagene QuikChange kit and verified by DNA sequencing. Inclusion bodies were purified from bacteria using lysozyme/DNase (30Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and were subject to high and low salt washes. Purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea and chromatographed over a SuperDex gel filtration column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences); fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions were pooled. Purified proteins were incubated in 100 micromolar TCEP (tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, hydrochloride; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by spin labeling with 500 micromolar O-87500 ((1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate-d15[MTSL-d15]; Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). The spin-labeled protein was separated from unincorporated label by chromatography over a CM-Sepharose column. All purified proteins were stored at −80 °C. Filaments were assembled either by dialysis of labeled proteins in a stepwise fashion (31Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and aliquots removed at different stages for EPR analysis or by single step dialysis overnight (32Herrmann H. Hofmann I. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). EPR measurements were carried out in a JEOL X-band spectrometer fitted with a loop-gap resonator (33Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). An aliquot of purified, spin-labeled protein (5 μl) at a final concentration of approximately 100 μm protein was placed in a sealed quartz capillary contained in the resonator. Spectra of samples at room temperature (20–22 °C) were obtained by a single 60-s scan over 100 G at a microwave power of 2 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of 1 G, as described previously (34Chomiki N. Voss J.C. Warden C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was performed as described by Quinlan and co-workers (31Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the hypothesized domain structure of vimentin and the region studied. Initial experiments were performed to compare the spectra of samples labeled within the central rod or carboxyl terminal tail domains followed by assembly into filaments. Consistent with current models, EPR spectra recorded from mutant vimentin labeled either within the central rod domain at position 316 (Cys316) or the tail domain at position 459 (Cys459) reveal striking differences in the local structure of these distinct domains (Fig. 2). When unfolded in 8 m urea, the spectra from mutant Cys316 and Cys459 proteins are identical, with sharp narrow peaks (Fig. 2, green spectra). Upon reduction of urea concentration from 8 to 4 m, corresponding to the assembly of dimers, the spectrum of the label attached to the central rod domain (Cys316) becomes more anisotropic, reflecting the adoption of a more ordered structure (Fig.2 A, blue trace) (24Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 35Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the assembled filament, the motional freedom of the Cys316 side chain is greatly reduced, as revealed by its highly anisotropic spectrum (Fig.2 A, black trace). In contrast, the spectra from vimentin labeled at Cys459 in the tail domain reveals a location that retains a high level of mobility, even in the assembled IF (Fig. 2 B,black trace). The sharp peaks of the spectra clearly demonstrate a high level of spin label mobility, indicating a lack of rigid structure. Thus, these two distinct spin-labeled vimentin samples demonstrate that the EPR line shapes can 1) resolve distinct dynamic states associated with specific stages of the assembly process and 2) identify secondary structural features unique to specific IF domains. The severe broadening of the Cys316 intact filament spectra shown in Fig. 2 A suggests a magnetic interaction between probes within the assembled filament. Fig.2 C demonstrates how a substantial interaction between labels can be readily identified. The black line displays the EPR spectrum of intact filaments spin-labeled at position 316. The spectrum of the same sample was then collected following addition of SDS (red trace), which disrupts the assembled filament into detergent-solubilized subunits. The large differences in the spectra, where the protein concentration is identical, reveals the extent of interaction between labels. Integration of the SDS-treated sample provides an accurate measure of the total number of spin labels present in the sample. This value can then be used to normalize the intensities between samples according to the total number of spins determined in the presence of SDS. To test the hypothesis that the initial stage of vimentin assembly is a coiled-coil dimer and to establish whether this dimer was arranged in- or anti-parallel, in-register, or out of register, we engineered a series of single-cysteine mutants at each position from 323 to 336 (as shown in Fig. 1). This sequence spans two contiguous heptad repeats in a region predicted to be rod domain 2B (11Albers K. Fuchs E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 243-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Each mutant contained a single introduced cysteine residue with the wild type cysteine replaced by serine. Mutant proteins were produced by bacterial expression, solubilized in urea, purified, and then spin-labeled. Filament assembly was performed either by single step dialysis overnight (32Herrmann H. Hofmann I. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or multistep dialysis over several days (31Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Assembly into native-looking filaments was confirmed by electron microscopy (31Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the EPR spectra generated from these mutants. The spectrum from each of these mutants, normalized for the same number of spins, reveals that the spin label is in a non-random environment, indicative of a stable backbone and varying degrees of tertiary contact (36Mchaourab H. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Direct evidence of the coiled-coil structure of the rod domain is provided by the magnetic interactions between labels in close proximity, manifested by increased broadening (most easily seen as a loss in amplitude) of the spectrum when the label is placed in a or d positions (323, 326, 330, and 333) of the heptad repeat. Thus, these data identify residues that were predicted to appose one another in a coiled-coil configuration. Evaluation of the broadening as a function of only the distance-dependent dipolar interaction was performed by collecting the EPR spectra of frozen samples. In the absence of motion (i.e. frozen in liquid N2), semi-quantitative analysis of the extent of broadening caused by dipolar interaction can be obtained from the d1/d spectral ratio (see Fig.3 B, inset) (37Kokorin A.I. Zamaraev K.I. Grigorian G.L. Ivanov V.P. Rozantsev E.G. Biofizika. 1972; 17: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar, 38Likhtenshtein G.I. Biophysical Labeling Methods in Molecular Biology. Cambridge University Press, New York1993: 57-62Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows the dipolar broadening ratio versus sequence position. The difference between a,d positions and non-a,d positions is demonstrated as a binary distribution of points. The d1/d ratio fora,d positions clusters near 0.5, and the d1/d ratio for non-a,dpositions all approach 0.33. These values translate into distances of 1.0 to 1.5 nm for a,d positions and >2 nm for all other positions. This analysis provides a measure of the separation between spin labels, revealing the periodicity of the distance separation along the positions of the heptad. From the data, we conclude that these two heptads are assembled in a coiled-coil dimer and that the individual monomers of this dimer are arranged in parallel and in exact register. To illustrate the α-helical coiled-coil structure within this region of vimentin, we used the recently determined crystal structure of a 100-amino acid region of cortexillin (39Burkhard P. Kammerer R.A. Steinmetz M.O. Bourenkov G.P. Aebi U. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as a model. With this crystal structure as a template for vimentin amino acids 305–405, we used molecular modeling software to introduce spin-labeled cysteine amino acids to heptad positions a through g. Fig.3 C shows an end-on view of the coiled coil with the spin-labeled side chain of each amino acid position in a different color. The appropriate positions of one heptad are labeleda–d, and equivalent positions on the second protein are labeled a′–d′. Looking down the helix, positions a–d (and a′–d′) are labeled red, green, yellow, and purple, respectively. The red and purple moieties are more centrally located, whereas the yellow and green moieties occupy more exterior positions. Spin labels ata and d positions are close enough to interact within one dimer; positions b and c are farther separated and at the limit of spin-spin interaction detection. From this modeling and our EPR data of Fig. 3, A andB, the periodicity of the spectra is easily seen to coincide exactly with the helical nature of the coiled coil. Positionse, f, and g of the heptad can also be modeled and reveal the same exterior positions as positionsb and c. In summary, our examination of vimentin structure within the 323–336 span confirms a self-interaction between labels attached at either thea or d position. If the monomers were aligned in an anti-parallel manner, then at best, only one residue within the entire rod domain would have shown interaction. Had the monomers been in-parallel, but out of register, then no interaction would have been seen. Thus, SDSL-EPR is able to provide the first real-time data that IF monomers are aligned as in-parallel and in-register dimers, within native filaments, formed in physiologic conditions in a manner consistent with predictions of coiled-coil assembly. Having established the ability to identify coiled-coil structures at the level of individual amino acids, we sought to clarify the structure of vimentin positions 305–315, which have been assigned alternately to rod domain 2B or linker 2 (11Albers K. Fuchs E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 243-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Within this sequence, amino acids 305, 309, and 312 were individually changed to cysteine, and the resulting proteins were subject to EPR analysis. As shown in the spectra of these positions (Fig. 4) 305, 309, and 312 resemble the a–d positions in line shape and extensive broadening. From these data, we conclude that the vimentin region 305–316 is in an α-helical coiled structure, revealing a heptad repeat pattern continuous with the region 323–336 discussed above. Thus, EPR analysis shows that rod domain 2B extends from at least position 305. In the previous experiments, a,d residues were found to interact because they are positioned at apposing surfaces of two monomers. The lack of interaction of the non-a–d residues results from the greater separation between spin labels located on opposite sides of the exterior surface of the dimer. We hypothesized that spin labels such as these, on the surface of the dimer, would permit us to study the precise arrangement of dimers in native filaments. Therefore, we spin-labeled vimentin at multiple positions along the outer surface of the α-helix of the rod domain, assembled filaments, and recorded spectra, looking for evidence of spin label interaction. We found that EPR spectra from spin labels placed at positions 345, 348, and 349 showed evidence of interaction indicating physical proximity. Of these three positions, 348 provided strongest interaction, establishing this residue as a point of overlap between two dimers (Fig.5 A). Interaction between spin labels at position 348 is interpreted as resulting from an interaction between spin labels attached to separate dimers. Support for this conclusion is provided by comparing EPR spectra from samples with different proportions of spin label (25Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A sample of vimentin containing 10% spin-labeled 348 and 90% wild type vimentin produces a spectrum that shows no evidence of spin-spin interaction; the spin labels are diluted and very rarely interact. The traces in Fig. 5 A each represent the same number of spins as determined from the integration of the sample following addition of SDS. The spectrum from protein completely labeled at position 348 (100%, Fig. 5 A, black line) is significantly more broadened than from the sample containing 10% labeled 348 (Fig.5 A, blue line). The spectrum of the 10% sample demonstrates that position 348 is a non-a,dresidue of the heptad (compare the spectra to those in Fig.3 A), but the spectrum from the 100% labeled sample is broadened. Note that each dimer contains two spin-labeled positions, but only one would be predicted to interact with the second dimer. The second spin-labeled position of each dimer is on the opposite side and would be predicted not to interact unless tetramers assemble further. Although the data in Fig. 5 A show that position 348 is a site of interaction between dimers, these data do not identify whether these dimers are arranged in- or anti-parallel. Unambiguous demonstration of the anti-parallel alignment of dimers with a midpoint overlap at position 348 is provided by EPR spectra of mixtures of spin-labeled proteins (Fig. 5 B). We selected position 334 as the starting point on the outside of the helix (an eposition) and predicted that a site within the region of 355–365 would interact with 334 if dimers were arranged in an anti-parallel fashion. Therefore, mutants at positions 356(b heptad position), 359(e), 363(b), or 366(e) on the outside of the helix were prepared. Spin-labeled 334 was individually mixed equimolar with each spin-labeled 356, 359, 363, or 366 mutant. Assembly of each mixture into filaments was confirmed by electron microscopy, and EPR spectra were collected. To evaluate these combinations independently of line shape differences arising from differences in the rate of rotational averaging of hyperfine anisotropy, EPR analysis was performed on the samples frozen at −100 C°. Quantitative analysis of the spectra was achieved using a Pake deconvolution of broadening functions (40Rabenstein M.S. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 41Altenbach C., Oh, K.-J. Trabanino R.E. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which optimizes results according to both the strength of the interaction and the fraction of interacting species. Only the mixture of the 334 and 359 spin-labeled proteins displayed evidence of interaction as seen by significant broadening of the spectra (Fig. 5 B). From this mixture, the Pake deconvolution optimization of frozen spectra resulted in a mean interspin distance of 1.6 nm, with a non-interacting fraction of 74%. This labeling level coincides with a distribution of approximately one quarter of the spins interacting. Given an equal number of labeled 334 and 359 proteins introduced into the assembly mixture and a random pairing of these proteins during assembly, the expected population of spins paired at the tetramer level is 25%. Thus, these results provide strong evidence that vimentin dimers in intact filaments are associated in an anti-parallel manner, overlapping within 1.6 nm of position 348. In observing the interaction between positions 334 and 359, more broadening would be predicted if spin labels were placed at both 334 and 359 within the same polypeptide chain. Hence we constructed a double mutant that codes for a Cys substitution at both position 334 and position 359. To simplify analysis, the assembly of the 334–359 double mutant was performed in low ionic strength Tris buffer; under these conditions, tetrameric protofilaments have been demonstrated to predominate (22Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Meng J.J. Khan S. Ip W. J. Biol.

EPR spectra of the 334–359 double mutant (Fig. 5 B, black line) is different from the spectral sum of the individual mutants (green line). A Pake deconvolution analysis of the double mutant collected at −100 C° was optimized with a mean interaction distance of 1.7 nm and a non-interacting population of 57%. The results correspond to a system in which approximately half of the spins are interacting, matching the alignment predicted by the experiments using a mixture of single-labeled proteins. Thus, EPR spectra provide evidence for the interaction of positions 334 and 359 within vimentin tetramers. Furthermore, quantitative analysis supports the hypothesis that vimentin in low ionic strength Tris is a relatively homogeneous population of tetramers arranged anti-parallel with rod 2B interacting. Visualization of the side chain interactions identified between position 348 and itself, as well as 334 and 359, is provided in Fig.5 C. As in Fig. 2 C, we have used the crystal structure of cortexillin as a model for vimentin dimer structure and have arranged two dimers in a structure consistent with our EPR data. Within the figure, the spin-labeled side chain of position 334 is shown in yellow; 348 is red, and 359 isblue. No other side chains are shown. As depicted, interactions between 348 and 348 as well as 334 and 359 can be seen. The data presented conclusively show that assembly of vimentin intermediate filaments can be studied by site-directed spin labeling and EPR. In summary, our examination of vimentin structure within the 323–336 span confirms a self-interaction between labels attached at either the a or d position. If the monomers were aligned in an anti-parallel manner, then at best, only one residue within the entire rod domain would have shown interaction. Had the monomers been in parallel but out of register, then no interaction would have been seen. Spectral data provide precise structural information detailing the protein-protein contacts between IF proteins in intact filaments. Thus, SDSL-EPR is able to provide the first real-time data that IF monomers are aligned as in-parallel and in-register dimers, within native filaments formed in physiologic conditions in a manner consistent with predictions of coiled-coil assembly. Our data reveal the α-helical coiled-coil nature of the vimentin rod domain and provide evidence that the region 305–336 is an α-helical coiled coil; this identification resolves a discrepancy in the literature (11Albers K. Fuchs E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 243-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two factors account for the broad spectra reported by thea,d positions. First, the wide splittings reflect a lack of motional averaging by side chains located at these positions. This indicates that the rotational freedom of the label is restricted by the protein structure. Second, the magnitude of broadening suggests a dipolar interaction among the labels when they are attached at either an a or d position. Thus the dynamic and spatial observations of spin-labeled positions within this span provide the first direct evidence of an α-helical coiled-coil arrangement with an exact register of the two peptide chains. Non-a,d positions, predicted to be on the exterior of the dimer, do not reveal such strong broadening, indicating that spin labels are farther apart, yet the overall structure is ordered and α-helical. Beyond determination of structure, we have used SDSL-EPR to study assembly of IFs. We have been able to collect spectra from samples in low ionic strength Tris and subsequently from the same samples assembled into filaments. A surprising finding was that little change in rod domain structure is observed between normalized spectra obtained from fully assembled filaments and protofilaments formed in low ionic strength Tris. Under these conditions, higher order assembly beyond tetrameric protofilaments is inhibited, resulting in a predominantly tetramer population (22Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Meng J.J. Khan S. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18679-18685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Potschka M. Nave R. Weber K. Geisler N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two examples of tetramer spectra are shown in Fig. 3 A (green line). This suggests that vimentin assembly beyond the tetramer level does not generate strong tertiary contacts involving the rod domain examined here. Thus, we do not see evidence for a tight packing of neighboring tetramers via their rod domains. This is consistent with the fact that non-a,d positions display moderate motional freedom even in the intact filament. As shown in Fig. 3 C, non-a,d positions are widely separated on the outside of the helix. In a fortunate coincidence, this degree of separation is just slightly greater than the distance EPR can be used to measure. Thus, we have used spin labels placed on the outside of the helix to study interactions between dimers in filaments and assembly intermediates. With this strategy, we have identified an anti-parallel arrangement of dimers that is one of the configurations suggested by Steinert et al. from protein cross-link data (20Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our conclusions extend the data of Steinertet al. (20Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and identify amino acid position 348 as the midpoint of overlap. Additionally, we have predicted an interaction between adjacent dimers and identified an interaction between positions 334 and 359 of adjacent dimers; this interaction thus proves the ability of EPR to identify interaction between the outer surfaces of two adjacent α-helices. This identification allows for the rational prediction of amino acids that interact between adjacent rods 2B in the anti-parallel arrangement. Our data validate our experimental approach and provide a method for understanding the individual mechanisms behind the growing number of IF gene mutations identified as causing inherited genetic diseases. Because of the numbers and locations of identified mutations, each is likely to have subtle differences from the others. Abnormal assembly products can now be characterized by EPR at any stage during assembly, and the mechanisms behind such abnormal assembly can be elucidated. More broadly, these data establish the utility of SDSL-EPR to provide structural data on filament-forming proteins in general.

https://openalex.org/W1997759665,"Mossy fiber (MF) and CA3 collateral (CL) axons activate common interneurons via synapses comprised of different AMPA receptors to provide feedforward and feedback inhibitory control of the CA3 hippocampal network. Because synapses potentially occur over variable electrotonic distances that distort somatically recorded synaptic currents, it is not known whether the underlying afferent-specific synaptic conductances are associated with different time courses. Using a somatic voltage jump technique to alter the driving force at the site of the synapse, we demonstrate that MF and CL synapses overlap in electrotonic location yet differ in conductance time course. Thus, afferent-specific conductance time courses allow single interneurons to differentially integrate feedforward and feedback information without the need to segregate distinct AMPA receptor subunits to different electrotonic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2010749449,"Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) used for mitochondrial DNA replication are mainly formed by phosphorylation of deoxynucleosides imported into mitochondria from the cytosol. We earlier obtained evidence for a mitochondrial 5'-nucleotidase (dNT2) with a pronounced specificity for dUMP and dTMP and suggested that the enzyme protects mitochondrial DNA replication from excess dTTP. In humans, accumulation of dTTP causes a mitochondrial genetic disease. We now establish that dNT2 in vivo indeed is located in mitochondria. The native enzyme shows the same substrate specificity and affinity for inhibitors as the recombinant dNT2. We constructed ponasterone-inducible cell lines overproducing dNT2 with and without the green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked to its C terminus. The fusion protein occurred in mitochondria mostly in an inactive truncated form, with only a short C-terminal fragment of dNT2 linked to GFP. No truncation occurred when dNT2 and GFP were not linked. The cell mitochondria then contained a large excess of active dNT2 with or without the mitochondrial presequence. After removal of ponasterone overproduced dNT2 disappeared only slowly from the cells, whereas dNT2-mRNA was lost rapidly. Overproduction of dNT2 did not lead to an increased excretion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides, in contrast to overproduction of the corresponding cytosolic deoxynucleotidase, suggesting that the mitochondrial enzyme does not affect overall cellular deoxynucleotide turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2052081639,"Protein kinase Akt, an important downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, is one of the major survival factors in mammalian cells. It has been shown that phosphorylation of the C-terminal hydrophobic motif is required for Akt activation. The activated Akt then phosphorylates several pro-apoptotic proteins and prevents apoptosis mediated by caspases and the mitochondria.

In this study we showed that cytokine withdrawal resulted in Akt degradation by caspases as well.

The Akt truncation mutant mimicking the caspase cleavage product lost its kinase activity and functioned as a dominant negative to promote cell death. Our results suggest that the balance between Akt and caspase activity controls cell survival.

Akt contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; IL-3, interleukin-3; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; FKHRs, forkhead related transcription factors; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; IL-3, interleukin-3; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; FKHRs, forkhead related transcription factors; HA, hemagglutinin. and a C-terminal kinase domain. The PH domain binds to phosphatidylinositols (thereby recruiting Akt to the plasma membrane where PDK1 is located) (13Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for fully activating Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Thr-308 is believed to be phosphorylated by PDK1 (14Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr.

O., and Tsichlis, P. N. (2001) stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/ oc_sigtrans;2001/66/pe/.Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ser-473 is within the hydrophobic motif (FXX(F/Y)(S/T)(F/Y)) in the C-terminal tail of Akt. This hydrophobic motif is also conserved among the AGC family of kinases. Basal phosphorylation of the Ser-473 site is important for the activation of Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar), presumably necessary for maintaining the proper conformation of the kinase domain and docking to PDK1 (18Biondi R.M.

Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) has also identified a novel protein that is capable of binding to the C-terminal domain of Akt and negatively regulates its activity. These data point to the important regulatory role of the C-terminal region of Akt.Akt likely acts on multiple substrates in vivo, which may include Bad and FKHR family transcription factors (20Datta S.R.

Phosphorylation of Bad and FKHRs leads to inactivation of its apoptotic activity (21del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). It has also been found that Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate caspase-9 in vitro, suggesting that Akt may protect cells from apoptosis by inhibiting caspases (24Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Akt was reported to be degraded during apoptosis induced by Fas and anoikis, and inhibition of caspase activity prevented its degradation (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results suggest a possible negative feedback loop between Akt and caspases that may help to maintain the balance between cell survival and apoptosis.However, it is still unclear how Akt and caspases may interact with each other in cytokine-induced cell death. The exact site(s) where caspase cleavage may occur in vivo and how this cleavage may affect Akt survival activity remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the potential caspase cleavage sites in Akt in vitro and in vivo, and we identified a novel primary cleavage site located between the kinase domain and the hydrophobic motif. Mutation of this site (Asp-462) blocked caspase cleavage and significantly enhanced Akt survival activity against cytokine withdrawal. The Akt cleavage product that did not contain the C-terminal tail lost its kinase activity and could function as a dominant negative in IL-3-dependent 32D cells. Therefore, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473, the activity of Akt is also regulated by caspases.DISCUSSIONAkt has been reported to be down-regulated during apoptosis induced by Fas ligand or anoikis (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that Akt could also be down-regulated during cytokine-induced cell death and it is likely mediated by caspases. In IL-3-dependent 32D cells, we found decreased levels of endogenous Akt at about 14–16 h after cytokine withdrawal. Such degradation is consistent with the time course of apoptosis in these cells, as most of the cells die between 14 and 20 h post-IL-3 depletion. Furthermore, addition of a caspase-3 inhibitor could block Akt degradation in 32D cells upon IL-3 withdrawal. We found that in vitro caspase-3 could cleave Akt at multiple sites, and a single point mutation of residue Asp-462 to Asn was able to block Akt cleavage and degradation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the D462N mutation enhanced Akt survival activity in vivo, possibly by stabilizing Akt without altering its kinase activity or subcellular localization.Other caspase cleavage sites (Asp-108 and Asp-119) on Akt have been reported recently (2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but the single mutation of any of these sites could not completely abolish in vitro caspase-3 cleavage. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Asp-462 site is likely the primary cleavage site. Subsequent cleavage might occur after this site has been cleaved. It is possible that in previous studies the Asp-462 site may have been overlooked because cleavage at Asp-462 results in only a slight change in the molecular weight of Akt and hence makes it difficult to distinguish from full-length Akt.The C-terminal tail of Akt downstream of the kinase domain contains a hydrophobic motif conserved in most of the AGC family kinases (32Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the Ser-473 residue inside this motif (by an as yet unidentified kinase) is thought to facilitate Akt interaction with PDK1 which then phosphorylates another regulatory site Thr-308 in the activation loop of Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar, 32Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic motif therefore plays a central role in regulating Akt activity. Consistent with this notion, we found that this short tail is necessary for the kinase activity of Akt (Fig. 6). The D462* mutant that does not contain this tail retains an intact kinase domain. However, we found that this protein lost its kinase activity in vitro and could not protect cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis in vivo. It has been shown that the hydrophobic motifs of several AGC family protein kinases directly interact with PDK1 (18Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the deletion of the hydrophobic motif by caspase cleavage at Asp-462 may have prevented PDK1 docking and subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-308. Alternatively, the loss of the tail may have disrupted potential intra-molecular interactions between the tail and other regions of Akt, thereby affecting its activity. The structures of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Akt indicate that the non-catalytic C terminus including part of the hydrophobic motifs form a loop that interacts with the kinase domain (34Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 35Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In light of recent findings, it is also possible that such cleavage may affect the interaction of Akt with other regulatory proteins (e.g.CTMP) through the Akt tail (19Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Although our study has focused on Akt1, it is likely that similar regulation by caspases is common for other isoforms of Akt. A comparison of sequences of three Akt isoforms shows that several potential caspase sites are clustered at the equivalent position of Asp-462 on Akt2 and Akt3 (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with this prediction, the signal reactive with the C-20 antibody decreased upon IL-3 starvation. Given that the C-20 antibody recognizes all Akt isoforms, it suggests that other Akt isoforms are probably also cleaved at the C-terminal tail during apoptosis.The fate of a cell is determined by the balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic signals. The observation that activated Akt inhibits caspases and caspases in turn degrade Akt indicates a feedback regulation mechanism in controlling cell survival and apoptosis. If cells maintain Akt activation, Akt can inhibit pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad, transcription factor FKHRs, and caspases, allowing the cells to survive. On the other hand, at the onset of apoptosis, caspase activity can be stimulated such that survival factors including Akt can be eliminated, thereby committing the cells to die. Consistent with this model, cleavage of Akt at Asp-462 was most apparent at about 16 h post-IL-3 withdrawal, which is also the time when most cells commit to apoptosis. It is possible that cleavage of Akt may have taken place during the early hours after IL-3 depletion. Because we could not detect the change in Akt levels at earlier time points using either the N- or C-terminal antibody, it is likely that new Akt protein synthesis counteracts Akt degradation. In support of this notion, the Akt protein level significantly increased in cells treated with a cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor. In addition, our results suggest that when cells undergo apoptosis, the primary cleavage of Akt by caspases at Asp-462 (which deletes the hydrophobic motif) is able to eliminate Akt survival activity before it is completely degraded.We have shown that the Akt cleavage product could function as a dominant negative. Interestingly, Akt cleavage products at two other caspase-3 cleavage sites have also been reported to function as dominant negative forms of Akt and accelerate the apoptotic process (2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,25Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These sites are located N-terminal to the kinase domain, and cleavage is predicted to delete the PH domain. Therefore, cleavage of Akt results in the survival signal being quickly down-regulated thereby allowing the cells to commit suicide. Cell survival and apoptosis are tightly regulated processes in multicellular organisms, the disruption of which may lead to diseases such as cancer. The serine/threonine kinase Akt (also referred to as PKB or RAC-PK) has proven to be a critical player in cell survival pathways. Originally identified as the cellular homologue of the retroviral oncogene v-akt (3Bellicose A. Test J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N.

Akt contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; IL-3, interleukin-3; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; FKHRs, forkhead related transcription factors; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; IL-3, interleukin-3; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; FKHRs, forkhead related transcription factors; HA, hemagglutinin. and a C-terminal kinase domain. The PH domain binds to phosphatidylinositols (thereby recruiting Akt to the plasma membrane where PDK1 is located) (13Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for fully activating Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Thr-308 is believed to be phosphorylated by PDK1 (14Alessi D.R. Deak M.

O., and Tsichlis, P. N. (2001) stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/ oc_sigtrans;2001/66/pe/.Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ser-473 is within the hydrophobic motif (FXX(F/Y)(S/T)(F/Y)) in the C-terminal tail of Akt. This hydrophobic motif is also conserved among the AGC family of kinases. Basal phosphorylation of the Ser-473 site is important for the activation of Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar), presumably necessary for maintaining the proper conformation of the kinase domain and docking to PDK1 (18Biondi R.M.

Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) has also identified a novel protein that is capable of binding to the C-terminal domain of Akt and negatively regulates its activity. These data point to the important regulatory role of the C-terminal region of Akt. Akt likely acts on multiple substrates in vivo, which may include Bad and FKHR family transcription factors (20Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Phosphorylation of Bad and FKHRs leads to inactivation of its apoptotic activity (21del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). It has also been found that Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate caspase-9 in vitro, suggesting that Akt may protect cells from apoptosis by inhibiting caspases (24Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Akt was reported to be degraded during apoptosis induced by Fas and anoikis, and inhibition of caspase activity prevented its degradation (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results suggest a possible negative feedback loop between Akt and caspases that may help to maintain the balance between cell survival and apoptosis. However, it is still unclear how Akt and caspases may interact with each other in cytokine-induced cell death. The exact site(s) where caspase cleavage may occur in vivo and how this cleavage may affect Akt survival activity remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the potential caspase cleavage sites in Akt in vitro and in vivo, and we identified a novel primary cleavage site located between the kinase domain and the hydrophobic motif. Mutation of this site (Asp-462) blocked caspase cleavage and significantly enhanced Akt survival activity against cytokine withdrawal. The Akt cleavage product that did not contain the C-terminal tail lost its kinase activity and could function as a dominant negative in IL-3-dependent 32D cells. Therefore, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473, the activity of Akt is also regulated by caspases. DISCUSSIONAkt has been reported to be down-regulated during apoptosis induced by Fas ligand or anoikis (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that Akt could also be down-regulated during cytokine-induced cell death and it is likely mediated by caspases. In IL-3-dependent 32D cells, we found decreased levels of endogenous Akt at about 14–16 h after cytokine withdrawal. Such degradation is consistent with the time course of apoptosis in these cells, as most of the cells die between 14 and 20 h post-IL-3 depletion. Furthermore, addition of a caspase-3 inhibitor could block Akt degradation in 32D cells upon IL-3 withdrawal. We found that in vitro caspase-3 could cleave Akt at multiple sites, and a single point mutation of residue Asp-462 to Asn was able to block Akt cleavage and degradation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the D462N mutation enhanced Akt survival activity in vivo, possibly by stabilizing Akt without altering its kinase activity or subcellular localization.Other caspase cleavage sites (Asp-108 and Asp-119) on Akt have been reported recently (2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but the single mutation of any of these sites could not completely abolish in vitro caspase-3 cleavage. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Asp-462 site is likely the primary cleavage site. Subsequent cleavage might occur after this site has been cleaved. It is possible that in previous studies the Asp-462 site may have been overlooked because cleavage at Asp-462 results in only a slight change in the molecular weight of Akt and hence makes it difficult to distinguish from full-length Akt.The C-terminal tail of Akt downstream of the kinase domain contains a hydrophobic motif conserved in most of the AGC family kinases (32Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the Ser-473 residue inside this motif (by an as yet unidentified kinase) is thought to facilitate Akt interaction with PDK1 which then phosphorylates another regulatory site Thr-308 in the activation loop of Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar, 32Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic motif therefore plays a central role in regulating Akt activity. Consistent with this notion, we found that this short tail is necessary for the kinase activity of Akt (Fig. 6). The D462* mutant that does not contain this tail retains an intact kinase domain. However, we found that this protein lost its kinase activity in vitro and could not protect cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis in vivo. It has been shown that the hydrophobic motifs of several AGC family protein kinases directly interact with PDK1 (18Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the deletion of the hydrophobic motif by caspase cleavage at Asp-462 may have prevented PDK1 docking and subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-308. Alternatively, the loss of the tail may have disrupted potential intra-molecular interactions between the tail and other regions of Akt, thereby affecting its activity. The structures of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Akt indicate that the non-catalytic C terminus including part of the hydrophobic motifs form a loop that interacts with the kinase domain (34Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 35Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In light of recent findings, it is also possible that such cleavage may affect the interaction of Akt with other regulatory proteins (e.g.CTMP) through the Akt tail (19Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Although our study has focused on Akt1, it is likely that similar regulation by caspases is common for other isoforms of Akt. A comparison of sequences of three Akt isoforms shows that several potential caspase sites are clustered at the equivalent position of Asp-462 on Akt2 and Akt3 (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with this prediction, the signal reactive with the C-20 antibody decreased upon IL-3 starvation. Given that the C-20 antibody recognizes all Akt isoforms, it suggests that other Akt isoforms are probably also cleaved at the C-terminal tail during apoptosis.The fate of a cell is determined by the balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic signals. The observation that activated Akt inhibits caspases and caspases in turn degrade Akt indicates a feedback regulation mechanism in controlling cell survival and apoptosis. If cells maintain Akt activation, Akt can inhibit pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad, transcription factor FKHRs, and caspases, allowing the cells to survive. On the other hand, at the onset of apoptosis, caspase activity can be stimulated such that survival factors including Akt can be eliminated, thereby committing the cells to die. Consistent with this model, cleavage of Akt at Asp-462 was most apparent at about 16 h post-IL-3 withdrawal, which is also the time when most cells commit to apoptosis. It is possible that cleavage of Akt may have taken place during the early hours after IL-3 depletion. Because we could not detect the change in Akt levels at earlier time points using either the N- or C-terminal antibody, it is likely that new Akt protein synthesis counteracts Akt degradation. In support of this notion, the Akt protein level significantly increased in cells treated with a cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor. In addition, our results suggest that when cells undergo apoptosis, the primary cleavage of Akt by caspases at Asp-462 (which deletes the hydrophobic motif) is able to eliminate Akt survival activity before it is completely degraded.We have shown that the Akt cleavage product could function as a dominant negative. Interestingly, Akt cleavage products at two other caspase-3 cleavage sites have also been reported to function as dominant negative forms of Akt and accelerate the apoptotic process (2Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,25Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These sites are located N-terminal to the kinase domain, and cleavage is predicted to delete the PH domain. Therefore, cleavage of Akt results in the survival signal being quickly down-regulated thereby allowing the cells to commit suicide. Akt has been reported to be down-regulated during apoptosis induced by Fas ligand or anoikis (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

To understand the consequences of CF mutations on CFTR channel activity, we compared the pharmacological properties of wild-type (wt) and G551D-CFTR. Dose-dependent relationships of wt-CFTR activated by genistein follows a non-Michaelis-Menten behavior consistent with the presence of two binding sites. With phosphorylated CFTR, a high affinity site for genistein is the activator (K s ≈ 3 μm), whereas a second site of low affinity (K i ≈ 75 μm) is the inhibitor. With non-phosphorylated CFTR, K s was increased (K s ≈ 12 μm), butK i was not affected (K i ≈ 70 μm). In G551D-CFTR cells, channel activity was recovered by co-application of forskolin and genistein in a dose-dependent manner. A further stimulation of G551D-CFTR channel activity was measured at concentrations from 30 μm to 1 mm. The dose response is described by a classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with only a single apparent site (K m ≈ 11 μm). Our results suggest glycine 551 in NBD1 as an important location within the low affinity inhibitory site for genistein and offers new evidence for pharmacological alteration caused by an NBD1 mutation of CFTR.

CFTR mutations (www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr) can be assigned to one of five classes of mutations (4Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), leading to a protein in which chloride channel function is altered (classes III and IV) or lacking (classes I, II, and V) at the apical membrane. The glycine-to-aspartic acid missense mutation at codon 551 (G551D) is a class III mutation located within the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) (5Cutting G.R. Kasch L.M. Rosenstein B.J. Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Antonarakis S.E. Kazazian H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Glycine 551 lies within a sequence in NBD1, DX(G/A)GQ, which shows remarkable conservation in ATP binding cassette transporters. G551D is one of the five most frequent CF mutations with a frequency of 2–5% depending of the population of origin but is associated with a severe CF phenotype (5Cutting G.R. Kasch L.M. Rosenstein B.J. Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Antonarakis S.E. Kazazian H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Class III mutations disrupt activation and regulation of CFTR at the plasma membrane. The G551D mutated protein is fully glycosylated, correctly located at the apical membrane (i.e. normal biosynthesis, trafficking, and processing), and normally phosphorylated at the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (6Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, G551D proteins have a decreased nucleotide binding (7Logan J.D. Hiestand D. Daram P. Huang Z. Muccio D.D. Hartman J. Haley B. Cook W.J. Sorscher E.J. J. Clin.

Understanding the molecular consequences of a mutation on CFTR function and activity and its impact on the severity of the disease must be associated with the development of agents able to modulate the activity of CFTR. Our knowledge of the pharmacological modulation of non-mutated wild-type CFTR (wt-CFTR) chloride channel activity is now increasing, and a number of molecules have been described as activators (reviewed in Ref. 10Schultz B.D. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S109-S144Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the pharmacological consequences of disease-causing mutations of CFTR have not been systematically characterized and compared with non-mutated CFTR. In this work, we compared the effect of genistein on both activation and inhibition of wt-CFTR and G551D-CFTR chloride channels. Analyzing dose-response relationships pointed to a novel type of alteration due to the disease-causing mutation G551D. A non-Michaelis-Menten behavior describes the effect of genistein on wt-CFTR and shows the presence of one inhibitory site and one activatory site. On the contrary, mutation of glycine 551 in NBD1 alters this kinetic behavior, which is transformed into a classical Michaelis-Menten mechanism indicating a single apparent site for genistein on CFTR. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with pNUT vector alone (pNUT CHO) or containing wild-type CFTR (CFTR(+) CHO) or G551D (G551D CHO) mutation were provided by J. R.

CFTR chloride channel activity was assayed by measuring the rate of iodide (125I) effluxversus time from cells as described previously (11Bulteau L. Dérand R. Mettey Y. Metaye T. Morris M.R. Mcneilly C.M. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Zegarra-Moran O. Pereira M.M. Jougla C. Dormer R.L. Vierfond J.M. Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J.

Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1657-C1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates to perform parallel experiments and comparison analysis. The efflux buffer contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells are loaded in efflux buffer containing 1 μm KI (1 μCi of Na125I/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. The loss of intracellular 125I was determined by removing the medium with efflux buffer every 1 min for up to 11 min. The first four aliquots were used to establish a stable baseline in efflux buffer alone. A medium containing the appropriate drug was used for the remaining aliquots. Residual radioactivity was extracted with 0.1 n NaOH and determined using a γ counter (Cobra II, Packard-Bell). The fraction of initial intracellular125I lost during each time point was determined, and time-dependent rates of 125I efflux were calculated from ln(125It1/125It2)/(t 1− t 2) where 125It is the intracellular 125I at time t, andt 1 and t 2 are successive time points (13Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curves were constructed by plotting the rate of125I versus time. The relative rate Rcorresponds toR peak/R basal. All comparisons were based on maximal values for the time-dependent rates excluding the points used to establish the baseline (12Dérand R. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Mettey Y. Zegarra-Moran O. Howell L.D. Randak C. Galietta L.J. Cohn J.A. Norez C. Romio L. Vierfond J.M. Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1657-C1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell recordings were performed as described elsewhere (12Dérand R. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Mettey Y. Zegarra-Moran O. Howell L.D. Randak C. Galietta L.J. Cohn J.A. Norez C. Romio L. Vierfond J.M. Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1657-C1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, currents were recorded with a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier. I-V relationships were built by clamping the membrane potential to −40 mV and by pulses from −100 mV to +100 mV by 20-mV increments. Media generating a chloride gradient of an external concentration of 151 mm and internal concentration of 28 mm were used. The pipette solution contained 113 mml-aspartic acid, 113 mm CsOH, 27 mm CsCl, 1 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm TES, 285 mosm (pH 7.2). MgATP (3 mm) was added just before patch clamp experiments. The external solution consists of 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm TES, 340 mosm (pH 7.4). Results were analyzed with the pCLAMP6 package software (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments). Forskolin, genistein, glibenclamide, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC), and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) were from Sigma. 5,11,17,23-tetrasulfonato-25,26,27,28-tetramethoxy-calix[4]arene was a generous gift of Drs. Singh and Bridges (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). All other products were from Sigma except α-minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham Nutritif Mix F12 from Fisher and Invitrogen, respectively. All compounds were dissolved in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration: 0.1%). In control experiments, the currents and iodide efflux were not altered by Me2SO. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations. To compare sets of data, we used either an analysis of variance or Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant whenp < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, CA). We used CHO cells as a model to study the pharmacology of wt-CFTR chloride channel activity. Because phosphorylation is an important mode of regulation of CFTR (reviewed in Ref.14Gabsdy D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S78-S107Google Scholar) and because cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is a prerequisite for genistein to activate CFTR (15Reenstra W.W. Yurko-Mauro K. Dam A. Rama S. Shorten S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C650-C657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yang I.C. Cheng T.H. Wang F. Price E.M. Hwang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C142-C155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of genistein on partially and non-phosphorylated CFTR channels. In the presence of increasing concentrations of forskolin (1 nm-10 μm), the wt-CFTR channel activity determined from iodide efflux experiments and whole cell patch clamp was stimulated with an EC50 ≈ 1 μm (not shown). In this study, partial phosphorylation of the CFTR channel was achieved in the presence of 500 nm forskolin (FSK). Concentration-dependent activation relationships were then generated using genistein (GST, chemical structure shown in Fig.1 A) from 0.1 μmto 200 μm in the presence of 500 nm FSK. As shown in Fig. 1 A (filled symbols), a biphasic, bell-shaped, effect was observed. For concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 30 μm, a marked potentiation was found. Example traces of the kinetics of iodide efflux with increasing doses of genistein are given Fig. 1 B (left traces) as compared with an experiment in which forskolin (500 nm) was present but not genistein. On the contrary, for concentrations above 30 μm, genistein induced an inhibition of CFTR activity at 50, 100, and 200 μm (Fig.1 A). The corresponding percentages of inhibition are 34, 55, and 77%, respectively. The second part of our experiments was conducted on non-phosphorylated CFTR, i.e. in the absence of forskolin. Dose-dependent relationship was again generated with concentrations of genistein from 0.1 μm to 200 μm as shown in Fig. 1 A (empty symbols). The general form of the curve is also biphasic. However, very low activity of CFTR was observed at concentrations below 30 μm (Fig. 1 B, right traces). For example, the relative rates of efflux were (for experiments without and with 500 nm forskolin, respectively): 1.25 ± 0.1 and 2.38 ± 0.1 at 0.1 μm genistein; 1.34 ± 0.1 and 2.42 ± 0.2 at 1 μm genistein; and 1.47 ± 0.08 and 3.2 ± 0.35 at 3 μm genistein (n = 4–8 for each condition). Comparing both curves in Fig. 1 A indicates that with forskolin (i.e.phosphorylated CFTR proteins), a significant shift toward lower concentrations of genistein and a significant increase of the amplitude of the response were induced. At higher concentrations of genistein (> 30 μm) and in the absence of forskolin, we also found an inhibition of CFTR activity. The relative rate of iodide efflux was 2.02 ± 0.1 (n = 20), 1.64 ± 0.09 (n = 8), and only 1.43 ± 0.11 (n= 4) at 50, 100, and 200 μm, respectively. The magnitude of CFTR inhibition was 15, 48, and 65%, respectively. Because genistein activates CFTR at low concentrations but inhibits CFTR at high concentrations, the half-maximal concentrations for activation (K s) and inhibition (K i) cannot be determined by a classical analysis from the fit of the data. This phenomenon is reminiscent of an enzymatic process in which an inhibition by excess of substrate occurs, a process known as non-Michaelis-Menten behavior. In such a reaction, an enzyme and its substrate give an intermediate complex and the product. When a second molecule of substrate interacts with this complex, the new complex formed is inactive or partially inactive. From the study of Randak et al. (17Randak C. Auerswald E.A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reenstra W.W. Machleidt W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we learned that genistein binds to the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2) of CFTR. We thus hypothesized that the inhibition of CFTR with high concentrations of genistein could be due to the interaction of a second molecule of genistein with the complex formed by CFTR and genistein, as illustrated below in Reaction 1,35999r1 REACTION1In such a non-Michaelis-Menten reaction, for low concentrations of GST, the K s of the reaction is given by the Lineweaver-Burk representation (as shown in Equation 1), 1/R=f(1/[GST])Equation 1 The relative rate of efflux, designated as R, is considered equivalent to the velocity V of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, the intersection on thex axis of the dotted line (which represents the fit of first-order regression to the data) corresponds to −1/K s in the presence of forskolin (Fig.2 A) and in its absence (Fig. 2 B). From six separate experiments, we found K s = 3 ± 0.8 μm for GST + FSK and K s = 12 ± 1.5 μm in the absence of forskolin. Both values fit well with the graphs presented in Fig. 1 A and are significantly different (p < 0.001). The substrate inhibition constant (K i) represents the parameter for inhibition at high concentrations of genistein and is given by a modification of the Lineweaver-Burk representation (as shown in Equation 2), 1/R=f[GST]Equation 2 The intersection on the x axis of the dotted line indicates −K i, the reverse concentration of genistein that produced half-maximal inhibition. Fig.3 shows examples for such an analysis. We found K i values of 75 ± 3.2 μmand 70 ± 4.1 μm from six separate experiments with GST + FSK and six others with GST alone, respectively. In contrast to the K s values, these values forK i are not significantly different. Finally, dose-dependent relationships presented in Fig. 1 Awere analyzed using the new parameters K s andK i fitted with the following equation (Equation 3) that describes a non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics (18Biochem. J. 1983; 213 (Symbolism and Terminology in Enzyme Kinetics: Recommendation 1981): 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), V=V′[S]Ks+[S]+[S]2/KiEquation 3 V′ is the rate of iodide efflux, S is the concentration of genistein, and V is the new non-Michaelis-Menten velocity. Fig. 4presents the curves obtained with Equation 3 (to be compared with Fig.1 A). This demonstrates that the pharmacological behavior of CFTR activated by genistein fully follows a non-Michaelis-Menten function.Figure 3Determination of K i, the substrate inhibition constant for wt-CFTR channel activity.The intersection on the x axis of thedotted line gives −K i, the reverse concentration of genistein that produced half-maximal inhibition.

Kasch L.M. Rosenstein B.J. Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Antonarakis S.E. Kazazian H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We used CHO cells stably expressing G551D-CFTR to analyze the effect of genistein. We first determined the relative rateR of 125I efflux in experiments in which genistein was added in the absence of forskolin. The addition of up to 100 μm genistein failed to activate chloride transport in G551D-CFTR-expressing cells. We also noticed that up to 10 μm forskolin failed to stimulate G551D-CFTR channels (not shown). However, when we applied simultaneously 10 μmforskolin (to phosphorylate CFTR) and 30 μm genistein, the average efflux peak rate was dramatically increased to 2.8 ± 0.11 (n = 35) as compared with control (i.e.10 μm FSK:1.40 ± 0.17, n = 12,p < 0.001 or 30 μm GST:1.17 ± 0.13, n = 12, p < 0.001). To compare the effect of genistein on G551D-CFTR with our study with wt-CFTR cells, we generated dose-response relationships for genistein in the presence of 10 μm forskolin. Example traces from one experiment are shown in Fig.5 A. Surprisingly, at 50 and 400 μm genistein, the CFTR-mediated efflux was further increased rather than decreased with efflux rates of 3 and 4.1, respectively. Complete dose-response relationships for activation of G551D-CFTR using concentrations of genistein from 0.1 μmto 1000 μm were generated from six separate experiments. Results are presented in Fig. 5 B. Two important effects were obtained. First, a strong stimulation of channel activity occurs at low concentrations of genistein. Second, at concentrations that normally induced an inhibition of wt-CFTR (i.e. > 30 μm), genistein did not inhibit G551D-CFTR chloride channel activity. Moreover, the fit of the dose-response relationship presented in Fig. 5 B was obtained assuming a normal Michaelis-Menten behavior according to Equation 4 (18Biochem. J. 1983; 213 (Symbolism and Terminology in Enzyme Kinetics: Recommendation 1981): 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), R=Rmax[GST]/KM+[GST]Equation 4 which indicates a single apparent site.R max is the maximal rate of the reaction that occurs when [GST] ≫ K m. K mis the substrate concentration that gives half-maximal velocity. The kinetic parameters were determined assuming V equivalent to the relative rate R and Vmax corresponding toR max. The corresponding Lineweaver-Burk equation is presented in the inset of Fig. 5 B. Analysis of the dose-response relationship gives R max = 4 and K m = 11 ± 1.5 μm(n = 6). These results obtained from the analysis of six separate experiments with the mutated protein are in sharp contrast with those obtained for wt-CFTR (compare Fig. 5 B with Fig.1 A). Finally, whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed using cells first exposed to 10 μm forskolin and then to genistein (30 μm). As expected from our iodide efflux experiments, a large current, which was time- and voltage-independent, was stimulated only in cells treated with FSK + GST (Fig.6, A and B). The currents reversed at −40 mV, as shown in Fig. 6 D, a value close to the theoretical Cl− equilibrium potential imposed by our conditions (ECe− = −42 mV, see “Experimental Procedures”), confirming the chloride nature of the current (11Bulteau L. Dérand R. Mettey Y. Metaye T. Morris M.R. Mcneilly C.M. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Zegarra-Moran O. Pereira M.M. Jougla C. Dormer R.L. Vierfond J.M. Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J.

Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1657-C1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genistein-activated conductance had a current density of 16.42 ± 3.77 pA/picofarads (n= 15) and was statistically different from control conditions (1.92 ± 0.23, pA/picofarads, n = 17,p < 0.001) when measured at +40 mV (Fig.6 D). Several inhibitors were also used to further characterize G551D-CFTR chloride channel activity. Fig. 6,C–E, shows that in the presence of 100 μmglibenclamide, the activation of G551D-CFTR currents is abolished. A time course of the activation of CFTR current at +40mV is illustrated in Fig. 6 E. Interestingly, the outwardly rectifying chloride channel blocker calixarene (100 nm, see Ref. 10Schultz B.D. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S109-S144Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) has no effect on the currents, whereas a further addition of glibenclamide fully blocked the current. A summary of the effect of four different inhibitors on the rate of iodide efflux stimulated by FSK + GST is also presented in Fig. 6 F, showing the inhibition of G551D-CFTR channel activity by 100 μm glibenclamide and 250 μm DPC but not by 200 μm DIDS nor by 100 nm calixarene. We described here the mechanism of action and kinetic parameters of wt-CFTR chloride channel activated by genistein and the profound alteration resulting from the G551D mutation. This study reveals two important results: (i) a non-Michaelis-Menten behavior describes the pharmacological effect of genistein on wt-CFTR, suggesting the presence of one activatory site and one inhibitory site; (ii) the non-Michaelis-Menten behavior of wt-CFTR is absent and transformed into a classical Michaelis-Menten behavior by the CF mutation G551D. This demonstrates the presence of a single genistein binding site that is activatory and the loss of the inhibitory site. Thus, glycine at position 551 in the NBD1 domain of CFTR is an important location within the inhibitory binding site for genistein. The concentration-response curve for genistein on wt-CFTR is bell-shaped with an upper plateau that is not straight but tends to flex downwards at high concentrations. A bell-shaped response is referred to as non-Michaelis-Menten behavior, a common mechanism observed for a broad range of enzymes including protein-tyrosine phosphatase (19Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 4-α-carbinolamine dehydratase (20Johnen G. Kowlessur D. Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37770-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) associated with α1/β-receptor interaction. Originally, the observation of non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics was considered either as an experimental artifact or as the result of an overstimulation leading to desensitization of the receptor or enzyme. However, in 1994, Rovati and Nicosia (23Rovati G.E. Nicosia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated in a theoretical analysis that such a mechanism could be explained in terms of the resulting interaction of stimulatory and inhibitory components involving two binding sites, one being the activator while a second one is the inhibitor. Our results support a model with two binding sites for genistein on wt-CFTR but only one binding site on G551D-CFTR. Evidence for two mechanisms of genistein interactions was obtained previously in a study on wt-CFTR channels by Wang et al. (24Wang F. Zeltwanger S. Yang I.C. Nairn A.C. Hwang T.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and by Lansdellet al. (25Lansdell K.A. Cai Z. Kidd J.F. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 317-330Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), who observed an additional inhibitory effect with high concentrations of genistein. This was interpreted as the presence of a second, low affinity site that should reduce the opening rate of CFTR. In cardiac myocytes, genistein activates CFTR at 20 μm but inhibits its activity at 100 μm(26Obayashi K. Horie M. Washizuka T. Nishimoto T. Sasayama S. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the maximal stimulation of CFTR activity obtained by these authors was 35 μm genistein, in close agreement with our study. Moreover, in rat epididymal epithelium, genistein stimulated CFTR current with an EC50 of 10 μmin the absence of forskolin (27Leung G.P.H. Wong P.Y.D. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a value similar to that found here. In a recent study, Randak et al. (17Randak C. Auerswald E.A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reenstra W.W. Machleidt W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) demonstrated that genistein interacts with a fusion protein (comprising a maltose-binding protein and NBD2 of CFTR) by inhibiting ATPase hydrolysis at NBD2. Other studies have demonstrated that ATPase hydrolysis at NBD2 closes the channel (4Welsh M.J. Smith A.E.

A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, genistein most likely activates wt-CFTR at least in part through the inhibition of ATPase hydrolysis at NBD2 via an interaction with the high affinity site for genistein, which may be located in the vicinity of the ATP binding site at NBD2 of CFTR. We found that K s, the kinetic parameter for activation of wt-CFTR by genistein, depends on the phosphorylation status of CFTR. Indeed, with partially phosphorylated CFTR (i.e. with low concentrations of forskolin present),K s was 4-fold smaller (K s ≈ 3 μm) as compared with non-phosphorylation conditions (i.e. in the absence of forskolin) withK s ≈ 12 μm. Phosphorylation of CFTR may facilitate the accessibility of the high affinity binding site to genistein through domain interactions or conformation changes. On the contrary, at high concentrations of genistein, the inhibition of wt-CFTR appears to be independent of the phosphorylation status of CFTR since K i was unchanged (K i ≈ 70–75 μm with or without phosphorylation of CFTR). Thus, we hypothesize that phosphorylation of the R domain interacts only with the high affinity binding site for genistein (i.e. at NBD2) to increase the accessibility of the site. Indeed, one major difference concerning the phosphorylation process is that with G551D-CFTR, much higher concentrations of forskolin are required to achieve the stimulation by genistein of the CFTR channel activity. The G551D-CFTR protein is a class III mutation that produced a fully glycosylated protein correctly located at the apical membrane (i.e.normal biosynthesis, trafficking, and processing) and normally phosphorylated at the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (6Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, G551D proteins have decreased nucleotide binding (7Logan J.D. Hiestand D. Daram P. Huang Z. Muccio D.D. Hartman J. Haley B. Cook W.J. Sorscher E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and a reduced ATPase activity at NBD1 (8Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bears C.E.

Commun. 2000; 271: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutation G551D also disrupts activation and regulation of CFTR at the plasma membrane since phosphorylation alone is not able to achieve efficient stimulation of chloride transport in G551D cells (12Dérand R. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Mettey Y. Zegarra-Moran O. Howell L.D. Randak C. Galietta L.J. Cohn J.A. Norez C. Romio L. Vierfond J.M. Joffre M. Becq F. Am. J.

A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our study of the activity of G551D-CFTR mutant demonstrates that the inhibitory component of the dual mechanism of the action of genistein on wt-CFTR is lacking. Therefore, we propose that the inhibitory site of low affinity is located within a region of NBD1 close to glycine 551. The mutations affecting the NBD1 domain of CFTR generally lead to a severe form of the disease cystic fibrosis because they prevent the trafficking of CFTR to the membrane or because they generate abnormal CFTR chloride channel activity (31Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, our study reveals that the G551D mutation profoundly alters the pharmacological behavior of CFTR. The finding that CFTR activity in the presence of genistein obeys a non-Michaelis-Menten behavior indicates an alternative pathway to achieve functional desensitization of CFTR. For example, the cAMP accumulation in cultured mature brown adipocytes in response to the β-agonist isoprenaline could be explained by the authors as the result of two counteracting components (22Bronnikov G.E. Zhang S.J. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37770-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar): a β-adrenergic receptor stimulatory component and an α1-adrenergic receptor inhibitory component. Interestingly, the α-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin transforms the bell-shaped response into a simple Michaelis-Menten curve (22Bronnikov G.E. Zhang S.J. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37770-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In some enzymatic reactions, the change between Michaelis-Menten and non-Michaelis-Menten behaviors is referred to as “mechanism switching” (32Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8201-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have described here a similar effect with the class III CF mutation G551D and showed that it abolishes the inhibitory response to genistein. These results finally raised important questions such as the nature of the physiological element that may control the inhibition of CFTR. Because CFTR plays a key role in the cAMP-dependent secretory pathway in epithelia and controls a variety of other channels and transporters (14Gabsdy D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S78-S107Google Scholar, 31Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this inhibitory site maybe be crucial for the physiological desensitization of CFTR. In conclusion, our results show that the high affinity stimulatory site for genistein, located in NBD2, is dependent on the phosphorylation status of CFTR and preserved by G551D mutation. The second site is lacking in G551D-CFTR cells. This site, of low affinity for genistein, is an inhibitor in non-mutated CFTR. These data suggest that a Rovati/Nicosia model (non-Michaelis-Menten behavior (23Rovati G.E. Nicosia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) describes the kinetics of the control of CFTR channel activity by genistein. Finally, it shows that glycine at position 551 in NBD1 is an important location within the binding site for genistein. Thus, not only did class III CF mutations produced protein with defective regulation and opening, but they also altered the structure and pharmacological properties of CFTR. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time how a mutation of an ion channel converts a non-Michaelis-Menten behavior (two binding sites) into a classical Michaelis-Menten model (one binding site).

(2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 33711–33720. The interaction between the CHK SH2 domain and Tyr(P)1248 of the ErbB-2 receptor has been shown to be specific and critical for CHK function. In this report, we investigated whether the interaction of the CHK SH2 domain and ErbB-2 is directly related to the inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity. We constructed three CHK SH2 domain binding mutants: G129R (enhanced binding), R147K (inhibited binding), and R147A (disrupted binding). NMR spectra for the domains of each construct were used to evaluate their interaction with a Tyr(P)1248-containing ErbB-2 peptide. G129R showed enhanced binding to ErbB-2, whereas binding was completely disrupted by R147A. The enhanced binding mutant showed chemical shift changes at the same residues as wild-type CHK, indicating that this mutant has the same binding characteristics as the wild-type protein. Furthermore, inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity was markedly diminished by R147A, whereas G129R-mediated inhibition was stronger as compared with wild-type CHK. These results indicate that the specific interaction of CHK and ErbB-2 via the SH2 domain of CHK is directly related to the growth inhibitory effects of CHK. These new CHK high affinity binding constructs may serve as good candidates for inhibition of the ErbB-2/Src transduction pathway in gene therapy studies in breast cancer. Our previous studies demonstrated that Csk homologous kinase (CHK) acts as a negative growth regulator of human breast cancer through inhibition of ErbB-2/neu-mediated Src family kinase activity (Bougeret, C., Jiang, S., Keydar, I., and Avraham, H.

Src homology Csk homologous kinase glutathione S-transferase enhanced green fluorescent protein heteronuclear single quantum correlation The majority of breast carcinomas appear to be sporadic and have a complex accumulation of molecular and cellular abnormalities that constitute the malignant phenotype (1Borg A. Sigurdsson H. Clark G.M. Ferno M. Fuqua S.A. Olsson H. Killander D. McGurie W.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Newman B. Austin M.A. Lee M. King M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In many cases, the random onset of breast cancer correlates with overexpression of the ErbB-2/neu receptor and Src tyrosine kinase activity (3Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K. Nomura N. Miyajima N. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Nature. 1986; 319: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Downstream activation by the ErbB-2/neu receptor involves intracellular pathways mediated by Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ; however, the molecular mechanisms of these processes are poorly understood (5Menard S. Tagliabue E. Campiglio M. Pupa S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Src tyrosine kinase has been suggested to be a main downstream activator of the ErbB-2/neu receptor because the increased Src kinase activity observed in ErbB-2/neu-induced tumors results from the ability of the Src SH2 1 domain to interact directly with ErbB-2/neu in a phosphotyrosinedependent manner (6Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1801-1810PubMed Google Scholar, 7Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar). Once the ErbB-2/neu receptor is activated by heregulin, it undergoes autophosphorylation at five tyrosine residues located in its non-catalytic carboxyl terminus. The autophosphorylation of ErbB-2/neu can also be induced in the absence of any ligand by high level overexpression of ErbB-2/neu protein (8Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), as occurs in BT474 or MDA-MB-361 cells. 2R. Zagozdzon and H. Avraham, unpublished data. The autophosphorylated tyrosine residues provide docking sites for proteins to connect to intracellular pathways (9Ben-Levy R. Peles E. Goldman-Michael R. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17304-17313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3302-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The individual target and effect of each phosphotyrosine are not clear, but an add-back mutation study showed that autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues is involved in both the positive and negative effects on ErbB-2/neu-mediated transformation (11Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Tyr1248 of ErbB-2/neu, which is conserved between human and rodent ErbB-2/neu, has been suggested to be the most critical residue for the oncogenicity of the constitutively activated receptor (12Akiyama T. Matsuda S. Namba Y. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, the study of proteins that bind to Tyr(P)1248 of ErbB-2/neu is important in elucidating ErbB-2/neu-mediated signaling and function in cancer development. The Csk homologous kinase (CHK) protein comprises SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains. Its SH2 domain interacts with Tyr(P)1248 of the ErbB-2/neu receptor in a ligand- and receptor-specific manner (13Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CHK, like Csk, down-regulates Src kinase activity by phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus of Src-related enzymes in vitro. However, CHK has been suggested to play a specific role as a novel negative growth regulator of human breast cancer on the basis of the following observations. 1) Unlike Csk, which is ubiquitously expressed and cannot associate with ErbB-2, CHK is specifically expressed in primary breast cancer specimens, but not in normal breast tissues (13Zrihan-Licht S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1355-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 2) CHK binds directly to Tyr(P)1248 of the ErbB-2/neu receptor kinase upon heregulin stimulation and inhibits Src kinase activity (17Chow L.M. Jarvis C., Hu, Q. Nye S.H. Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4975-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence supports a role for CHK as a negative growth regulator of human breast cancer through inhibition of ErbB-2/neu-mediated Src family kinase activity. Overexpression of CHK in MCF-7 breast cancer cells markedly inhibits the cell growth, transformation, and invasion induced by heregulin and also causes a significant delay of cell entry into mitosis. Furthermore, the tumor growth of wild-type CHK-transfected MCF-7 cells in nude mice is significantly inhibited compared with that of non-transfected MCF-7 cells or cells transfected with kinase-dead CHK (18Davidson D. Chow L.M. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1355-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specific expression of CHK in breast cancer tissues and its inhibitory effect on cancer development strongly suggest the potential of the CHK protein as an anticancer drug and a target of gene therapy. Mechanism-based target identification and structure-based drug design are promising for the development of selective anticancer drugs that would replace conventional cancer chemotherapy and its associated cytotoxic side effects (19Gibbs J.B. Science. 2000; 287: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Precise biochemical and structural information on the CHK SH2 domain and the Tyr(P)1248containing peptide is necessary to develop CHK as a potential target of breast cancer therapy. We compared the primary sequence of the CHK SH2 domain with those of other SH2 domains (Fig.1). The structures of a number of other SH2 domains and their complexes with phosphopeptides derived from biological targets were studied by NMR and x-ray crystallography. All contain similar secondary structural elements (Fig. 1) (20Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 21Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J.

The structures reveal general Tyr(P)-binding sites as well as specificity-determining sites in the SH2 domains. Although the mode of recognition of the cognate phosphopeptides by two types of SH2 domains is different (see “Discussion”), the geometry of the Tyr(P)-binding pocket within each SH2 domain is conserved in the SH2 domain family (23Kay L.E. Muhandiram D.R. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SH2 domains display positively charged pockets lined with consensus basic residues of Arg (αA1), Arg (βB5), His (βD4), and Lys/Arg (βD6) (Fig. 1). Extensive interactions have been identified between the sequence C-terminal to Tyr(P) of the peptide and several residues in the βD strand, the βD-αB loop, and the αB-βE loop, which play a regulatory role in the specific binding. We constructed three CHK SH2 domain binding mutants in αA and βB to test the biological significance of their binding in growth inhibitory function. We also performed NMR experiments to identify, in the CHK SH2 domain, the binding sites for a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide derived from ErbB-2. CHK has been suggested to have a specific role in breast cancer and to be a potential target for breast cancer drug development. Mutation of residues to confer modified binding to Tyr(P)1248 of ErbB-2/neu will elicit functional insights into the binding of CHK to this receptor. Recombinant heregulin-β1 (amino acids 177–244) was obtained from Genentech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Anti-phospho-HER2/ErbB-2 (Tyr1248) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. The primers for PCR were purchased from Integrated DNA Tech. ECL reagents were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Three different breast cancer cell lines with various levels of ErbB-2/neu protein expression were used: MCF-7 (normal level expression), T47D (moderate level overexpression), and BT474 (high level overexpression). All three cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 3.5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Prior to stimulation with heregulin, cells were starved overnight in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium. A peptide containing Tyr(P)1248 of ErbB-2, ENPEpYLGLDV, was synthesized using solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based peptide synthesis with an acetylated N terminus and amidated C terminus (Tufts Core Facility, Boston, MA). All peptides were purified by C18 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and identities were confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy. The CHK SH2 domain constructs (residues 116–217: G129R, R147A, R147K, and wild-type) were subcloned into the pGEX2T vector using the restriction endonuclease sites BamHI and EcoRI. Point mutations were generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants were verified by sequencing. At least three independently generated mutants were tested for each construct. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused CHK SH2 domains were expressed in bacteria (BL21(DE3) cells) and purified following published procedures (13Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X.

Approximately 10 mg of protein from all constructs were purified from 1-liter cultures in rich medium (LB medium) and 5 mg from culture in minimal medium. To investigate the effects of the generated mutants in breast cancer cells, the same mutations were generated in the full-length form of the CHK gene originating from previously described pcDNA3-based constructs (19Gibbs J.B. Science. 2000; 287: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 20Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M.

The generation and characterization of a CHK mutant lacking kinase activity were described in detail previously (15Bougeret C. Jiang S. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33711-33720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All studied forms of the CHK gene were cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH). Expression of wild-type as well as mutant CHK proteins was assessed by transient transfection of 293T cells and by Western blot analysis. T47D or BT474 cells (∼5 × 106 cells/plate) were starved overnight in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, followed by additional starvation in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The starved T47D or BT474 cells were then stimulated with 20 nmheregulin for 8 min at room temperature. The stimulation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min) and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Next, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. SDS buffer was then added, and samples were analyzed on an SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-PM membranes (Millipore Corp.), and bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-HER2/ErbB-2 (Tyr1248) antibody. The blots were developed using the ECL system. 15N,13C-Double-labeled protein samples or 15N-labeled samples were obtained by growing the transformed bacteria in minimal medium containing15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose or15NH4Cl and unlabeled glucose as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively (22Xu W.

Protein was purified following the same procedures as described above, except that the purified proteins were concentrated using Centricon centrifugation filtration units (Millipore Corp.) with a M r3000 cutoff. The purified proteins were then exchanged into the final NMR sample buffer containing 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmperdeuterated dithiothreitol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA). Optimal conditions were predetermined using microdialysis against a variety of buffers (25Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Klevit R.E.

NMR experiments were performed on Bruker AMX 500-MHz and Avance 600-MHz spectrometers. Titration of the protein with the dissolved peptide (in the same buffer) was monitored by changes in 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra collected at peptide/protein molar ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.85, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 2.0. Dissociation constants (K d) of peptide binding were determined by analyzing the titration data assuming fast exchange and by using CRVFIT (a nonlinear least-squares fitting program obtained from R. Boyko and B. D. Sykes). For backbone assignment of the protein, triple resonance experiments, including HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and HN(CO)CACB (27Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 28Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), were performed and 15N-separated three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect correlation and total correlation spectra were recorded. The data were processed and analyzed using FELIX 98 (Accelyrs, Inc.). For this experiment, MCF-7 cells were chosen because of their overexpression of Src kinase. The cells were grown on 100-mm Petri dishes until 80% confluent and then transfected with 10 μg of various CHK-pIRES2-EGFP constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were starved overnight in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, followed by additional starvation in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The starved MCF-7 cells were then stimulated with 20 nmheregulin for 8 min at room temperature, and total protein extracts were prepared as described above. One milligram of protein was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, 0.25 mg/ml poly(Glu/Tyr) (4:1; Sigma) as an exogenous kinase substrate, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 10 min. Subsequently, the samples were resolved on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The labeled poly(Glu/Tyr) was excised from the gel, and radioactivity was counted. Two arginine residues are conserved in the Tyr(P)-binding pocket. Alignment of the CHK SH2 domain with other SH2 domain sequences shows that whereas the arginine in βB5 is present in these SH2 sequences, the αA2 CHK SH2 domain has a glycine. This arginine in the binding pocket of other SH2 domains provides a positive charge to coordinate the phosphate of Tyr(P), implying either a different mode of binding or weak binding for CHK. Arg147 in βB is a critical residue for Tyr(P) binding and is strictly conserved in SH2 domains (23Kay L.E. Muhandiram D.R. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we constructed three CHK SH2 domain mutants: G129R, R147A, and R147K. The G129R mutant encodes a CHK SH2 domain protein in which the αA2 glycine at the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket has been replaced by arginine. For the R147A and R147K mutants, the βB5 arginine has been replaced by alanine and lysine, respectively. Our hypothesis is that G129R will have enhanced ErbB-2 phosphopeptide binding, R147A will have disrupted binding, and R147K will have reduced binding. We conducted binding studies with the three CHK SH2 domain mutants as well as with wild-type CHK (Fig.2). Two different breast cancer cell lines, T47D (moderate level of ErbB-2/neu expression) and BT474 (high level of expression), were tested. The conserved tyrosine residues of overexpressed ErbB-2/neu in BT474 cells were found to be autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand stimulation. The cells were serum-starved as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then activated with heregulin (20 nm) for 8 min. Unstimulated and stimulated cells were lysed and precipitated with GST-CHK SH2 fusion proteins as well as with GST protein alone. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-HER2/ErbB-2 (Tyr1248) antibody. In comparison with wild-type CHK, the substitution of Gly129 with Arg129 resulted in dramatically increased binding in both cell lines. In T47D cells (Fig. 2 A), only heregulin stimulation induced the association of ErbB-2 with the purified wild-type SH2 domain and also G129R, indicating that G129R binding is ligand-stimulated to a similar level compared with wild-type binding. The substitution of Arg147 with Lys147 slightly decreased binding, whereas the substitution with Ala147completely disrupted binding. These results indicate that the positive charge of Arg147 is critical for phosphopeptide binding and that the length of the side chain has a moderate effect on binding. Because the R147K mutant showed only a moderate effect on binding in comparison with the wild-type SH2 domain, the R147K mutant was not analyzed in further experiments. In BT474 cells, no ligand stimulation was necessary for the CHK SH2 domain interaction with the constitutively phosphorylated ErbB-2/neu protein (Fig. 2 B). Again, almost no association of R147A with ErbB-2/neu was seen, whereas G129R pulled down markedly more ErbB-2 protein than did the wild-type CHK SH2 domain. The backbone atoms of the CHK SH2 domain were assigned using triple resonance experiments (Fig.3 A). NMR, which is a method used to determine the high resolution structure of macromolecules, is particularly valuable in providing rapid identification of a ligand-binding site. The 15N-1H HSQC experiment yields a well resolved spectrum, with single peaks for the backbone amides of most residues in the protein (25Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2624-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Changes in the positions of these peaks upon titration of the ligand can identify the residues in the binding site, and analysis of the titration data can be used to determine the kinetics of binding (24Kim S. Cullis D.N. Feig L.A. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6776-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To analyze the interaction between CHK SH2 domain constructs and the phosphopeptide, we titrated the peptide into 0.6 mm15N-labeled SH2 domains. Progressive changes in1H and 15N chemical shifts were monitored with a series of 15N HSQC spectra. Significant chemical shift changes in the wild-type SH2 domain were observed for several residues in the αA, βB, and βD secondary structures as well as in the βD-αB and αB-βE loops (Fig. 3 A), which have been implicated in the binding of other SH2 domains to phosphopeptides (26Matsuo H. Kupce E., Li, H. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 113: 190-194Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, several positive residues in βD (His168and Arg170) undergo large chemical shift changes upon complex formation, consistent with the positive charged residues in these secondary structural elements forming contacts with Tyr(P) of the ligand. In the αA helix, several residues changed chemical shifts upon complex formation (Ile127, Gly129, Gln134, and Gln135). The βB-βC loop has also been implicated in the binding of the peptide, and significant chemical shift changes were observed for residues in this loop (Ser149, Arg151, and Gly154). Interestingly, Arg147 showed little change in chemical shift despite its presumed role in contacting the phosphate of the ligand. Significant chemical shift changes were also observed in residues in βD (Tyr169, Val171, and Leu172), the βD-αB loop (Ile180 and Asp181), and the αB-βE loop (Ile203), which presumably form the hydrophobic environment for the hydrophobic residues of the C terminus to the Tyr(P) region of the peptide (see Fig. 5). G129R, which showed enhanced binding, was also titrated with the phosphopeptide (Fig. 3 B). The Gly129 resonance was replaced with a new resonance (Arg129), consistent with the substitution of glycine with arginine and the expected changes in chemical shift (27Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Several residues showed chemical shift changes upon mutation. In particular, residues in αA (Ile127, Glu131, Ala132, and Gln134) experienced chemical shift changes (0.3 ± 0.1 ppm) presumably due to introduction of the long charged side chain of Arg. Several residues in βB and βD also showed chemical shift changes, suggesting that they are in proximity to the G129R mutation site. Upon titration with peptide, residues similar to the wild-type residues underwent significant chemical shift changes, except for residues near the mutation site in αA and βB (TableI).Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants and chemical shift changes of the wild-type SH2 domain and G129RResidue1-aThese residues were selected because they were well resolved during peptide titration.

https://openalex.org/W2078475359,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is an important hypophysiotrophic factor as well as a regulator for immune, reproductive, and neural tissues. We recently found that TTF-1, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for the development of the fetal diencephalon, is postnatally expressed in the hypothalamic area and plays a transcription regulatory role for certain neurohormones. Based on the similarity of synthesis sites between PACAP and TTF-1 and, moreover, on the presence of conserved core TTF-1 binding motifs in the 5′-flanking region of the PACAP gene, we sought to uncover a regulatory role of TTF-1 in PACAP gene transcription. The TTF-1 homeodomain binds to six of the seven putative binding domains observed in the 5′-flanking region of the PACAP gene. In the C6 glioma cell-line, TTF-1 activates the PACAP promoter in a dose-dependent manner. This transactivation of PACAP by TTF-1 was totally removed when the core TTF-1 binding motif at −369 was deleted. RNase protection assays showed that TTF-1 and PACAP mRNAs have daily fluctuations in the rat hypothalamus. They both were at low levels during the day and high levels during the night. Intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense TTF-1 oligodeoxynucleotide significantly decreased the PACAP mRNA level as well as TTF-1 protein content in the rat hypothalamus, suggesting that TTF-1 also regulates PACAP transcription in vivo. Moreover, the TTF-1 promoter was inhibited by molecular oscillators of CLOCK and BMAL-1. Taken together, these data suggest that TTF-1 plays an important regulatory role in the gene transcription for PACAP, which may be important for the generation of a daily rhythm of hypothalamic PACAP gene expression.

Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). PACAP plays the role of a hypophysiotropic factor and regulates the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones through the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal system (3Rawlings S. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar). Although PACAP immunoreactivity is found in nearly all brain regions, its highest concentration is in the hypothalamus of both rat and human (3Rawlings S. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar, 4Arimura A. Shioda S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the hypothalamus, PACAP immunoreactivity is primarily localized to the cells of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (3Rawlings S. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar, 4Arimura A. Shioda S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PACAP is found both in neurons terminating on hypophysial blood vessels of the median eminence as well as in neurons projecting to the posterior pituitary. Therefore, PACAP may act not only as a hypophysiotropic factor regulating anterior pituitary hormone release but as a posterior pituitary hormone as well. It is also an important factor in the regulation of peripheral tissues such as ovary and testis and of the immune system. Recently, the 5′-flanking region of PACAP gene was characterized and shown to have several sequence motifs homologous to the cAMP response element (CRE), the TPA response element (TRE), and the growth hormone factor-1 (GHF-1) binding sites (5Hosoya M. Kimura C. Ogi K. Ohkubo S. Miyamoto Y. Kugoh H. Shimizu M. Onda H. Oshimura M. Arimura A. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys.

Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, no clear evidence has yet been reported regarding the regulation of PACAP gene expression via its specific transcription factor(s). We searched the recently published 5′-flanking sequence of the rat PACAP gene (7Park J.-I. Kim W.-J. Wang L. Park H.-J. Lee J. Park J.-H. Kwon H.-B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.-Y. Mol. Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and discovered several putative transcription factors that could bind to the PACAP promoter, meeting the criteria for core motifs that bind to transcription factors. One of these putative transacting regulatory factors, whose expression sites overlap the synthesis site of PACAP, was TTF-1, a thyroid-specific transcription factor (4Arimura A. Shioda S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 8Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Guazzi S. Price M., De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.-G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and is expressed in the embryonic diencephalon and lung (12Lazzaro D. Price M., De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the brains of mice carrying a null mutation of the TTF-1 gene, extensive abnormalities were found in the ventral region of the forebrain from the septal area to the mamillary body of the hypothalamus (13Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In the preoptic and hypothalamic area, abnormalities were extensively demonstrated in the ventral and medial regions and, to a lesser extent, in the dorsal and lateral regions. The ventral hypothalamic area, as mentioned above, was particularly abnormal, suggesting that TTF-1 plays an important role in the formation of this area. Recently, we and other investigators reported that TTF-1 is also expressed in the postnatal rat hypothalamus (8Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol.

Brain Res. 2001; 130: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Specifically, TTF-1 and PACAP mRNA are colocalized in the same preoptic areas (POA), such as the organum vasculosum lamina terminals and the periventricular nucleus, and the medial basal hypothalamic areas, such as the ventromedial nucleus (4Arimura A. Shioda S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar,8Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell.

Based on the similar localization in certain nuclei of hypothalamus as well as the presence of high affinity core TTF-1 binding motifs (5′-CAAG-3′ or 5′-CTTC-3′ (14Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) in the 5′-flanking region of the PACAP gene, we proposed the present study to examine a regulatory role of TTF-1 in PACAP gene expression. In the present study, we found that (a) TTF-1 regulates PACAP transcription via binding to its binding motifs in the 5′-flanking sequence of PACAP gene and (b) hypothalamic PACAP mRNA levels show daily changes during a normal day-night cycle, which coincides with the daily changes of TTF-1 mRNA levels during the same time period. To ascertain the transcription initiation site of the PACAP gene, primer extension of mRNA samples from the rat brain was employed. A 33-base oligonucleotide primer (5′-CCTTCTCTGCTCCGAGGTCTCAGGCTGAGTCTG-3′), complementary to the nucleotides within exon 1A of the rat PACAP gene (7Park J.-I. Kim W.-J. Wang L. Park H.-J. Lee J. Park J.-H. Kwon H.-B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.-Y. Mol. Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Ten micrograms of rat brain total RNA were hybridized with the radiolabeled primer in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.4), 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50% formamide) at 65 °C for 90 min. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, the hybridized mRNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The extended cDNA products were extracted and separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The length of the formed products was determined by comparing them with sequencing reactions carried out on genomic clones using the same primer in parallel. The procedure for expression and purification of the TTF-1 homeodomain (TTF-1HD) has already been described (15Damante G. Pellizzari L. Esposito R. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Fabbro D. Tell G. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, labeled at the 5′-end terminal with 32P, were used as probes for the EMSA. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used are shown below in Table I. Oligonucleotides C and Cβ were used as a positive and negative control, respectively (16Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed by incubating, for 30 min at room temperature, proteins and DNA in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 75 mm KCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 12.5 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 10% glycerol; TTF-1HD was used at 75 and 150 nm with oligonucleotides at 5 mm. Protein-bound and free DNA were separated on a native 7.5% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× TBE for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Gels were fixed and exposed to phosphorimaging analysis (Bio-Rad, GS525); signals corresponding to the protein-bound and free DNA were quantitated by using Multi-analyst software. Binding of TTF-1HD to oligonucleotides of the PACAP promoter was expressed as a percentage of the TTF-1HD binding to oligonucleotide C.Table IEMSA oligonucleotide probesLocation in the 5′-flanking region of PACAP geneProbe sequencesC5′-CACTGCCCAGTCAAGTGTTCTTGA-3′Cβ5′-CACTGCCCAGTCACGCGTTCTTGA-3′−13185′-CTATTTCTCCTTGAAAAGAAG-3′−13035′-GGCTCTCAAGATCTCTTAAATG-3′−5395′-CATACGCAAGGAATTACG-3′−4945′-GGAGAGCTTGATGGTGC-3′−3695′-GTTCTTTACTTGTCTTTGTG-3′−2205′-GTTAATATGTTCCTTGAGGGAC-3′−1005′-CAAAATATTCTGTACTTGAAGGC-3′Each sequence represents the sense strand of probes; core TTF-1 binding motifs are underlined.

The rat PACAP promoter, luciferase reporter (pGL3-basic) vector was previously described (7Park J.-I. Kim W.-J. Wang L. Park H.-J. Lee J. Park J.-H. Kwon H.-B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.-Y. Mol. Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Serial deletion from this promoter was produced with restriction enzymes that cut uniquely in the promoter at the 5′-end (PstI for −1007, BxtI for −708, XbaI for −481, andAatII for −199) and with SpeI of the vector's multicloning site at the 3′-end. These truncated promoters were inserted into the pGL3-basic vector at each corresponding restriction enzyme site within the multicloning site. Promoter constructs containing more detailed deletions between −481 and −199 were generated by PCR reactions with specific primer sets corresponding to the −414, −384, −314, and −267 bp of promoter sequences at the 5′-end and with a specific primer for a SpeI site in the multicloning site of the pGL-3-basic vector at the 3′-end. Site-specific deletions of core binding motifs for TTF-1 were created with two rounds of PCR. The first round was performed to generate upstream fragments before the core binding motifs, with an RV3 primer in the pGL3-basic vector and a specific primer placed upstream of each core motif. Downstream fragments of the core motifs were amplified with a specific primer placed downstream and the GL2 primer placed in the pGL3-basic vector. The second round of PCR was performed with a specific nested primer set inside the span between RV3 and GL2 to link the upstream and downstream fragments. These deletion mutants were cloned into the pGL-3-basic vector. C6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum; NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter, 25 mm), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PACAP promoter analysis employed the C6 cells. Twenty-four hours after seeding the cells in six-well plates, they were transiently transfected with a PACAP promoter, luciferase-reporter construct (PACAP-pGL3), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) along with different concentrations (100–400 ng/ml) of the TTF-1 expression vector (TTF-1-pcDNA zeo). A TTF-1 promoter, luciferase-reporter vector (TTF-1-pGL2) was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with expression vectors containing CLOCK (CLOCK-pcDNA zeo) and BMAL1 (BMAL1-pcDNA zeo). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting the plasmid pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH) at 20 ng/ml. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant at 800 ng/ml by adding the appropriate amount of pcDNA zeo to each well. The transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as reported (8Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the SEAP activity assay, medium from cells transfected with the PACAP-promoter-SEAP reporter vector (PACAP-SEAP) was collected 48 h after transfection at 3-h intervals for 24 h. Chemiluminescence detection of SEAP activity was performed according to the manufacturer (CLONTECH) using Hyper-Film β-Max (Amersham Biosciences) exposed to the base of a 96-well plate. Two-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Daehan Animal Breeding Co., Chungwon, Chungbuk, South Korea) were used in this study. They were housed in a room with a conditioned photoperiod (12-h light/12-h darkness, lights on from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and temperature (23–25 °C) just after arrival and allowed ad libitum access to tap water and pelleted rat chow. Animals were sacrificed at 3-h intervals for 1 day, their brains were removed, and the hypothalamus, including the POA and medial basal hypothalamus, was collected from each rat. The tissues were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at −85 °C until RNA isolation. RPA was used to determine the daily change in TTF-1 and PACAP mRNA levels in the hypothalamus. Total RNA was isolated as reported previously (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar); the RPA employed has been described in detail (18Kim M.S., Ha, C.M. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Protocols. 2001; 7: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); and the preparation of antisense RNA probes for TTF-1, PACAP, and cyclophilin (Cyclo, the internal control) were done following a described procedure (8Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Choi E.J., Ha, C.M. Kim M.S. Kang J.H.

RNA samples (5 μg/tube) or different amounts of in vitro synthesized TTF-1 and PACAP sense mRNA (0.03–2 pg/tube) were hybridized to 500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled TTF-1 and PACAP cRNA probes, respectively, for 18–20 h at 45 °C. The tissue RNA samples were simultaneously hybridized to a Cyclo cRNA probe (5,000 cpm/tube) to correct for procedural losses (18Kim M.S., Ha, C.M. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Protocols. 2001; 7: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At the end of the hybridization, the samples were treated with ribonucleases A and T1 to digest unhybridized RNA species. The protected cRNA fragments were separated on a polyacrylamide-urea gel (5% acrylamide, 7 murea), and the hybridization signals were detected by exposure of the dried gels to X-Omat x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the signals obtained was quantified as reported (18Kim M.S., Ha, C.M. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Protocols. 2001; 7: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), using an edited version of the National Institutes of Health IMAGE program (21Correa-Rotter R. Mariash C.N. Rosenberg M.E. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the inhibitory effect of TTF-1 synthesis on PACAP mRNA levels, phosphorothioate AS TTF-1 ODN was delivered to the ventral region of the third ventricle, and PACAP mRNA levels were determined. Our AS TTF-1 ODN was designed to have the AS sequence against 24 bases that included the translation initiation site based on sequence data (GenBankTM accession number X53858): AS TTF-1 ODN, 5′-GAC TCA TCG ACA TGA TTC GGC GTC-3′. As a control, a scrambled (SCR) sequence of AS TTF-1 ODN was used: SCR ODN, 5′-AGT CCT ACT CGG TAC GTA TGC AGC-3′. This sequence does not bear similarities with any eukaryotic sequence thus far deposited in the NCBI GenBankTM. For the intracerebroventricular injection, the ODNs were diluted to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in millimolar, 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.24 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.3, and bubbled with 95% O2:5% CO2). The details for intracerebroventricular administration of ODNs were already described (20Ha C.M. Kang J.H. Choi E.J. Kim M.S. Park J.-W. Kim Y. Choi W.S. Chun S.Y. Kwon H.B. Lee B.J. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After a week of recovery, the inner stylet was removed and the ODNs (2 nmol in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) were intracerebroventricularly injected with a Hamilton syringe once a day for 2 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed at 12:00 midnight (5 h after lights off) on the day following the second ODN administration. Total RNA from most animals or nuclear proteins from some animals were extracted from the hypothalamus. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (22Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), using the mixture of protease inhibitors recommended by Kuhnet al. (23Kuhn R. Monuki E.S. Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4642-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Electrophoretically separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose paper at 40 mA for 16 h using a transfer buffer of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3. The nitrocellulose paper was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with a TTF-1 antibody (Neomaker) for 2 h, bound antibody was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplied protocol. The membranes were exposed to the x-ray film for 3 min in the dark. Changes in TTF-1 and PACAP mRNA levels and SEAP-assay data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls multiple comparison test for unequal replications. Changes observed between two groups were analyzed by Student's t test. To identify the transcriptional start site of the rat PACAP gene, we performed the primer extension procedure using mRNA from rat hypothalamus. Primer extension showed a single transcriptional start site of the rat PACAP gene located upstream of the translation initiation site (Figs.1 and 2). Primer extension with the rat hypothalamic mRNA terminated at the G according to a concomitant sequence analysis, whereas no specific reaction was observed with mRNA from a plant (Fig. 1). Utilizing this result, a single transcriptional start site was mapped at −61 bp, which is also indicated in Fig. 2.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat PACAP gene. Nucleotides are numbered by assigning position +1 to the translational start site. Previously reported potential regulatory elements (PRE, TRE, GHF-1, and CRE) are indicated with boxes, and the putative TTF-1 binding motifs areunderlined. Binding domains for GATA-1 and F2F are indicated, based on sequence analysis (GenBankTM accession number AF163322).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To find possible TTF-1 binding motifs in the 5′-flanking region of the rat PACAP gene, the sequence deposited in the NCBI GenBankTM data base by us (Ref. 7Park J.-I. Kim W.-J. Wang L. Park H.-J. Lee J. Park J.-H. Kwon H.-B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.-Y. Mol. Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; accession numberAF163322) was analyzed again with the aid of a search program (available at www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/). The 5′-flanking sequence of the rat PACAP gene contains several consensus motifs involved in transcriptional control (Fig. 2): two CRE, a TRE, three GHF-1, and one GATA-1 binding sites. Two binding sites for F2F, which is believed to be a transcriptional repressor (24Jackson S.M. Keech C.A. Williamson D.J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2708-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were also observed. A consensus progesterone receptor binding site (PRE) was also identified at the distal region of the 5′-flanking region. The transcriptional start site is indicated in the sequence as described above. A TATA-like sequence reported previously (6Yamamoto K. Hashimoto H. Hagihara N. Nishino A. Fujita T. Matsuda T. Baba A. Gene. 1998; 211: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Park J.-I. Kim W.-J. Wang L. Park H.-J. Lee J. Park J.-H. Kwon H.-B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.-Y. Mol. Human Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is not the functional TATA box, because it is located downstream of the transcription initiation site. The PACAP promoter has seven putative TTF-1 binding domains, based on the sequence identity with reported conserved motifs of TTF-1 binding domains (14Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two of them are located in the distal promoter region (−1318 and −1303), and the remaining motifs lie at the proximal region. Five of the putative core motifs are 5′-CTTG-3′, and two are 5′-CAAG-3′. EMSAs were performed to examine TTF-1HD binding to the putative TTF-1 binding domains utilizing double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes (Table I), which contain the sequence of the putative TTF-1 binding motifs in the 5′-flanking region of rat PACAP gene, as shown in Fig. 2. Of the seven putative binding motifs, six were recognized by TTF-1HD (Fig.3). Probes at −100, −1303, and −1318 showed relatively strong binding signals, over 50% than that of the positive control of oligonucleotide C, whereas probes at −220, −369, and −494 revealed weak signals. The probe at −539 did not generate a positive signal; therefore, it is not a TTF-1 binding site. Increasing TTF-1HD concentration for EMSA reactions resulted in increased signals for all six probes that had displayed positive signals. Transcriptional activation of the PACAP gene by TTF-1 was assessed by functional promoter analysis in C6 glioma cells. Cotransfection with different concentrations of a TTF-1 expression vector resulted in an increase in transactivation of the PACAP promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). Serial deletion of the PACAP promoter did or did not affect its transactivation by TTF-1 as follows: Deletion of −1474 to −1007, which contains two TTF-1 binding motifs at −1318 and −1303, did not affect promoter activity transactivated by TTF-1. Deletion up to −708 resulted in an increase in transactivation of the promoter by TTF-1, suggesting the sequence between −1007 and −708, which does not have a core TTF-1 binding motif, may, therefore, contain one or more binding sites for one or more repressor molecules. The transactivation by TTF-1 in the promoter with a deletion of up to −481 was clearly reduced compared with the promoter with −708 and similar to that of the promoter with −1474 and −1007, however, a transactivation effect of TTF-1 was still active. Therefore, there may be TTF-1 transactivational binding site(s) between −708 and −481 in addition to the essential TTF-1 binding sites at the more proximal region of the PACAP promoter. This region contains one core binding motif at −494 (Figs. 2 and 3). A deletion reaching to −199 resulted in a loss of PACAP transactivation by TTF-1, therefore, this promoter region has basic essential TTF-1 transactivation motifs; this region has two TTF-1 binding core motifs at −369 and −220 (Figs. 2 and 3). Further deletions between −481 to −199 revealed the essential promoter sequence for the transactivation of PACAP gene by TTF-1 (Fig.4 B). A deletion between −384 to −314 completely abolished TTF-1 transactivation of the PACAP promoter. There is a TTF-1 binding motif at −369 (CTTG), therefore, this sequence seems to be basically critical for TTF-1 transactivation of the PACAP promoter. Based on the described promoter assay, the sequence placed at −369 appears to be critical for basic transactivation of PACAP by TTF-1, although it showed a very weak binding affinity with TTF-1HD compared with others (Fig. 3). To confirm that this site is essential for the PACAP transactivation by TTF-1, six core motifs (including −369) were site-specifically deleted, and promoter analyses were performed with these mutated PACAP promoters. TTF-1-dependent transactivation of the PACAP promoter completely disappeared without the core motif at −369 (Fig."

Because NF-κB regulates the expression of many inflammatory mediators, such as RANTES, we utilized CD40-mediated induction of RANTES expression to investigate the mechanisms that underlie CD40-mediated activation of NF-κB in AEC. Results demonstrate that, in AEC, intact NF-κB sites were required for CD40-mediated activation of the RANTES promoter. To examine activation of NF-κB binding directly, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed. These analyses revealed that CD40 ligation stimulated NF-κB binding and that the activated NF-κB complexes were composed of p65 subunits. Additional studies focused on the CD40-triggered signaling pathways that facilitate NF-κB activation. Findings show that CD40 engagement activated the IκB kinases IKK-α and IKK-β and stimulated IκBα phosphorylation. Analyses also examined the role of tumor necrosis factor-associated factor (TRAF) molecules in CD40-mediated NF-κB activation within AEC. Stable transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant forms of the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 suggested that TRAF3, but not TRAF2, binding was essential for CD40-mediated RANTES expression. Further studies indicated that exogenous expression of wild-type TRAF3 enhanced activation of the RANTES promoter, whereas exogenous expression of wild-type TRAF2 inhibited this activation; TRAF3-mediated enhancement was dependent upon NF-κB. Together, these findings suggest that, in AEC, ligation of CD40 regulates the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as RANTES, via activation of NF-κB. Moreover, these results suggest that CD40-mediated signaling in AEC differs with previously reported findings observed in other cell models, such as B lymphocytes.

First, epithelial cells serve as barrier cells that protect the lung from the external environment. To this end, airway epithelial cells respond to a variety of environmental stimuli resulting in the alteration of their cellular actions such as ion transport and movement of airway secretions. Second, airway epithelial cells function as immune effector cells in response to noxious endogenous or exogenous stimuli. Growing evidence demonstrates that airway epithelial cells express and secrete a variety of immune molecules that modulate immune responses within the lung. The array of immune molecules expressed by airway epithelial cells includes adhesion molecules and a variety of cytokines, including the chemokine RANTES1 (1Schwiebert L.M. Stellato C. Schleimer R.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: S16-S19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through the production of these molecules, the epithelium is now considered important in the initiation and exacerbation of airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. CD40 is a member of the TNFR family, which includes TNFRI (p55), TNFRII (p75), CD30, Fas, and low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (for review see Refs. 2Gruss H.J. Int. J. Clin. Lab.

Distribution of CD40 expression includes a wide variety of cell types including B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells (4Lazaar A.L.

CD40 and its natural ligand, CD40L, play a central role in the regulation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity (8Clark L.B. Foy T.M. Noelle R.J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 63: 43-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type and the local microenvironment, protein-protein interactions between CD40 and CD40L may modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, isotype switching, and inflammatory mediator production (9Van Cooten C. Banchereau J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 1-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the TNFR family, including CD40, display homology in their extracellular ligand-binding domains, which are composed of tandemly repeated cysteine-rich modules. The interactions of these modules create a three-dimensional structure that provides ligand specificity (reviewed in Ref. 10Bear C. Duguay F. Naismith A.L. Kartner N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19142-19145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the TNF ligand family trimerize, thereby allowing their cognate receptors to aggregate upon binding; this receptor aggregation, in turn, activates signal transduction cascades that facilitate the CD40-mediated actions listed above. Like other TNFR family members, the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity; however, this domain associates with “signaling adapter proteins” termed TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs). To date, six different TRAF molecules (TRAF1–TRAF6) have been identified. Several studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 associates with TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 (11Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

In contrast, a separate study reported that B cells expressing a mutant form of CD40 that was able to bind TRAF2, but not TRAF6, stimulated NF-κB activation upon CD40 engagement (17Jalukar S.V. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, other reports demonstrated that mice lacking functional TRAF2 molecules were able to activate NF-κB in response to CD40- and TNF-mediated signals (15Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D.

Together, such conflicting results suggest that TRAF molecules exhibit cell type specificity with regard to NF-κB activation. Recently, we described CD40 expression on airway epithelial cells and demonstrated that CD40 engagement on these cells stimulated the expression of inflammatory mediators, including the chemokine RANTES (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The studies presented here extend these original findings by examining the signaling mechanisms that underlie CD40-mediated inflammatory mediator expression. Specifically, these studies examined CD40-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB within airway epithelial cells. Presently, information regarding CD40 signaling is based primarily on studies performed with B cells (14Kuhné M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T. Gigley J.P. Noelle R.J.

The results presented here suggest that CD40 ligation in airway epithelial cells triggers the activation of NF-κB through a signaling pathway that involves the IκB kinases IKKα and IKKβ, IκBα phosphorylation, and TRAF3. Experiments employed the human airway epithelial cell lines 9HTEo− (tracheal; a gift from Dr. Dieter Gruenert, University of California, San Francisco) (23Gruenert D.C. Basbaum C.B.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment and on Vitrogen 100 (Cohesion, Inc., Palo Alto, CA)-coated flasks (Vitrogen 100 contains collagen types I and IV). For analysis of CD40 mutant molecules, the human colon carcinoma epithelial cell line HT-29 (25Noguchi P. In Vitro. 1979; 15: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (ATCC) was employed.

For analysis of RANTES mRNA expression, total RNA was isolated from cells treated with and without soluble CD40L (sCD40L, hgp38mCD8; 400 ng/ml; a gift from Dr. Randolph Noelle, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH) for the time points indicated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. A radiolabeled probe was generated using the hCK-5 RNA multiprobe from BD PharMingen. RiboQuant kit components (BD PharMingen) were used to perform the RPA. Each sample RNA (30 μg) and 6 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled probe were mixed in hybridization buffer, heated to 90 °C for 5 min, allowed to cool to 50 °C, and incubated for 16 h. RNase A/T1 (1:100) diluted in digestion buffer was added, and RNA digestion was allowed to proceed for 45 min. Inactivation/precipitation solution was added, and the samples were incubated at −70 °C for 30 min. After pelleting by centrifugation, the buffer was removed, and the RNA allowed to air-dry. The RNA was resuspended in gel loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 4-mm thick 4% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to filter paper and exposed to film. To analyze the role of NF-κB in CD40-mediated activation of the RANTES promoter in airway epithelial cells, constructs containing portions of the RANTES promoter ligated to a luciferase reporter gene were generated and provided by Dr. Hiro Moriuchi, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda (26Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1.4-kb 5′-noncoding sequence of the RANTES gene (R1.4) was cloned into pGL2-basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Site-directed mutations of NF-κB-binding sites (ΔκB1, ΔκB2) within this non-coding sequence were confirmed via dideoxy DNA sequencing (26Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar). 9HTEo− cells were co-transfected transiently with a construct encoding β-galactosidase and the RANTES promoter constructs R1.4, ΔκB1, ΔκB2, or a pGL2-basic empty vector in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus. As a positive control for NF-κB activation, 9HTEo− cells were transfected transiently in parallel with a luciferase reporter construct containing multiple NF-κB-binding sites (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, 9HTEo− cells were grown on Vitrogen 100-coated wells of a 6-well plate in media containing 5% FCS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.2% fungizone. At ∼80% confluence, cells were incubated with low serum Opti-MEM I media (Invitrogen) containing LipofectAMINE Plus (6 μg/well; Invitrogen), the RANTES promoter construct R1.4, ΔκB1, or ΔκB2 (each 2.0 μg/well), and the pSV-β-galactosidase construct (0.5 μg/well, Promega) for 6 h at 37 °C. Following transfection, cells were cultured in the presence and absence of sCD40L (400 ng/ml) for 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was monitored via the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). Relative transfection efficiency was determined using the β-Gal Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.) according to manufacturer's protocols. To examine CD40-mediated effects on NF-κB binding directly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (27Dong Y. Tang L. Letterio J.J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with and without sCD40L (400 ng/ml) for the time points indicated were prepared. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and then were stimulated with or without sCD40L (400 ng/ml) as indicated. After treatment, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mmKCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4), set on ice for 10 min, and pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, set on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 15% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4) and set at 4 °C for 30 min with constant gentle mixing. Nuclei were then pelleted at 40,000 ×g for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 15% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Nuclear extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. EMSA was performed using the following oligonucleotides as probes and/or competitors: the oligonucleotides κB1 (5′-att ttg gaa act ccc tta gg-3′; Invitrogen) and κB2 (5′-ttg agg gga tgc ccc taa gg-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The gel shift reaction was then prepared by incubating 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (250,000 cpm/reaction) with 10 μg of nuclear extract in a volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at room temperature. For competition analysis, molar excess (as indicated) of the respective unlabeled DNA was included in the initial gel shift reaction mix. For supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody (directed against NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the gel shift reaction and then incubated for an additional 45 min at room temperature. Bound and free DNA were resolved by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 190 V in 1× TGE buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA). Dried gels were processed via autoradiography. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 μm Tris, 0.15 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A (100 μg/ml each), and 10 μm PMSF) and then examined for the presence of the NF-κB subunits p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB via immunoblotting. Specifically, equivalent amounts of protein (25 μg/lane; determined via Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad) for each sample were electrophoresed and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific sites were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween and 5% non-fat dry milk. Blots were then immunoblotted with polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) directed against the NF-κB subunits listed above (diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% BSA; New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% BSA). Immunoblots were developed using chemiluminescence. For analysis of IKK molecule involvement in CD40-mediated NF-κB activation, 9HTEo− cells were co-transfected transiently with constructs encoding wild-type or dominant-negative forms (K44A) of IKK-α or IKK-β (28–30, generous gifts from Dr. Randolph Noelle) together with constructs encoding the intact R1.4 RANTES promoter or β-galactosidase as described above. Briefly, using LipofectAMINE Plus (6 μg/well; Invitrogen), cells were co-transfected with the appropriate IKK construct or an empty vector control (0.5 μg/well), the R1.4 construct (2.0 μg/well), and the pSV-β-galactosidase construct (0.5 μg/well). Following transfection, cells were stimulated with or without sCD40L, harvested, and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described above. In addition, supernatants from cells transfected with IKK-α or IKK-β constructs and then cultured with and without sCD40L as detailed above were collected and analyzed for secreted RANTES protein expression via ELISA (BioSource Inc.). To analyze CD40-mediated IκBα phosphorylation, cells were stimulated with or without sCD40L (400 ng/ml) for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C. Following stimulation, cells were lysed with lysis as described above. Equivalent amounts of protein (25 μg/lane) for each sample were electrophoresed and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were then immunoblotted, as described above, with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against IκBα-Ser-32 (diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% BSA) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% BSA). Immunoblots were developed using chemiluminescence. Blots were then stripped (0.2n NaOH for 5 min at room temperature) and reprobed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against IκBα (diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% BSA) in order to verify equivalent IκBα protein expression in each sample. To examine TRAF molecule expression in airway epithelial cells, 9HTEo− and 16HBE14o− cells were cultured and lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Whole cell lysates (5 × 106 cells/sample) were precleared with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with GST or GST-CD40cyt (a GST-CD40 fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of CD40; a gift from Dr. Randolph Noelle) each at 20 μg/ml and glutathione-agarose for 18 h at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, eluted, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for TRAF2 or TRAF3 (each at 1 μg/ml; gifts from Dr. Randolph Noelle) followed by a goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in lysis buffer, Sigma), as described above, and developed via ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). HT-29 cells, which do not express endogenous CD40 (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), were transfected stably with constructs encoding wild-type or mutant forms of human CD40. Specifically, cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE Plus, as described above, with constructs that encoded wild-type human CD40 (see Ref. 31Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H.

Following transfection, cells were selected for hygromycin resistance, expanded, and examined for surface CD40 expression via flow cytometry as described previously (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Clones that stained positively for human CD40 were cultured in the presence and absence of sCD40L as described above; supernatants were then harvested and examined for RANTES secreted protein expression via ELISA as detailed above. For analysis of TRAF molecule involvement in CD40-mediated NF-κB activation, 9HTEo− cells were transfected transiently with constructs encoding wild-type (WT) or dominant-negative (DN) forms of the molecules TRAF2 (11Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) and TRAF3 (33Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as described above. Briefly, using LipofectAMINE Plus (6 μg/well), cells were co-transfected with the appropriate TRAF construct or empty vector control (0.5 μg/well), the R1.4 or ΔκB construct (2.0 μg/well), and the pSV-β-galactosidase construct (0.5 μg/well) in 6-well plates for 6 h at 37 °C. WT and DN forms of TRAF molecules were utilized in these studies and were gifts from Dr. Randolph Noelle; each construct contained a peptide tag, either c-Myc or FLAG. Following transfection, cells were stimulated with or without sCD40L as described above. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity via the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). The relative expression of the epitope-tagged TRAF molecules was determined via immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the respective tag. Relative transfection efficiency was determined using the β-Gal Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.) according to manufacturer's protocols. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of replicate determinations as indicated. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. Ap ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. We have demonstrated previously (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that engagement of CD40 expressed on airway epithelial cells increased the protein production of several inflammatory mediators, including the chemokine RANTES. To determine whether engagement of epithelial CD40 also modulated RANTES expression at the steady-state mRNA level, RPA was performed. To this end, 9HTEo− airway epithelial cells were cultured in the presence and absence of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) for various time points and prepared for analysis. The 9HTEo− cell line was utilized because it expresses CD40 on its surface constitutively and is responsive to stimulation by sCD40L (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig.1 A indicate that CD40 ligation up-regulated RANTES mRNA expression and that this expression increased over time. Importantly, CD40 ligation also up-regulated the mRNA expression of other chemokines, including MCP-1 and IL-8; we have shown previously (5Propst S.M. Estell K. Schwiebert L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2214-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that the protein expression of MCP-1 and IL-8 is modulated upon CD40 engagement. Previous studies (34Ray P. Yang L. Zhang D.-H. Ghosh S.K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20191-20197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have reported that, in airway epithelial cells, RANTES mRNA expression is delayed in comparison with the mRNA expression of other chemokines, including IL-8. Because RANTES mRNA expression did not reach maximal levels until 18 h post-treatment with sCD40L, we determined whether de novoprotein synthesis was required for CD40-mediated increases in RANTES mRNA expression in airway epithelial cells. For this analysis, 9HTEo− cells were cultured in the presence and absence of sCD40L and/or cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor that can cause super-induction of some genes through the prevention of mRNA degradation. Results presented in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that cycloheximide treatment alone induced RANTES mRNA expression suggesting that newly synthesized proteins degrade RANTES mRNA transcripts in the absence of stimuli. In cells stimulated with cycloheximide and sCD40L simultaneously, interestingly, RANTES mRNA expression was not significantly increased over that level observed with cycloheximide or sCD40L alone (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, mRNA expression of MCP-1 and IL-8 was superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide and sCD40L (Fig. 1 B). Together, these results indicate that engagement of CD40 on airway epithelial cells induces the mRNA expression of RANTES, but not MCP-1 or IL-8, in a manner that is not regulated by de novo protein synthesis. NF-κB regulates the expression of many genes that encode inflammatory mediators, including RANTES (35Schall T.J. Jongstra J. Dyer B.J. Jorgensen J. Clayberger C. Davis M.M. Krensky A.M. J.

The increased nucleophilicity results from stronger hydrogen bonding to the catalytic base, which is mediated by a hydrogen bond from the charged donor.

These enzymes catalyze the intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the 5′-leaving group by the attacking 2′-hydroxyl group in RNA, forming a 2′,3′-cyclophosphate (see Fig.1). The nucleophilic attack occurs in-line, in a postulated trigonal bipyramidal transition state, implying a catalytic base and acid on either side of the scissile bond (1Eckstein F. Schulz H.H. Ruterjans H Maurer W. Haar W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Usher D.A. Erenrich E.S. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographical and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have provided substantial insight in the structure-function relationship of two unrelated families of ribonucleases. RNase A, (bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A) (EC 3.1.27.5) (3Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and RNase T1, (EC 3.1.27.3) (4Steyaert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Loverix S. Steyaert J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (and references therein) are the best characterized members of the mammalian and the microbial enzymes, respectively. The mammalian enzymes depend on two histidines for acid/base catalysis, whereas a histidine/glutamic acid pair is found in the microbial enzymes (6Hill C. Dodson G. Heinemann U. Saenger W. Mitsui Y. Nakamura K. Borisov S. Tishchenko G. Polyakov K. Pavlovskii S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The active site of RNase T1 is composed of the side chains of Tyr-38, His-40, Glu-58, Arg-77, His-92, and Phe-100 (see Fig.2 a). With the exception of Arg-77, all these amino acids have been shown to take part in catalysis (5Loverix S. Steyaert J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both the His-40 and Glu-58 side chains are in the direct vicinity of the 2′-nucleophile. pH dependence studies have shown Glu-58 to be unprotonated and His-40 to be protonated at the onset of catalysis, proving that Glu-58 is the catalytic base accepting a proton from the 2′-nucleophile (7Steyaert J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9064-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protonated His-92 located at the opposite side of the active site functions as the catalytic acid. Removal of the His-40 side chain leads to a 6500-fold decrease in the second-order rate constantk cat/K m suggesting an important catalytic role for this residue in the wild type enzyme. His-40 is believed to polarize the 2′-hydroxyl group and to properly orientate Glu-58 toward the substrate (8Zegers I. Haikal A.F. Palmer R. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cordes F. Starikov E.B. Saenger W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10365-10372Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the actual role of this residue is not totally clarified at present. Despite the lack of sequential homology between RNase A and RNase T1, their active site architectures show considerable similarities (Fig. 2). In RNase A, the protonated His-119 and the unprotonated His-12 form the catalytic acid/base pair, respectively. His-12 superimposes with its RNase T1 counterpart Glu-58 (Fig. 2 c). Lys-41, another important residue in RNase A, has been shown to donate a single hydrogen bond to the rate-limiting transition state of the reaction (10Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The lack of large thioeffects for the RNase A-catalyzed reaction (11Herschlag D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11631-11635Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) argues against important catalytic interactions with the nonbridging oxygens. Moreover, crystallographic studies of RNase A complexed with a 3′-mononucleotide substrate (3′-CMP (12Zegers I. Maes D. Daothi M.H. Poortmans F. Palmer R. Wyns L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2322-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and 3′-UMP (13Fisher B.M. Schultz L.W. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17386-17401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) or with the transition state analog uridine vanadate (14Wladkowski B.D. Svensson L.A. Sjolin L. Ladner J.E. Gilliland G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5488-5498Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) persistently show a short hydrogen bond of about 2.7 Å between Nζ of Lys-41 and the 2′-oxygen, much like His-40 in RNase T1 (Fig. 2 c). Early molecular dynamics simulations on RNase A complexed with the dinucleotide substrate CpA support these observations (15Haydock K. Lim C. Brunger A.T. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 3826-3831Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, Lys-41 is still considered to stabilize negative charge build up on one of the nonbridging phosphoryl oxygens (3Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), and its precise role in catalysis remains controversial. Because RNase-catalyzed phosphodiester cleavage is not a dissociative process (16Sowa G.A. Hengge A.C. Cleland W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2319-2320Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the nucleophilic attack contributes largely to the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The nucleophilic attack on hard centers such as phosphates involves the donation of electrons from a nucleophile to a phosphorus, leading to partial bond formation in the transition state. The dominant feature controlling nucleophilicity in these reactions is the Lewis basicity of the nucleophile. Considering its high pK a of about 13.5 (17Velikyan I. Acharya S. Trifonova A. Foeldesi A. Chattopadhyaya J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2893-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the 2′-oxyanion of ribose is a very reactive species by itself. However, the concentration of the reactive species is very low because most of the 2′-oxygen will be protonated at a neutral pH value. In the classical case of serine proteases, the nucleophilic serine is activated in a catalytic Asp-His-Ser triad. The present study aims to shed more light on how ribonucleases deal with this problem of nucleophile activation. The onset of every enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the formation of a Michaelis complex between enzyme and substrate. Starting from high resolution structures of genuine Michaelis complexes, ab initio quantum chemical calculations were used to evaluate the effect of the enzymic environment upon the intrinsic reactivity of the 2′-hydroxyl group in RNA. All RNase T1 mutants were co-crystallized with the substrate 3′-guanosine monophosphate (3′-GMP) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 1.5 mmprotein and 3 mm substrate were incubated together for an hour at 20 °C prior to adding an equal volume of mother liquor containing 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and 42–52% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Data collection and refinement procedures were carried out essentially as published (18Zegers I. Loris R. Dehollander G. Haikal A.F. Poortmans F. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Nat. Struct.

In a first set of computations, we analyzed the charge distribution in the Michaelis complexes of wild type and mutant RNase T1, starting from high resolution crystallographic data (Table I). The models used in the calculations consisted of the 3′-GMP substrate and all amino acid side chains that make up the active site: Tyr-38, His-40, Glu-58, Arg-77, His-92, and Phe-100 (Fig. 2 a). A similar analysis was done on a model of wild type RNase A that was constructed starting from the crystallographic coordinates of the complex with 3′-CMP (12Zegers I. Maes D. Daothi M.H. Poortmans F. Palmer R. Wyns L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2322-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), including the side chains of Gln-11, His-12, Lys-41, and His-119 and the backbone atoms of Phe-100 (Fig. 2 b). The mutants of RNase A were constructed in silico by truncating a side chain at the Cβ atom in the wild type model. In all cases, hydrogens were added according to the protonation state of titratable groups and optimized at the Hartree Fock 3–21G level of theory, whereas heavy atoms were kept fixed at their spatial positions. As a control, each RNase T1 mutant was constructed in silico as well. For all these models, atomic charges were obtained using the Mulliken population analysis approach (19Mulliken R.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1955; 23 (2238, 2343): 1833-1841Crossref Scopus (9772) Google Scholar) (TableII). To justify the use of Mulliken charges to describe the nucleophilicity of the 2′-OH group, a preliminary study on small alkoxide nucleophiles attacking methyl 2,4 dinitrophenyl phosphate was performed at the same level of theory. For these calculations, the nucleophile and phosphate were optimized separately and then placed together in the same geometry as is observed in the wild type RNase T1 Michaelis complex, the distance between O-2′ and phosphorus being fixed to 3.5 Å.Table IINucleophilicity of the 2′-OH group, illustrated by the Mulliken atomic charge on O-2′ and the polarity of the hydroxyl bond for a variety of Michaelis complexes in atomic units.Mulliken charge O-2′Polarity 2′-OHRNase T1Wild type−0.7700.351E58Ain vivo−0.7120.315H40Ain vivo−0.7150.305H40A/E58Ain vivo−0.7020.300E58Ain silico−0.7410.329H40Ain silico−0.7240.321H40A/E58Ain silico−0.6860.271RNase AWild type−0.7990.439H12Ain silico−0.7950.393K41Ain silico−0.7650.395H12A/K41Ain silico−0.7580.354 Open table in a new tab To analyze the interactions of the 2′-nucleophile with the catalytic dyad at the quantum chemical level, the following model was constructed. Methanol was used to mimic the 2′-hydroxyl group, formate for glutamate, a methylammonium ion for lysine, and an imidazole for histidine (imidazolium ion in the case of RNase T1). Ab initio calculations using the Hartree Fock, Möller Plesset 2, and density functional theory (DFT)1 methodology (the latter two methods partly take into account the electronic correlation energy) have been carried out using the split valence 6–31++G(d,p) basis set, which includes d polarization and diffuse sp functions on heavy atoms and p polarization and diffuse p functions on hydrogen atoms. The DFT B3LYP functional, which proved to be adequate for the calculation of a large variety of molecular properties (20Geerlings P., De Proft F. Langenaeker W. Adv. Quant.

Yang W. Parr R.G. Phys. Rev. B. 1988; 37: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (87049) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were optimized at each level of theory, heavy atoms being fixed at their spatial positions as observed in the crystal structure. The hydrogen bond energy is calculated as the difference between the energy of the complex and the energies of the infinitely separated partners. Basis set superposition errors were corrected for using the counterpoise method (26Boys S.F. Bernardi F. Mol. Phys. 1970; 10: 553-566Crossref Scopus (19436) Google Scholar). All calculations were performed using methods implemented in the Gaussian98 package (27Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G.

Table I summarizes the crystallographic details of the structures that were used as a starting point for the computational study. In each mutant structure, the 3′-GMP substrate is bound in a catalytic productive mode, as is the case for the wild type structure (8Zegers I. Haikal A.F. Palmer R. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from direct interactions involving the mutated residues, all intermolecular interactions between enzyme and substrate are found to be similar in all these structures. The only striking difference among these structures is observed in the E58A complex where the imidazole side chain of His-40 has flipped about 180 °, causing it to interact with the 2′-oxygen via its Nδ atom instead of Nε as is found in the wild type structure. A diversity of reactivity descriptors is available to probe nucleophilicity. Working within the context of Pearson's hard and soft acids and bases principle (28Pearson R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 3533-3539Crossref Scopus (8198) Google Scholar, 29Parr R.G. Yang W. Density-Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 87-104Google Scholar) at a local level (30Mendez F. Gazquez J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 9298-9301Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 31Gazquez J.L.

Quantum Chem. 2000; 80: 227-235Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the hardness of the reacting partners in the RNase active site incites us to use DFT-based descriptors related to local hardness. As atomic charges were found to be successful in describing the reactivity of hard centers (33Langenaeker W., De Proft F. Geerlings P. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 6424-6431Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Chattaraj P.K. Gomez B. Chamorro E. Santos J. Fuentealba P. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2001; 105: 8815-8820Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), they were used for this purpose. In view of computational simplicity, atomic charges were obtained via the Mulliken population analysis (19Mulliken R.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1955; 23 (2238, 2343): 1833-1841Crossref Scopus (9772) Google Scholar). The Mulliken analysis was preferred to the nowadays often used CHELPG analysis (35Breneman C.M. Wiberg K.B. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 361-373Crossref Scopus (4026) Google Scholar) because the latter leads to a poorer description of atoms embedded in large systems as these atoms contribute less to the electrostatic potential at the surface considered. To validate the use of the Mulliken charge as a descriptor of nucleophilicity, the Mulliken charge distribution was calculated for four alkoxide nucleophiles attacking methyl 2,4-dinitrophenyl phosphate. Fig. 3 plots the net atomic charge on the nucleophilic oxygen versus the logarithm of experimentally obtained rate constants for the nucleophilic substitution reaction (36Kirby A.J. Younas M. J. Chem. Soc. B. 1970; 6: 1165-1172Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The observed correlation allows for a qualitative assessment of the 2′ nucleophilicity based on Mulliken charges. Whereas the charge on an oxygen atom describes its nucleophilicity, the polarity of a hydroxyl group, which may be estimated by the product of the charges on the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, describes its acidity (37Datka J. Geerlings P. Mortier W. Jacobs P. J. Phys. Chem. 1985; 89: 3483-3488Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Langenaeker W. Coussement N., De Proft F. Geerlings P. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 3010-3014Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Vos A.M. Nulens K.H.L., De Proft F. Schoonheydt R.A. Geerlings P. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 106: 2026-2034Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The higher the polarity of the 2′-OH group, the more proton transfer to a catalytic base will be facilitated. We calculated the effect of a particular mutation on the Mulliken charge on the 2′-oxygen atom to identify amino acid side chains involved in nucleophile activation. Table II shows both the net atomic charge on O-2′ as a measure of its nucleophilicity as well as the polarity of the 2′-OH group as a measure of the degree of proton transfer to the catalytic base. In a first set of calculations, we started from x-ray crystallographic data to quantify the effect of mutations in the active site of RNase T1 on the 2′ nucleophilicity. For these calculations, His-40 was double protonated in the wild type enzyme, whereas in the E58A mutant a neutral imidazole ring was used (7Steyaert J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9064-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). From these results it is seen that deletion of the negatively charged Glu-58 carboxylate (the catalytic base) and/or the positively charged His-40 imidazolium lowers the Mulliken charge on the 2′-oxygen atom, thus affecting its nucleophilicity. In the wild type enzyme, the 2′-atomic charge and the polarity of the 2′-hydroxyl are maximal, illustrating that both Glu-58 and His-40 contribute to nucleophile activation. In the H40A and the E58A mutants, the 2′-OH is polarized by donating a hydrogen bond to the Glu-58 carboxylate and to the His-40 imidazole, respectively. In the case of the wild type enzyme, a second interaction is present: the charged His-40 donates a hydrogen bond to the 2′-oxygen atom. These data are entirely consistent with results from protein engineering and kinetic experiments (40Steyaert J. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It thus follows that the comparison of quantum chemical reactivity descriptors among wild type and mutant structures is a valid complementary technique to evaluate the contribution of particular side chains to catalysis. To test if this method is also applicable when no crystal structures are available for the mutants under investigation, we constructed a number of RNase T1 mutants in silico by removing the carboxylate and/or imidazolium side chain from the wild type structure. In a second step, we calculated the effect of these in silico mutations on the 2′-oxygen atomic charge using the same approach. Each in silico single mutant displays a higher nucleophilicity than the corresponding in vivo mutant (TableII). This may be due to the fact that in wild type RNase T1the distances from O-2′ to Nε of His-40 (2.59 Å) or Oδ of Glu-58 (2.65 Å) are smaller than in the in vivo mutants, E58A (2.92 Å) and H40A (2.75 Å). The corresponding double mutant displays a higher nucleophilicity in vivo than in silico because of the presence of a water molecule that donates a hydrogen bond to O-2′. From the in silico mutations, it is clear that the presence of the His-40 imidazolium ion is intrinsically important for the 2′ nucleophilicity, more so than the presence of the Glu-58 side chain. This is reflected by thek cat/K m values of these mutants, the catalytic importance of His-40 prevailing over Glu-58 (40Steyaert J. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The good qualitative agreement between the in vivo and in silico results for RNase T1justifies the employment of the in silico approach for RNase A, for which there are no mutant crystal structures available. In RNase A, removal of the Lys-41 side chain lowers the nucleophilicity more so than removal of the catalytic base His-12. The observation that each RNase A variant displays a higher 2′ nucleophilicity than its RNase T1 counterpart can be explained by a third short hydrogen bond between the 2′-OH and a nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen. This interaction is not present in the RNase T1 complex, where the phosphate group is more distant from the 2′-hydroxyl group. Nevertheless, both enzymes display a similar behavior of the 2′ nucleophilicity in response to equivalent in silicomutations (H40A versus K41A and E58A versusH12A). Also, in both cases, the double mutant has the largest impact on the reactivity of the nucleophile. Interestingly, the effect of these mutations on the charge of the 2′-oxygen atom follows the same trend as the kinetic parameter kcat/K m (10Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,40Steyaert J. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on the observed nucleophile activation, we set out to calculate the strength of the hydrogen bond between the 2′-OH group and the catalytic base in the gas phase. This was done in the presence and absence of the charged hydrogen bond donor. Table III summarizes the results for RNase A and RNase T1. The calculated hydrogen bond strength depends on the level of theory used. From the deviant values obtained at the Hartree Fock level, it is clear that electron correlation needs to be included for a proper description of the system. The DFT and Møller-Plesset 2 levels give comparable results, confirming that the B3LYP functional is suitable for this type of studies. In the following discussion we will focus on the Møller-Plesset 2 results because these may be considered the most accurate. In wild type RNase T1, the hydrogen bond strength amounts to about 17 kcal/mol, corresponding well with the experimental value of 17.6 kcal/mol for a hydrogen bond between formate and methanol in the gas phase (41Meot-Ner M. Sieck L.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7525-7529Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, the analogous hydrogen bond in RNase A is much weaker (about 6.7 kcal/mol). This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that RNase T1 features an ionic homonuclear hydrogen bond (OH–O−), whereas in RNase A we find an uncharged heteronuclear hydrogen bond (OH–N). This is also clear from the larger donor-acceptor distance in RNase A (2.90 Å) as compared with RNase T1 (2.64 Å). All the same, removal of the His-40 imidazolium in RNase T1 or the Lys-41 ammonium group in RNase A leads to a decrease in hydrogen bond strength of 3 and 4 kcal/mol, respectively. These computational results are consistent with the functional cooperativity that has been observed experimentally between the side chains of His-40 and Glu-58 in RNase T1 (40Steyaert J. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These two residues depend on each other to perform their mutual role in catalysis. It is now clear that His-40 assists in the proton transfer from 2′-OH to Glu-58 via the donation of a charged hydrogen bond.Table IIICalculated strength of the hydrogen bond between the 2′-OH group and the catalytic base in kcal/mol3-aHF, Hartree Fock; MP2, Møller-Plesset 2.HFB3LYPMP2RNase T1With His-4013.317.416.9Without His-4011.914.613.9RNase AWith Lys-413.36.56.7Without Lys-41−0.51.92.73-a HF, Hartree Fock; MP2, Møller-Plesset 2. Open table in a new tab Taken together, these results promote a mechanism of nucleophile activation in RNA by a catalytic dyad in an RNase active site. This may well be a general feature for many ribonucleases. Human angiogenin for example, an effector of blood vessel formation, relies for catalytic activity on two histidines (His-13 and His-114) and a lysine (Lys-40), like all members of the RNase A superfamily. An analogous study on a molecular dynamics structure of angiogenin complexed with the dinucleotide CpA (42Madhusudhan M.S. Sanjeev B.S. Vishveshwara S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 45: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), revealed a decrease of 3 kcal/mol in the strength of the hydrogen bond between His-13 and 2′-OH upon removal of the Lys-40 side chain (data not shown). These results suggest a general mechanism for nucleophile activation in ribonucleases by a catalytic dyad composed of the catalytic base and a charged hydrogen bond donor. In the Michaelis complex, the ground state of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the catalytic base accepts a hydrogen bond from the 2′-OH while the cationic partner donates a hydrogen bond to the 2′-oxygen atom, thereby strengthening the first hydrogen bond. Because mutation of the dyad residues affects catalysis, rather than binding, these interactions will become significantly more important in the transition state of the catalyzed reaction. Such a mechanism is reminiscent of the two-metal-ion-assisted phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by various enzymes and ribozymes (43Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 44Lott W.B. Pontius B.W. Von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There, one divalent metal ion stabilizes negative charge build up on the leaving oxygen, while another is directly coordinated to the attacking oxygen. An increasing number of crystal structures of enzyme complexes, wherein the nucleophile is present in a productive configuration (8Zegers I. Haikal A.F. Palmer R. Wyns L. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 2001; 130: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), argues for a common mechanism of nucleophile activation in which a cationic group interacts directly with the attacking atom, resulting in enhanced general base catalysis. Particularly, we believe that a charged hydrogen bond donated to the 2′-oxygen atom is indispensable for efficient proton transfer to the catalytic base. In conclusion, this study demonstrates how high level ab initiocomputations on “experimental” x-ray structures of Michaelis complexes can lead to novel insights in enzymology. Interestingly, the onset of catalysis is already noticeable in the Michaelis complex, as is clear from the negative charge increase on the attacking nucleophile upon substrate binding."

Ligand-dependent death receptor oligomerization recruits cytoplasmic adapter proteins such as FADD, 1The abbreviations used are: FADD, Fas-associated death domain; Hid, Head involution defective; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pErk, phosphorylated Erk; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; CA-MEK, constitutively active MEK; DN-MEK, dominant negative MEK; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; IL, interleukin; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; zVAD-FMK, z-Val-Ala-Asp (O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone; IETD-FMK, Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK; LEHD-FMK, Leu-Glu-His-Asp-FMK; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; MBP, maltose-binding protein; FL, full length; Smac, second mitochondrial activator of caspases; DIABLO, direct IAP-binding protein with low pI; c, cytoplasmic. which in turn binds the pro-form of caspase-8 and triggers its activation. Caspase-9 is usually activated via the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, an event regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family (12Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Although death receptor-FADD interactions are the best understood mechanism of caspase-8 activation, recent studies have described alternative pathways that lead to the activation of caspase-8. Thus, apoptotic signaling via the B-cell receptor (13Besnault L. Schrantz N. Auffredou M.T. Leca G. Bourgeade M.F. Vazquez A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), anticancer drugs (14Bantel H. Engels I.H. Voelter W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2083-2090PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokines such as TGF-β (15Schrantz N. Bourgeade M.F. Mouhamad S. Leca G. Sharma S. Vazquez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3139-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reportedly activate FADD-independent activation of caspase-8. The death domain in many members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily in mammals is present as the gene reaper inDrosophila, although a receptor-mediated death pathway is not known in flies. Caspase activity is inhibited by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) class of proteins, which function by binding and inactivating processed effector and initiator caspases including caspase-3, -7, and -9. The IAP proteins have characteristic baculoviral IAP repeats that are required for their antiapoptotic function (16Hay B.A. Cell. Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, head involution defective (Hid), a developmentally regulated gene (17Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Agapite J. White K. Steller H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), induces apoptosis by antagonizing Drosophila IAP (DIAP) (16Hay B.A. Cell. Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Hid is apoptotic to mammalian cells, and apoptosis is inhibited by various antiapoptotic molecules that include baculoviral p35 (bvp35), Bcl-xL, and Human X-linked IAP (XIAP) (19Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C. Wei C.L. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4936-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 43-KDa Hid protein has, in addition to the IAP-binding N terminus, five consensus p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Erk-1/2) phosphorylation domains (PX(S/T)P) (20Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) located between residues 121 and 257. Unlike other death genes identified in flies, expression of Hid mRNA is seen widely in various stages of development, regardless of cell death fate (20Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Kurada P. White K. Cell. 1998; 95: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondrial activator of caspases/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI), believed to be the human equivalent of Hid in mammalian cells, has been recently identified (22Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 23Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). However, unlike Hid, overexpression of Smac/DIABLO does not induce apoptosis in cells (23Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism of Hid-induced apoptosis by utilizing mammalian cell lines of lymphoid origin that differ in their sensitivity to Hid-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate Erk-mediated negative regulation of Hid function in mammalian cells and demonstrate that Erk did not regulate Smac/DIABLO-mediated potentiation of apoptosis in the same cells. Hid activates an apoptotic pathway dependent on caspase-8. We show that Hid associates with caspase-8, that the deletion of caspase-8 renders cells resistant to Hid, and that caspase-8 activation is independent of FADD-mediated signaling events. Caspase-8 processing in mitogen-stimulated T cells is inhibited by the trophic factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) via an Erk-dependent event, suggesting that a Hid-like molecule may be present in mammalian cells. Jurkat, a T lymphoblastoid line of human origin, and d11S, a murine T cell hybridoma, were used in all experiments. Activated T cells were generated as described before (24Sarin A. Nakajima H Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5806-5812PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide inhibitors z-Val-Ala-Asp (O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-FMK), Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK (IETD-FMK), and Leu-Glu-His-Asp-FMK (LEHD-FMK) were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Hoechst 33342 and PMA were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to green fluorescent protein (GFP), caspase-8, Erk-1, and p38MAPK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phosphorylated Erk and U0126 were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and antibodies to full-length Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) and TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PD98059 and LY294002 were obtained fromCalbiochem. Hid cDNA was obtained from Kristin White (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (21Kurada P. White K. Cell. 1998; 95: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The Hid construct was made by PCR amplification of the open reading frame, which was cloned into the Bgl-11 and Kpn-1 sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with GFP in-frame in the C terminus. The bvp35 plasmid was a kind gift of Charlie Zacharchuk (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Constitutively active or dominant negative MEK-1 plasmids were originally from the laboratories of M. J. Weber (University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville, Virginia) and C. J. Marshall (Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK) and were obtained from Shahid Jameel (International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India). The Smac plasmid was from X. Wang (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas TX and obtained from Dr. Santhosh (Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, India). A total of 3–5 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation at 250 mV and 960 microfarad as described previously (25Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely transfected with 5 μg of relevant DNA unless specified otherwise. The total amount of DNA across all transfection groups in an experiment was kept constant and adjusted when required by additional amounts of the pEGFP-N3 plasmid. In all experiments with peptide inhibitors of caspases or kinase inhibitors, agents were added to cells soon after transfection. In the experiments with PMA and UO126, UO126 was added to the cells immediately after transfection followed by the addition of PMA after 45 min. This protocol was followed to allow UO126 to enter cells prior to the relatively rapid activation of Erk triggered by PMA. Apoptotic damage was assessed using Hoechst 33342 by fluorescence microscopy as described (26Varghese J. Chattopadhyay S. Sarin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells were viewed under a blue filter, and nuclear morphology of GFP-positive cells was scored using the UV filter. Hid protein tagged with maltose-binding protein (MBP) was added to lysates made from 3 × 106Jurkat cells. MBP-tagged Hid and associated proteins were pulled down using amylose beads, and after thorough washing, they were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), vortexed to reduce sample viscosity, denatured by boiling, and then cooled on ice. Samples were resolved on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Freshly activated T cells were washed and cultured as such to induce spontaneous death, which could be blocked if the growth factor interleukin-2 was added at the initiation of culture. When used, the blocking antibodies to TNFR-1 or TNFR-2 were also added at the initiation of culture. For activation-induced cell death, freshly activated cells were cultured overnight in the presence of IL-2 before being used for the assay. 0.4 × 106 cells/ml were cultured for 18–20 h on dishes that had been precoated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 (clone 2C11). In all experiments with T cell blasts, apoptotic nuclear damage was assessed using Hoechst 33342. In a screen of mammalian cell lines, we observed that transient overexpression of full-length Hid (Fig.1 A, Hid-FL) induced dose-dependent apoptotic nuclear damage in Jurkat T cells but not in the d11S T cell line (Fig. 1 B, solid bars). Although concentrations as low as 1 μg of Hid-FL triggered death in Jurkat cells, d11S cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of Hid at concentrations as high as 20 μg (Fig.1 C, squares). Since Hid was tagged to GFP, the detection of GFP at the appropriate molecular weight by Western blot analysis, 8–10 h after transfection (Fig. 1 C,inset), confirmed expression of the Hid protein in these cells. This time point was determined based on experiments that indicated near maximal levels of GFP expression by flow cytometry (data not shown). Since both d11S and Jurkat cells expressed comparable levels of the transfected gene (indicated by GFP), it appeared that resistance to apoptosis could not be attributed to the instability of the Hid protein in d11S cells. The differential effect of Hid on these two cell lines was sustained if a non-tagged construct of Hid was co-transfected with GFP (data not shown). Fig. 1 Dshows the induction of apoptotic nuclear morphology (Fig.1 D, iv) in cells expressing Hid (Fig.1 D, iii and iv) as opposed to the normal nuclei (Fig. 1 D, ii) seen in the cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1 D, i andii). Both cell lines were equally susceptible to the proapoptotic molecule Bax, suggesting that d11S cells were specifically resistant to Hid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1 E). These experiments showed that Hid was not generally cytotoxic and that its activity was regulated in mammalian cells. We then tested whether molecules that regulate Hid function in flies were also conserved in mammalian cells. Members of the Ras family of protein kinases are key manipulators of many apoptotic pathways (27Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and the Erk pathway regulates Hid-induced apoptosis in flies either via transcriptional mechanisms or via modification of the Hid protein (20Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Kurada P. White K. Cell. 1998; 95: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Hid has five consensus p44/42 MAPK (Erk-1/2) phosphorylation domains (PX(S/T)P) (20Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) located between residues 121 and 257. In subsequent experiments, we tested whether negative regulation of Hid function by Erk signaling was also seen in mammalian cells. We compared levels of endogenous, phosphorylated Erk (pErk) in both Hid-resistant (d11S) and Hid-sensitive (Jurkat) cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, d11S cells (lanes 1 and 3) expressed higher levels of endogenous pErk as compared with Jurkat cells (upper panel, lanes 2and 4), although total Erk protein was detected in both cell lines (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The antiapoptotic role of Erk was examined by utilizing two reagents that can inhibit MEK1/2, the kinase that phosphorylates Erk (28Chang L. Karin M Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Both UO126 (Fig.2 B, lane 2) (29Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) and PD98059 (Fig. 2 B,lane 3) (30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) reduced levels of pErk (Fig. 2 B,lane 1) following a 2-h treatment in d11S cells. An inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LY294002 (Fig.2 B, lane 4), was without effect on pErk in the same experiment and served as a specificity control. The inhibitors were used to probe the functional role of the kinase in Hid-induced apoptosis. At concentrations that reduced phosphorylation of Erk, both inhibitors revealed a sensitivity to Hid-induced apoptosis in d11S cells (Fig. 2 C). These inhibitors were without effect on Hid-induced killing in Jurkat cells (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the protective effect of Erk was an artifact of the d11S cell line, we tested the effect of activating Erk on Hid-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Phorbol esters such as PMA activate Erk (31Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and in Jurkat cells, 10 ng/ml PMA increased pErk (Fig.3 A, i andiv), which was blocked by UO126 (Fig. 3 A,iv, lane 3). In functional assays, the same concentration of PMA reduced Hid-induced death close to background levels (Fig. 3 B), and pretreatment with UO126 prior to addition of PMA reversed the protective effect of this agent on Hid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 B) in Jurkat cells. These experiments suggest that PMA could act at the level of MEK1/2 since its effect was blocked by UO126 in cells. PMA has pleiotropic effects on cells, and in subsequent experiments, we used other approaches to confirm the antiapoptotic role of Erk in this system. Since both PD98059 and UO126 can inhibit kinases other than MEK1/2, a constitutively active form of MEK1 (S218/222D, CA-MEK) (32Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was tested for its effect on Hid-triggered apoptosis. As shown in Fig.3 C, overexpression of this construct blocked Hid-induced death to the same levels as those achieved by PMA. In addition, overexpression of a dominant negative form (S217/A, DN-MEK) of this kinase (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) reversed the protective effect of PMA on Hid-induced death (Fig. 3 C), an observation consistent with the data using UO126 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Hid-induced apoptosis was suppressed by the hyperactivation of Erk as the protective effect of PMA was reversed by the genetic approaches and pharmacological reagents that block phosphorylation of Erk in our system. Smac/DIABLO (a mammalian protein with some similarity to Hid) is a mitochondrial localized protein that can bind IAP and potentiate apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli (22Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar,23Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Both Smac/DIABLO and Hid function by relieving the inhibitory effect of IAP on caspases. Therefore we tested whether Erk signaling similarly inhibited Smac/DIABLO potentiation of UV-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of Smac/DIABLO increased apoptosis triggered by UV irradiation in these cells. Overexpression of CA-MEK (Fig.4 A) or PMA (Fig. 4 B) at concentrations that blocked the apoptotic function of Hid did not block the proapoptotic effect of Smac/DIABLO. Since serum can protect cells during the process of irradiation, we show data using protocols in which cells are irradiated in the absence (experiment 1) or presence (experiment 2) of serum containing medium for the duration of UV exposure. Following the exposure, cells are washed and continued in culture in complete medium. In subsequent experiments, we investigated the involvement of caspases in Hid-induced apoptosis. In accordance with the literature, Hid-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells was blocked by the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the baculoviral pan-caspase inhibitor bvp35 (Fig. 5 A) (19Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C. Wei C.L. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4936-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Death was blocked by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitory peptide ZVAD-FMK (34Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 35Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar), the caspase-9 inhibitory peptide LEHD-FMK, and somewhat unexpectedly by the peptide IETD-FMK, a more specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (Fig. 5 B). Previous studies have shown that Hid activates a caspase-9-dependent apoptotic death pathway (19Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C. Wei C.L. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4936-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and our data with LEHD-FMK and inhibition by Bcl-2 are consistent with this observation. However, the indication of caspase-8 functioning as a rate-limiting step in this pathway was unexpected, and we used additional approaches to confirm this observation. To confirm the role of caspase-8 in this pathway, Jurkat cells that have a deletion of caspase-8 were tested for their susceptibility to Hid. As shown in Fig. 5C (Caspase 8−), a Jurkat line deficient for caspase-8 (JI 9.2) was resistant to Hid, implicating caspase-8 in Hid-induced apoptosis. Minimal activation of caspase-8 cleaves the proapoptotic molecule Bid, which translocates to the mitochondrion and results in the activation of caspase-9 (36Nagata S. Nat. Cell Bio. 1999; 1: E143-E145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hid-induced apoptotic death was accompanied by a loss of full-length Bid protein, which indicated a possible truncation of the full-length Bid protein (Fig.5 D, lane 2-Hid) in Jurkat cells. It may be noted that at the time we detect the loss of Bid, total protein expression of p38MAPK is unchanged in Hid-treated cells. We also tested for an interaction of Hid with caspase-8. Lysates of Jurkat cells were incubated with purified Hid protein, and the associated complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation of Hid. These experiments revealed an interaction of Hid with caspase-8, IAP-1, and IAP-2 (Fig.5 E). We did not detect interactions with Bid/Bcl-2 in these experiments (data not shown). All these proteins are expressed in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 E, WCL). Caspase-8 is usually activated via ligand-dependent oligomerization of cell surface receptors belonging to the superfamily of TNFR. There are no models of death receptor-induced apoptosis in flies that have been described thus far, whereas receptor-independent activation of caspase-8 has been described in some apoptotic paradigms in mammalian cells (13Besnault L. Schrantz N. Auffredou M.T. Leca G. Bourgeade M.F. Vazquez A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Bantel H. Engels I.H. Voelter W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2083-2090PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schrantz N. Bourgeade M.F. Mouhamad S. Leca G. Sharma S. Vazquez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3139-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used a Jurkat cell line with a deletion of the death adaptor protein FADD (J12.1) to test the involvement of death receptor signaling in Hid-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.5 C, FADD negative cells (FADD−) remained susceptible to Hid-induced apoptosis. These experiments indicate that Hid-triggered apoptosis is dependent on caspase-8 and that apoptosis is suppressed by MEK1/2 signaling in mammalian cells. In the d11S cell line, inhibition of Erk rendered cells susceptible to Hid-induced apoptosis. We tested whether in these experimental conditions caspases functioned as effectors of apoptosis in the d11S cell line as well. Both PD98059 (Fig.6 A) and UO126 (Fig.6 B) revealed a sensitivity to Hid-induced apoptosis in the d11S cell line. Apoptosis triggered by Hid in these conditions was blocked by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor bvp35 as well as the peptide inhibitors of caspase-8 or -9 (Fig. 6 B), thereby recreating the pathway described in Jurkat cells (Fig. 6, Aand B). Regulation by Erk and the activation of caspase-8 appear to be consistent features of the Hid-induced apoptotic pathway in lymphocytes. Trophic factors regulate survival of many cell types, and activated T cells undergo apoptosis in the absence of exogenous survival factors such as the cytokine IL-2 (37Van Parijs L. Abbas A.K. Science. 1998; 280: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, A–C, apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of IL-2 in T cell blasts is independent of Fas and TNFR-mediated signaling. Thus, activated T cell blasts generated from splenocytes from normal C57Bl/6 (triangles) or mutant Fas (C57Bl/6lpr/lpr squares) mice undergo apoptosis in the absence of IL-2 (No IL-2, solid lines A andB), which is not blocked by soluble blocking antibodies to TNFR1 (Fig. 7 A) or TNFR2 (Fig. 7 B). The levels of apoptosis were comparable in both normal and lpr/lpr mice. The experiment in panel C confirms that T cell blasts fromlpr/lpr mice are resistant to Fas ligand-Fas mediated apoptosis induced by cross-linking the T cell receptor complex. When cultured in the absence of IL-2 (Fig. 7 D), activated T cells undergo apoptosis characterized by the processing of caspase-8, assessed by the loss of the full-length 55-kDa pro-form over time. The progressive disappearance of the pro-form of caspase-8 correlated with increased levels of apoptotic damage (Fig. 7 D, values below the blot) and preceded the loss of caspase-3 in these cells. The loss of caspase-8 was blocked by IL-2 or PMA (Fig.7 E). Both reagents also induced the phosphorylation of Erk in these cells (Fig. 7 E). Furthermore, the inhibition of caspase-8 processing and the antiapoptotic effect of IL-2 (Fig. 7,F and G) or PMA (Fig. 7 G) was reversed by UO126, indicating a role for Erk in the regulation of this caspase in T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Hid-induced apoptosis is dependent on both caspase-8 and -9 and, as demonstrated in flies, the apoptotic pathway is regulated by Erk in mammalian cells as well. The antiapoptotic function of Erk in this death pathway was inferred from the following experiments: a cell line that was resistant to Hid-induced apoptosis had high constitutive expression of pErk, and inhibition of MEK-1/2 revealed sensitivity to Hid-induced apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 2). In the Jurkat cell line, a constitutively active form of MEK1 blocked Hid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 C), the phorbol ester PMA blocked Hid-induced apoptosis, and protection was reversed by UO126 (an inhibitor of MEK) or a dominant negative MEK construct, identifying MEK as a key component of the PMA-induced antiapoptotic pathway. Erk is a member of the family of MAPKs downstream of Ras and is recruited into multiple signaling cascades (27Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Prosurvival functions have been described for other members of this family of kinases (26Varghese J. Chattopadhyay S. Sarin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,38Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), and their function is conserved across various species of metazoans (39McNeill H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R176-R179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hid function is negatively regulated by Ras through theDrosophila Erk homologue, rolled, which down-regulates Hid expression (21Kurada P. White K. Cell. 1998; 95: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and inactivates Hid by phosphorylation (20Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the latter study and show that despite enforced expression of Hid, apoptotic activity was regulated by endogenous Erk in mammalian cells. The involvement of this key regulatory event laid the foundation for the analysis of the mechanism by which Hid triggered apoptosis in mammalian cells. Our experiments show that Smac/DIABLO-induced potentiation of death is not regulated by Erk signaling (Fig. 4), consistent with the absence of conventional Erk phosphorylation sites on this molecule. That Hid-induced death may be integrated by the mitochondrion, culminating in the activation of caspase-9, has been reported earlier (19Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C. Wei C.L. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4936-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Activation or recruitment of caspase-9 requires the formation of an apoptogenic complex that includes co-factors dATP, Apaf-1, and cytochrome c (40Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Apoptogenic complex formation is regulated by antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which regulate the release of cytochrome c. Inhibition of Hid-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2, bvp35, and LEHD-FMK is consistent with a role for the mitochondrion in this pathway. However, the following experiments, unexpectedly, also indicated a role for caspase-8 in this pathway: Hid-induced apoptosis was blocked by a peptide inhibitor specific for this caspase; enforced expression of Hid triggered the truncation of Bid, a preferred substrate for caspase-8, and more conclusively, a Jurkat mutant with a deletion for caspase-8 was resistant to Hid-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, purified Hid protein, when used as a probe, immunoprecipitated caspase-8, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 from Jurkat cell lysates. We did not detect an interaction between Bid/Bcl-xL although these proteins are expressed in Jurkat cells. The latter experiments are consistent with the model that Hid promotes caspase activity by binding and antagonizing IAP function. Thus, we propose that Hid activates caspase-8, thereby triggering a cascade that involves the mitochondrion, culminating in the activation of caspase-9 and the death of cells. Caspase-8 activation is linked to the oligomerization of death receptors and recruitment of adaptors containing death domains. However, no death domain has thus far been identified in Hid, prompting us to determine whether caspase-8 was activated by recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD. Since Jurkat cells with a deletion in the FADD gene were susceptible to Hid-induced apoptosis, our data suggest a FADD-independent mechanism of caspase-8 activation described in other systems (13Besnault L.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3139-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Caspases similar to caspase-8 (DREDD, Ref. 41Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and caspase-9 (DRONC, Ref. 42Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have been described in the apoptotic machinery inDrosophila. However, death receptor signaling has not so far been demonstrated in flies. It should be noted that a deficiency that removed the DREDD gene suppressed Hid-induced apoptosis in the fly eye (43Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L. Mills K. Colussi P.A. Chen P. Coombe M. Abrams J. Kumar S Richardson H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Hid-induced apoptosis and its regulation appears to be highly conserved in mammalian cells (19Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C. Wei C.L. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4936-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our analysis in mammalian cells proposes a model of Hid interaction with the caspase-network and members of the Bcl-2 family that may likely be conserved in flies as well. Cell survival in most tissues is dependent on survival cues from neighboring cells or the extracellular matrix. Thus, it is of interest to understand the mechanisms by which molecules such as trophic factors block intrinsic death programs. EGF signaling via Erk has been reported to block Hid-induced apoptosis in Drosophila (44Bergmann A. Tugentman M. Shilo B.Z Steller H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that caspase-8 is an intermediate in a death pathway in T cells where both caspase processing and apoptosis are blocked by MEK1/2. Thus, inhibition of a Hid-like molecule may be a conserved component of trophic factor-mediated survival in Drosophila and mammalian cells. We thank Gaiti Hasan, M. K. Mathew, and K.
