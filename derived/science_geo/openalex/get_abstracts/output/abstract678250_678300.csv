Qin et al . found that doping a tin selenide thermoelectric material with lead and sodium improved the room temperature thermoelectric properties, an effect created by manipulation of the electronic bands. The authors showed that the material could be used not only for power generation but also cooling. If optimal contact materials are identified, then this approach may be attractive for future applications. —BG"
https://openalex.org/W3184541229,"Centenarians have a decreased susceptibility to ageing-associated illnesses, chronic inflammation and infectious diseases1–3. Here we show that centenarians have a distinct gut microbiome that is enriched in microorganisms that are capable of generating unique secondary bile acids, including various isoforms of lithocholic acid (LCA): iso-, 3-oxo-, allo-, 3-oxoallo- and isoallolithocholic acid. Among these bile acids, the biosynthetic pathway for isoalloLCA had not been described previously. By screening 68 bacterial isolates from the faecal microbiota of a centenarian, we identified Odoribacteraceae strains as effective producers of isoalloLCA both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes 5α-reductase (5AR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSDH) were responsible for the production of isoalloLCA. IsoalloLCA exerted potent antimicrobial effects against Gram-positive (but not Gram-negative) multidrug-resistant pathogens, including Clostridioides difficile and Enterococcus faecium. These findings suggest that the metabolism of specific bile acids may be involved in reducing the risk of infection with pathobionts, thereby potentially contributing to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. The microbiota of centenarians (aged 100 years and older) comprise gut microorganisms that are capable of generating unique secondary bile acids, including isoallolithocholic acid, a bile acid with potent antimicrobial effects against Gram-positive—but not Gram-negative—multidrug-resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3186830867,"Evening out the heat The conversion of precursors into the active layer of perovskite solar cells normally occurs by heating the underlying substrate. Conversion tends to occur near the top of the film, where solvent is lost, and unwanted preheating of reactants occurs near the substrate before the reaction. Li et al . show that the use of a surrounding heat transfer oil (anisole) leads to more rapid and even heating, removes solvent, and avoids air and water contamination effects. The larger grains and more uniform films led a much greater retention of efficiency in moving from small-area to large-area devices. —PDS"

However, Tummino et al . deliver a cautionary tale, finding that many leads from such screens have an antiviral effect in cells through phospholipidosis, a phospholipid storage disorder that can be induced by cationic amphiphilic drugs (see the Perspective by Edwards and Hartung). There is a strong correlation between drug-induced phospholipidosis and inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in cells. Unfortunately, drugs that have an antiviral effect in cells through phospholipidosis are unlikely to be effective in vivo. Screening out such drugs may allow a focus on drugs with better clinical potential. —VV"

However, molecular insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in Vibrio cholerae's resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are widespread in γ-proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances."
https://openalex.org/W3184663355,"<h2>Summary</h2> Environmental light cycles entrain circadian feeding behaviors in animals that produce rhythms in exposure to foodborne bacteria. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota generates diurnal rhythms in innate immunity that synchronize with feeding rhythms to anticipate microbial exposure. Rhythmic expression of antimicrobial proteins was driven by daily rhythms in epithelial attachment by segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), members of the mouse intestinal microbiota. Rhythmic SFB attachment was driven by the circadian clock through control of feeding rhythms. Mechanistically, rhythmic SFB attachment activated an immunological circuit involving group 3 innate lymphoid cells. This circuit triggered oscillations in epithelial STAT3 expression and activation that produced rhythmic antimicrobial protein expression and caused resistance to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium infection to vary across the day-night cycle. Thus, host feeding rhythms synchronize with the microbiota to promote rhythms in intestinal innate immunity that anticipate exogenous microbial exposure."

How its biophysical properties are regulated has remained elusive. Wu et al . found that the RNA helicase DDX21 forms a shell coating each FC/DFC unit in the nucleolus (see the Perspective by Yamazaki and Hirose). The authors found that a long noncoding RNA called SLERT facilitates the transition from the open to the closed configuration of the helicase using a chaperone-like mechanism. DDX21 in the closed conformation forms loose clusters that confer the FC/DFC unit sufficient liquidity and space required for Pol I processivity. In addition, DDX21 within the loose clusters cannot approach and wrap rDNA, thus licensing rDNA for transcription. —DJ"

Much of the cell’s volume is accounted for by a large central vacuole, the membrane of which, the tonoplast, is not so mechanically constrained. Radin et al . studied how and where plant cells use Piezo sensors. Plant homologs of the animal mechanosensitive channels are found not in the plasma membrane but rather in the tonoplast.

https://openalex.org/W3185299425,"The genetic effect-size distribution of a disease describes the number of risk variants, the range of their effect sizes and sample sizes that will be required to discover them. Accurate estimation has been a challenge. Here I propose Fourier Mixture Regression (FMR), validating that it accurately estimates real and simulated effect-size distributions. Applied to summary statistics for ten diseases (average $$N_{\textrm{eff}} = 169,000$$ ), FMR estimates that 100,000–1,000,000 cases will be required for genome-wide significant SNPs to explain 50% of SNP heritability. In such large studies, genome-wide significance becomes increasingly conservative, and less stringent thresholds achieve high true positive rates if confounding is controlled. Across traits, polygenicity varies, but the range of their effect sizes is similar. Compared with effect sizes in the top 10% of heritability, including most discovered thus far, those in the bottom 10–50% are orders of magnitude smaller and more numerous, spanning a large fraction of the genome. Fourier Mixture Regression (FMR) is a method for estimating common-variant effect-size distributions. Applying FMR to summary statistics for complex traits from the UK Biobank shows that heritability is spread across a wide range of effect sizes."

Across >325,000 perturbations, we provide evidence that CREs can regulate multiple genes, skip over the nearest gene and display activating and/or silencing effects.

Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin, TSLP expression correlated directly with sebum-associated gene expression. Thus, we establish a paradigm in which adipose loss can be achieved by means of sebum hypersecretion and uncover a role for adaptive immunity in skin barrier function through sebum secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3185409663,"The 11 zinc finger (ZF) protein CTCF regulates topologically associating domain formation and transcription through selective binding to thousands of genomic sites. Here, we replaced endogenous CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells with green-fluorescent-protein-tagged wild-type or mutant proteins lacking individual ZFs to identify additional determinants of CTCF positioning and function. While ZF1 and ZF8-ZF11 are not essential for cell survival, ZF8 deletion strikingly increases the DNA binding off-rate of mutant CTCF, resulting in reduced CTCF chromatin residence time. Loss of ZF8 results in widespread weakening of topologically associating domains, aberrant gene expression and increased genome-wide DNA methylation. Thus, important chromatin-templated processes rely on accurate CTCF chromatin residence time, which we propose depends on local sequence and chromatin context as well as global CTCF protein concentration."

Avy expressivity is sensitive to a range of early-life chemical exposures and nutritional interventions, suggesting that environmental perturbations can have long-lasting effects on the methylome. However, the extent to which VM-IAP elements are environmentally labile with phenotypic implications is unknown. Using a recently identified repertoire of VM-IAPs, we assessed the epigenetic effects of different environmental contexts. A longitudinal aging analysis indicated that VM-IAPs are stable across the murine lifespan, with only small increases in DNA methylation detected for a subset of loci. No significant effects were observed after maternal exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A, an obesogenic diet or methyl donor supplementation. A genetic mouse model of abnormal folate metabolism exhibited shifted VM-IAP methylation levels and altered VM-IAP-associated gene expression, yet these effects are likely largely driven by differential targeting by polymorphic KRAB zinc finger proteins. We conclude that epigenetic variability at retrotransposons is not predictive of environmental susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3185193799,"Nonresponse, or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer (CRC) highlight the importance of finding potential tolerance mechanisms. Low expression of major histocompatibility complex, class I (MHC-I) on the cell surface of the tumor is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape from T-cell recognition and destruction. In this study, we demonstrated that a high level of calnexin (CANX) in the tumors is positively correlated with the overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. CANX is a chaperone protein involved in the folding and assembly of MHC-I molecules. Using miRNA target prediction databases and luciferase assays, we identified miR-148a-3p as a potential regulator of CANX. Inhibition of miR-148a-3p restores surface levels of MHC-I and significantly enhanced the effects of CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune attack in vitro and in vivo by promoting CANX expression. These results reveal that miR-148a-3p can function as a tumor promotor in CRC by targeting the CANX/MHC-I axis, which provides a rationale for immunotherapy through targeting the miR-148a-3p/CANX/MHC-I pathway in patients with CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3185480713,"The behavioral strategies that mammals use to learn multi-step routes are unknown. In this study, we investigated how mice navigate to shelter in response to threats when the direct path is blocked. Initially, they fled toward the shelter and negotiated obstacles using sensory cues. Within 20 min, they spontaneously adopted a subgoal strategy, initiating escapes by running directly to the obstacle’s edge. Mice continued to escape in this manner even after the obstacle had been removed, indicating use of spatial memory. However, standard models of spatial learning—habitual movement repetition and internal map building—did not explain how subgoal memories formed. Instead, mice used a hybrid approach: memorizing salient locations encountered during spontaneous ‘practice runs’ to the shelter. This strategy was also used during a geometrically identical food-seeking task. These results suggest that subgoal memorization is a fundamental strategy by which rodents learn efficient multi-step routes in new environments. Shamash et al. examine how mice learn to get past an obstacle blocking their path to a goal. They found that mice instinctively adopt a subgoal memory strategy, which combines elements from both habitual learning and the cognitive map theory."

When members of the butterfly and moth family are targeted by wasps, a protein family has evolved that is horizontally carried by viruses—and sometimes is incorporated into the host genome—and impairs the ability of parasitoid offspring to fully develop and emerge. Characterizing the ability of this protein to protect hosts against specific parasites, the authors document an ongoing host-parasite evolutionary arms race. —LMZ"

The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and determinants of NCD risk factors in Nepal, a low-income country, in which two-thirds (66%) of annual deaths are attributable to NCDs.A nationally representative NCD risk factors STEPS survey (instrument version 3.2), was conducted between February and May 2019, among 6,475 eligible participants of age 15-69 years sampled from all 7 provinces through multistage sampling process. Data collection involved assessment of behavioral and biochemical risk factors. Complex survey analysis was completed in STATA 15, along with Poisson regression modelling to examine associations between covariates and risk factor prevalence.The most prevalent risk factor was consumption of less than five servings of fruit and vegetables a day (97%; 95% CI: 94.3-98.0). Out of total participants, 17% (95% CI: 15.1-19.1) were current smoker, 6.8% (95% CI: 5.3-8.2) were consuming ≥60g/month alcohol per month and 7.4% (95% CI:5.7-10.1) were having low level of physical activity. Approximately, 24.3% (95% CI: 21.6-27.2) were overweight or obese (BMI≥25kg/m2) while 24.5% (95% CI: 22.4-26.7) and 5.8% (95% CI: 4.3-7.3) had raised blood pressure (BP) and raised blood glucose respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of raised total cholesterol was 11% (95% CI: 9.6-12.6). Sex and education level of participants were statistically associated with smoking, harmful alcohol use and raised BP. Participants of age 30-44 years and 45-69 years were found to have increased risk of overweight, raised BP, raised blood sugar and raised blood cholesterol. Similarly, participants in richest wealth quintile had higher odds of insufficient physical inactivity, overweight and raised blood cholesterol. On average, each participant had 2 NCD related risk factors (2.04, 95% CI: 2.02-2.08).A large portion of the Nepalese population are living with a variety of NCD risk factors.

https://openalex.org/W3183191385,"Running exercise has beneficial effects on brain health. However, the effects of relatively short-term running exercise (STEx) on behavior, and its underlying signaling pathways, are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the possibility that the regulation by STEx of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, encoded by NOS1), which are important molecules for anxiety regulation, might involve mechanisms of epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into sedentary (SED, n = 12) and STEx (EX, n = 15) groups; STEx was conducted with the mice for a duration of 11 days. STEx reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and STEx reduced Nos1α and increased Bdnf exon I and IV mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, behavioral parameters were associated with Bdnf exon I and IV and Nos1α mRNA levels in the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampal region. However, STEx had no effect on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (Pgc-1α) or fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (Fndc5) mRNA levels, which are relatively long-term exercise-induced upstream regulators of BDNF. In parallel with gene expression changes, we found, for the first time, that STEx downregulated Bdnf promoter IV and upregulated Nos1 DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus, and these patterns were partially different between the dorsal and ventral regions. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of running exercise on mood regulation may be controlled by alterations in epigenetic mechanisms, especially in the ventral hippocampus. These effects occur even after a relatively short-term period of exercise."

Sustainable control strategies aimed at increasing biological control approaches and decreasing chemical inputs are required, due to the tendency to develop insecticide resistance. In this study, the lethal and sublethal effects of four chemical insecticides (abamectin, indoxacarb, chlorantraniliprole, and spinosad) and the sublethal effects of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) on a widespread TLM egg parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko, were estimated. Concentration mortality response bioassays enabled the estimation of lethal concentrations of the tested insecticides for the parasitoids, with chlorantraniliprole having the lowest LC50 and indoxacarb the highest. The LC25 and LC50 of the tested insecticides on the TLM were sprayed on eggs and then offered at three time intervals to the parasitoids. The fertility and other life table parameters of the individuals emerging from the treated eggs were estimated. All of the chemical insecticides, but not the fungus, had harmful effects on T. brassicae. The insecticide applications caused a 3.84-5.17 times reduction in the net reproductive rate (R0) compared with the control. No parameters were affected by spraying the fungus in the 0h treatment, but effects were recorded at 24 and/or 48h, except for the gross reproduction rate (GRR). The value of the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) also decreased to 0.528-0.617 after the insecticide treatments. The doubling time (DT) increased in all treatments compared to the control. Nevertheless, the generation time (T) was only very slightly affected. In addition, in the combination experiments, M. anisopliae showed a remarkable synergism with T. brassicae in controlling TLM eggs. These results indicate that low levels of lethal effects on key biological control agents should be considered in the choice of insecticides to be included in sustainable TLM control packages."

Here, we find that approximately half of lipoproteins destined to the Escherichia coli outer membrane display an intrinsically disordered linker at their N terminus. Intrinsically disordered regions are common in proteins, but establishing their importance in vivo has remained challenging. As we sought to unravel how lipoproteins mature, we discovered that unstructured linkers are required for optimal trafficking by the Lol lipoprotein sorting system, whereby linker deletion re-routes three unrelated lipoproteins to the inner membrane. Focusing on the stress sensor RcsF, we found that replacing the linker with an artificial peptide restored normal outer-membrane targeting only when the peptide was of similar length and disordered. Overall, this study reveals the role played by intrinsic disorder in lipoprotein sorting, providing mechanistic insight into the biogenesis of these proteins and suggesting that evolution can select for intrinsic disorder that supports protein function."

Changing the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane may provide means to compromise annexin-mediated repair and sensitize cells to injury. Since, cancer cells experience heightened membrane stress and are more dependent on efficient plasma membrane repair, inhibiting repair may provide approaches to sensitize cancer cells to plasma membrane damage and cell death. Here, we show that derivatives of phenothiazines, which have widespread use in the fields of psychiatry and allergy treatment, strongly sensitize cancer cells to mechanical-, chemical-, and heat-induced injury by inhibiting annexin-mediated plasma membrane repair. Using a combination of cell biology, biophysics, and computer simulations, we show that trifluoperazine acts by thinning the membrane bilayer, making it more fragile and prone to ruptures. Secondly, it decreases annexin binding by compromising the lateral diffusion of phosphatidylserine, inhibiting the ability of annexins to curve and shape membranes, which is essential for their function in plasma membrane repair.

https://openalex.org/W3185309451,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating complication of many chronic disease states and disuse conditions including denervation. However, molecular and signaling mechanisms of muscle wasting remain less understood. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of several toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signaling adaptor, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), are induced in skeletal muscle of mice in response to sciatic nerve denervation. Muscle-specific ablation of MyD88 mitigates denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Targeted ablation of MyD88 suppresses the components of ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, and FOXO transcription factors in skeletal muscle during denervation. We also found that specific inhibition of MyD88 reduces the activation of canonical nuclear factor-kappa (NF-κB) pathway and expression of receptors for inflammatory cytokines in denervated muscle. In contrast, inhibition of MyD88 stimulates the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling in denervated skeletal muscle. Ablation of MyD88 also inhibits the denervation-induced increase in phosphorylation of AMPK without having any effect on the phosphorylation of mTOR. Moreover, targeted ablation of MyD88 inhibits the activation of a few components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, especially X-box protein 1 (XBP1). Importantly, myofiber-specific ablation of XBP1 mitigates denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Collectively, our experiments suggest that TLR-MyD88 signaling mediates skeletal muscle wasting during denervation potentially through the activation of canonical NF-κB signaling, AMPK and UPR pathways."

The metastatic drivers of TNBCs are still poorly understood, and effective treatment non-existent. Here we reveal that the presence of Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA) in the nucleus and metastatic dissemination are molecularly connected through HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1) signaling. Nuclear AURKA activates transcription of “hypoxia-induced genes” under normoxic conditions (pseudohypoxia) and without upregulation of oxygen-sensitive HIF1A subunit. We uncover that AURKA preferentially binds to HIF1B and co-localizes with the HIF complex on DNA. The mass-spectrometry analysis of the AURKA complex further confirmed the presence of CBP and p300 along with other TFIIB/RNApol II components. Importantly, the expression of multiple HIF-dependent genes induced by nuclear AURKA (N-AURKA), including migration/invasion, survival/death, and stemness, promote early cancer dissemination. These results indicate that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, AURKA is a novel driver of early metastasis. Analysis of clinical tumor specimens revealed a correlation between N-AURKA presence and decreased patient survival. Our results establish a mechanistic link between two critical pathways in cancer metastasis, identifying nuclear AURKA as a crucial upstream regulator of the HIF1 transcription complex and a target for anti-metastatic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3185371274,"Insulin receptor (IR) is a membrane tyrosine kinase that mediates the response of cells to insulin. IR activity has been shown to be modulated by changes in plasma membrane lipid composition, but the properties and structural determinants of lipids mediating IR activity are poorly understood. Here, using efficient methyl-alpha-cyclodextrin mediated lipid exchange, we studied the effect of altering plasma membrane outer leaflet phospholipid composition upon the activity of IR in mammalian cells. After substitution of endogenous lipids with lipids having an ability to form liquid ordered (Lo) domains (sphingomyelins) or liquid disordered (Ld) domains (unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PCs)), we found that the propensity of lipids to form ordered domains is required for high IR activity. Additional substitution experiments using a series of saturated PCs showed that IR activity increased substantially with increasing acyl chain length, which increases both bilayer width and the propensity to form ordered domains. Incorporating purified IR into alkyl maltoside micelles with increasing hydrocarbon lengths also increased IR activity, but more modestly than by increasing lipid acyl chain length in cells. These results suggest that the ability to form Lo domains as well as wide bilayer width contributes to increased IR activity. Inhibition of phosphatases showed that some of the lipid dependence of IR activity upon lipid structure reflected protection from phosphatases by lipids that support Lo domain formation. These results are consistent with a model in which a combination of bilayer width and ordered domain formation modulates IR activity via IR conformation and accessibility to phosphatases."

Potential treatment strategies against COVID-19 are yet to be devised. It is crucial that antivirals that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle be identified and developed. 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is an attractive antiviral drug target against SARS-CoV-2, and coronaviruses in general, because of its role in the processing of viral polyproteins. Inhibitors of 3CLpro activity are screened in enzyme assays before further development of the most promising leads. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a common additive used in such assays and enhances the solubility of assay components. However, it may also potentially affect the stability and efficiency of 3CLpro but, to date, this effect had not been analyzed in detail. Here, we investigated the effect of DMSO on 3CLpro-catalyzed reaction. While DMSO (5%-20%) decreased the optimum temperature of catalysis and thermodynamic stability of 3CLpro, it only marginally affected the kinetic stability of the enzyme. Increasing the DMSO concentration up to 20% improved the catalytic efficiency and peptide-binding affinity of 3CLpro. At such high DMSO concentration, the solubility and stability of peptide substrate were improved because of reduced aggregation. In conclusion, we recommend 20% DMSO as the minimum concentration to be used in screens of 3CLpro inhibitors as lead compounds for the development of antiviral drugs against COVID-19."

Could oligomerization that ensures high local concentrations of catalytic sites necessary for efficient neurotransmission be affected by environmental factors? Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-EM, we demonstrate that homodimerization of recombinant monomeric human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) in solution occurs through a C-terminal four-helix bundle at micromolar concentrations. We show that diethylphosphorylation of the active serine in the catalytic gorge or isopropylmethylphosphonylation by the RP enantiomer of sarin promotes a 10-fold increase in homodimer dissociation. We also demonstrate the dissociation of organophosphate (OP)-conjugated dimers is reversed by structurally diverse oximes 2PAM, HI6, or RS194B, as demonstrated by SAXS of diethylphosphoryl-hAChE. However, binding of oximes to the native ligand-free hAChE, binding of high-affinity reversible ligands, or formation of an SP-sarin-hAChE conjugate had no effect on homodimerization. Dissociation monitored by time-resolved SAXS occurs in milliseconds, consistent with rates of hAChE covalent inhibition. OP-induced dissociation was not observed in the SAXS profiles of the double-mutant Y337A/F338A, where the active center gorge volume is larger than in wildtype hAChE. These observations suggest a key role of the tightly packed acyl pocket in allosterically triggered OP-induced dimer dissociation, with the potential for local reduction of acetylcholine-hydrolytic power in situ. Computational models predict allosteric correlated motions extending from the acyl pocket toward the four-helix bundle dimerization interface 25 Å away."
https://openalex.org/W3184629770,"Acute hypoxia has previously been suggested to potentiate resistance training-induced hypertrophy by activating satellite cell-dependent myogenesis rather than an improvement in protein balance in human. Here, we tested this hypothesis after a 4-week hypoxic vs normoxic resistance training protocol. For that purpose, 19 physically active male subjects were recruited to perform 6 sets of 10 repetitions of a one-leg knee extension exercise at 80% 1-RM 3 times/week for 4 weeks in normoxia (FiO2 : 0.21; n = 9) or in hypoxia (FiO2 : 0.135, n = 10). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were taken before and after the training period. Muscle fractional protein synthetic rate was measured over the whole period by deuterium incorporation into the protein pool and muscle thickness by ultrasound. At the end of the training protocol, the strength gain was higher in the hypoxic vs the normoxic group despite no changes in muscle thickness and in the fractional protein synthetic rate. Only early myogenesis, as assessed by higher MyoD and Myf5 mRNA levels, appeared to be enhanced by hypoxia compared to normoxia. No effects were found on myosin heavy chain expression, markers of oxidative metabolism and lactate transport in the skeletal muscle. Though the present study failed to unravel clearly the mechanisms by which hypoxic resistance training is particularly potent to increase muscle strength, it is important message to keep in mind that this training strategy could be effective for all athletes looking at developing and optimizing their maximal muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W3187063411,"N-glycosylation is one of the most abundant posttranslational modifications of proteins, essential for many physiological processes, including protein folding, protein stability, oligomerization and aggregation, and molecular recognition events. Defects in the N-glycosylation pathway cause diseases that are classified as congenital disorders of glycosylation. The ability to manipulate protein N-glycosylation is critical not only to our fundamental understanding of biology but also for the development of new drugs for a wide range of human diseases. Chemoenzymatic synthesis using engineered endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) has been used extensively to modulate the chemistry of N-glycosylated proteins. However, defining the molecular mechanisms by which ENGases specifically recognize and process N-glycans remains a major challenge. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of the ENGase EndoBT-3987 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in complex with a hybrid-type glycan product. In combination with alanine scanning mutagenesis, molecular docking calculations and enzymatic activity measurements conducted on a chemically engineered monoclonal antibody substrate unveil two mechanisms for hybrid-type recognition and processing by paradigmatic ENGases. Altogether, the experimental data provide pivotal insight into the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and specificity for GH18 ENGases and further advance our understanding of chemoenzymatic synthesis and remodeling of homogeneous N-glycan glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W3186327404,"In mammals, including sheep and mice, lactation attenuates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and plasma cortisol concentration. Oxytocin, one neuropeptide present in the blood during lactation, may contribute to such stress attenuation. Providing oxytocin intra-nasally increases plasma oxytocin concentration in cattle and can be used in non-lactating cows to mirror plasma oxytocin concentration of lactating cows. Therefore, our hypothesis was that there would be no difference in plasma cortisol between non-lactating beef cows intra-nasally administered oxytocin and lactating beef cows intra-nasally treated with saline. Twenty Bos taurus cows were randomly allocated by lactational status to one of four treatments, in a 2×2 factorial arrangement: 1) Non-lactating, saline (NL-S; n = 5); 2) Non-lactating, oxytocin (NL-OXT; n = 5); 3) Lactating, saline (L-S; n = 5); and 4) Lactating, oxytocin (L-OXT; n = 5). Two hours pre-treatment, cows were catheterized, moved to their appropriate chute and baseline blood samples were collected at -60, -45, -30, and 0 minutes before treatments were administered. Directly following the 0-minute sample, cows were administered their intra-nasal treatment via a mucosal atomization device. Subsequently, blood was collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 minutes. Non-lactating cows had greater (P = 0.02) plasma cortisol concentration compared with lactating cows. There was no lactation by treatment interactions for either plasma cortisol (P = 0.55) or oxytocin (P = 0.89) concentration. Although a treatment by time interaction was identified for oxytocin (P < 0.0001), there was no main effect of lactation on plasma oxytocin concentration (P = 0.34). Similar oxytocin and dissimilar cortisol concentration in lactating and non-lactating cows indicate that oxytocin alone cannot be responsible for reduced plasma cortisol in lactating ruminants. Further investigations are needed to elucidate alternative mechanisms that may be involved in the stress hypo-responsive condition of lactating mammals."

https://openalex.org/W3184014850,"Food resource access can mediate establishment success in invasive species, and generalist herbivorous insects are thought to rely on mechanisms of transcriptional plasticity to respond to dietary variation. While asexually reproducing invasives typically have low genetic variation, the twofold reproductive capacity of asexual organisms is a marked advantage for colonization. We studied host-related transcriptional acclimation in parthenogenetic, invasive, and polyphagous weevils: Naupactus cervinus and N. leucoloma. We analyzed patterns of gene expression in three gene categories that can mediate weevil-host plant interactions through identification of suitable host plants, short-term acclimation to host plant defenses, and long-term adaptation to host plant defenses and their pathogens. This approach employed comparative transcriptomic methods to investigate differentially expressed host detection, detoxification, immune defense genes, and pathway-level gene set enrichment. Our results show that weevil gene expression responses can be host plant-specific, and that elements of that response can be maintained in the offspring. Some host plant groups, such as legumes, appear to be more taxing as they elicit a complex gene expression response which is both strong in intensity and specific in identity. However, the weevil response to taxing host plants shares many differentially expressed genes with other stressful situations, such as host plant cultivation conditions and transition to novel host, suggesting that there is an evolutionarily favorable shared gene expression regime for responding to different types of stressful situations. Modulating gene expression in the absence of other avenues for phenotypic adaptation may be an important mechanism of successful colonization for these introduced insects."
https://openalex.org/W3184025983,"There9s emerging evidence that weight and health can be uncoupled. Many researchers and doctors—and broader societies—take it as given that obesity means ill health. In fact, some say, the two don9t inevitably go hand in hand. Researchers worldwide are studying genes, animal models, and humans to understand how factors such as the bodily distribution of fat and its nature can blunt or compound any health impacts of extra weight. The researchers are also working to define metabolically healthy obesity and examine how common it is and how long it persists. Beyond the research lies a knotty practical question: what the science means for people with obesity and the doctors they see."
https://openalex.org/W3187049038,"Since prenatal glucocorticoids (GC) excess increases the risk of metabolic dysfunctions in the offspring and its effect on β-cell recovery capacity remains unknown we investigated these aspects in offspring from mice treated with dexamethasone (DEX) in the late pregnancy. Half of the pups were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) on the sixth postnatal day (PN). Functional and molecular analyses were performed in male offspring on PN25 and PN225. Prenatal DEX treatment resulted in low birth weight. At PN25, both the STZ-treated offspring developed hyperglycemia and had lower β-cell mass, in parallel with higher α-cell mass and glucose intolerance, with no impact of prenatal DEX on such parameters. At PN225, the β-cell mass was partially recovered in the STZ-treated mice, but they remained glucose-intolerant, irrespective of being insulin sensitive. Prenatal exposition to DEX predisposed adult offspring to sustained hyperglycemia and perturbed islet function (lower insulin and higher glucagon response to glucose) in parallel with exacerbated glucose intolerance. β-cell-specific knockdown of the Hnf4α in mice from the DS group resulted in exacerbated glucose intolerance. We conclude that high GC exposure during the prenatal period exacerbates the metabolic dysfunctions in adult life of mice exposed to STZ early in life, resulting in a lesser ability to recover the islets’ function over time. This study alerts to the importance of proper management of exogenous GCs during pregnancy and a healthy postnatal lifestyle since the combination of adverse factors during the prenatal and postnatal period accentuates the predisposition to metabolic disorders in adult life."
https://openalex.org/W3183388409,"“This is only temporary,” I told myself as I switched from pursuing my Ph.D. research to being a COVID-19 diagnostic technician. During the summer, I had been volunteering in a diagnostic laboratory, assaying samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Now, the lab was offering to take over paying my stipend, tuition, and fees so I could commit more time to that work—and so my Ph.D. adviser wouldn't have to support me while I did so. My research progress and graduation were my priority. At the same time, I wanted to continue to do my part to protect my community from the pandemic, as well as help out the lab and ease my adviser's financial burden. I was torn between the needs of my community and my personal needs.



> “I am grateful my skills were useful during the pandemic.” 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I had spent several years working at state veterinary diagnostic laboratories. I enjoyed the diagnostic work, but I wanted to pursue Ph.D.-level research. Four years in, everything was going well as I learned how to combine the precision and speed from my diagnostic training with the flexible thinking and creativity needed for research.

Then, of course, the pandemic hit. My research was mostly stalled as my lab was closed, and I was feeling helpless and frustrated at home. I was interested to learn about a public health effort to track the virus in our community, a collaboration between my university and the county health department—and that veterinary diagnostic labs were pitching in. I realized I had the knowledge and training to help with the project, called TRACE COVID-19. Despite having left diagnostics, now was not the time to focus on my personal career goals. I was done watching from the sidelines.

Initially, I volunteered in the diagnostic lab 8 to 10 hours a day, a few times a week. It seemed like a rewarding use of my excess time. But my adviser didn't approve. He was paying me, after all, and didn't think I should be dedicating time to diagnostics. Still, I continued to volunteer through the summer months, using the time when I would otherwise be quarantining at home. When my research lab opened at limited capacity, volunteering did not hinder my research progress.

But when the diagnostic laboratory offered to fund me, I faced a dilemma. I worried that if the diagnostic lab took over my funding, it might be logistically challenging to fully return to my Ph.D. research when the time came. At the same time, I didn't want to abandon my work with the diagnostic lab. My adviser also encouraged me to keep working for TRACE, saying it would augment my CV. So, I naively forged ahead, thinking I could work on my research in my spare time.

Instead, TRACE consumed my life. The number of samples delivered daily was overwhelming, and in the evenings, I faced the onslaught alone. I skipped meals and neglected exercise, and my mental health suffered. But I kept telling myself it was only temporary.

By the end of the fall term, I was burned out and ready to transition back to research. To my dismay, my adviser was running low on funding. My “temporary” decision was looking more and more permanent, and what had begun as rewarding work was becoming a ball and chain.

Extricating myself took flexibility, creativity, and patience. I reached out to faculty members for advice and support, and everyone was willing to help—something I had forgotten during my isolation in the diagnostic lab. One of them encouraged me to apply for a position at a local biotech company. I was thrilled when the company offered me the job, as well as the funding I needed to complete my degree. My way forward was now clear.

I don't regret my time with the TRACE project, despite the sacrifices to my research progress and mental health. I am grateful my skills were useful during the pandemic. And I've learned that, when I encounter detours and setbacks on my career path, I should look to the bigger picture and remind myself that it's only temporary."
https://openalex.org/W3184987450,"Sentiment analysis is an evolving field of study that employs artificial intelligence techniques to identify the emotions and opinions expressed in a given text. Applying sentiment analysis to study the billions of messages that circulate in popular online social media platforms has raised numerous opportunities for exploring the emotional expressions of their users. In this paper we combine sentiment analysis with natural language processing and topic analysis techniques and conduct two different studies to examine whether engagement in entrepreneurship is associated with more positive emotions expressed on Twitter. In study 1, we investigate three samples with 6.717.308, 13.253.244, and 62.067.509 tweets respectively. We find that entrepreneurs express more positive emotions than non-entrepreneurs for most topics. We also find that social entrepreneurs express more positive emotions, and that serial entrepreneurs express less positive emotions than other entrepreneurs. In study 2, we use 21.491.962 tweets to explore 37.225 job-status changes by individuals who entered or quit entrepreneurship. We find that a job change to entrepreneurship is associated with a shift in the expression of emotions to more positive ones."
https://openalex.org/W3185411118,"A post-marketing study was performed on all patients who had started treatment with iguratimod, a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug approved in Japan. During the study period, various safety measures were implemented to reduce risks. We investigated the frequency of adverse drug reactions before and after implementation of each safety measure to examine the preventive effect of these measures. Post-hoc analysis was performed using data from all-case surveillance of iguratimod. The subjects were all of the patients receiving iguratimod for whom safety information was obtained. To identify the time after starting administration when adverse drug reactions were most likely to occur, a generalized linear mixed-effect model was applied for the period from initiation of administration until occurrence of reactions in each patient. The mean incidence of adverse drug reactions per patient was compared before and after the implementation of safety measures by using generalized estimating equations based on a two-sided test, 95% confidence interval, and 5% significance level. The number of patients treated with iguratimod was not related to changes in the number of patients with adverse drug reactions. After implementing precautions regarding co-administration with warfarin and liver dysfunction, the estimated mean incidence rate of adverse drug reactions (95% confidence interval) decreased significantly to 0.73 (0.59-0.90) and 0.72 (0.55-0.94), respectively. Accordingly, some of the implementation of safety measures significantly reduced adverse drug reactions. The effectiveness of safety measures implemented during the all-case surveillance of iguratimod was evaluated, revealing that early implementation of safety measures decreased the incidence of adverse drug reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3186217150,"We hypothesized that the click perceived when puncturing the dura-arachnoid with fine-gauge spinal needles can be subjectively identified, and investigated whether it may be distinguishable among different needle types.Subjective and objective evaluations were performed. First, physicians punctured the polyamide film or porcine dura mater (n = 70 and n = 20, respectively) with seven types of spinal needles and numerically evaluated the perceived click sensations. Using an 11-point numerical rating scale (from ""0"" for ""no click sensation"" to ""10"" for ""the strongest click perceived"") data, subjective differentiation among needle types was assessed. Second, in the objective part of the study, total forces elicited by polyamide film or porcine dura mater punctures with each needle were measured using a biomechanical testing device, and load-displacement curves evaluated. Third, the results of subjective and objective evaluations were compared.All participants recognized the click and could discriminate among needles of different tip shape. The load-displacement curves for polyamide film and porcine dura mater were similar and needle-specific. The subjective numerical rating scale values corresponded well with the objectively measured changes in total forces (R2 = 0.862 and R2 = 0.881 for polyamide film and porcine dura mater, respectively), indicating that an increase in the largest drop in total force value of 0.30 N or 0.21 N would produce an increase of numerical rating scale value of 1 for polyamide film and porcine dura mater, respectively.We provide an objective proof of the click sensation felt upon dural puncture using different fine-gauge spinal needles. Click recognition could be used as an additional indicator of successful spinal puncture."
