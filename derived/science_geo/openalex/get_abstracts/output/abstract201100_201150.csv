https://openalex.org/W1965258196,A PREVIOUS communication1 reported that spores of a fungus identified as Sporidesmium bakeri Syd. contained the ‘beaker test’ substance found to be associated with toxicity of pasture samples on which the disease known as facial eczema had occurred.

https://openalex.org/W2047792055,"A RADIO-IODINATED protein, other than labelled thyroglobulin, has been found in the plasma of patients receiving radioiodine therapy for thyroid carcinoma1. Although this protein was associated with the albumin fraction of plasma protein, immunological techniques differentiated it from iodinated serum albumin2. The protein was detected after tracer doses of radioiodine (0.31–1 mc.) and was found only in malignant conditions1."

https://openalex.org/W1988661726,"THE synthesis of the chain-forming α-1: 4-bonds of potato starch (amylose + amylopectin) has for long been ascribed to phosphorylase acting on glucose-1-phosphate and a preformed starch-like primer1. We now report the synthesis of amylose-like material by another enzyme system from potato. This synthesis makes use of D-enzyme, discovered in 1953 by Peat and co-workers2. D-enzyme catalyses the reversible disproportionation of maltodextrins, the glucose oligosaccharides containing the α-1: 4-linkage. For example, maltotriose is acted on to give, as the first products of reaction, glucose and malto-pentaose, and at equilibrium glucose and a whole series of maltodextrins are present. However, with maltotriose as the initial substrate, none of the synthetic oligosaccharides is of sufficient length to form a coloured complex with iodine. The minimum length for colour formation is at least 12 glucose units3. Incubation of D-enzyme with a maltodextrin and glucose lowers the average length of the polymer because of transfer of some of its glucose residues to the added glucose. It was realized that a reversal of this procedure, the removal of glucose, should increase the length of the polymers and might ultimately result in the synthesis from a small maltodextrin molecule of an iodine-staining, amylose-like polysaccharide. If, in addition to D-enzyme, the potato is equipped with such a glucose-removing enzyme system, then it is presumably capable of synthesizing amylose by a route other than that provided by phosphorylase. A suitable glucose-removing system is hexokinase and adenosine tri-phosphate, and hexokinase is known to be in the potato4. This will convert glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, and D-enzyme does not transfer chain segments from maltodextrins to the sugar phosphate as it does to glucose5. The system (maltodextrin + D-enzyme + hexokinase + adenosine triphosphate) should therefore bring about amylose synthesis. This has been achieved."

https://openalex.org/W2092186431,"A MAJOR advance in the elucidation of nicotine metabolism was the demonstration by McKennis et al. 1 that dogs receiving nicotine excreted small amounts of γ-(3-pyridyl)-γ-methylaminobutyric acid and its lactam, cotinine. These workers favoured the view that cotinine was formed in urine by spontaneous lactamization of the acid. However, they also suggested that cotinine might be an intermediate in nicotine metabolism which was hydrolysed to the acid in vivo."

The usual method for determining these values is by dilatation measurements and the dilatometer is used fairly considerably for this work. There are, however, certain inherent errors in this type of measurement. It is stated that the calculation of liquid/solid content from dilatometric data is either not possible with any degree of accuracy1 or even that it is impossible2 with complex mixtures of glycerides. This arises from the fact that a prior knowledge of the glycerides present is required and that mathematical adjustment is needed to take account of the differert melting dilatations. Such prior knowledge is not always available."

https://openalex.org/W2075041560,"A PREVIOUS communication1 described the preparation of two crystalline hæmoproteins (556) and (566), which possess strong peroxidatic activity. It was found in later investigations2 that both hæmoproteins form complexes with hydrogen peroxide and are not reduced with diphosphopyridine nucleotide or succinate in the presence of an active homogenate or particles from wheat germ. This indicates that both hæmoproteins (556) and (566) are peroxidases and thus can be called peroxidase (556) and (566), respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1974143914,"METHODS of delaying pupation in D. melanogaster are not only of interest in relation to the physiology of metamorphosis but also provide useful tools for developmental-genetical studies. Up to the present, the main method available has been that of Beadle, Tatum and Clancy1. They kept larvæ, aged less than 70 hr., on a low food-level provided by 1.5 per cent agar and 0.25 per cent brewer's yeast. According to Bodenstein2 most of the larvæ starved in this way fail to survive, particularly, of course, those starved from early ages; moreover, the period for which pupation is delayed is highly variable, since in some cases larvæ pupate only one day late whereas in others the delay might be as much as five days."

https://openalex.org/W2019599165,"THE literature concerning insect proteins is, generally, represented by analyses of single developmental stages, usually immature, haemolymph being the principal fluid investigated. The results of these studies show that the protein component fluctuates during development1–4. This communication shows the variations for the protein component of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor, during its developmental stages. The method employed, electrophoresis, seems to be a useful facility for investigations of this nature, since electrophoretic patterns of proteins are distinctive. Specific pattern characteristics have been reported for developmental stages of mammals5, closely related species of reptiles6,7, and amphibians8,9."

https://openalex.org/W2063112997,"IN a recent communication, Drs. A. Fiori and M. Marigo1 described the identification of meprobamate by adsorption chromatography on chromatoplates. Their method is both complex and laborious compared with the technique of paper chromatography, but was advocated because meprobamate appeared to be insoluble in water and because there were no available methods for detecting it on paper."
