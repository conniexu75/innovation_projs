https://openalex.org/W2947611747,"Accurately predicting reference evapotranspiration (ET0) with limited climatic data is crucial for irrigation scheduling design and agricultural water management. This study evaluated eight machine learning models in four categories, i.e. neuron-based (MLP, GRNN and ANFIS), kernel-based (SVM, KNEA), tree-based (M5Tree, XGBoost) and curve-based (MARS) models, for predicting daily ET0 with maximum/maximum temperature and precipitation data during 2001-2015 from 14 stations in various climatic regions of China, i.e., arid desert of northwest China (NWC), semi-arid steppe of Inner Mongolia (IM), Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), (semi-)humid cold-temperate northeast China (NEC), semi-humid warm-temperate north China (NC), humid subtropical central China (CC) and humid tropical south China (SC). The results showed machine learning models using only temperature data obtained satisfactory daily ET0 estimates (on average R2 = 0.829, RMSE = 0.718 mm day-1, NRMSE = 0.250 and MAE = 0.508 mm day-1). The prediction accuracy was improved by 7.6% across China when information of precipitation was further considered, particularly in (sub)tropical humid regions (by 9.7% in CC and 12.4% in SC). The kernel-based SVM, KNEA and curve-based MARS models generally outperformed the others in terms of prediction accuracy, with the best performance by KNEA in NWC and IM, by SVM in QTP, CC and SC, and very similar performance by them in NEC and NC. SVM (1.9%), MLP (2.0%), MARS (2.6%) and KNEA (6.4%) showed relatively small average increases in RMSE during testing compared with training RMSE. SVM is highly recommended for predicting daily ET0 across China in light of best accuracy and stability, while KNEA and MARS are also promising powerful models."
https://openalex.org/W2947397189,"Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays a fundamental role in irrigated agriculture. The objective of this study is to simulate monthly ET0 at a meteorological station in India using a new method, an improved support vector machine (SVM) based on the cuckoo algorithm (CA), which is known as SVM-CA. Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and sunshine hours were selected as inputs for the models used in the simulation. The results of the simulation using SVM-CA were compared with those from experimental models, genetic programming (GP), model tree (M5T) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The achieved results demonstrate that the proposed SVM-CA model is able to simulate ET0 more accurately than the GP, M5T and ANFIS models. Two major indicators, namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), indicated that the SVM-CA outperformed the other methods with respective reductions of 5–15% and 5–17% compared with the GP model, 12–21% and 10–22% compared with the M5T model, and 7–15% and 5–18% compared with the ANFIS model, respectively. Therefore, the proposed SVM-CA model has high potential for accurate simulation of monthly ET0 values compared with the other models."
https://openalex.org/W2947371868,"Solar energy is a major type of renewable energy, and its estimation is important for decision-makers. This study introduces a new prediction model for solar radiation based on support vector regression (SVR) and the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm. The new version of algorithm attempts to enhance the global search ability for the PSO. In practice, the SVR method has a few parameters that should be determined through a trial-and-error procedure while developing the prediction model. This procedure usually leads to non-optimal choices for these parameters and, hence, poor prediction accuracy. Therefore, there is a need to integrate the SVR model with an optimization algorithm to achieve optimal choices for these parameters. Thus, the IPSO algorithm, as an optimizer is integrated with SVR to obtain optimal values for the SVR parameters. To examine the proposed model, two solar radiation stations, Adana, Antakya and Konya, in Turkey, are considered for this study. In addition, different models have been tested for this prediction, namely, the M5 tree model (M5T), genetic programming (GP), SVR integrated with four different optimization algorithms SVR-PSO, SVR-IPSO, Genetic Algorithm (SVR-GA), FireFly Algorithm (SVR-FFA) and the multivariate adaptive regression (MARS) model. The sensitivity analysis is performed to achieve the highest accuracy level of the prediction by choosing different input parameters. Several performance measuring indices have been considered to examine the efficiency of all the prediction methods. The results show that SVR-IPSO outperformed M5T and MARS."
https://openalex.org/W2947663739,"Primary health care has been recognized as a critical strategy for improving population health in developing countries. This paper investigates the effect of primary care physicians on the infant mortality rate in Brazil using a dynamic panel data approach. This method accounts for the endogeneity problem and the persistence of infant mortality over time. The empirical analysis uses an eight-year panel of municipalities between 2005 and 2012. The results indicate that primary care physician supply contributed to the decline of infant mortality in Brazil. An increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with 7.08 fewer infant deaths per 10,000 live births. This suggests that, in addition to other determinants, primary care physicians can play an important role in accounting for the reduction of infant mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W2947789972,"Throughout the world, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HIV infection compared to heterosexual men. Little is known about awareness of HIV infection and other gaps in the HIV care continuum for MSM, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This information is urgently needed to address the HIV epidemic in this population. This study assessed gaps in the HIV care continuum among persons screened for participation in a multi-country prospective study that evaluated the feasibility of recruiting and retaining MSM for HIV prevention studies in SSA (HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 075, conducted in four cities in Kenya, Malawi, and South Africa). Participants were recruited using site-specific strategies, that included outreach and informal networks. Transgender women (TW) were eligible to participate. During screening, 601 MSM and TW were tested for HIV infection and asked about prior HIV testing, HIV status, engagement in care, and HIV treatment. Viral load testing and retrospective antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed for HIV-infected participants. Most participants (92.2%) had a prior HIV test; 42.1% were last tested >6 months earlier. HIV prevalence was 30.4%. HIV infection was associated with older age and identifying as female or transgender; 43.7% of the HIV-infected participants were newly diagnosed, especially younger persons and persons with a less recent HIV test. Almost a third of previously-diagnosed participants were not linked to care. Most participants (88.7%) in care were on ARV treatment (ART). Only about one-quarter of all HIV-infected participants were virally suppressed. These findings demonstrate substantial prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection and sub-optimal HIV care engagement among MSM and TW in SSA. Increased HIV testing frequency and better linkage to care represent critical steps in preventing further HIV transmission in this population. Once in care, gaps in the HIV care continuum appear less critical."
https://openalex.org/W2947109500,"The software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm has simplified the management of computer networks by decoupling data and control planes. Moreover, the separation of the data and control planes has transitioned network complexity from traditional devices to controllers; therefore, controllers have become indispensable entities in SDN. Controllers have multiple features and direct the network from a central point and respond to updates to topological changes. However, the supportive capability of these features is strong in one controller but weak in another. Due to several controllers and each controller having a set of features, selecting an optimal SDN controller can be considered to be a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Herein, a two-step approach is proposed for SDN controller selection. First, the controllers are ranked with analytical network process (ANP) according to their qualitative features which influence the performance of these controllers and then a performance comparison is performed to check for the QoS improvement. The controller with a high-weight value from the feature-based comparison is quantitatively analysed by experimental analysis. The main contribution of this paper is checking the applicability of the ANP for controller selection in SDN considering its features and performance analysis in real-world Internet and Brite topologies. The simulation results show that the controller computed through the proposed approach outperforms the controller selected with existing approaches. The selection of an optimum controller with ANP results in a reduction of topology discovery time and delay in the normal and traffic load scenario. Similarly, an increase in throughput with a reasonable utilization of the central processing unit (CPU) is observed for the proposed controller."
https://openalex.org/W2946910395,"Following the March 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, many residents of Fukushima have faced anxieties about the health impacts of radiation exposure. Considering that source of information may influence resident anxiety, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between the two. In addition, a health literacy query was included to examine a possible relationship between anxiety and health literacy skills. A mail survey was conducted in August 2016 among 2000 residents of Fukushima Prefecture aged 20 to 79 years. Survey items included questions about current health anxieties caused by radiation, trusted sources of information about radiation, and media used to obtain information on radiation. The survey valid response rate was 43.4%. Results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that anxiety was significantly higher for the groups indicating ""trust in citizen groups"" and ""use of internet sites."" Anxiety was significantly lower for the groups indicating ""trust in government ministries,"" ""trust in local government,"" and ""use of local broadcast television."" Also anxiety was significantly lower for groups with higher health literacy. It was found that the significant relationship to anxiety varies depending on the sources of trust and media used. There is a possibility that this was caused by the difference between the contents of each information and media reports. In preparation for any future nuclear accident, government may consider action to improve the media literacy of residents. In addition, improving health literacy of both the recipient and the sender of information can improve access to information and thereby safeguard the health and well-being of the public."
https://openalex.org/W2953379422,"Hyperthermia (HT) has shown feasibility and potency as an anticancer therapy. Administration of HT in the chemotherapy has previously enhanced the cytotoxicity of drugs against pancreatic cancer. However, the drugs used when conducting these studies are substantially conventional chemotherapeutic agents that may cause unwanted side effects. Additionally, the thermal dosage in the treatment of cancer cells could also probably harm the healthy cells. The purpose of this work was to investigate the potential of the two natural polyphenolic compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), as heat synergizers in the thermal treatment of the PANC-1 cells. Furthermore, we have introduced a unique strategy entitled the thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) that is capable of providing a maximum synergy and minimal side effect with the anticancer compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the TC-HT and the CGA or EGCG markedly exerts the anticancer effect against the PANC-1 cells, while none of the single treatment induced such changes. The synergistic activity was attributed to the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and the induction of the ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These findings not only represent the first in vitro thermal synergistic study of natural compounds in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but also highlight the potential of the TC-HT as an alternative strategy in thermal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2947165337,"Scaffold-based cancer cell culture techniques have been gaining prominence especially in the last two decades. These techniques can potentially overcome some of the limitations of current three-dimensional cell culture methods, such as uneven cell distribution, inadequate nutrient diffusion, and uncontrollable size of cell aggregates. Porous scaffolds can provide a convenient support for cell attachment, proliferation and migration, and also allows diffusion of oxygen, nutrients and waste. In this paper, a comparative study was done on porous poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles prepared using three porogens-gelatin, sodium bicarbonate (SBC) or novel poly N-isopropylacrylamide [PNIPAAm] particles, as substrates for lung cancer cell culture. These fibronectin-coated, stable particles (19-42 μm) supported A549 cell attachment at an optimal cell seeding density of 250,000 cells/ mg of particles. PLGA-SBC porous particles had comparatively larger, more interconnected pores, and favored greater cell proliferation up to 9 days than their counterparts. This indicates that pore diameters and interconnectivity have direct implications on scaffold-based cell culture compared to substrates with minimally interconnected pores (PLGA-gelatin) or pores of uniform sizes (PLGA-PMPs). Therefore, PLGA-SBC-based tumor models were chosen for preliminary drug screening studies. The greater drug resistance observed in the lung cancer cells grown on porous particles compared to conventional cell monolayers agrees with previous literature, and indicates that the PLGA-SBC porous microparticle substrates are promising for in vitro tumor or tissue development."
https://openalex.org/W2947085373,"Education of disease plays an important role in management of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about the link between the understanding of disease and the burden of care. This study was carried out to find the correlation between the burden of care and the understanding of disease in caregivers for PD patients.Non-demented patients with PD and their caregivers participated in structured interviews. Understanding of patients and caregivers was evaluated through newly-devised questions. The caregiver burden inventory was used to assess the burden of care.A total of 142 pairs of patients and their caregivers were recruited. A correlation analysis showed that the burden of care was positively associated with low understanding of the disease by the caregiver. Daily care time and female patients were revealed to be independently associated with the burden of care through a multivariate analysis. Further analyses were performed in the caregiver group according to relationship with patients. The spouse group showed an increased burden of care and poor understanding compared to the offspring group. A multivariate analysis revealed that daily care time and understanding were independent predictors for the burden of care in the spouse group. There was no significant association in the offspring group.The burden of care was associated with higher daily caregiving time and female gender of the patient, and was significantly increased in the spouse of the patient. In the spouse group, better understanding of the caregiver correlated with less burden of care."
https://openalex.org/W2947481639,"Accuracy of genome-wide association studies, and the successful implementation of genomic selection depends on the level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the genome and also the persistence of LD phase between populations. In the present study LD between adjacent SNPs and LD decay between SNPs was calculated in three Iranian water buffalo populations. Persistence of LD phase was evaluated across these populations and effective population size (Ne) was estimated from corrected r2 information. A set of 404 individuals from three Iranian buffalo populations were genotyped with the Axiom Buffalo Genotyping 90K Array. Average r2 and |D'| between adjacent SNP pairs across all chromosomes was 0.27 and 0.66 for AZI, 0.29 and 0.68 for KHU, and 0.32 and 0.72 for MAZ. The LD between the SNPs decreased with increasing physical distance from 100Kb to 1Mb between markers, from 0.234 to 0.018 for AZI, 0.254 to 0.034 for KHU, and 0.297 to 0.119 for MAZ, respectively. These results indicate that a density of 90K SNP is sufficient for genomic analyses relying on long range LD (e.g. GWAS and genomic selection). The persistence of LD phase decreased with increasing marker distances across all the populations, but remained above 0.8 for AZI and KHU for marker distances up to 100Kb. For multi-breed genomic evaluation, the 90K SNP panel is suitable for AZI and KHU buffalo breeds. Estimated effective population sizes for AZI, KHU and MAZ were 477, 212 and 32, respectively, for recent generations. The estimated effective population sizes indicate that the MAZ is at risk and requires careful management."
https://openalex.org/W2947805904,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a frequent complication of diabetes with potentially devastating consequences that may be prevented or delayed. This study aimed to estimate the health and economic benefit of earlier diagnosis and treatment of DKD.Life expectancy and medical spending for people with diabetes were modeled using The Health Economics Medical Innovation Simulation (THEMIS). THEMIS uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to model cohorts of individuals over age 50 to project population-level lifetime health and economic outcomes. DKD status was imputed based on diagnoses and laboratory values in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We simulated the implementation of a new biomarker identifying people with diabetes at an elevated risk of DKD and DKD patients at risk of rapid progression.Compared to baseline, the prevalence of DKD declined 5.1% with a novel prognostic biomarker test, while the prevalence of diabetes with stage 5 chronic kidney disease declined 3.0%. Consequently, people with diabetes gained 0.2 years in life expectancy, while per-capita annual medical spending fell by 0.3%. The estimated cost was $12,796 per life-year gained and $25,842 per quality-adjusted life-year.A biomarker test that allows earlier treatment reduces DKD prevalence and slows DKD progression, thereby increasing life expectancy among people with diabetes while raising healthcare spending by less than one percent."
https://openalex.org/W2947817186,"Everyday speech is produced with an intricate timing pattern and rhythm. Speech units follow each other with short interleaving pauses, which can be either bridged by fillers (erm, ah) or empty. Through their syntactic positions, pauses connect to the thoughts expressed. We investigated whether disturbances of thought in schizophrenia are manifest in patterns at this level of linguistic organization, whether these are seen in first degree relatives (FDR) and how specific they are to formal thought disorder (FTD). Spontaneous speech from 15 participants without FTD (SZ-FTD), 15 with FTD (SZ+FTD), 15 FDRs and 15 neurotypical controls (NC) was obtained from a comic strip retelling task and rated for pauses subclassified by syntactic position and duration. SZ-FTD produced significantly more unfilled pauses than NC in utterance-initial positions and before embedded clauses. Unfilled pauses occurring within clausal units did not distinguish any groups. SZ-FTD also differed from SZ+FTD in producing significantly more pauses before embedded clauses. SZ+FTD differed from NC and FDR only in producing longer utterance-initial pauses. FDRs produced significantly fewer fillers than NC. Results reveal that the temporal organization of speech is an important window on disturbances of the thought process and how these relate to language."
https://openalex.org/W2906151397,"Despite the successful application of LNA/2’OMe-FISH procedures for bacteria detection, there is a lack of knowledge on the properties that affect hybridization. Such information is crucial for the rational design of protocols. Hence, this work aimed to evaluate the effect of three essential factors on the LNA/2’OMe hybridization step—hybridization temperature, NaCl concentration and type and concentration of denaturant (formamide, ethylene carbonate and urea). This optimization was performed for 3 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter freundii) and 2 Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis), employing the response surface methodology and a Eubacteria probe. In general, it was observed that a high NaCl concentration is beneficial (from 2 M to 5 M), regardless of the denaturant used. Urea, formamide and ethylene carbonate are suitable denaturants for LNA/2’OMe-FISH applications; but urea provides higher fluorescence intensities among the different bacteria, especially for gram-positive bacteria and for P. aeruginosa. However, a unique optimal protocol was not found for all tested bacteria. Despite this, the results indicate that a hybridization solution with 2 M of urea and 4 M of NaCl would be a proper starting point. Furthermore, a hybridization temperature around 62°C, for 14 bp probes with LNA monomers at every third position of 2′OMe and 64% of GC content, should be use in initial optimization of new LNA/2’OMe-FISH protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2947464418,"We describe CD4 count recovery among HIV positive individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) with and without severe immune suppression using complete laboratory data from South Africa's national HIV treatment programme between 2010 and 2014 and discuss implications for CD4 count monitoring.Retrospective analysis of routinely collected laboratory data from South Africa's National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS). A probabilistic record linkage algorithm was used to create a cohort of HIV positive individuals who initiated ART between 2010 and 2014 based on timing of CD4 count and viral load measurements. A CD4 count < 50 copies/μl at ART initiation was considered severe immunosuppression. A multivariable piecewise mixed-effects linear regression model adjusting for age, gender, year of starting ART, viral suppression in follow up and province was used to predict CD4 counts during follow up.1,070,900 individuals had evidence of starting ART during 2010-2014 and met the criteria for inclusion in the cohort -46.6% starting ART with CD4 < 200 cells/μl and 10.1% with CD4 < 50 cells/ μl. For individuals with CD4 counts < 200 cells/μl, predicted CD4 counts > 200 cells/μl, >350 cells/μl and >500 cells/μl corresponded with mean follow up durations of 1.5 years (standard deviation [s.d] 1.1), 1.9years (s.d 1.2) and 2.1 years (s.d 1.3 years). For those with CD4 counts < 50 cells/μl, predicted CD4 count above these threshold corresponded with mean follow up durations of 2.5 years (s.d 0.9 years), 4.4 years (s.d 0.4 years) and 5.0 years (s.d 0.1years) for recovery to the same thresholds. CD4 count recovery varied mostly with duration on ART, CD4 count at the start of ART and gender.For individuals starting with ART with severe immunosuppression, CD4 recovery to 200cells/μl did not occur or took longer than 12 month for significant proportions. CD4 monitoring and interventions recommended for advanced HIV disease should continue until full recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2947989955,"Angry rumination and hostile attribution bias are important cognitive factors of aggression. Although prior theoretical models of aggression suggest that aggressive cognitive factors may influence each other, there are no studies examining the longitudinal relationship between angry rumination and hostile attribution bias. The present study used cross-lagged structural equation modeling to explore the longitudinal mutual relationship between hostile attribution bias and angry rumination; 941 undergraduate students (38.5% male) completed questionnaires assessing the variables at two time points. The results indicate that hostile attribution bias showed a small but statistically significant effect on angry rumination 6 months later, and angry rumination showed a quite small but marginally significant effect on hostile attribution bias across time. The present study supports the idea that hostile attribution bias influences angry rumination, and argue that the relationship between angry rumination and hostile attribution bias may be mutual. Additionally, the results suggest that there may be a causal relation of different aggression-related cognitive factors."
https://openalex.org/W2946953469,"A recently introduced Multilocus Sequence Typing scheme for Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum was applied to clinical samples collected from 2004 to 2017 from the two largest cities (Prague and Brno) in the Czech Republic. Altogether, a total of 675 samples were tested in this study and 281 of them were found PCR-positive for treponemal DNA and typeable. Most of the typed samples (n = 281) were swabs from primary or secondary syphilis lesions (n = 231), and only a minority were whole blood or tissue samples (n = 50). Swab samples from patients with rapid plasma regain (RPR) values of 1–1024 were more frequently PCR-positive (84.6%) compared to samples from patients with non-reactive RPR test (46.5%; p-value = 0.0001). Out of 281 typeable samples, 136 were fully-typed at all TP0136, TP0548, and TP0705 loci. Among the fully and partially typed samples, 25 different allelic profiles were identified. Altogether, eight novel allelic variants were found among fully (n = 5) and partially (n = 3) typed samples. The distribution of TPA allelic profiles identified in the Czech Republic from 2004 to 2017 revealed a dynamic character with allelic profiles disappearing and emerging over time. While the number of samples with the A2058G mutation was seen to increase (86.7% in 2016/2017), the number of samples harboring the A2059G mutation was found to have decreased over time (3.3% in 2016/2017). In addition, we found several allelic profile associations with macrolide resistance or susceptibility, the gender of patients, as well as patient residence."
https://openalex.org/W2947144278,"Both Grapholita molesta (Busck) and Grapholita dimorpha Komai (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are important pests of pome and stone fruits. Mature fruits of peach and plum have been tested as food sources for G. molesta, but no studies have examined the suitability of immature fruits, which are the fruit stage more likely to be available for the spring populations of both G. molesta and G. dimorpha. Thus, we evaluated immature fruits of peach, plum, and apple as food sources by assessing their effects on biological and behavioral attributes of these moths in the laboratory. Immature fruits were collected in May and June of 2016 and again in 2017. The first-instar larvae of G. molesta preferred either peach or plum, which showed exit rates of mature larvae of 81.0 and 100.0% for the two fruits, respectively. On peach, development time was shorter, and fecundity was lower than plum. However, G. dimorpha preferred plum and apple, showing the lowest fruit-boring rate and lowest mature larval exit rate on peach, from which only one female moth emerged but produced no eggs. In conclusion, it seems that at the immature fruit stage, plum and apple are better food sources for both G. molesta and G. dimorpha than is peach."

This was a retrospective study of adult patients who underwent central line placement and were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2014 and March 2018. In this study, the primary endpoint was central line-induced complications. The secondary endpoint was initial success of central line placement. Placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC performed at the bedside if intra-hospital transport was inappropriate. Other patients underwent PICC placement at the interventional radiology suite under fluoroscopic guidance. A total of 191 patients underwent central line placement in the neurosurgery ICU during the study period. Requirement for central line infusion (56.0%) and difficult venous access (28.8%) were the most common reasons for central line placement. The basilic vein (39.3%) and the subclavian vein (35.1%) were the most common target veins among patients who underwent central line placement. The placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC at the bedside were more frequently performed in patients on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001) and with hemodynamic instability (p <0.001) compared to the fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement. The initial success rate of central line placement was better in the fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement than in the placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC at the bedside (p = 0.004). However, all re-inserted central lines were successful. There was no significant difference in procedure time between the three groups. However, incidence of insertional injuries was higher in CCVC group compared to PICC groups (p = 0.038). Ultrasound-guided PICC placement by a neurointensivist may be safe and feasible compared to fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement by interventional radiologists and CCVC placement for neurocritically ill patients."

Study design A total of 4,940 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born between 23 and 31 weeks of gestation from 2013 to 2015 who were registered in the Korean Neonatal Network (KNN) database were enrolled. Infants with major congenital malformations and those with incomplete data were excluded. Z-scores for weight, length, and head circumference at birth were calculated from the Fenton 2013 growth curve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether the z-score for length at birth was associated with BPD or death before 36 postmenstrual weeks. Results A total of 4,662 VLBW infants were analyzed: 518 infants died before 36 postmenstrual weeks; 1,388 infants developed BPD. Decreased length at birth z-scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of BPD or death when adjusted for covariates (odds ratio (OR) 1.25 per 1-point decrease of length at birth z-score, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–1.37). The association was particularly evident in infants born earlier than 29 weeks of gestation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.31–1.89 in infants born at 23–25 weeks; OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.42 in infants born at 26–28 weeks). Conclusion Length at birth was inversely associated with an increased risk of BPD or death in VLBW infants born earlier than 32 weeks of gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2947520092,"Methylphenidate (MPH) is a first line drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the neuronal mechanisms underlying the condition and the treatment are still not fully understood. Previous EEG studies on the effect of MPH in ADHD found changes in evoked response potential (ERP) components that were inconsistent between studies. These inconsistencies highlight the need for a well-designed study which includes multiple baseline sessions and controls for possible fatigue, learning effects and between-days variability. To this end, we employ a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study and explore the effect of MPH on the ERP response of subjects with ADHD during a Go/No-Go cognitive task. Our ERP analysis revealed significant differences in ADHD subjects between the placebo and MPH conditions in the frontal-parietal region at 250ms-400ms post stimulus (P3). Additionally, a decrease in the late 650ms-800ms ERP component (LC) is observed in frontal electrodes of ADHD subjects compared to controls. The standard deviation of response time of ADHD subjects was significantly smaller in the MPH condition compared to placebo and correlated with the increased P3 ERP response in the frontoparietal electrodes. We suggest that mental fatigue plays a role in the decrease of the P3 response in the placebo condition compared to pre-placebo, a phenomenon that is significant in ADHD subjects but not in controls, and which is interestingly rectified by MPH."

Methods: Five hundred and nine cervical swabs were collected. Each sample was subjected to DNA extraction and PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis using primers NRO/NLO and CTP1/CTP2. Positives samples were sequenced to determine genotype. Main outcome measures: Demographic data of the patients were collected to detect a population at risk for this infection. Results A prevalence of 6.9% (35/509) for Chlamydia trachomatis infection was detected, with 32/295 and 3/214 from pregnant women with low or better economic resources respectively (p = 0,0001). Results showed a significantly increased rate of 11.6% (30/258) in women under 25 years compared with 2% (5/251) in patients over that age (p = 0,00003). Genotype E was the most prevalent. Conclusions With these results, we can say that pregnant women under 25 years old and low economic resources are one of the populations in which the screening programs of Chlamydia trachomatis should focus."
https://openalex.org/W2946873949,"Introduction and methods Hepatitis B is a vaccine preventable disease and is notifiable in South Africa. Hepatitis B vaccination was incorporated into the Expanded Programme on Immunisation in South Africa in 1995. We used a convenience sample from community-based febrile rash surveillance in 2013 to estimate hepatitis B sero-prevalence. Of samples serologically negative for acute measles infection, 450 samples spanning nine provinces of South Africa were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). Results Two children (2/450; 0.4%) tested positive for HBsAg. Three hundred and three children (67.3%) had evidence of vaccine induced immunity. Vaccine induced immunity was present in 80.2% of 1–5 year olds, but only 60.3% of 10–14 year olds. Natural immunity, indicating exposure to circulating hepatitis B, was present in 13/450 (2.9%) children. Conclusion Chronic hepatitis B in South African has decreased in prevalence from highly endemic levels prior to vaccine introduction to approximately 0.4% in this sample, demonstrating impact of a successful vaccination programme 18 years after introduction. Decreased vaccine-induced immunity with increasing age may reflect waning antibody titres over time."
https://openalex.org/W2947368415,"A stable walking pattern is presumably essential to avoid falls. Stability of walking is most accurately determined by the short-term local dynamic stability (maximum Lyapunov exponent) of the body centre of mass. In many studies related to fall risk, however, variability of step width is considered to be indicative of the stability of the centre of mass during walking. However, other footfall parameters, in particular variability of stride time, have also been associated with increased risk for falling. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between short-term local dynamic stability of the body centre of mass and different measures of footfall variability. Twenty subjects performed unperturbed walking trials on a treadmill and under increased (addition of 40% body weight) and decreased (harness system) demands to stabilise the body centre of mass. Association between stability of the centre of mass and footfall parameters was established using a structural equation model. Walking with additional body weight lead to greater instability of the centre of mass and increased stride time variability, however had no effect on step width variability. Supported walking in the harness system did not increase centre of mass stability further, however, led to a significant decrease of step width and increase in stride time variability. A structural equation model could only predict 8% of the variance of the centre of mass stability after variability of step width, stride time and stride length were included. A model which included only step width variability as exogenous variable, failed to predict centre of mass stability. Because of the failure to predict centre of mass stability in this study, it appears, that the stability of the centre of mass is controlled by more complex interaction of sagittal and frontal plane temporal and spatial footfall parameters, than those observed by standard variability measures. Anyway, this study does not support the application of step width variability as indicator for medio-lateral stability of the centre of mass during walking."
https://openalex.org/W2946962543,"The highly extreme conditions of the lower convective layer in the Atlantis II (ATII) Deep brine pool of the Red Sea make it an ideal environment for the search for novel enzymes that can function under extreme conditions. In the current study, we isolated a novel sequence of a thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme from the metagenomic dataset established from the microbial community that resides in the lower convective layer of Atlantis II. The gene was cloned, expressed and characterized for redox activity, halophilicity, and thermal stability. The isolated thioredoxin reductase (ATII-TrxR) was found to belong to the high-molecular-weight class of thioredoxin reductases. A search for conserved domains revealed the presence of an extra domain (Crp) in the enzyme sequence. Characterization studies of ATII-TrxR revealed that the enzyme was halophilic (maintained activity at 4 M NaCl), thermophilic (optimum temperature was 65°C) and thermostable (60% of its activity was retained at 70°C). Additionally, the enzyme utilized NADH in addition to NADPH as an electron donor. In conclusion, a novel thermostable and halophilic thioredoxin reductase has been isolated with a unique sequence that adapts to the harsh conditions of the brine pools making this protein a good candidate for biological research and industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2947315865,"Oxidatively modified low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) play an important role in the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. To identify the genetic factors influencing the oxLDL levels, we have genotyped 776 DNA samples of Russian individuals for 196,725 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Cardio-MetaboChip (Illumina, USA) and conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS). Fourteen common variants in the locus including APOB gene were significantly associated with the oxLDL levels (P < 2.18 × 10-7). These variants explained only 6% of the variation in the oxLDL levels. Then, we assessed the contribution of rare coding variants of APOB gene to the oxLDL levels. Individuals with the extreme oxLDL levels (48 with the lowest and 48 with the highest values) were selected for targeted sequencing of the region including APOB gene. To evaluate the contribution of the SNPs to the oxLDL levels we used various statistical methods for the association analysis of rare variants: WST, SKAT, and SKAT-O. We revealed that both synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs affected the oxLDL levels. For the joint analysis of the rare and common variants, we conducted the SKAT-C testing and found a group of 15 SNPs significantly associated with the oxLDL levels (P = 2.14 × 10-9). Our results indicate that the oxLDL levels depend on both common and rare variants of the APOB gene."
https://openalex.org/W2947482935,"Long-term memory (LTM) associations appear as important to cognition as single memory contents. Previous studies on updating development have focused on cognitive processes and components, whereas our investigation examines how contents, associated with different LTM strength (strong or weak), might be differentially updated at different ages. To this end, we manipulated association strength of information given at encoding, in order to focus on updating pre-existing LTM associations; specifically, associations for letters. In particular, we controlled for letters usage frequency at the sub-lexical level. We used a task where we dissociated inhibition online (i.e., RTs for updating and controlling inhibition from the same set) and offline (i.e., RTs for controlling inhibition from previously updated sets). Mixed-effect analyses were conducted and showed a substantial behavioural cost when strong associations had to be dismantled online (i.e., longer RTs), compared to weak ones; here, in primary school age children. Interestingly, this effect was independent of age; in fact, children from 7-8 to 9-10 years were comparably sensitive to the strength of LTM associations in updating. However, older children were more effective in offline inhibitory control."
https://openalex.org/W2947569530,"Background While school-aged children in low- and middle-income countries remain highly exposed to acute infections, programs targeting this age group remain limited in scale and scope. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a new and comprehensive primary school-based health intervention program on student-reported morbidity and anthropometric outcomes in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods A prospective matched control study identified 12 classes in 7 schools for the intervention and 12 classes in 7 matched schools as controls. Teachers in intervention schools were trained to deliver health lessons and to refer sick students to care. In addition, vitamin A and deworming medication were biannually administered to intervention students. The primary study outcome was student-reported morbidity. Secondary outcomes were weight, height, health knowledge, and absenteeism. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to estimate program impact. Results 380 students ages 4–16 were enrolled in the study in 2015, and 97% were followed up at endline in 2016. The intervention decreased the adjusted odds of self-reported acute illnesses by 38% (95% CI: 0.48, 0.77) and the adjusted odds of stunting by 52% (95% CI: 0.26, 0.87). It also increased health knowledge by 0.53 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.24, 0.81). No impact was found on weight (adjusted mean difference β = 0.17, 95% CI: - 1.11, 1.44) and student absenteeism (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.60, 1.33). Conclusion The results presented in this paper suggest that comprehensive school-based health programs may offer a highly effective way to improve students’ health knowledge as well as their health status. Given their low cost, a more general adoption and implementation of such programs seems recommendable. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03607084."
https://openalex.org/W2947693258,"Winter annual biotypes of Camelina sativa regularly survive after winter conditions experienced in northern regions of the U.S., whereas summer annual biotypes do not. To determine potential molecular mechanisms associated with these biotype differences in survival after low temperature treatments, we examined genetic and transcript variations in both a winter- (Joelle) and a summer- (CO46) biotype. It was determined that as few as one or two dominant genes may control differential survival after low temperature treatments. Of the 1797 genes that were differentially expressed in response to cold in both the winter and summer biotypes many COR genes were identified, indicating that the CBF regulon is functional in both. However, only 153 and 76 genes from Joelle and CO46, respectively, were either differentially expressed or not expressed at all in one biotype versus the other following cold acclimation. We hypothesize that these 229 genes play a significant role in, or are primarily responsive to, differences in survival after freezing between these two biotypes. Promoter analysis provided few clues as to the regulation or these genes; however, genes that were down-regulated specifically in the winter biotype Joelle were enriched with the sequence TGGCCCTCGCTCAC, which is over-represented among genes associated with chloroplasts in Arabidopsis. Additionally, several genes involved in auxin signaling were down-regulated specifically in Joelle. A transcription factor with strong similarity to MYB47, known to be up-regulated by salt, drought, and jasmonic acid, but not cold in Arabidopsis, was essentially off in the freezing sensitive biotype CO46, but was cold-induced in the winter biotype Joelle. Several other transcription factors genes including three with similarity to WRKY70, that may be involved in SA/JA-dependent responses, a HOMEOBOX 6 gene involved in ABA signaling, and two others (NUCLEAR FACTOR Y and CONSTANS-like 2) known to be implicated in photoperiodic flowering were also differentially expressed between the two biotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2946921160,"Studies on diabetic nephropathy rarely take into account that the co-existence of diabetes and hypertension is frequent and further aggravates the prognosis of renal dysfunction. Adenosine can activate four subtypes of adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B and A3) and has been implicated in diabetic nephropathy. However, it is not known if, in hypertensive conditions, diabetes alters the presence/distribution profile of renal adenosine receptors. The aim of this work was to describe the presence/distribution profile of the four adenosine receptors in six renal structures (superficial/deep glomeruli, proximal/distal tubules, loop of Henle, collecting tubule) of the hypertensive kidney and to evaluate whether it is altered by diabetes. Immunoreactivities against the adenosine receptors were analyzed in six renal structures from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, the control group) and from SHR rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocyin (SHR-STZ group). Data showed, for the first time, that all adenosine receptors were present in the kidney of SHR rats, although the distribution pattern was specific for each adenosine receptor subtype. Also, induction of diabetes in the SHR was associated with downregulation of adenosine A2A receptors, which might be relevant for the development of hypertensive diabetic nephropathy. This study highlights the adenosine A2A receptors as a potential target to explore to prevent and/or treat early diabetes-induced hyperfiltration, at least in hypertensive conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2947106720,"Chronic hepatic disease can present a diagnostic challenge with different etiologies being associated with similar clinical and laboratory findings. The histopathological assessment of a liver biopsy specimen is usually required in order to make a definitive diagnosis and the availability of non-invasive prognostic biomarkers is limited. The emerging science of metabolomics is used to detect changes in endogenous low molecular weight metabolites in biological samples and offers the possibility of identifying noninvasive markers of disease. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the urine metabolome between healthy dogs, dogs with chronic hepatitis, dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma, and dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt. Stored urine samples from 10 healthy dogs, 10 dogs with chronic hepatitis, 6 dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 5 dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt were analyzed. The urine metabolome was analyzed by gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and 220 known metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis and heat dendrogram plots of the metabolomics data showed clustering between groups. Random forest analysis showed differences in the abundance of various metabolites including putrescine, gluconic acid, sorbitol, and valine. Based on univariate statistics, 37 metabolites were significantly different between groups. In, conclusion, the urine metabolome varies between healthy dogs, dogs with chronic hepatitis, dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma, and dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt. Further targeted assessment of these metabolites is needed to assess their diagnostic utility."
https://openalex.org/W2947133977,"Background The precise anatomical reduction of the ankle mortise is crucial for the clinical outcome in unstable syndesmotic injuries. Intraoperative cone beam computed tomography (CT), in addition to two-dimensional fluoroscopy, provides detailed information about the reduction and implant placement. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the joint position on the fibula position in the incisural notch and to determine the inter- and intraindividual anatomical differences in the intact ankle joints. Methods A total of 20 fresh-frozen lower legs disarticulated in the knee joint of 10 individuals were included. The measurements were performed using a cone beam CT. The distances and angles were measured in the standard imaging planes. The mean values of distances and angles were compared during the different joint positions: 10° dorsiflexion, 0° neutral position and 20° plantar flexion. Results The influence of the joint position was on average as follows: The anterior tibiofibular distance was 3.68 mm in 10° dorsiflexion, 3.66 mm (0° neutral position) and 3.59 mm (20° plantar flexion). The posterior tibiofibular distance measured 7.82mm, 7.76mm and 7.82mm. The rotation of the fibula measured ten millimeters proximal the joint line was 1.2°, 1.3° and 1.05°. The fibular rotation determined 4mm was 9.3°, 9.4° and 9.4°. On average, the following intraindividual variations were observed: superior tibiotalar clear space of 0.27mm and 0.15mm medial; and anterior tibiofibular distance of 0.42mm, 0.38mm posterior and 0.24mm in the incisural notch. The proximal angle of the fibular rotation was 0.2° and distal 0.4°. The interindividual variations of the angles and distances exceeded the intraindividual values partly by 3 to 4 fold. Conclusions Within the scope of this study neither the tibiofibular distance, nor the tibiofibular angle changed significantly through the different joint positions. The intraindividual differences were little while the interindividual variations of the parameters were distinctive."
https://openalex.org/W2947657790,"Introduction Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with selective 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracers has contributed to our understanding on the role of inflammation in disease development and progression. With an increasing number of rodent models of human disease and expansion of the preclinical PET imaging base worldwide, accurate quantification of longitudinal rodent TSPO PET datasets is necessary. This is particularly relevant as TSPO PET quantification relies on invasive blood sampling due to lack of a suitable tissue reference region. Here we investigate the kinetics and quantification bias of a novel TSPO radiotracer [18F]AB5186 in rats using automatic, manual and image derived input functions. Methods [18F]AB5186 was administered intravenously and dynamic PET imaging was acquired over 2 hours. Arterial blood was collected manually to derive a population based input function or using an automatic blood sampler to derive a plasma input function. Manually sampled blood was also used to analyze the [18F]AB5186 radiometabolite profile in plasma and applied to all groups as a population based dataset. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes (VT) and [18F]AB5186 outcome measure bias was determined. Results [18F]AB5186 distribution in rats was consistent with TSPO expression and at 2 h post-injection 50% of parent compound was still present in plasma. Population based manual sampling methods and image derived input function (IDIF) underestimated VT by ~50% and 88% compared with automatic blood sampling, respectively. The VT variability was lower when using IDIF versus arterial blood sampling methods and analysis of the Bland-Altman plots showed a good agreement between methods of analysis. Conclusion Quantification of TSPO PET rodent data using image-derived methods, which are more amenable for longitudinal scanning of small animals, yields outcome measures with reduced variability and good agreement, albeit biased, compared with invasive blood sampling methods."
https://openalex.org/W2947701335,"Despite advances in perioperative management and surgical technique, postoperative liver failure remains a feared complication after hepatic resection. Various supportive treatment options are under current discussion, but lack of structured evaluation. We therefore established a porcine model of major liver resection to study regeneration after partial hepatectomy in a reliable and well-defined pre-clinical setting.Major hepatectomy was performed on seven minipigs with the intention to set up a non-lethal but relevant transient impairment of liver function. For steady postoperative vascular access (e.g. for blood withdrawal, measurement of venous pressure), permanent catheters were implanted into the internal jugular and portal veins, respectively. Animals were followed up for 30 days; clinical and laboratory results were recorded in detail. Monitoring was enhanced by non-invasive determination of the maximum liver function capacity (LiMAx test).The established porcine model appeared suitable for evaluation of postoperative liver regeneration. Clinical characteristics and progression of liver function impairment as well as subsequent recovery were comparable to courses known from surgery in humans. Laboratory parameters (e.g. liver enzymes, bilirubin, INR, coagulation factor II) showed relevant derangements during postoperative days (POD) 0 to 3 followed by normalization until POD 7. Application of the LiMAx test was feasible in minipigs, again showing values comparable to humans and kinetics in line with obtained laboratory parameters. The exteriorized portal vein catheters enabled intra- and postoperative monitoring of portal venous pressures as well as easy access for blood withdrawal without relevant risk of postoperative complications."
https://openalex.org/W2947962230,"Objectives We hypothesize that when temporal bone fractures occur, the pneumatic cells in the temporal bone are able to absorb most of the impact force during a traumatic event. This study aims to correlate the degree of pneumatization of the temporal bone with the severity of temporal bone fracture (TBF). Methods Charts and computed tomography scans representing 54 TBFs, diagnosed from 2012 to 2017 at a single tertiary hospital, were retrospectively reviewed. Temporal bone pneumatization (TBP) in the petrous apex and mastoid region was evaluated using previously published classification systems. TBP classifications and fracture types were correlated with TBF complications such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), facial nerve palsy (FNP), and vestibular dysfunction. Results Patients with increased pneumatization of the temporal bone had significantly fewer and less severe SNHL. SNHL more strongly correlated with the degree of pneumatization in the mastoid (P = 0.005) than that in the petrous apex (P = 0.024). On the other hand, the degree of TBP correlated poorly with FNP and vestibular dysfunction. However, the mastoid hypopneumatization demonstrated significant correlation with otic-capsule violations (P = 0.002). Fractures with otic-capsule violation were 4 times more likely to have vestibular dysfunction (P = 0.043) and 3 times more likely to have SNHL (P = 0.006). FNP was not associated with otic-capsule violating fractures but was 3.5 times more common in comminuted fractures (P = 0.025). Conclusions The degree of temporal bone pneumatization was negatively correlated to the incidence of otic-capsule violation and the severity of hearing impairment in patients with temporal bone fracture. This study substantiated the potential protective effect of temporal bone pneumatization in TBFs."

CMI.The authors retrospectively analysed objective (contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) and subjective (4-point Likert scale) image quality of CTs after i.o. (n = 4, mean age (y) 57.0±11.0) versus i.v. (n = 20, mean age (y) 58.8±4.4) CMI. All patients underwent a native head CT scan, a cerebral CT angiography (CTA) and CTA of the supra-aortic vasculature as well as a chest and abdominal CT scan in the venous phase; one patient with an i.o. access additionally received a CTA of the lower limbs. Electronic patient records have been reviewed to determine i.o. access related complications.Both groups were consistent in age, heart rate, scan parameters including the flow rate of the contrast agent, resulting in comparable radiation dose levels. The image noise and CNR had no significant difference between the two groups. Scoring the delineation of the main vessels after i.o. CMI showed no significant difference to the i.v. group. There were no CT or i.o. access related complications observed.The i.o. access is a safe and suitable alternative for emergency CMI in CT. Using established protocols good to very good image quality can be achieved, comparable to i.v. CMI. We show for the first time, that i.o. CMI is also feasible for CTA imaging of the head and neck region as well as of pelvic and leg vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2947913252,"Although the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) into amyloid fibrils is a well-established hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, the complex mechanisms linking this process to neurodegeneration are still incompletely understood. The nematode worm C. elegans is a valuable model organism through which to study these mechanisms because of its simple nervous system and its relatively short lifespan. Standard Aβ-based C. elegans models of Alzheimer’s disease are designed to study the toxic effects of the overexpression of Aβ in the muscle or nervous systems. However, the wide variety of effects associated with the tissue-level overexpression of Aβ makes it difficult to single out and study specific cellular mechanisms related to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, to better understand how to investigate the early events affecting neuronal signalling, we created a C. elegans model expressing Aβ42, the 42-residue form of Aβ, from a single-copy gene insertion in just one pair of glutamatergic sensory neurons, the BAG neurons. In behavioural assays, we found that the Aβ42-expressing animals displayed a subtle modulation of the response to CO2, compared to controls. Ca2+ imaging revealed that the BAG neurons in young Aβ42-expressing nematodes were activated more strongly than in control animals, and that neuronal activation remained intact until old age. Taken together, our results suggest that Aβ42-expression in this very subtle model of AD is sufficient to modulate the behavioural response but not strong enough to generate significant neurotoxicity, suggesting that slightly more aggressive perturbations will enable effectively studies of the links between the modulation of a physiological response and its associated neurotoxicity."

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) occurs, among others, in unpredictable outbreaks after wars and disasters. After the last war in Iraq, the collapse of the health system led to the spread of infectious diseases, including CL. Between September 2016 and November 2017, all patients with confirmed CL having one or more skin lesion(s) were referred to a regional health center in Musol City within the Rabeea District. During this period, 1539 patients visited the clinic. A total of 190 patients were excluded from the study because of poor follow-up. The treatment success rate was 97.7% (1319/1349). Statistically significant associations were found between number of lesions and treatment failure (p = 0.0018; OR = 1.4430; CI = 1.1466–1.8161), number of doses and number of lesions (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.095; p = 0.001), and the lack of municipality services and number of doses used for the treatment (p = 0.008; OR = 1.0629; CI = 1.0158–1.1122). To conclude, the highest number of patients with CL in the city of Musol was recorded after the war in Iraq. The treatment success rate was high, which reflected the strict treatment and follow-up program. An urgent plan is needed to stop the spread of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2947409384,"Lung cancer is among the common and deadly cancers. Although the treatment options for late-stage cancer patients have continued to increase in numbers, the overall survival rates for these patients have not shown significant improvement. This highlights the need for new targets and drugs to more effectively treat lung cancer patients. In this study, we characterize the MCL-1 inhibitor maritoclax alone or in combination with a BCL-2/xL inhibitor in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. BCL-2 family proteins, phosphorylated proteins, and apoptosis were monitored following the treatments. We found that maritoclax was effective at inhibiting growth in these lung cancer cells. We also establish that cell lines with EGFR mutations were most sensitive to the combined inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL. In addition, a high level of phosphorylated AKT (S473) was identified as a marker for sensitivity to the combination treatment. This work has defined EGFR mutations and AKT phosphorylation as markers for sensitivity to combined MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL targeted therapy and establishes a rationale to explore multiple BCL-2 family members in patients who are refractory to EGFR inhibitor treatment. Our data support the design of a clinical trial that aims to employ inhibitors of the BCL-2 family of proteins in lung cancer patients."

Some have argued, however, that the benefits of such a rule are dubious at best. In this article, I seek to counter this claim, as I posit that a runoff rule promotes the protection of human rights by reducing outcomes that are negatively associated with high government respect for human rights. Using ordered logistic regression and an analysis of predicted probabilities, I find that democratic presidential elections held using a runoff rule produce presidents that are less likely to be associated with lower government respect for human rights, and more likely to be associated with greater government respect for human rights. I conclude by suggesting that politicians should consider embracing a presidential runoff rule, as its adoption could be a relatively easy way to reduce repression."
https://openalex.org/W2948021746,"Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a safe and natural food-coloring additive, as well as an agent with several therapeutic properties. However, extensive glucuronidation in vivo has resulted in its poor bioavailability. In this study, we aimed to investigate the formation of DMC-O-glucuronides by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and its transport by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in HeLa cells stably transfected with UGT1A1 (named HeLa1A1 cells). The chemical inhibitors Ko143 (a selective BCRP inhibitor) and MK571 (a pan-MRP inhibitor) both induced an obvious decrease in the excretion rate of DMC-O-glucuronides and a significant increase in intracellular DMC-O-glucuronide concentrations. Furthermore, BCRP knock-down resulted in a marked reduction in the level of excreted DMC-O-glucuronides (maximal 55.6%), whereas MRP1 and MRP4 silencing significantly decreased the levels of excreted DMC-O-glucuronides (a maximum of 42.9% for MRP1 and a maximum of 29.9% for MRP3), respectively. In contrast, neither the levels of excreted DMC-O-glucuronides nor the accumulation of DMC-O-glucuronides were significantly altered in the MRP4 knock-down HeLa cells. The BCRP, MRP1 and MRP3 transporters were identified as the most important contributors to the excretion of DMC-O-glucuronides. These results may significantly contribute to improving our understanding of mechanisms underlying the cellular disposition of DMC via UGT-mediated metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2947162441,"Conventional geometric design methods for pre-signal systems usually use the expected traffic demand, which may obtain a short sorting area distance and lead to frequent queue spillbacks due to stochastic traffic arrivals. On the other hand, if one selects a longer sorting area distance, the geometric design will suffer from low spatial utilization with higher delay and lower capacity. In this paper, we propose a geometric design method for intersections with pre-signal systems using a phase swap strategy. The geometric design can balance the desire of storing more vehicles to prevent spillbacks and improve the spatial utilization of the road. We model the traffic dynamic within the pre-signal system using queue theory and shockwave theory to determine the furthest point a queue can reach. The length of the pre-signal system should be short enough to improve spatial utilization but longer than the furthest point of the queue to prevent queue spillback. The effectiveness of the pre-signal system is evaluated by the VISSIM Signal Control Application Programming Interfaces (SCAPI). The results indicate that the proposed design plan increases the spatial utilization of the pre-signal system by 7.5% while maintaining a similar delay, queue length and ratio of flow to saturation flow."
https://openalex.org/W2947184229,"This study aimed to evaluate the potential adverse effects of the dermal administration of Dillenia indica Linnaeus (D. indica) fruit extract in healthy rodents; the extract was standardized to betulinic acid. In the initial phase, the acute effects were evaluated on the skin application site of a single extract dose. A skin irritation test was performed in male Wistar rats (n = 8/group) receiving the extract (50–150 mg/mL) with betulinic acid (0.5–1.5%, respectively). A photosensitivity test was performed in male BALB/c mice (n = 6/group) receiving the extract (150 mg/mL). Afterwards, other BALB/c mice (n = 20, male:female, 1:1) were used to assess the systemic alterations caused by 14 daily repeated doses (150 mg/mL) by monitoring the effects on mortality, body morphology, behavior, nutrition status, neuromotor reactions, organ morphology and weight, and blood tests. At this time, 0.5 mg/mL clobetasol was used as the positive control. The skin irritation index suggested that negligible skin irritation had occurred, even when the extract was applied to the rat skin at 150 mg/mL. However, the extract acted as a photosensitizer on mouse skin, showing a photosensitizing activity close to that of 10 mg/mL 5-methoxypsoralen. Repeated doses caused no mouse mortality, aggressiveness, piloerection, diarrhea, convulsions, neuromotor alterations or nutrition status changes. The mouse organ weights did not change, and the mice did not have alterations in their blood compositions. Clobetasol caused a reduction in the mononuclear leukocyte numbers. In general, the data suggest that the extract was safe in healthy rodents but indicate that caution should be taken with the photosensitizing activity; in addition, this activity should be further explored as it may be useful for phototherapeutic drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2947856294,"Monitoring and reducing inequalities in health care has become more relevant since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs bring an opportunity to put the assessment of inequalities by ethnicity on the agenda of decision-makers. The objective of this qualitative study is to know how current monitoring is carried out and to identify what factors influence the process in order to incorporate indicators that allow the evaluation of inequalities by ethnicity.We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with key informants from the health ministry, monitoring observatories, research centers, and international organizations, involved in maternal health care monitoring in Mexico. Our analysis was interpretative-phenomenological and focused on examining experiences about monitoring maternal health care in order to achieve a full picture of the current context in which it takes place and the factors that influence it.The obstacles and opportunities pointed out from the participants emerge from the limitations or advantages associated with the accuracy of evaluation, availability of information and resources, and effective management and decision-making. Technicians, coordinators, researchers or decision-makers are not only aware of the inequalities but also of its importance. However, this does not lead to political decisions permitting an indicator to be developed for monitoring it. As for opportunities, the role of international organizations and their links with the countries is crucial to carry out monitoring, due to political and technical support.The success of a monitoring system to help decision-makers reduce inequalities in health care depends not only on accurate evaluations but also on the context in which it is implemented. Understanding the operation, obstacles and opportunities for monitoring could be a key issue if the countries want to advance towards assessing inequalities and reducing health inequities with the aid of concrete policies and initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2947994707,"First, to assess the psychometric properties of key questions included in a public sector evaluation of primary dental care in Brazil; and second, to evaluate the performance of dental teams in relation to these items.Secondary analysis of a national primary care dataset monitoring quality and access to dental care. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with representatives of dental teams participating in the 'National Programme for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care'. Twenty-three mandatory questions about the dentists' reported delivery of dental procedures were included in the analysis. Item Response Theory (IRT) modelling was applied to measure the psychometric properties of the instrument-level of difficulty and discrimination parameter of each item-and then to estimate dental team performance scores based on these parameters. Based on IRT, possible scores ranged from -4 to +4.Three of the 23 mandatory items were removed due to poor internal consistency, resulting in a scale of 20 items for assessing dental team performance. The results showed variation in procedures delivered by the dental teams; whilst more than a half of the procedures were executed by at least 80% of the dental teams, those relating to dentures (partial/total) and frenectomy (lingual/labial) were performed by less than 30%. Amongst the 20 items included in the model, those related to partial/total dentures and oral cancer follow-up presented higher levels of difficulty and were less frequently provided. The items relating to the treatment of deciduous teeth and access to the dental pulp of permanent teeth had the highest discrimination parameters and, consequently, greater weight in the performance's score estimation; therefore, dental teams that did not perform these items had the lowest performance scores. In the present study, dental team performance scores ranged from -3.66 to +1.87 with a mean/median of -0.06/+0.01.The findings suggest that whilst the items within the instrument demonstrated some potential to discriminate between poor and very poor teams, they were ineffective in discriminating between poor and good teams. Whilst Brazilian dental teams perform many mandatory procedures, variation in the nature of their delivery of care requires further investigation to enhance service provision to the population."
https://openalex.org/W2947832862,"Introduction Disability follows the rapid rate of population ageing, imposing a huge burden on society. Functional assessment in older people can identify predictors of disability. Objective Analyze the incidence and the risk factors for disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in older adults over six years. Methods Six year-follow up study initiated in 2010. The baseline non-probabilistic sample consisted of 180 independent community dwelling individuals aged 60 and over. The procedures comprised an interview with sociodemographic data, questions about falls, urinary incontinence, self-rated health, and assessment of ADL, IADL, mobility, depression, vision, hearing, cognition, nutrition, grip strength and social support. The second research was carried out by telephone and assessed ADL and IADL. Logistic regression models calculated the odds of disability in ADL and IADL according to the age, sex and all other variables. Results At six-year follow-up, 118 participants were still alive (65.6%), 31 died (17%) and other 31 were missed (17%). The incidence of disability to performADL and IADL were 25.4% and 32.3%, respectively. The regression logistic models revealed thaturinary incontinence (OR = 3.2; P = 0.03) and insufficient emotional support (OR = 3.8; P = 0.04) were associated with ADL disability, while visual problems (OR: 2.9; P = 0.03) and insufficient emotional support (OR: 5.6; P = 0.01) were associated with IADL disability. Conclusion The current study has identified that insufficient emotional support, visual problems and urinary incontinence are associated with disability in older adults. The routine assessment of these problems in the primary care clinics enable the implementation of strategies aimed at reducing or postponing disability. Educating patients and families will also enable better choices to reduce the risk of functional decline."
https://openalex.org/W2947836748,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic anticancer drug. Its intrinsic fluorescence properties enable investigation of tumor response, drug distribution and metabolism. First phantom studies in vitro showed optoacoustic property of DOX. We therefore aimed to further investigate the optoacoustic properties of DOX in biological tissue in order to explore its potential as theranostic agent. We analysed doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox·HCl) and liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox·Lipo), two common drugs for anti-cancer treatment in clinical medicine. Optoacoustic measurements revealed a strong signal of both doxorubicin substrates at 488 nm excitation wavelength. Post mortem analysis of intra-tumoral injections of DOX revealed a detectable optoacoustic signal even at three days after the injection. We thereby demonstrate the general feasibility of doxorubicin detection in biological tissue by means of optoacoustic tomography, which could be applied for high resolution imaging at mesoscopic depths dictated by effective penetration of visible light into the biological tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2947440708,"By comparing and measuring covariations of viral protein sequences from isolates of the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus (IAV), specific substitutions that co-occur in the NP-NA pair were identified. To investigate the effect of these co-occurring substitution pairs, the V100I substitution in NP and the D248N substitution in NA were introduced into laboratory-adapted WSN IAVs. The recombinant WSN with the covarying NPV100I-NAD248N pair exhibited enhanced pathogenicity, as characterized by increased viral production, increased death and inflammation of host cells, and high mortality in infected mice. Although direct interactions between the NPV100I and NAD248N proteins were not detected, the RNA-binding ability of NPV100I was increased, which was further strengthened by NAD248N, in expression-plasmid-transfected cells. Additionally, the NAD248N protein was frequently recruited within lipid rafts, indirectly affecting the RNA-binding ability of NP as well as viral release. Altogether, our data indicate that the covarying NPV100I-NAD248N pair obtained from 2009 pH1N1 IAV sequence information function together to synergistically augment viral assembly and release, which may explain the observed enhanced viral pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2947649232,"Feature screening has become a real prerequisite for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, as it is effective in reducing dimensionality and removing redundant features. However, existing methods for feature screening have been mostly relying on the assumptions of linear effects and independence (or weak dependence) between features, which might be inappropriate in real practice. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting continuous features for a categorical outcome from high-dimensional data. We propose a powerful statistical procedure that consists of two steps, a nonparametric significance test based on edge count and a multiple testing procedure with dependence adjustment for false discovery rate control. The new method presents two novelties. First, the edge-count test directly targets distributional difference between groups, therefore it is sensitive to nonlinear effects. Second, we relax the independence assumption and adapt Efron's procedure to adjust for the dependence between features. The performance of the proposed procedure, in terms of statistical power and false discovery rate, is illustrated by simulated data. We apply the new method to three genomic datasets to identify genes associated with colon, cervical and prostate cancers."
