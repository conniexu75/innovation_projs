https://openalex.org/W1488195106,"Abstract Large differences between the transfer RNA methyl-transferase capacity of adult organs and their fetal counterparts, as well as between tumor tissues and normal tissues, have been observed. This is in part due to the presence of natural inhibitors of the tRNA methyltransferases in normal adult tissues. An inhibitory system present in the liver, kidney, and pancreas of adult rabbit and rat has been identified. The inhibitory effect of extracts of these organs on the tRNA methyltransferases is due to the presence of an enzyme which methylates glycine to yield sarcosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-adenosylmethionine: glycine N-methyltransferase). The glycine methyltransferase not only competes with the tRNA methyltransferases for the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine but its product S-adenosylhomocysteine is a potent inhibitor of the tRNA methyltransferases and a relatively weak inhibitor of the glycine methyltransferase. The glycine methyltransferase is found only in those organs where elevated levels of S-adenosylmethionine-synthesizing enzyme have been observed. It is present at either very low levels or not at all in fetal organs and several tumor tissues. It is postulated that the glycine methyltransferase serves a role in regulating the relative levels of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, thus exerting some control over those methyltransferases whose activity is more sensitive to the action of S-adenosylhomocysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1488694825,"The effects of glucagon and epinephrine on gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in liver and of catecholamines and adrenocorticotrophic hormone on lipolysis in adipose tissue were examined in normal and adrenalectomized rats. Glucagon or epinephrine stimulation of glucose synthesis from lactate was markedly reduced in isolated perfused livers from fasted, adrenal-deficient rats. Administration in vivo of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone 30 min prior to perfusion restored the gluconeogenic response to glucagon. Cortisol and dexamethasone were also effective when added to the perfusion medium, but had no effect in the absence of glucagon. Cyclic AMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate) accumulation was normal or increased in livers from adrenalectomized rats perfused without hormones or with glucagon or epinephrine. Gluconeogenesis in livers from fasted, adrenal-deficient rats was relatively unresponsive to cyclic AMP or dibutyryl cyclic AMP added to the perfusion medium. Hypophysectomized rats also showed an impairment of cyclic AMP activation of gluconeogenesis which was corrected by treatment with cortisol but not growth hormone. High concentrations of epinephrine, glucagon, and cyclic AMP stimulated glucose production and lactate gluconeogenesis in livers from fed, adrenalectomized rats. However, more nearly physiological concentrations of the hormones did not activate glucose release and phosphorylase normally in such livers. Livers from fed, adrenalectomized rats also showed diminished activation of gluconeogenesis and phosphorylase by exogenous cyclic AMP. Omission of Ca++ from the perfusion medium did not alter control or cyclic AMP-stimulated glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis in normal rats. Addition of ethyleneglycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N′-tetraacetic acid to Ca++-free medium reduced the control rates of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis but did not abolish the stimulation by cyclic AMP. Lowering the Ca++ level did not accentuate the impairment of cyclic AMP-stimulated glycogenolysis in fed, adrenalectomized rats nor did increasing the Ca++ level relieve the impairment of cyclic AMP-stimulated gluconeogenesis. It is therefore concluded that variations in plasma Ca++ are not important in the regulation of hepatic glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine stimulation of free fatty acid and glycerol release is impaired in epididymal fat pads or isolated fat cells from adrenalectomized rats. Cyclic AMP accumulation in response to epinephrine is, however, increased in fat pads from such animals. Activation of lipolysis by norepinephrine, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or cyclic AMP is also reduced in fat cells from adrenal-deficient rats. These studies indicate that adrenal glucocorticoids are required for normal activation of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and lipolysis by epinephrine and other hormones. Part of the function of the steroids appears to be to maintain normal sensitivity of these processes to cyclic AMP. The possibility is discussed that the corticoids exert their permissive effects by preserving a normal intracellular ionic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1636387388,"Abstract Protein B2 is an iron-containing subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Its light absorption spectrum has similarities to that of oxyhemerythrin, but in addition shows a sharp peak at 410 nm. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum recorded from 14–293 °K shows a slightly asymmetric doublet centered at g = 2.0047. Even though the integrated ESR absorption corresponded at the most to a spin concentration of only 30% of the total iron content, different lines of evidence strongly link the presence of the ESR signal (and the peak at 410 nm) to the enzymatic activity of protein B2. Several characteristics of the signal would suggest that it is due to a free radical. It is, however, dependent on the presence of iron in protein B2. A mononuclear or dinuclear iron complex is considered less likely as an explanation of the data."
https://openalex.org/W1518069046,"Abstract Cytochalasin B inhibited the transport of several hexoses in HeLa, 3T3, HTC rat hepatoma, and chick embryo heart cells. Fifty per cent inhibition of [3H]glucose, [3H]glucosamine, and 2-deoxy[3H]glucose transport occurred with 8 x 10-8 m cytochalasin B. Inhibition of hexose transport was immediate and was immediately and completely reversible when cytochalasin B was removed from the medium after 1 hour of incubation. Cytochalasin B did not prevent the uptake of thymidine, uridine, α-aminoisobutyric acid, or calcium. Hexokinase activity of a HeLa cell sonicate was also unaffected by cytochalasin B. Inhibition of glucose transport appeared to be noncompetitive."

In contrast it does not prevent this response to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Because it is known that the kidney is the site of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol formation, these results provide evidence that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol or a further metabolite thereof and not 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is the metabolically active form of vitamin D(3) responsible for bone calcium mobilization."

https://openalex.org/W1504471357,"Abstract Two fractions of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase B1 and B2) and one fraction of cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase (protein kinase B0) are resolved and partially purified from rat liver cytosol treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-Sephadex and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Analysis with gel filtration on a Sephadex column reveals that protein kinase B0 shows a single peak with themolecular weight of approximately 3 x 104, whereas protein kinase B1 is a mixture of two, major and minor, species of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases with the molecular weights of 1.8 x 105 and 1.2 x 105, respectively. However, the minor species appears to be an artifact due to proteolysis during the isolation procedure. Protein kinase B2 is also a mixture of multiple cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases with the molecular weights ranging from 1.0 x 105 up to more than 2.0 x 105. This heterogeneity does not seem to represent simply artifact due to proteolysis during the isolation procedure. Each of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases is shown to be an inactive form of protein kinase, the activity of which is inhibited by association of regulatory protein (R-protein). R-protein per se is catalytically inactive. Cyclic AMP activates such inactive form by binding to the R-protein molecule in an allosteric manner, resulting in the release of active protein kinase. All active protein kinases thus released from both protein kinase B1 and B2 are indistinguishable from protein kinase B0, and show the molecular weight of 3 x 104. The active protein kinases show similar kinetic properties and behave in an identical manner upon chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column. These kinases are not stimulated nor inhibited by the cyclic nucleotide, and phosphorylate the same specific seryl and threonyl residues of histone. An available evidence suggests that the multiple cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases differ from each other in their associated R-proteins, although the exact identity of the active protein kinases may be explored by further investigations. Protein kinase B1 is shown to be reconstituted from protein kinase B0 and each of the R-proteins with the molecular weights of 1.5 x 105 and 9 x 104, although the latter R-protein is probably an artifact due to proteolysis. These R-proteins are partially purified from rat liver cytosol. However, attempts to reconstitute protein kinase B2 have been unsuccessful. Most of the R-protein is unstable and decomposed to a smaller protein with the molecular weight of about 4 x 104. Protein kinase B1 and B2 show closely similar properties, but their affinities for cyclic AMP are slightly different."

https://openalex.org/W1997070409,"The effects of putative transmitters on the primary afferent terminals were studied in the magnesium-treated, isolated spinal cord of the frog. Gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid reversibly depolarized primary afferent terminals and increased their excitability, whereas glycine produced weak and variable effects. Bicuculline and picrotoxin, which reduce primary afferent depolarization, reversibly antagonized the gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated responses but had little effect on those produced by either glutamic acid or glycine. The glutamic acid- and the gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced depolarizations remained in the absence of external chloride but disappeared in the absence of external sodium. These results support the hypotheses that gamma-aminobutyric acid is the transmitter mediating the synaptic depolarization of primary afferent terminals and that sodium is the predominant ion involved."
https://openalex.org/W1522146362,"Abstract The subcellular distribution in rat liver of a phospholipid identified as bis-(monoacylglyceryl) phosphate (bis(MAG)P) has been investigated. In liver from untreated animals, 48% of bis(MAG)P was recovered in a crude mitochondrial fraction where it was enriched 2.8-fold over the homogenate in terms of protein. When liver from animals who had received Triton WR-1339 by injection 3 days earlier was taken and the crude mitochondrial fraction subfractionated on a discontinuous density gradient of sucrose, 32% of bis(MAG)P was recovered in the lysosome fraction. In terms of protein, bis(MAG)P was enriched 32-fold in the lysosome fraction and its distribution among the various fractions paralleled closely that of acid phosphatase. In the lysosome fraction it comprised 7% of the total phospholipid P whereas cardiolipin accounted for 1%. These results show that bis(MAG)P is greatly enriched in secondary lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1600918029,"Abstract Human α-fetoprotein has been isolated from the sera of hepatoma patients by the combined techniques of preparative electrophoresis, Sephadex gel filtration, and preparative isoelectric focusing. The purity of the isolated α-fetoprotein was demonstrable by (a) a single line on Ouchterlony immunodiffusion versus anti-α-fetoprotein, with no reaction versus a potent polyvalent anti-human serum of anti-albumin; (b) a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis; and (c) the production of monospecific antibody upon immunization of rabbits. The molecular weight of α-fetoprotein was 72,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide electrophoresis. Two major molecular forms of α-fetoprotein were found by isoelectric focusing, ion exchange chromatography, and agarose electrophoresis. Both forms were present in most hepatoma and fetal sera, but their relative amounts appeared to have no relationship to gestational age, clinical status, serum concentration, or method of storage. The two forms, with isoelectric points of 4.85 and 5.2, were isolated by preparative isoelectric focusing and were found to convert to a single homogeneous form with slower electrophoretic mobility after treatment with neuraminidase."
https://openalex.org/W1552776768,"Abstract The biosynthesis of collagen was studied both in vivo and in vitro in embryonic chick lens, a tissue in which all of the collagen is in the basement membrane of the lens capsule. Experiments in vivo demonstrated that only a small fraction of the total protein synthesized by the lens is collagen but that the rate of collagen synthesis increases significantly between about Day 18 and Day 20 of embryonic development. [14C]Proline was incorporated into basement membrane collagen by intact lenses in vitro and by matrix-free cells obtained by enzymic dissociation of the embryonic lenses. The [14C]proline incorporation per µg of DNA observed with the matrix-free cells was about 77% of the rate observed with intact lenses. Of the total hydroxy[14C]proline synthesized by the matrix-free cells, about 14% was present as the 3-isomer. Significant amounts of collagen 4-hydroxy[14C]-proline were secreted into the incubation medium by the matrix-free cells, but incubation of the cells with [14C]proline for varying periods of time indicated that the secretion of the collagen did not begin until about 1 hour after the incorporation of 14C into protein became linear. The results indicated that in lens cells there is a greater lag between the incorporation of [14C]proline into protein and the secretion of [14C]-collagen than is observed with matrix-free tendon cells under the same conditions. When the cells were incubated with [14C]lysine, 85 to 92% of the hydroxy[14C]lysine in both the intracellular and extracellular collagen synthesized by the system was glycosylated, and most of the glycosylated hydroxy[14C]lysine was present as glucosylgalactosylhydroxy[14C]lysine. The extent of glycosylation of hydroxy[14C]lysine in the intracellular collagen was maximal even after incubation with [14C]lysine for only 30 min, a time at which the secretion of [14C]collagen had not yet begun. The data indicated, therefore, that the glycosylation occurred shortly after the synthesis of hydroxylysine in the molecule and that the addition of both hexose residues was initiated considerably before the molecule was secreted."

https://openalex.org/W1559011673,"Abstract 1. Exposure of mitochondria and submitochondrial particles from bovine heart to [35S]diazobenzenesulfonate yielded information on the asymmetrical distribution of membrane components. Radioactive coupling factor 1 (ATPase) was isolated from submitochondrial particles and radioactive cytochrome c from mitochondria. The specific radioactivities were comparable to those observed when the soluble proteins were exposed to [35S]diazobenzenesulfonate. The low radioactivity of coupling factor 1 isolated from mitochondria and of cytochrome c isolated from submitochondrial particles is evidence for the lack of permeation of the radioactive marker from one side of the membrane to the other. 2. Cytochrome oxidase was labeled from both sides of the membrane, but the specific radioactivity was about 6-fold lower than that of a solubilized cytochrome oxidase treated with [35S]diazobenzenesulfonate. This finding indicates a transmembranous location of cytochrome oxidase. 3. Spectral and enzymatic analyses of mitochondria and submitochondrial particles after cross-linking with polylysine show that cytochrome a is located on the same side as cytochrome c and suggest that cytochrome a3 is located on the same side as coupling factor 1. 4. Exposure of membrane-bound coupling factor 1 to [35S]-diazobenzenesulfonate resulted in an asymmetrical labeling of its subunits which was distinctly different from the labeling pattern after exposure of the soluble coupling factor."
https://openalex.org/W1532265104,"Abstract The first intermediate in the conversion of p-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) to ubiquinone is a 3-polyprenyl derivative of PHB. Winrow and Rudney ((1969) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 37, 833) noted that in rat tissue minces and homogenates the synthesis of 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (PPHB) required supplementation with an extract of Micrococcus lysodeikticus and isopentenylpyrophosphate. Under new conditions adopted by us the requirement for the M. lysodeikticus extract can be dispensed with and the synthesis of polyprenyl-p-hydroxybenzoate can be obtained solely from p-hydroxybenzoate, mevalonate, and ATP. Pulse chase experiments with labeled precursors in rat liver minces show a precursor-product relationship of PPHB and ubiquinone. It was found that PPHB was located primarily in the inner membrane of liver mitochondria. Mitochondrial preparations to which PHB, ATP, and mevalonate were added could not synthesize PPHB unless a supernatant fraction obtained by centrifugation of rat liver homogenates at 48,000 x g was added. The requirement for the supernatant fraction, ATP, and mevalonate could be dispensed with only if isopentenylpyrophosphate were added. This implied that mitochondria contain a system for synthesizing polyprenylpyrophosphate derivatives. This concept was unequivocally verified by demonstration of the presence of a sequence of key enzymes involved in polyprenyl synthesis, i.e. isopentenylpyrophosphate isomerase and diprenyltransferase, in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The nature of the PPHB formed in rat liver was investigated and it was found that in keeping with the known distribution of ubiquinone prenyl analogues UQ-9 and UQ-10 in rat liver the same proportion of 3-decaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 3-nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate could be formed. Guinea pig liver which is known to contain only UQ-10 was also shown to form only 3-decaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The enzyme alkylating PHB, i.e. PHB: polyprenyltransferase, has been shown to be unspecific with regard to the length of the polyprenyl side chain which it can transfer o PHB. The predominance of any prenyl analogue of UQ in a tissue depends upon the specificity of the system which determines the length of the polyprenylpyrophosphate chains synthesized in mitochondria. Conditions for the optimal synthesis of PPHB from PHB and isopentenylpyrophosphate in mitochondria are described. The effect of CoA-SH was investigated on PPHB formation and was found to be either nonexistent or stimulatory depending on the medium in which the synthesis was carried out. In the latter case CoA-SH increased the amount of shorter chain prenyl analogues of PHB. The results, providing the first demonstration that a system of enzymes for synthesizing polyprenylpyrophosphate chains exists in the inner mitochondrial membrane, are of great biological significance in view of the increasing role that these compounds play in the transfer of sugars to glycoproteins. Several other possible roles for polyprenylpyrophosphate compounds in mitochondria are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559585838,"Abstract l-Histidinol has been found to be a potent, reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis in cultured human cells. When the culture medium contains 0.005 mm histidine, protein synthesis is inhibited 50% by 0.1 mm histidinol. Histidinol does not significantly affect the transport of histidine into cells or the amount of histidine accumulated in the free amino acid pool. Histidinol probably inhibits protein synthesis by decreasing the activation of histidine since it competitively inhibits the pyrophosphate-ATP exchange reaction promoted by crude histidyl-tRNA synthetase in the presence of histidine, with an apparent Ki of 4 x 10-7 m. Histidinol alone will not support the exchange reaction. The inhibition by histidinol of the over-all histidine charging reaction with tRNA is also competitive. The apparent Ki of histidinol for the charging reaction, under different reaction conditions than the exchange reaction, is 3 x 10-6 m. Histidinol appears to be a useful inhibitor for studying the regulation of macromolecule synthesis in cultured human cells."

https://openalex.org/W1552520497,"Abstract A procedure for partial purification of the adipose tissue adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase by substrate affinity chromatography is described. On the basis of specificity, apparent Km for ATP, pH dependence, metal ion requirement, and other properties, the enzyme showed a striking similarity to the protein kinases described in skeletal muscle and other tissues. Chromatography on casein-Sepharose columns in the presence of cAMP produced a cAMP-independent kinase. Gel filtration studies showed that this form had a molecular weight of approximately 42,000 as compared with 140,000 for the original cAMP-dependent enzyme. The adipose tissue cAMP-independent kinase was inhibited by a heat-stable muscle protein and by a preparation of muscle protein kinase regulatory subunit. The latter effect occurred only in the absence of cAMP. The cAMP-dependent and independent protein kinases were affected similarly by sodium chloride and potassium chloride and the direction of the effect was dependent on the substrate used. On the basis of the above findings and reports of results obtained with protein kinases from other tissues, it would appear that the adipose tissue cAMP-dependent protein kinase is composed of a regulatory (cAMP-binding) subunit and a cAMP-independent catalytic subunit. Lipolytic activity in adipose tissue homogenates is stimulated 2-fold in the absence of cAMP and in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP by the protein kinase catalytic subunit prepared from skeletal muscle. This stimulation is prevented if the muscle protein kinase regulatory subunit is also included in the incubation. The regulatory subunit added alone did not alter lipolytic activity significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1597293236,"Abstract Treatment of Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA with sodium bisulfite results in conversion of 6 cytidine residues to uridine residues under conditions where other cytidine residues in the tRNA are unreactive. Comparison of double and single stranded polymers shows that the bisulfitemediated deamination reaction is strongly inhibited by ordered structure. Under conditions where over 90% of the cytidine residues in poly(C) are deaminated, there is no detectable reaction of poly(I) poly(C). The 6 reactive cytidine residues in formylemethionine tRNA are modified at the same rate as cytidine residues in poly(C) and all are located in single stranded regions of the clover-leaf model. The modified residues include the cytidine at the 5'-phosphate terminus, the cytidine in the anticodon, the two cytidines in the dihydrouridine loop, and the two cytidines in the 3'-terminal CpCpA sequence. The O-methylcytidine in the anticodon loop shows only about 20% reaction under conditions where reactive cytidines are completely modified. No reaction of the cytidine in the small loop or of the cytidine in the TψC loop is observed. Aside from the unusual unpaired base at the 5' terminus, the initiator tRNA resembles several other tRNAs with respect to the locations of exposed and protected cytidine residues in the ordered structure of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1534762597,"Abstract The chain-initiating reaction in chondroitin sulfate synthesis is catalyzed by a xylosyltransferase, which transfers xylose from UDP-xylose to a polypeptide acceptor. The enzyme has previously been detected in several cell-free tissue preparations, which also contain endogenous xylose acceptors. However, reliable quantitation of enzyme levels has not been possible, since such crude systems contain two unknown dependent variables, enzyme concentration and acceptor concentration. The purpose of the present work was (a) to develop exogenous acceptors which would permit accurate determination of enzyme levels and (b) at the same time gain some insight into the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Many small molecular weight compounds were tested as potential acceptors, including free serine, serine derivatives, and serine-containing peptides. One of the peptides had some acceptor activity, i.e. the tripeptide, Ser-Gly-Gly, although it had a rather high Km value of 20.0 mm. Considerably higher acceptor activity was observed with peptides derived from the chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region by Smith degradation of a chondroitin sulfate peptidoglycan preparation, which had been isolated after trypsin digestion of the proteoglycan. Smith degradation of the entire proteoglycan molecule yielded the best acceptor obtained so far; this material had a Km of 0.064 mm, expressed in terms of concentration of serine residues. The intact proteoglycan was not an acceptor, nor were the products obtained by digestion with testicular hyaluronidase or bacterial chondroitinase, although about half of the serine residues in these three compounds are unsubstituted. Characterization of the [14C]xylosyl-labeled Smith-degraded proteoglycan showed that (a) xylose had been incorporated into the protein in an alkali-labile linkage from which it could be released as xylitol on treatment with alkaline borohydride, and that (b) exhaustive proteolysis yielded a compound with electrophoretic and chromatographic properties of xylosylserine. It is therefore concluded that xylose had been transferred to the serine hydroxyl groups which had been liberated by Smith degradation. Furthermore, the failure of the intact proteoglycan and the enzymatic digestion products to serve as acceptors suggests that glycosylation occurs specifically at certain serine sites of the proteoglycan molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1628593931,"Abstract A concentrated solution of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase has a deep red color with a broad absorption band between 400 and 650 nm. The enzyme showed a sharp electron spin resonance signal at g = 4.31 known to be due to the high spin state of ferric ion. The signal markedly decreased upon the addition of sodium dithionite concomitant with bleaching of the red color, but the signal as well as the red color was partially restored when the solution was exposed to air. The restoration of the red color was also observed when potassium ferricyanide was added to the solution under anaerobic conditions. These results indicate that the trivalent iron bound to the enzyme is responsible for the electron spin resonance signal as well as the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme. When the substrate, protoacatechuic acid, was added to the enzyme under anaerobic conditions, the electron spin resonance signal at g = 4.31 decreased instantaneously. The signal was restored to the original level when the substrate was completely exhausted by the introduction of air. The decrease in electron spin resonance signal was also observed when various substrate analogues or competitive inhibitors were used. However, changes in electron spin resonance signal caused by substrate analogues or competitive inhibitors were somewhat different from the one caused by the substrate in that they showed a marked anisotropy. The visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme exhibited an increase in absorbance with a slight red shift of the peak by the addition of the substrate under anaerobic conditions indicating the possible formation of a enzyme-substrate complex. The spectrum was restored to the original one after the substrate was exhausted by the addition of oxygen. Similar, but not exactly identical spectral changes were observed when various substrate analogues were used. The spectrum of the enzyme-substrate complex was markedly decreased when sodium dithionite was added to the complex and was restored to that of the complex upon the addition of ferricyanide. Further addition of oxygen converted the spectrum to that of the original enzyme. Evidence is also presented to indicate that the enzyme consists of eight subunits and combines with 8 moles of substrate. In light of the above findings, the valence state of the iron in the enzyme, and its relation to substrate binding sites and to subunit structure of the enzyme are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1552281684,"Abstract Ethanolamine ammonia lyase catalyzes the coenzyme B12-dependent conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and NH3. When the enzyme-coenzyme complex is frozen in liquid nitrogen during the act of catalysis, an electron spin resonance signal equivalent to about 0.04 spin per active site can be detected. By saturation experiments, the signal consists of two components, a broad derivative signal composed of two peaks (g = 2.34 and g = 2.08) assigned to the cobalt of B12r, and a narrow signal (g = 2.007) assigned to a free radical. With [1,1-D2]ethanolamine as substrate, the shape and position of the signal was unchanged, but its size was increased. In the absence of substrate, a signal was still observed, but the concentration of unpaired electrons was reduced. The broad metal signal was unchanged except for a decrease in size. The radical signal was narrower (10 gauss, compared with 18 gauss in the presence of substrate) and was shifted (g = 2.003) with respect to the substrate-dependent signal, suggesting that the radical in the absence of substrate may have been different from the substrate-dependent radical. These observations support the proposal that the mechanism of action of this coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme involves homolysis of the carbon-cobalt bond of the coenzyme."

CRP binds to λpgal, λh80dlac ps, calf thymus, salmon sperm, and chicken blood DNA. CRP also binds to denatured chicken blood DNA and the separated strands of λpgal and λplac DNA. The binding of CRP to these DNA species is cyclic AMP-dependent and is inhibited by cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. At least 30 molecules of CRP bind to 1 molecule of λpgal DNA as measured by the sucrose density gradient technique. There is no binding of CRP to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase as measured by sucrose density gradient analysis. Although CRP binds to DNA species containing no known CRP-cyclic AMP sensitive promoters, the cyclic AMP dependency of the binding suggests that DNA binding of CRP may be important in stimulation of transcription by CRP-cyclic AMP."

The daily rhythm in concentration of the adrenal steroid does not depend on a daily rhythm in the concentration of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone.
https://openalex.org/W2044391573,"A new compound, 5,6-trans-25-hydroxycholecalciferol, has been synthesized and tested for its biological activity. Like 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, it stimulates intestinal calcium transport in anephric rats, whereas 25-hydroxycholecalciferol does not. But this analog has little if any activity in stimulating mobilization of calcium from the bone of anephric rats."
https://openalex.org/W2043071269,"Interferon was identified in the milk of mice injected with an interferon inducer. The kinetics of interferon appearance in serum and in milk were similar, but maximum concentrations in milk were 10 to 20 percent of those in serum. Interferon administered orally to neonatal mice was detected in their serums. Significantly more newborns survived an oral challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus when interferon had been induced in the lactating mothers."
https://openalex.org/W1569416025,"Abstract Fusion of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was carried out in an isotonic salt solution at pH 7.8. Fusion occurred efficiently even under nitrogen with glucose as the only added substrate. In the presence of NaCN (1 mm), rotenone (0.5 mm), or dinitrophenol (0.25 mm) the process was absolutely dependent on glucose concentration (1 to 10 mm). Inosine alone (10 mm) or with addition of adenine (2 mm) could replace glucose when fusion was carried out in the presence of NaCN. High concentration of Ca++ (20 mm) or Mn++ (6 mm) facilitated fusion even in the absence of glucose. In the presence of ouabain (0.1 mm), Ca++ is not required for fusion. Ca++ was also not required in a medium of high KCl and low NaCl which, like ouabain, is known to inhibit sodium and potassium ion-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. The data presented strongly suggest that all possible conditions which allow agglutination to occur and suppress virus-induced lysis might be sufficient for the fusion process."
https://openalex.org/W2047607414,"The incidence of 3-methylcholanthrene-induced subcutaneous tumors was significantly reduced by a single injection of inactivated type C RNA viral vaccine. Rauscher leukemia virus vaccine reduced the incidence of sarcomas from 78 to 50 percent in the BALB/cCr mouse. Radiation leukemia virus vaccine and a vaccine from a wild murine leukemia virus derived from a 3-methylcholanthrene tumor reduced the incidence of sarcoma from 86 percent to 33 and 37 percents, respectively, in the C57BL/6 mouse. These reductions in tumor incidence by virus vaccines help support the concept that type C RNA viruses serve as determinants of chemically induced cancer; additional studies of vaccines made with more purified virus preparations are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1557452901,"Abstract Mild acid hydrolysis of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide from Xanthomonas sinensis yielded a disaccharide composed of mannose phosphate glycosidically linked to a keto-deoxy acid. Treatment of the disaccharide with alkaline phosphatase followed by α-mannosidase liberated an acid component which migrated electrophoretically with authentic 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO), but differed chromatographically from known KDO. Molecular weight determination by mass spectrometry of the persilylated derivative of the borohydride-reduced acid yielded a value equal to that calculated for the lactone of authentic reduced KDO. Periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction of the Xanthomonas acid yielded two electrophoretically separable compounds. Molecular weight determinations by high resolution mass spectrometry indicated that one of these compounds had gained 2 atomic mass units, while the other had lost 100 atomic mass units from the starting material. Treatment of authentic KDO with 2% acetic acid for 90 min at 100° followed by borohydride reduction resulted in the conversion of most of the KDO into compounds identical with the reduced acids isolated from the Xanthomonas lipopolysaccharide. The results presented are consistent with the conclusion that the lipopolysaccharide occurring in the cell wall of Xanthomonas sinensis contains a single molecule of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid per molecule of lipopolysaccharide, and that mild acid hydrolysis of either the Xanthomonas lipopolysaccharide or of authentic KDO results in the formation of 4,7-anhydro- and 4,8-anhydro-3-deoxy-octulosonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2001590485,"Comparison was made between 2659 veterans who died of cancer, during 1950 to 1954 or 1959 to 1963, and matched controls, based on the frequency of yellow fever immunization during World War II. The vaccine was produced from chick embryos that almost certainly contained avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses. Among the veterans, no relation was found between vaccination and leukemia, lymphoma, or other cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1650999572,"Abstract The kinetic properties of the p-nitrophenylphosphatase of red cell ghosts from rats fed fat-sufficient and fat-deficient diets were investigated. With this system the enzyme shows hyperbolic saturation curves. In the fat-sufficient case, positive cooperativity with n g 1.5 for K+ and negative cooperativity with n l -1.5 for F- were observed. Evidence for a different allosteric transition in the p-nitro-phenylphosphatase from fat-deficient rats is supported by the following facts: (a) values of n g -1.5 in F- inhibition and (b) nonsigmoidal kinetics for K+ activation with n l 1.5. In the activation by K+, the heterotropic effect of F- and of the substrate alters the values of n and K0.5 in fat-deficient rats but in fat-sufficient rats the corresponding effect is only on the K0.5 values. Arrhenius plots for the p-nitrophenylphosphatase between 7 and 45° showed for the enzyme from fat-sufficient rats an inflection point at 30°; for the p-nitrophenylphosphatase from deficient animals two inflection points were observed, one at 30° and another at 37°. Evidence is presented showing that in fat-deficient rats the p-nitrophenylphosphatase of the red cell ghost has an allosteric transition different from the corresponding controls."
https://openalex.org/W2075428992,"Abstract Pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was separated into lipoamide dehydrogenase (s20,w = 5.74 S) and a colorless fraction by the fractionation on a calcium phosphate gel-cellulose column in the presence of 4 m urea. Subsequently, in the presence of 0.3 m potassium iodide, the colorless fraction was fractionated into two additional components, pyruvate dehydrogenase (7.84 S) and partially resolved lipoate acetyltransferase, by solid ammonium sulfate. In the presence of 4 m urea, highly purified lipoate acetyltransferase (31.6 S) was prepared by the resolution of the yellow fraction which was separated from the native complex on a calcium phosphate gel-cellulose column in the presence of 0.02 m ethanolamine (pH 9.4). All three components were required to reconstitute the coenzyme A- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked oxidation of pyruvate. The sedimentation coefficient (65.5 S), the composition, and enzymatic activities of the reconstituted complex were in good agreement with the values of the native complex."
https://openalex.org/W1582117490,"Abstract The spin-labeled ferrihemoglobin, in which a spin label is attached to one of the propionic acid groups at positions 6 or 7 of the porphyrin ring, was enzymatically reduced to the ferrous oxy form without destroying the spin label. The enzyme system contains ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP reductase, and a NADPH generating system. The absorption spectra of the spin-labeled hemoglobins are identical with those of native hemoglobins. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the spin-labeled oxyhemoglobin is distinctly different from that of the acid methemoglobin indicating different conformations for the protein in the vicinity of the label in these two hemoglobins. The resonance amplitude of the oxyhemoglobin is approximately twice that of the ferrihemoglobin. The change is attributed to the spin state change of the heme-iron from the high spin ferric to the low spin ferrous form. Because the oxygen binding properties of the spin-labeled hemoglobins are identical with those of native hemoglobin, this hemoglobin will be used for probing the molecular mechanism of hemoglobin functions in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1575735806,"Abstract Free cell suspensions of renal tubules obtained from the rachitic chicken were observed to be capable of the rapid and sustained metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Among the products of the in vitro metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was a metabolite identified to be identical to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) metabolite known to be most active for the initiation of intestinal calcium transport. Unlike the results reported for kidney homogenates, the renal tubule metabolism results in the production of at least one major metabolic product other than 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Further-more the renal tubule preparation was observed to be able to rapidly metabolize 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to other as yet unidentified metabolites. The initial rates of consumption of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol were estimated to be, respectively, 4.5 and 27.9 fmoles per min per mg of renal tubule protein. The rates of renal tubule RNA and protein synthesis were observed to be linear for 15 and 180 min, respectively. The short interval for linear RNA synthesis appeared to be due to precursor pool equilibration as nonlinear RNA synthesis could be demonstrated during at least a 45-min incubation interval. The complete inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D or protein synthesis by puromycin did not diminish either the rate of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol consumption or the amount of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol produced by renal tubules. This result was obtained even after the renal tubules had been incubated for 3 hours in the presence of the metabolic inhibitors prior to the initiation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol metabolism. The rate of α-ketoglutarate consumption by the chick renal tubules was observed to be sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium ion concentration in a manner analogous to that reported for rat renal tubules. Additionally the chick renal tubules showed a marked elevation in cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate content after stimulation by parathyroid hormone. Identical changes in extracellular calcium ion concentration or stimulation by parathyroid hormone had no effect on the metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol as measured after 30 min of incubation. It was concluded that the ability of renal tubules to metabolize 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is not dependent upon their ability to synthesize either RNA or proteins and that the renal metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is not subject to regulation by extracellular calcium ion concentration. Additionally parathyroid hormone was observed to have no regulatory effect upon the metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by renal tubules isolated from rachitic chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2058861871,The photoreceptors in the median ocellus of the rock barnacle depolarize when illuminated. This depolarization spreads passively to the axon terminals in the supraesophageal ganglion. A small number of cells in the supraesophageal ganglion hyperpolarize when the median ocellus is illuminated and depolarize when it is shadowed. Nerve impulses are superimposed on the slow depolarization of the ganglion cells. Impulse activity in response to shadowing the median ocellus is recorded in a few fibers of the circumesophageal connectives. Picrotoxin blocks this shadow-induced activity. A model of the shadow reflex pathway is presented.

Incubation of infected cells with unlabeled antibody to viral antigens specifically blocks the attachment of labeled antibody, and by this inhibition technique the titer of unlabeled antibody to viral antigens can be calculated. The attachment of the labeled antibody to virus-infected cells offers an objective and sensitive method of detecting viral antigens and measuring antibody to virus."
https://openalex.org/W1522321224,"Abstract Mutations in any of six genes of Salmonella typhimurium lead to constitutivity of the histidine operon. Four of these genes, hisR, hisU, hisW, and hisT, are believed to be involved with the production of histidine tRNA. We show that the tRNAhis isolated from each of these mutants is aminoacylated normally, indicating that the constitutivity of these mutants cannot be ascribed to a reduced ability of their histidine tRNA to be charged. HisT mutants are known to have a structurally altered tRNAhis. These mutants are apparently constitutive because of failure of the altered tRNA to interact properly with the repression mechanism. The binding of charged tRNAhis from hisT mutants to the histidyl-tRNA synthetase, one candidate for the corepressor of the histidine operon, has been tested by filter binding. Under several different assay conditions the binding of histidyl-tRNAhis from the wild type and from hisT1504 is the same within experimental error. An assay for the enzymatic deacylation of histidyl-tRNAhis was developed to check the binding constants obtained by the filter binding method. The synthetase has surprisingly low Km values for the substrates of the reverse reaction; 45 µm for AMP and 15 µm for pyrophosphate. The Km for charged tRNAhis, 40 nm, is the same as the dissociation constant found for charged tRNAhis by filter binding and also the same as the Km for uncharged tRNAhis in the aminoacylation reaction. The Km of the enzyme for tRNAhis is shown to increase as the histidine concentration is increased, over a range of histidine concentrations that are found physiologically. It is shown that an increase in pyrophosphate concentration increases the inhibitory effect of AMP on synthetase activity, and it is suggested that this has physiological meaning."
https://openalex.org/W1554181408,"Abstract Free cell suspensions of intestinal epithelial and renal tubule cells were prepared by enzymatic digestion of tissue from rachitic chickens. The cells were demonstrated to remain metabolically functional during prolonged incubation at 37°. Both preparations were demonstrated to be capable of the in vitro metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to products chromatographically more polar than 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. One product of the in vitro renal tubule metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was shown to be identical to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, countercurrent distribution in two different solvent systems, thin layer chromatography, and by its insensitivity to periodic acid oxidation. Additionally it was demonstrated that 25,26-dihydroxycholecalciferol is not and that 21,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, if produced at all, is a very minor product of the in vitro renal tubule metabolism of cholecalciferol. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol was not a product of the in vitro intestinal epithelial cell metabolism of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. More importantly, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol also was not significantly metabolized in vitro by the epithelial cell preparation. This observation provides a unique demonstration that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and not some further metabolite of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is the cholecalciferol metabolite responsible for the initiation and maintenance of intestinal calcium absorption."
https://openalex.org/W1518350767,"Diphosphopyridine nucleotide analogues have been prepared in which the adenosine 5′-monophosphate of the coenzyme is replaced by the 5′-monophosphate of one of the following fluorescent nucleosides: formycin, 2-aminopurine riboside, and 7-deazapurine riboside (7-deazanebularin). The analogue compounds, unlike the parent coenzyme, are highly fluorescent in both oxidized and reduced form. Their spectral and fluorescence properties have been examined as a function of temperature, pH, and solvent conditions. All three analogues show significant coenzyme activity and can replace DPN with all of the five dehydrogenases tested; the efficiency of the analogues in these tests is in the range of 20 to 150%, compared with DPN+ itself."
