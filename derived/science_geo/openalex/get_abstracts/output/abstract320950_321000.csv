https://openalex.org/W2078329205,"Charcoal is common in the soils of mature rain forests within 75 kilometers of San Carlos de Rio Negro in the north central Amazon Basin. Carbon-14 dates of soil charcoal from this region indicate that numerous fires have occurred since the mid-Holocene epoch. Charcoal is most common in tierra firme forest Oxisols and Ultisols and less common in caatinga and igapo forest soils. Climatic changes or human activities, or both, have caused rain-forest fires."
https://openalex.org/W1995881811,"The discovery of abundant autotrophic macrophytes living below 200 meters indicates their importance to primary productivity, food webs, sedimentary processes, and as reef builders in clear oceanic waters. Estimates concerning minimum light levels for macroalgal photosynthesis and macrophytic contributions to the biology and geology of tropical insular and continental borderlands must now be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2016727667,"A comparison of infrared spectra from individual teeth along the radula of a chiton (Polyplacophora, Mollusca) shows that the first-formed calcium phosphate mineral is amorphous. Over a period of weeks the mineral transforms to dahllite. The c axes of the dahllite crystals are aligned approximately perpendicular to the tooth surface."
https://openalex.org/W2081168314,"Morphologic and paleozoogeographic analysis of Cenozoic marine Ostracoda from the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific indicates that climatic change modulates evolution by disrupting long-term stasis and catalyzing speciation during sustained, unidirectional climatic transitions and, conversely, by maintaining morphologic stasis during rapid, high-frequency climatic oscillations. In the middle Pliocene, 4 to 3 million years ago, at least six new species of Puriana suddenly appeared as the Isthmus of Panama closed, changing oceanographic circulation and global climate. Since then morphologic stasis has characterized ancestral and descendant species during many glacial-interglacial cycles. The frequency and duration of climatic events have more impact on ostracode evolution than the magnitude of climatic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2010106286,"Temperature profiles measured regularly for 21 years reveal the interannual differences in winter-to-summer heat gain in Castle Lake, California, a small subalpine lake. Year-to-year changes in large-scale climatic surface forcing, especially the amount of snowfall from February through April (which determines the date of thaw) coupled with the early heating and wind mixing after thaw, causes this interannual variation. The seasonal thermal structure for years in which the lake gains significantly more or less heat than normal—all of the El Niño years and several others—shows that the depth of the mixed layer and the mixing of heat into the stratified thermocline region control the storage of heat. The temperature of the mixed layer does not reflect abnormal thermal storage. Variations in mixing during early spring, which controls the heat content at Castle Lake, may also affect the annual average of the primary productivity."
