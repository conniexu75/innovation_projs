https://openalex.org/W4220987557,"We provide two methods for monitoring reinfection trends in routine surveillance data to identify signatures of changes in reinfection risk and apply these approaches to data from South Africa’s severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic to date. Although we found no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of the Beta (B.1.351) or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, we did find clear, population-level evidence to suggest immune evasion by the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in previously infected individuals in South Africa. Reinfections occurring between 1 November 2021 and 31 January 2022 were detected in individuals infected in all three previous waves, and there has been an increase in the risk of having a third infection since mid-November 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4220656655,"Declines in health service use during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could have important effects on population health. In this study, we used an interrupted time series design to assess the immediate effect of the pandemic on 31 health services in two low-income (Ethiopia and Haiti), six middle-income﻿ (Ghana, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mexico, Nepal, South Africa and Thailand) and high-income (Chile and South Korea) countries. Despite efforts to maintain health services, disruptions of varying magnitude and duration were found in every country, with no clear patterns by country income group or pandemic intensity. Disruptions in health services often preceded COVID-19 waves. Cancer screenings, TB screening and detection and HIV testing were most affected (26-96% declines). Total outpatient visits declined by 9-40% at national levels and remained lower than predicted by the end of 2020. Maternal health services were disrupted in approximately half of the countries, with declines ranging from 5% to 33%. Child vaccinations were disrupted for shorter periods, but we estimate that catch-up campaigns might not have reached all children missed. By contrast, provision of antiretrovirals for HIV was not affected. By the end of 2020, substantial disruptions remained in half of the countries. Preliminary data for 2021 indicate that disruptions likely persisted. Although a portion of the declines observed might result from decreased needs during lockdowns (from fewer infectious illnesses or injuries), a larger share likely reflects a shortfall of health system resilience. Countries must plan to compensate for missed healthcare during the current pandemic and invest in strategies for better health system resilience for future emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4220764353,"Genetic correlation (rg) analysis is used to identify phenotypes that may have a shared genetic basis. Traditionally, rg is studied globally, considering only the average of the shared signal across the genome, although this approach may fail when the rg is confined to particular genomic regions or in opposing directions at different loci. Current tools for local rg analysis are restricted to analysis of two phenotypes. Here we introduce LAVA, an integrated framework for local rg analysis that, in addition to testing the standard bivariate local rgs between two phenotypes, can evaluate local heritabilities and analyze conditional genetic relations between several phenotypes using partial correlation and multiple regression. Applied to 25 behavioral and health phenotypes, we show considerable heterogeneity in the bivariate local rgs across the genome, which is often masked by the global rg patterns, and demonstrate how our conditional approaches can elucidate more complex, multivariate genetic relations. LAVA estimates multivariate local genetic relations, which enables conditional genetic analyses. Application to behavioral and health traits identifies local genetic heterogeneity and provides insights into genetic mediation and confounding."

https://openalex.org/W4220985590,"Mammalian embryogenesis is characterized by rapid cellular proliferation and diversification. Within a few weeks, a single-cell zygote gives rise to millions of cells expressing a panoply of molecular programs. Although intensively studied, a comprehensive delineation of the major cellular trajectories that comprise mammalian development in vivo remains elusive. Here, we set out to integrate several single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets that collectively span mouse gastrulation and organogenesis, supplemented with new profiling of ~150,000 nuclei from approximately embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) embryos staged in one-somite increments. Overall, we define cell states at each of 19 successive stages spanning E3.5 to E13.5 and heuristically connect them to their pseudoancestors and pseudodescendants. Although constructed through automated procedures, the resulting directed acyclic graph (TOME (trajectories of mammalian embryogenesis)) is largely consistent with our contemporary understanding of mammalian development. We leverage TOME to systematically nominate transcription factors (TFs) as candidate regulators of each cell type's specification, as well as 'cell-type homologs' across vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4221023904,"Abstract Pancreatic islet transplantation can cure diabetes but requires accessible, high-quality islets in sufficient quantities. Cryopreservation could solve islet supply chain challenges by enabling quality-controlled banking and pooling of donor islets. Unfortunately, cryopreservation has not succeeded in this objective, as it must simultaneously provide high recovery, viability, function and scalability. Here, we achieve this goal in mouse, porcine, human and human stem cell (SC)-derived beta cell (SC-beta) islets by comprehensive optimization of cryoprotectant agent (CPA) composition, CPA loading and unloading conditions and methods for vitrification and rewarming (VR). Post-VR islet viability, relative to control, was 90.5% for mouse, 92.1% for SC-beta, 87.2% for porcine and 87.4% for human islets, and it remained unchanged for at least 9 months of cryogenic storage. VR islets had normal macroscopic, microscopic, and ultrastructural morphology. Mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were slightly reduced, but all other measures of cellular respiration, including oxygen consumption rate (OCR) to produce ATP, were unchanged. VR islets had normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) function in vitro and in vivo. Porcine and SC-beta islets made insulin in xenotransplant models, and mouse islets tested in a marginal mass syngeneic transplant model cured diabetes in 92% of recipients within 24–48 h after transplant. Excellent glycemic control was seen for 150 days. Finally, our approach processed 2,500 islets with &gt;95% islets recovery at &gt;89% post-thaw viability and can readily be scaled up for higher throughput. These results suggest that cryopreservation can now be used to supply needed islets for improved transplantation outcomes that cure diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4220704537,"Structural variants (SVs), which are genomic rearrangements of more than 50 base pairs, are an important source of genetic diversity and have been linked to many diseases. However, it remains unclear how they modulate human brain function and disease risk. Here we report 170,996 SVs discovered using 1,760 short-read whole genomes from aged adults and individuals with Alzheimer's disease. By applying quantitative trait locus (SV-xQTL) analyses, we quantified the impact of cis-acting SVs on histone modifications, gene expression, splicing and protein abundance in postmortem brain tissues. More than 3,200 SVs were associated with at least one molecular phenotype. We found reproducibility of 65-99% SV-eQTLs across cohorts and brain regions. SV associations with mRNA and proteins shared the same direction of effect in more than 87% of SV-gene pairs. Mediation analysis showed ~8% of SV-eQTLs mediated by histone acetylation and ~11% by splicing. Additionally, associations of SVs with progressive supranuclear palsy identified previously known and novel SVs."

https://openalex.org/W4220777942,"Tumourigenesis and cancer progression require enhanced global protein translation1-3. Such enhanced translation is caused by oncogenic and tumour-suppressive events that drive the synthesis and activity of translational machinery4,5. Here we report the surprising observation that leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS) becomes repressed during mammary cell transformation and in human breast cancer. Monoallelic genetic deletion of LARS in mouse mammary glands enhanced breast cancer tumour formation and proliferation. LARS repression reduced the abundance of select leucine tRNA isoacceptors, leading to impaired leucine codon-dependent translation of growth suppressive genes, including epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) and gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5). Our findings uncover a tumour-suppressive tRNA synthetase and reveal that dynamic repression of a specific tRNA synthetase-along with its downstream cognate tRNAs-elicits a downstream codon-biased translational gene network response that enhances breast tumour formation and growth."
https://openalex.org/W4221132537,"Cone snail venoms contain a wide variety of bioactive peptides, including insulin-like molecules with distinct structural features, binding modes and biochemical properties. Here, we report an active humanized cone snail venom insulin with an elongated A chain and a truncated B chain, and use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and protein engineering to elucidate its interactions with the human insulin receptor (IR) ectodomain. We reveal how an extended A chain can compensate for deletion of B-chain residues, which are essential for activity of human insulin but also compromise therapeutic utility by delaying dissolution from the site of subcutaneous injection. This finding suggests approaches to developing improved therapeutic insulins. Curiously, the receptor displays a continuum of conformations from the symmetric state to a highly asymmetric low-abundance structure that displays coordination of a single humanized venom insulin using elements from both of the previously characterized site 1 and site 2 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4220998486,"Giardiasis is a protozoan disease caused by the parasite Giardia lamblia. Around 200 million people are infected worldwide annually while, 500,000 deaths were reported each year. The infection rates were between 2-5% in the developed nations and 20-30% in the developing countries. The parasite is associated with poverty, poor sanitation, lack of clean and safe drinking water supply, and poor personal hygiene. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence rate and associated risk factors of G. lamblia infection among the elementary school children at Loka Abaya town, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2018 to July 2019. A total number of 422 students were selected by using simple random sampling. Structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used to identify known risk factors such as environmental, socio-demographic, and behavioural. Stool specimens were collected from the study subjects and examined using direct smear method, microscopically. A bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done. P value less than 0.05 at 95% of the confidence interval was considered statistically significant. The overall prevalence rates of G. lamblia infection were 27.1%. Rural school from Aregeda [AOR: 9.997, P = 0.005], age group of 6-9 years [AOR: 2.305, P = 0.019], consuming tap water [AOR: 0.011, P = 0.006], hand washing habit after defecation with water only [AOR = 0.313, P = 0.040], use of soap and water [AOR: 0.046, P = 0.000] were the factors which are found to be associated with the parasite infection when compared to urban school. As such, the prevalence of G. lamblia infection was found to be high in the studied area among school children. Thus, scaling-up of access to safe water, toilets, education, and health facilities are required to possibly eradicate this predicament."
https://openalex.org/W4221046138,"Cardiovascular risk is increased in transgender persons using gender-affirming hormone therapy. To gain insight into the mechanism by which sex hormones affect cardiovascular risk in transgender persons, we investigated the effect of hormone therapy on markers of inflammation and hemostasis.In this exploratory study, 48 trans women using estradiol patches plus cyproterone acetate (CPA) and 47 trans men using testosterone gel were included. They were between 18 and 50 years old and did not have a history of cardiovascular events. Measurements were performed before and after 3 and 12 months of hormone therapy.After 12 months, in trans women, systemic and endothelial inflammatory markers decreased (hs-CRP -66%, (95% CI -76; -53), VCAM-1-12%, (95% CI -16; -8)), while platelet activation markers increased (PF-4 +17%, (95% CI 4; 32), β-thromboglobulin +13%, (95% CI 2; 24)). The coagulation marker fibrinogen increased transiently, after 3 months (+15%, (95% CI 1; 32)). In trans men, hs-CRP increased (+71%, (95% CI 19; 145)); platelet activation and coagulation markers were not altered. In both trans women and trans men, leptin and adiponectin changed towards reference values of the experienced gender.Platelet activation and coagulation marker concentrations increased in trans women using transdermal estradiol plus CPA, but not in trans men using testosterone. Also, concentrations of inflammatory markers decreased in trans women, while hs-CRP increased in trans men. Our results indicate that hormone therapy may affect hemostasis in transgender persons, which could be an underlying mechanism explaining the increased cardiovascular risk in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4221136492,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is known for its unique function in the direct detoxification of lipid peroxides in the cell membrane and as a key regulator of ferroptosis, a form of lipid peroxidation-induced nonapoptotic cell death. However, the cytosolic isoform of GPx4 is considered to play a major role in inhibiting ferroptosis in somatic cells, whereas the roles of the mitochondrial isoform of GPx4 (mGPx4) in cell survival are not yet clear. In the present study, we found that mGPx4 KO mice exhibit a cone-rod dystrophy-like phenotype in which loss of cone photoreceptors precedes loss of rod photoreceptors. Specifically, in mGPx4 KO mice, cone photoreceptors disappeared prior to their maturation, whereas rod photoreceptors persisted through maturation but gradually degenerated afterward. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that vitamin E supplementation significantly ameliorated photoreceptor loss in these mice. Furthermore, LC-MS showed a significant increase in peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine esterified with docosahexaenoic acid in the retina of mGPx4 KO mice. We also observed shrunken and uniformly condensed nuclei as well as caspase-3 activation in mGPx4 KO photoreceptors, suggesting that apoptosis was prevalent. Taken together, our findings indicate that mGPx4 is essential for the maturation of cone photoreceptors but not for the maturation of rod photoreceptors, although it is still critical for the survival of rod photoreceptors after maturation. In conclusion, we reveal novel functions of mGPx4 in supporting development and survival of photoreceptors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4220867839,"What factors predict the originality of domain-specific idea generation? Replicating and extending an earlier study using a Design Product Ideation task in an introductory university design course, the present research, grounded in the componential theory of creativity, assessed the relative contributions to originality of design ideation from five factors: divergent thinking, personality traits, general cognitive ability, prior creative experience, and task-specific challenge/interest. The Design Product Ideation task asked participants, at two different timepoints, to propose ideas for products to improve either the experience of urban gardening or of outdoor picnics. Four divergent thinking tasks were used, including the predominantly conceptually-based Alternative Uses Task, a newly developed perceptually-based Figural Interpretation Quest, and two modified verbal tasks from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (Torrance Suppose and Torrance Product). Regression analyses revealed that, at both timepoints, originality on the Design Product Ideation tasks was predicted by multiple divergent thinking, personality, and task-based factors. Originality of responses to the Figural Interpretation Quest was a significant predictor at both timepoints, and continued to add incremental value after controlling for the other divergent thinking measures. Collectively, these findings indicate that the four divergent thinking tasks, though related, do not measure identical constructs, and that many individual difference components, both trait-based (e.g., openness to experience) and more specifically task-based (e.g., perceived challenge of the task), shape creative performance. Methodologically, and from a practical standpoint, these findings underscore the value of incorporating both conceptual and perceptual measures of divergent thinking as contributors to originality in domain-specific idea generation."
https://openalex.org/W4221132816,"Genetics play a prominent role in the development and progression of malignant neoplasms. Identification of the relevant genes is a high-dimensional data processing problem. Pyramid gravitational search algorithm (PGSA), a hybrid method in which the number of genes is cyclically reduced is proposed to conquer the curse of dimensionality. PGSA consists of two elements, a filter and a wrapper method (inspired by the gravitational search algorithm) which iterates through cycles. The genes selected in each cycle are passed on to the subsequent cycles to further reduce the dimension. PGSA tries to maximize the classification accuracy using the most informative genes while reducing the number of genes. Results are reported on a multi-class microarray gene expression dataset for breast cancer. Several feature selection algorithms have been implemented to have a fair comparison. The PGSA ranked first in terms of accuracy (84.5%) with 73 genes. To check if the selected genes are meaningful in terms of patient's survival and response to therapy, protein-protein interaction network analysis has been applied on the genes. An interesting pattern was emerged when examining the genetic network. HSP90AA1, PTK2 and SRC genes were amongst the top-rated bottleneck genes, and DNA damage, cell adhesion and migration pathways are highly enriched in the network."
https://openalex.org/W4220834348,"Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in hydrological and energy cycles, as well as in the assessments of water resources and irrigation demands. On a regional scale, particularly in the agro-pastoral ecotone, clarification of the distribution of surface ET and its influencing factors is critical for the rational use of water resources, restoration of the ecological environment, and protection of ecological water sources. The SEBAL model was used to invert the regional ET based on Landsat8 images in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northwest China. The results were indirectly verified by monitoring data from meteorological stations. The correlation between ET and surface parameters was analyzed. Thus, the main factors that affect the surface ET were identified. The results show that the SEBAL model determines an accurate inversion, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an average root mean square error of 0.9 mm/d, which is highly suitable for research on water resources. The correlation coefficients of normalized vegetation index, surface temperature, land surface albedo, net radiation flux with daily ET were 0.5830, 0.8425, 0.3428 and 0.9111, respectively. The normalized vegetation index and the net radiation flux positively correlated with the daily ET, while the surface temperature and land surface albedo negatively correlated with the daily ET. The correlation from strong to weak is the net radiation flux > surface temperature > normalized vegetation index > surface albedo. In terms of spatial distribution, the daily ET of water was the highest, followed by woodland, wetland, cropland, built-up land, shrub land, grassland and bare land. However, the SEBAL model overestimates the inversion of daily ET of built-up land."
https://openalex.org/W4220930821,"Guangxi chickens play a crucial role in promoting the high-quality development of the broiler industry in China, but their value and potential are yet to be discovered. To determine the genetic diversity and population structure of Guangxi indigenous chicken, we analyzed the whole genomes of 185 chickens from 8 phenotypically and geographically representative Guangxi chicken breeds, together with 12 RJFt, 12 BRA and 12 WL genomes available from previous studies. Calculation of heterozygosity (Hp), nucleotide diversity (π), and LD level indicated that Guangxi populations were characterized by higher genetic diversity and lower differentiation than RJFt and commercial breeds except for HGFC. Population structure analysis also confirmed the introgression from commercial broiler breeds. Each population clustered together while the overall differentiation was slight. MA has the richest genetic diversity among all varieties. Selective sweep analysis revealed BCO2, EDN3 and other candidate genes had received strong selection in local breeds. These also provided novel breeding visual and data basis for future breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4220988218,"Poor sleep quality or short and long sleep duration are associated with many negative health outcomes, such as diabetes, hypertension, and fatigue, which may directly or indirectly correlate with poor mental health. Although, the association between sleep duration and quality, and depressive symptoms has been examined, the results of these studies were inconsistent and evidence specifically on older women is lacking. Therefore, we designed a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association between sleep duration and quality, and depressive symptoms in a relatively large sample of older Chinese women. The data were collected from 1,429 older women aged ≥60 years during bone-health examinations in Shanghai. Information on sleep duration and quality were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), and depressive symptoms were considered present for SDS scores ≥ 45. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between sleep and depressive symptoms. After adjusting for all potential confounding factors, a J-shaped association was found between sleep duration and depressive symptoms. When a sleep duration of 6–8 hours was set as a reference, the odds ratios and 95% confidential intervals of short and long sleep duration were 1.31 (0.99, 1.73) and 2.10 (1.40, 3.16), respectively. Moreover, sleep quality was inversely associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms ( p for trend = 0.040). When the SDS cut-off score defining depressive symptoms was changed to 40 and 50, these associations were somewhat weakened, but the trend did not change. This study replicated and extended prior research findings that sleep duration and quality may influence mental health in older women."
https://openalex.org/W4220992131,"Uptake for cervical cancer screening remains well below the 80% target as recommended by Brunei's National Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control plan. We conducted a pilot study to determine the reasons for non-attendance and explore their acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling as an alternative to the Pap test.A cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary healthcare center in Brunei, from January to December 2019. We recruited screening non-attendees, defined as women who were eligible for Pap test but who either never, or did not have one within the recommended screening interval of 3 years. This recruitment was done conveniently among women attending outpatient care and/or child health services at the primary healthcare center. Participants were first asked to complete a self-administered paper-based questionnaire on their reasons for screening non-attendance, and then invited for HPV self-sampling. Among those who agreed to participate in HPV self-sampling, they were asked to complete a second questionnaire on the self-sampling procedure and their samples were tested for high-risk HPV (hr-HPV). Results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.We enrolled 174 screening non-attendees, out of which 97 (55.7%) also participated in HPV self-sampling. The main reasons for not attending Pap test screening were fear of bad results (16.1%, n = 28); embarrassment (14.9%, n = 26) and lack of time due to home commitments (10.3%, n = 18). When compared to those who agreed to participate in HPV self-sampling, those who declined were significantly older (p = 0.002) and less likely to agree that they are susceptible to cervical cancer (p = 0.023). They preferred to receive Pap test-related information from healthcare workers (59.0%, n = 155), social messaging platforms (28.7%, n = 51) and social media (26.4%, n = 47). HPV self-sampling kits were positively received among the 97 participants, where > 90% agreed on its ease and convenience. Nine (9.3%) tested positive for hr-HPV, out of which eight were non-16/18 HPV genotypes.Our findings suggest that promoting awareness on cervical cancer, clarifying any misconceptions of Pap test results, and highlighting that the disease is preventable and that early detection through screening can facilitate successful treatment would help increase screening uptake among Bruneian non-attendees. Response to HPV self-sampling was highly positive, suggesting the possibility of implementing this strategy in the local setting. Our high detection of non-16/18 HPV genotypes suggest high prevalence of other hr-HPV genotypes in Brunei. Larger studies should be conducted to further validate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W4221000638,"Myocardial ischemia occurs when blood flow to the heart is reduced, preventing the heart muscle from receiving enough oxygen required for survival. Several anatomical and electrophysiological changes occur at the ischemic core (IC) and border zone (BZ) during myocardial ischemia, for example, gap junctional remodeling, changes in ionic channel kinetics and electrophysiologic changes in cell excitability, which promote the development of cardiac arrhythmia. Ephaptic coupling (EpC), which is an electrical field effect developed in the shared cleft space between adjacent cells, has been suggested to rescue the conduction when gap junctions are impaired, such as myocardial ischemia. In this manuscript, we explored the impact of EpC, electrophysiological and anatomical components of myocardial ischemia on reentry termination during non-ischemic and ischemic condition. Our results indicated that EpC and BZ with complex geometry have opposite effects on the reentry termination. In particular, the presence of homogeneous EpC terminates reentry, whereas BZ with complex geometry alone facilitates reentry by producing wave break-up and alternating conduction block. The reentry is terminated in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous EpC despite the presence of complex geometry of the BZ, independent of the location of BZ. The inhibition of reentry can be attributed to a current-to-load mismatch. Our results points to an antiarrhythmic role of EpC and a pro-arrhythmic role of BZ with complex geometry."
https://openalex.org/W4220779983,"Background Enhancing the contribution of practicing pharmacists into scientific evidence via practice-based research (PBR) is crucial in maintaining high-quality clinical practice and healthcare delivery. Involving community pharmacists in PBR can potentially can also help break barriers to the utilization of the current best evidence in everyday pharmacy practice. The impact of pharmacists’ attitude towards PBR on their utilization of current best evidence in pharmacy practice is understudied. Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of community pharmacists’ attitudes toward PBR on their utilization of current best evidence, barriers for conducting PBR in clinical practice were also investigated. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 169 community pharmacists working across Jordan filled a questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PBR, barriers to PBR, and their utilization of the current best evidence in clinical practice. Results Pharmacists in this study showed a positive attitude toward PBR (attitude mean score &gt;3.5). A positive attitude towards PBR was associated with high utilization of the best current scientific evidence. We also investigated several barriers to PBR and their association with utilization those included; the lack of perceived benefits, lack of institutional support, and lack of self-engagements of community pharmacists to PBR. The lack of perceived benefit was found to be negatively associated with pharmacists’ utilization of the current best scientific evidence. Conclusion In this study, pharmacists’ utilization of current best evidence was found to be significantly impacted by their attitude toward PBR. The current study findings highlight the importance of supporting, promoting, and facilitating PBR among community pharmacists which can potentially enhance their utilization of the current best evidence in their everyday pharmacy practice."
https://openalex.org/W4220927051,"The language barrier prevents allophone migrant patients from accessing healthcare when arriving in a country, and interpreters are often needed to help them to be understood. This study aimed to understand perceptions and experiences of allophone migrant patients who used a telephone-interpreting service during primary care consultations.A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken between September 2019 and January 2020. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis framework.Allophone migrant patients from an accommodation centre for asylum-seekers who used a telephone-interpreting service during primary care consultations with a general practitioner.A purposive sample of allophone migrant patients (n = 10).From the semi-structured interviews, we identified three themes: (1) multi-level difficulties of being an allophone migrant in the primary care pathway (i.e., before, during, and after the consultation); (2) the key role of the interpreter in the doctor-patient relationship, participating in improving the patient's management by establishing a climate of trust between the two; and (3) advantages and limitations of the TIS. However, even if a telephone-interpreting service is very helpful, allowing quick access to interpreters speaking the allophone patient's native language, certain situations would require the interpreter to see the patient to better guide the doctor during the consultation.Telephone-interpreting services enable improving communication and comprehension between allophone migrant patients and doctors. Nevertheless, the interpreter may sometimes need to physically see the patient to better guide the doctor. To do so, interpreting services using videoconferencing deserve wider development."
https://openalex.org/W4220915977,"The selection of the many biological indicators described in scientific literature is rarely based on systematic or clear-cut processes, and often takes into account only a single or very few taxa, or even disregards the complex interactions that exist between the components of biodiversity. In certain cases, the particular context of a site–for example in the Mediterranean Basin–makes it difficult to apply the choice of indicators to other regions proposed in the literature. Therefore, the selection of appropriate methodologies for generating relevant indicators for a particular site is of crucial importance. Here, we present a simple quantitative methodology capable of incorporating multidisciplinary information for assessing and selecting appropriate methods and indicators for monitoring local biodiversity. The methodology combines several ecological levels (species, habitats, processes, and ecosystem disturbances), and embraces biological interactions and common functional guilds (detritivores, producers, herbivores, and carnivores). We followed an iterative selection procedure consisting of five phases: 1) collection focal area useful information; 2) classification of this information into interrelated datasets; 3) assessment and selection of the relevant components using a quantitative relevance index; 4) the adding of taxonomic, physiognomic and functional similarities to the relevant components; and 5) the quantitative selection of the priority indicators in the study area. To demonstrate the potential of this methodology, we took as a case study the biodiversity components and their ecological interactions present in a protected area. We show that our methodology can help select appropriate local and long-term indicators, reduce the number of components required for thorough biodiversity monitoring, and underline the importance of ecological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4221075561,"Purpose To compare technical success, clinical success, complications and radiation dose for percutaneous intradiscal ozone therapy in patients with lumbar disc herniation using fluoroscopic guidance versus conventional computed tomography (CT) guidance. Materials and methods Between March 2018and March 2021, 124consecutive percutaneous intradiscal ozone therapies wereperformedon111 patients with low back pain (LBP) and/or sciatic pain due to lumbar disc herniation, using fluoroscopic or conventional CT guidance, respectively in 53 and 58 herniated lumbar discs, with at least 1-month follow up. Dose area product (DAP) and dose length product (DLP) were recorded respectively for fluoroscopy and CT, and converted to effective dose (ED). Results Fluoroscopic and CT groups were similar in terms of patient age (p-value 0.39), patient weight (p-value 0.49) and pre-procedure Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, p-value 0.94). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Clinical success was obtained in 83.02% (44/53) patients in fluoroscopic group and 79.31% (46/58) in CT group. Mean DAP was 11.63Gy*cm 2 (range 5.42–21.61). Mean DLP was 632.49mGy-cm (range 151.51–1699). ED was significantly lower in the fluoroscopic group compared toCT group (0.34 vs. 5.53mSv, p = 0.0119). No major complication was registered. Minor complications were observed in 4 cases (2 in fluoroscopic group; 2 in CT group). Conclusions Compared to conventional CT guidance, fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous intradiscal ozone therapy in patients with lumbar disc herniation shows similar technical and clinical success rates, with lower radiation dose. This technique helps sparing dose exposure to patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220729178,"Forms of embryonic nutrition are highly diverse in cartilaginous fishes, which contain oviparity, yolk-sac viviparity and several types of matrotrophic viviparity (histotrophy, oophagy, and placentotrophy). The molecular mechanisms of embryonic nutrition are poorly understood in these animals as few species are capable of reproducing in captivity. Oviparous cartilaginous fishes solely depend on yolk nutrients for their growth and development. In the present study, we compared the contribution to embryonic nutrition of the embryonic intestine with the yolk sac membrane (YSM). RNA-seq analysis was performed on the embryonic intestine and YSM of the oviparous cloudy catshark Scyliorhinus torazame to identify candidate genes involved in nutrient metabolism to further the understanding of nutrient utilization of developing embryos. RNA-seq discovery was subsequently confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis and we identified increases in several amino acid transporter genes ( slc3a1 , slc6a19 , slc3a2 , slc7a7 ) as well as genes involved in lipid absorption ( apob and mtp ) in the intestine after ‘pre-hatching’, which is a developmental event marked by an early opening of the egg case about 4 months before hatching. Although a reciprocal decrease in the nutritional role of YSM was expected after the intestine became functional, we observed similar increases in gene expression among amino acid transporters, lipid absorption molecules, and lysosomal cathepsins in the extraembryonic YSM in late developmental stages. Ultrastructure of the endodermal cells of YSM showed that yolk granules were incorporated by endocytosis, and the number of granules increased during development. Furthermore, the digestion of yolk granules in the YSM and nutrient transport through the basolateral membrane of the endodermal cells appeared to be enhanced after pre-hatching. These findings suggest that nutrient digestion and absorption is highly activated in both intestine and YSM after pre-hatching in catshark embryos, which supports the rapid growth at late developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W4220750202,"The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is one of the most common screening instruments for emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents. Although exploratory factor analyses support the originally proposed 5-factor structure of SDQ as well as a 3-factor model, the evidence from confirmatory factor analyses is more mixed. Some of the difficulties items in SDQ are positively worded and it has been proposed that this leads to method effects, i.e. these items share variance that is due to the method used rather than to a substantive construct. Also, there seems to be minor factors in some subscales. This study tests a series of 3- and 5- factor models pertaining to the factor structure of SDQ, also considering method effects and minor factors. The sample consists of a nationally representative cohort of Swedish adolescents born in 2001 (n = 5549). Results show a relatively better fit of the 5-factor model compared with the 3-factor model although neither of these had a satisfactory fit. Model fit was improved when specifying cross-loadings of the positively worded difficulties items on the prosocial scale as well as minor factors on the hyperactivity scale. Although no model provided a completely satisfactory fit to the data, the results show that the 5-factor model performs better than the 3-factor model and has an acceptable fit. We conclude that for the purposes of epidemiological research, SDQ has acceptable factorial validity, provided that researchers consider method effects and minor factors."
https://openalex.org/W4220765703,"Cervical dilatation curves are widely used to describe normal and abnormal labor progression for cephalic presentation. Labor curves for breech presentations have never been described.The aims of this study were to examine the pattern of labor progression in women with a breech presentation and to determine whether the type of breech or parity can influence the speed of cervical dilatation.We analyzed the labor data from 349 women with a term, singleton, and breech fetus after spontaneous onset of labor in 2010-2018. Cesarean deliveries were excluded. The patterns of labor progression were described by examining the relationship between the elapsed times from the full dilatation and cervical dilatation stages. Average labor curves were developed using repeated-measures analysis with 3rd degree polynomial modeling. The results were interpreted according to parity and the type of breech.The first stage of labor progression was divided into a latency phase from 0 to 5 cm of dilatation and an active phase from 5 to 10 cm. In the active phase, the median speed of cervical dilatation was 1.67 cm/h [1.25, 2.61] (2 cm/h for multipara and 1.54 cm/h for nullipara). The difference by parity was significant in the active phase (p< 0.05). The cervical dilatation rate from 3 cm to 10 cm did not significantly differ between the complete and frank breeches (1.56 cm/h vs 1.75 cm/h, p = 0.48). However, the median cervical dilatation rate from 8 cm to complete dilatation was faster for complete breeches (1.92 cm/h versus 1.33 cm/h, p = 0.045).As with cephalic presentation, the first stage of labor progression for breech presentation can be divided into a latent and active phase. Labor progression should be interpreted with respect to parity, and women should be informed that the type of breech does not seem to influence the cervical dilatation rate when there is adequate management."

The aim was to examine the associations between maternal and child appetitive traits, using the AEBQ-Esp and CEBQ-Mex adapted for use in Mexican populations. Sociodemographic data, weights and heights of mothers and their children (aged 3–13 years), who were recruited from a teaching hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico, were measured. Mothers completed both the AEBQ-Esp and the CEBQ-Mex. The CEBQ-Mex was developed, and its reliability was tested using Cronbach’s alpha and Omega, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess its validity. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to assess associations between mothers’ and children’s Ats. The sample included 842 mother-child dyads (mother’s mean age = 34.8±SD6.9 years, BMI 29.7±6.1 kg/m 2 ; children’s mean age = 8.5 ±SD2.5 years, BMIz 1.5±1.6). Internal reliability was moderate to high [Cronbach alpha = .68-.86; Omega = .71-.87] for the CEBQ-Mex and validity was confirmed for an 8-factor model through CFA [RMSEA = 0.065; CFI = 0.840, NFI = 0.805; IFI = 0.842; and χ 2 (df = 532) = 2939.51, p &lt; 0.001]. All but one of the children’s appetitive traits showed small to moderate, significant correlations with their mother’s counterpart [FR ( r = .22; p&lt;001); EOE ( r = .30; p &lt; .001); EF ( r = .15; &lt; .001); SR ( r = .16; p &lt; .001); EUE ( r = .34; p &lt; .001) and FF ( r = .14; p &lt; .001). Only SE was not significantly associated with maternal SE ( r = .01; p&gt;.05). ATs tend to run in families, signalling the intergenerational transmission of eating behaviours. These may be useful targets for family-wide interventions to support the development and maintenance of healthy eating behaviours in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W4220867419,"Swimming behavior of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts affects transit time, route selection and survival in complex aquatic ecosystems. Behavior quantified at the river reach and junction scale is of particular importance for route selection and predator avoidance, though few studies have developed field-based approaches for quantifying swimming behavior of juvenile migratory fishes at this fine spatial scale. Two-dimensional acoustic fish telemetry at a river junction was combined with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to estimate in situ emigration swimming behavior of federally-threatened juvenile Chinook salmon smolts. Fish velocity over ground was estimated from telemetry, while the hydrodynamic model supplied simultaneous, colocated water velocities, with swimming velocity defined by the vector difference of the two velocities. Resulting swimming speeds were centered around 2 body lengths/second, and included distinct behaviors of positive rheotaxis, negative rheotaxis, lateral swimming, and passive transport. Lateral movement increased during the day, and positive rheotaxis increased in response to local hydrodynamic velocities. Swim velocity estimates were sensitive to the combination of vertical shear in water velocities and vertical distribution of fish."
https://openalex.org/W4221042437,"Objective A scoring system for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is useful for guiding treatment decisions, especially in urgent-care limited settings. This study developed a simple algorithm of clinical conditions and grading to predict outcomes in patients treated by clipping or coiling. Methods Data on patients with aSAH hospitalized in a university’s neurovascular center in Thailand from 2013 to 2018 were obtained for chart review. Factors associated with poor outcomes evaluated at one year were identified using a stepwise logistic regression model. For each patient, the rounded regression coefficients of independent risk factors were linearly combined into a total score, which was assessed for its performance in predicting outcomes using receiver operating characteristic analysis. An appropriate cutoff point of the scores for poor outcomes was based on Youden’s criteria, which maximized the summation between sensitivity or true positive rate and the specificity or true negative rate. Results Patients (n, 121) with poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, mRS score, 4–6) had a significantly higher proportion of old age, underlying hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, high clinical severity grading, preoperative rebleeding, and hydrocephalus than those (n, 336) with good outcomes (mRS score, 0–3). Six variables, including age &gt;70 years, diabetes mellitus, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) scaling of IV-V, modified Fisher grading of 3–4, rebleeding, and hydrocephalus, were identified as independent risk factors and were assigned a score weight of 2, 1, 2, 1, 3 and 1, respectively. Among the total possible scores ranging from 0–10, the cut point at score 3 yielded the maximum Youden’s index (0.527), which resulted in a sensitivity of 77.7% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusion A simple 0–10 scoring system on six risk factors for poor outcomes was validated for aSAH and should be advocated for use in limited resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W4221054938,"In conventional Muslim societies, fertility occurs within the marital union. Therefore, fertility outcomes depend on females’ age at first marriage (AFM). The present study explores the pattern of AFM in Pakistan, analyses of which are scarce in the literature. We aim to identify the factors associated with the AFM among currently married women in Pakistan. Demographic factors like birth cohort, and socioeconomic and cultural factors such as province and place of residence, education level, whether or not a woman had ever worked before marriage, ethnicity, and husband’s education were studied to explore the pattern of female AFM. Data were taken from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHSs) of 2012–13 and 2017–18, and a comparison was made with the findings from the earlier PDHSs of 1990–91 and 2006–07. The analysis concentrates on women born between 1941 and 1992, aged between 25 and 49 years during the data collection periods. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the difference between the mean AFM for different sub-groups of the population. To identify the covariates that are associated with AFM multiple linear regression models were estimated. We observed a gradually increasing trend in female AFM over time among women born after 1950. The ANOVA results revealed that birth cohort, province, and place of residence, female education level, whether or not a woman had ever worked before marriage, ethnicity, and husband’s education were significantly associated with AFM ( p -values &lt; 0.05). In a multiple regression model, we found that the birth cohort significantly affects the AFM ( p -value &lt; 0.05). Having worked before marriage is associated with a statistically significant one-year rise in the AFM. Interestingly, all other ethnic groups have lower AFM compared with women whose mother language was Punjabi. Education has a highly significant effect on the AFM: the regression results revealed that uneducated females have a mean AFM 4 to 5 years lower than highly educated women. The results also revealed that educated men marry older women as compared to uneducated men. We conclude that the education of females and even males in Pakistan could lead to a rise in the female AFM."

Based on the ""leader-employee"" matching data of 477 employees from 101 teams, SPSS (Statistic Package for Social Science) and AMOS (a macro-micro model of Scotland) were used to analyze the three-stage data linear regression. The research conclusions indicate that: (1) The paradoxical thinking of leaders positively affects team voice behavior; (2) Team cooperation plays a completely mediating role in the relationship between the paradoxical thinking of leaders and team voice behavior; (3) The team forgiveness climate positively moderates the relationship between the paradoxical thinking of leaders and team cooperation, which means that their positive relationship is stronger in a higher forgiveness climate; (4) The team forgiveness climate moderates the mediating role of team cooperation between the paradoxical thinking of leaders and team voice behavior. Compared with a lower forgiveness climate, this moderating mediating effect is significant at a higher forgiveness level. This study clarifies the connection of the paradoxical thinking of leaders to the team voice behavior through team cooperation and has practical insights into how a team forgiveness climate promotes the team voice behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4220665443,"Perception and action are essential in our day-to-day interactions with the environment. Despite the dual-stream theory of action and perception, it is now accepted that action and perception processes interact with each other. However, little is known about the impact of unpredicted changes of target size during grasping actions on perception. We assessed whether size perception and saccade amplitude were affected before and after grasping a target that changed its horizontal size during the action execution under the presence or absence of tactile feedback. We have tested twenty-one participants in 4 blocks of 30 trials. Blocks were divided into two experimental tactile feedback paradigms: tactile and non-tactile. Trials consisted of 3 sequential phases: pre-grasping size perception, grasping, and post-grasping size perception. During pre- and post-phases, participants executed a saccade towards a horizontal bar and performed a manual size estimation of the bar size. During grasping phase, participants were asked to execute a saccade towards the bar and to make a grasping action towards the screen. While grasping, 3 horizontal size perturbation conditions were applied: non-perturbation, shortening, and lengthening. 30% of the trials presented perturbation, meaning a symmetrically shortened or lengthened by 33% of the original size. Participants’ hand and eye positions were assessed by a motion capture system and a mobile eye-tracker, respectively. After grasping, in both tactile and non-tactile feedback paradigms, size estimation was significantly reduced in lengthening (p = 0.002) and non-perturbation (p&lt;0.001), whereas shortening did not induce significant adjustments (p = 0.86). After grasping, saccade amplitude became significantly longer in shortening (p&lt;0.001) and significantly shorter in lengthening (p&lt;0.001). Non-perturbation condition did not display adjustments (p = 0.95). Tactile feedback did not generate changes in the collected perceptual responses, but horizontal size perturbations did so, suggesting that all relevant target information used in the movement can be extracted from the post-action target perception."
https://openalex.org/W4220806715,"Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies, found in patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), can directly contribute to disease pathology through activation of the classical complement pathway. Activation of the complement pathway in autoimmune diseases can lead to a secondary complement deficiency resulting in reduced complement activity, due to consumption, during episodes of disease activity. It is not clear whether complement activity in MG patients associates with measurements of disease activity or the titer of circulating pathogenic AChR autoantibodies. To explore such associations, as a means to identify a candidate biomarker, we measured complement activity in AChR MG samples (N = 51) using a CH50 hemolysis assay, then tested associations between these values and both clinical status and AChR autoantibody titer. The majority of the study subjects (88.2%) had complement activity within the range defined by healthy controls, while six patients (11.8%) showed reduced activity. No significant association between complement activity and disease status or AChR autoantibody titer was observed."

https://openalex.org/W4220991497,"The pancreatic islets of Langerhans have low endogenous antioxidant levels and are thus especially sensitive to oxidative stress, which is known to influence cell survival and behaviour. As bioengineered islets are gaining interest for therapeutic purposes, it is important to understand how their composition can be optimized to diminish oxidative stress. We investigated how the ratio of the two main islet cell types (alpha and beta cells) and their culture in three-dimensional aggregates could protect against oxidative stress. Monolayer and aggregate cultures were established by seeding the alphaTC1 (alpha) and INS1E (beta) cell lines in varying ratios, and hydrogen peroxide was applied to induce oxidative stress. Viability, oxidative stress, and the level of the antioxidant glutathione were measured. Both aggregation and an increasing prevalence of INS1E cells in the co-cultures conferred greater resistance to cell death induced by oxidative stress. Increasing the prevalence of INS1E cells also decreased the number of alphaTC1 cells experiencing oxidative stress in the monolayer culture. In 3D aggregates, culturing the alphaTC1 and INS1E cells in a ratio of 50:50 prevented oxidative stress in both cell types. Together, the results of this study lead to new insight into how modulating the composition and dimensionality of a co-culture can influence the oxidative stress levels experienced by the cells."

Aim of the study was to explore the association between HLA class I molecules and HIV-1 DNA in people with chronic HIV-1 infection. Methods Post-hoc analysis of the APACHE trial, on adults with chronic HIV-1 infection, prolonged suppressive antiretroviral therapy and good immunological profile. HIV-1 DNA was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); HLA-A, -B and -C were tested on genomic DNA. Crude odds ratios (OR) with their respective 95% Wald confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by univariable logistic regression for HLAs with a p-value &lt;0.10. Results We found 78 and 18 patients with HIV-1 DNA ≥100 copies/10 6 PBMCs and with HIV-1 DNA &lt;100 copies/10 6 PBMCs, respectively. HLA-A24 was present in 21 (29.6%) participants among subjects with HIV-1 DNA ≥100 copies/10 6 PBMCs and 1 (5.9%) among those with HIV-1 DNA &lt;100 copies/10 6 PBMCs (OR = 5.67, 95%CI = 0.79–46.03; p = 0.105); HLA-B39 was present in 1 (1.4%) with HIV-1 DNA ≥100 copies/10 6 PBMCs and in 3 (17.6%) with HIV-1 DNA &lt;100 copies/10 6 PBMCs (OR = 13.71, 95%CI = 1.33–141.77; p = 0.028) and HLA-B55 in 3 (4.2%) and 3 (17.6%), respectively (OR = 4.43, 95%CI = 0.81–24.29; p = 0.087).

https://openalex.org/W4221037434,"Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is caused by both genetic and environmental factors, such as daily calorie intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, are considered to be related to the prevalence of MetS and plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of depression. Methods We investigated the bidirectional association between lifestyle factors and MetS among Korean adults with depressive symptoms in third wave of a community-based cohort study. A total of 1,578 individuals, aged 39–72 years, who had MetS at baseline were recruited. Participants were divided into two groups according to depressive symptoms. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of MetS. Results The percentage of heavy drinkers was lower in men with depressive symptoms compared to those who did not (7.0% vs. 7.1%), while the percentage of current smokers were higher in participants who had depressive symptoms (40.2% vs. 30.0%). After adjusting for age, education, monthly income, body mass index (BMI), sleep duration, and volume of drinking and smoking status, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male heavy drinkers with depressive symptoms were 2.75 times more likely to have MetS than those without depressive symptom. Conversely, depressive women with a high BMI were 3.70 times more likely to have MetS than in those with lower BMI. Limitations The cross-sectional nature of the study, and the study population ethnicity and ages were limitations. Conclusions Lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, may be associated with the risk of MetS in adults with depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4221038006,"Introduction The present existing data on the association of metastatic sites and prognosis of patients with metastatic adrenal malignancy are limited. This study aims to investigate the impact of different distant metastases pattern on the survival of patients with adrenal malignancy. Methods A dataset from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 Registries (2000–2017) was selected for a retrospective metastatic adrenal malignancy cohort study. There was information on distribution of metastatic lesions in bone, brain, liver, and lung in the SEER database. Kaplan-Meier analysis and nomogram analyses were applied to compare the survival distribution of cases. Univariate and multivariate cox regression models were used to analyze survival outcomes. Results From the SEER database, a total of 980 patients with primary metastatic adrenal malignancy from 2010 to 2017 were enrolled in this cohort study. Based on the initial metastatic sites, 42.3%, 38.4%, 30.5%, and 4.9% of patients were found bone, liver, lung, and brain metastasis, respectively. Patients who had a single site of distant metastases accounted for 52.6% (515/980) and had a better overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (both P &lt; 0.001). In contrast with the tumor arising from the cortex, the tumor from the medulla showed better survival outcomes in both OS and CSS (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Different histological types possess various metastatic features and prognostic values. Understanding these differences may contribute to designing targeted pre-treatment assessment of primary metastatic adrenal malignancy and creating a personalized curative intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4221080582,"Immune cells kill invading microbes by producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, primarily hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). We previously found that NO inhibits catalases in Escherichia coli, stabilizing H2O2 around treated cells and promoting catastrophic chromosome fragmentation via continuous Fenton reactions generating hydroxyl radicals. Indeed, H2O2-alone treatment kills catalase-deficient (katEG) mutants similar to H2O2+NO treatment. However, the Fenton reaction, in addition to H2O2, requires Fe(II), which H2O2 excess instantly converts into Fenton-inert Fe(III). For continuous Fenton when H2O2 is stable, a supply of reduced iron becomes necessary. We show here that this supply is ensured by Fe(II) recruitment from ferritins and Fe(III) reduction by flavin reductase. Our observations also concur with NO-mediated respiration inhibition that drives Fe(III) reduction. We modeled this NO-mediated inhibition via inactivation of ndh and nuo respiratory enzymes responsible for the step of NADH oxidation, which results in increased NADH pools driving flavin reduction. We found that, like the katEG mutant, the ndh nuo double mutant is similarly sensitive to H2O2-alone and H2O2+NO treatments. Moreover, the quadruple katEG ndh nuo mutant lacking both catalases and efficient respiration was rapidly killed by H2O2-alone, but this killing was delayed by NO, rather than potentiated by it. Taken together, we conclude that NO boosts the levels of both H2O2 and Fe(II) Fenton reactants, making continuous hydroxyl-radical production feasible and resulting in irreparable oxidative damage to the chromosome.

In addition, the Fenton-induced DNA damage is repaired by base-excision repair and recombinational repair (18Demple B. Halbrook J. Linn S. Escherichia coli xth mutants are hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ananthaswamy H.N. Eisenstark A.

These multiple systems in E. coli ensure that acute H2O2 doses up to 5 mM are only bacteriostatic in E. coli, although H2O2 concentrations ≥10 mM apparently self-potentiate to cause chromosomal fragmentation and loss of viability even in this quite resistant bacterium (7Imlay J.A.

But there is complexity even in the mechanisms of E. coli killing by H2O2 (7Imlay J.A. Linn S.

Chin S.M. Linn S. Three chemically distinct types of oxidants formed by iron-mediated Fenton reactions in the presence of DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12438-12442Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Generally, in cells with intact H2O2 scavenging, low millimolar H2O2 concentrations kill by mode-one; mode-one killing is blocked by iron chelators and affects mostly the DNA repair mutants, defining mode-one as IF-iron–dependent killing via DNA damage. When WT E. coli is killed by 10 mM H2O2, it is still mode-one (22Agashe P. Kuzminov A. Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In contrast, higher concentrations of H2O2, starting with 20 to 25 mM in E. coli, kill by mode-two, which is insensitive of iron chelation, active metabolism, or of DNA repair capacity—defining mode-two as killing of unknown nature that does not depend on IF-iron or DNA damage. The additional distinction between the two H2O2 killing modes relevant for this work is that, while mode-one killing is potentiated by NO, mode-two killing is inhibited by NO treatment (22Agashe P. Kuzminov A. Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Perhaps the biggest paradox of H2O2 toxicity is that inside our immune cells, bacteria are presumed to be killed by H2O2 concentrations that are at least 1,000× lower than the H2O2 concentrations that start killing them in growing lab cultures. While direct electrochemical detection of ROS and RNI in phagosomes within macrophages with nanoelectrodes is still being developed (25Zhang X.W. Oleinick A. Jiang H. Liao Q.L. Qiu Q.F. Svir I. Liu Y.L. Amatore C. Huang W.H. Electrochemical Monitoring of ROS/RNS homeostasis within individual phagolysosomes inside single macrophages.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Redox reactions and microbial killing in the neutrophil phagosome.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 642-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). At the same time, as mentioned above, the minimal H2O2 concentrations that kill WT E. coli in culture are 10 mM (7Imlay J.A. Linn S.

Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To explain how such low H2O2 concentrations can be effective against bacteria in the phagosome, H2O2 was proposed and shown to be potentiated by other substances (reviewed in (31Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A. Potentiation of hydrogen peroxide toxicity: From catalase inhibition to stable DNA-iron complexes.Mutat. Res. Rev. Mutat. Res. 2017; 773: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), notably by nitric oxide (NO), abundantly produced by immune cells. Indeed, NO and H2O2, when present simultaneously, kill WT E. coli at concentrations at which they are individually nonlethal (1Klebanoff S.J. Reactive nitrogen intermediates and antimicrobial activity: Role of nitrite.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 32Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Cook J.A.

Toxicol. 1997; 10: 801-810Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, left). We have previously demonstrated that the nature of this phenomenon is not simply redundancy of two toxic treatments overwhelming antitoxicity mechanisms of the cells but potentiation of H2O2 toxicity by NO to cause catastrophic chromosome fragmentation (CCF) (22Agashe P. Kuzminov A. Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, right). NO, a radical species with one unpaired electron, can bind to other species with unpaired electrons, like transition metals (34Ford P.C. Lorkovic I.M. Mechanistic aspects of the reactions of nitric oxide with transition-metal complexes.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 993-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), the intracellular ‘labile’ iron pool (35Toledo J.C. Bosworth C.A. Hennon S.W. Mahtani H.A. Bergonia H.A. Lancaster J.R.

Nitric oxide and iron proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 290-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Two general strategies around Fenton chemistry, by which NO could enhance the intracellular toxicity of H2O2, are as follows (Fig. S1): (1) increase in available Fe(II) and (2) stabilization of the intracellular H2O2. The first strategy is confirmed in principle by the effect of iron chelators that completely block potentiated H2O2 toxicity (32Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Friedman N. Tsokos M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide-induced killing of Escherichia coli.J. Exp.

Potentiation by sulfide of hydrogen peroxide-induced killing of Escherichia coli.Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 538-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, Woodmansee and Imlay investigated a mechanism, dependent on iron, by which either cyanide (CN) or NO could potentiate H2O2 toxicity (38Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A.

Both molecules complex the oxygen-binding heme of the terminal quinol oxidases (41Stevanin T.M. Ioannidis N. Mills C.E. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K.

Routes, reasons and regulation.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 165-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in the case of CN leads to accumulation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH (38Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. Reduced flavins promote oxidative DNA damage in non-respiring Escherichia coli by delivering electrons to intracellular free iron.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); NO was proposed to do the same (40Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. A mechanism by which nitric oxide accelerates the rate of oxidative DNA damage in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consequently, the enzyme flavin reductase (Fre) uses the increased NADH pool to reduce free flavins, which in turn reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron, which then becomes available for the Fenton reaction (38Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. Reduced flavins promote oxidative DNA damage in non-respiring Escherichia coli by delivering electrons to intracellular free iron.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 40Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. A mechanism by which nitric oxide accelerates the rate of oxidative DNA damage in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since, in the presence of excessive H2O2, Fenton reaction rapidly turns all IF-iron from Fe(II) to Fe(III), NO should be able to potentiate Fenton by cycling Fe(III) back to Fe(II), continuously feeding Fenton reaction with the disappearing key ingredient, reduced iron (Fig. S1). In another “iron-centric” model, we previously proposed that part of the CN potentiation of H2O2 toxicity was iron recruitment from cellular iron depots (21Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A. Cyanide enhances hydrogen peroxide toxicity by recruiting endogenous iron to trigger catastrophic chromosomal fragmentation.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 96: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and deposition of this iron directly onto DNA, causing chromosome fragmentation (20Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A. Prompt repair of hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA lesions prevents catastrophic chromosomal fragmentation.DNA Repair. 2016; 41: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A. Potentiation of hydrogen peroxide toxicity: From catalase inhibition to stable DNA-iron complexes.Mutat. Res. Rev. Mutat. Res. 2017; 773: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells store their iron in ferritins of two types: the regular size ferritins, FtnA and Bfr (the latter one equipped with internal heme), and the small ferritin, Dps (16Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 17Smith J.L. The physiological role of ferritin-like compounds in bacteria.Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the FtnA ferritin functions like a regular iron depot, taking in excess iron and releasing it back when needed; the function of Bfr is less clear (16Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 17Smith J.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ferritins can release ferrous iron in response to reductants, such as thiols, ascorbate, or flavins (44Coves J. Fontecave M.

The release of iron from horse spleen ferritin by reduced flavins.Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Both ferritins and bacterioferritins have been shown to release iron by flavin-dependent and flavin-independent ferric reductases (15Bradley J.M. Svistunenko D.A. Wilson M.T. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R.

Microbiol. 2020; 65: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, Dps appears to function as a terminal iron repository in the presence of H2O2, as the Dps-sequestered iron can be subsequently released only by Dps protein degradation (48Sen A. Zhou Y. Imlay J.A. During oxidative stress the Clp proteins of Escherichia coli ensure that iron pools remain sufficient to reactivate oxidized metalloenzymes.J. Bacteriol. 2020; 202e00235-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using corresponding single mutants and H2O2 potentiation by CN, we have previously shown (21Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A. Cyanide enhances hydrogen peroxide toxicity by recruiting endogenous iron to trigger catastrophic chromosomal fragmentation.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 96: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that Dps is important for protecting chromosomal DNA, while FtnA serves as a source of iron for the H2O2+CN attack on the chromosomal DNA; inactivation of Bfr had no effect. The above studies demonstrated that manipulating the intracellular iron causes synergistic toxicity with H2O2 via increasing DNA damage (20Mahaseth T. Kuzminov A.

A mechanism by which nitric oxide accelerates the rate of oxidative DNA damage in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was even argued that H2O2 detoxification was prioritized over NO detoxification when both agents were present together (in much reduced, close-to-physiological concentrations) (53Adolfsen K.J. Chou W.K. Brynildsen M.P. Transcriptional regulation contributes to prioritized detoxification of hydrogen peroxide over nitric oxide.J. Bacteriol. 2019; 201e00081-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, our recent study of the H2O2+NO toxicity found that NO inhibits H2O2 scavenging, by binding and inhibiting the heme-containing catalases (Fig. S1), to stabilize effective concentrations of H2O2 inside the treated cells, causing lethal densities of double-strand DNA breaks (22Agashe P. Kuzminov A. Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We also found that in a catalase-deficient mutant, H2O2-alone exerts mode-two killing at H2O2 concentrations static for WT cells, while NO treatment blocks unknown targets of mode-two killing, offering temporary protection from lethal H2O2 concentrations (22Agashe P. Kuzminov A. Catalase inhibition by nitric oxide potentiates hydrogen peroxide to trigger catastrophic chromosome fragmentation in Escherichia coli.Genetics. 2021; 218: iyab057Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this study, we wanted to determine the contribution of various intracellular targets of NO potentiation to the overall H2O2+NO killing. Is the catalase inhibition by NO and resulting H2O2 stability the cause of death or does it simply correlate with a concurrent respiration inhibition in WT cells? Another objective was to find additional cellu"

https://openalex.org/W4220659251,"Accurately detecting sudden changes, or steps, in genetic diversity across landscapes is important for locating barriers to gene flow, identifying selectively important loci, and defining management units. However, there are many metrics that researchers could use to detect steps and little information on which might be the most robust. Our study aimed to determine the best measure/s for genetic step detection along linear gradients using biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We tested the ability to differentiate between linear and step-like gradients in genetic diversity, using a range of diversity measures derived from the q-profile, including allelic richness, Shannon Information, GST, and Jost-D, as well as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. To determine the properties of each measure, we repeated simulations of different intensities of step and allele proportion ranges, with varying genome sample size, number of loci, and number of localities. We found that alpha diversity (within-locality) based measures were ineffective at detecting steps. Further, allelic richness-based beta (between-locality) measures (e.g., Jaccard and Sørensen dissimilarity) were not reliable for detecting steps, but instead detected departures from fixation. The beta diversity measures best able to detect steps were: Shannon Information based measures, GST based measures, a Jost-D related measure, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. No one measure was best overall, with a trade-off between those measures with high step detection sensitivity (GST and Bray-Curtis) and those that minimised false positives (a variant of Shannon Information). Therefore, when detecting steps, we recommend understanding the differences between measures and using a combination of approaches."

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh classes were A, B, and C in 26, 79, and 32 patients, respectively; 34 patients (24.8%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), of which 11 also had complicating portal venous tumor thrombosis (PVTT). Patients with GOV were treated by endoscopic variceal ligation or endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) with ethanolamine oleate, while those with FV were treated by EIS with cyanoacrylate; 29 patients with FV also underwent additional balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO). Hemostasis was successfully achieved in 136 patients (99.3%), and the cumulative 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year rebleeding rates were 18.1%, 30.8%, and 30.8%, respectively, in the patients with GOV, and 2.2%, 12.5% and 12.5%, respectively, in the patients with FV.

Positive family history was another significant factor in all the symptom-frequency categories. GERD-related symptom frequency showed a linear association with sex (R2 = 0.75, P = 0.0049). Typical and atypical GERD symptoms were significantly more common in those with chronic diseases than those without. Heartburn was observed in 12.5% and 4.4% (P<0.05) and acid regurgitation was seen in 6.9% and 1.8% (P<0.05), respectively.The prevalence of GERD-related symptoms in South Hungary was significantly lower than that in Western countries and was closer to Eastern values. The presence of mild, non-exclusionary chronic diseases significantly increased the prevalence of GERD-related symptoms, as well as positive family history of GERD, height, BMI, coffee consumption, and smoking."
https://openalex.org/W4220843539,"The Euler's elastica energy regularizer has been widely used in image processing and computer vision tasks. However, finding a fast and simple solver for the term remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a new dual method to simplify the solution. Classical fast solutions transform the complex optimization problem into simpler subproblems, but introduce many parameters and split operators in the process. Hence, we propose a new dual algorithm to maintain the constraint exactly, while using only one dual parameter to transform the problem into its alternate optimization form. The proposed dual method can be easily applied to level-set-based segmentation models that contain the Euler's elastic term. Lastly, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real images in tasks image processing tasks, i.e. denoising, inpainting, and segmentation, as well as compare to the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) on the aforementioned tasks."

Some patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which may affect any organ/tissue. IrAEs are occasionally fatal and usually have nonspecific symptoms. We developed a three-step application ( https://irae-search.com/ ) to provide healthcare professionals with information on the diagnosis, treatment options, and published reports for 38 categories of irAEs encountered in clinical practice. Methods IrAEs reported in ≥5 cases were identified from articles published between October 2018 and August 2020 by searching Japanese (SELIMIC, JAPIC-Q Service, and JMED Plus) and international (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Derwent Drug File) databases. The cases’ symptoms were entered into the application to identify irAEs, which were verified using the reported diagnosis, to evaluate the application’s sensitivity and specificity. Results Overall, 1209 cases (1067 reports) were analyzed. The three most common categories of irAEs were pituitary or adrenal disorders (14% of cases), skin disorders (13%), and diabetes mellitus (10%). The top three primary diseases were lung cancer (364 cases), melanoma (286 cases), and renal cell carcinoma (218 cases). The average sensitivity was 90.8% (range 44.4%–100.0%) initially, and improved to 94.8% (range 83.3%–100.0%) after incorporating the symptoms reported in published cases into the application’s logic for two irAE categories. The average specificity was 79.3% (range 59.1% [thyroid disorders]–98.2% [arthritis]). Conclusion irAE Search is an easy-to-use application designed to help healthcare professionals identify potential irAEs in ICI-treated patients in a timely manner to facilitate prompt management/treatment. The application showed high sensitivity and moderate-to-high specificity for detecting irAEs."
https://openalex.org/W4221033062,"The burden of harm from problem gambling weighs heavily on those experiencing poverty and homelessness, yet most problem gambling prevention and treatment services are not designed to address the complex needs and challenges of this population. To redress this service gap, a multi-service agency within a shelter setting in a large urban centre developed and implemented a population-tailored, person-centred, evidence-informed gambling addiction program for its clients. The purpose of this article is to report on qualitative findings from an early evaluation of the program, the first designed to address problem gambling for people experiencing poverty and/or homelessness and delivered within a shelter service agency. Three themes emerged which were related to three program outcome categories. These included increasing awareness of gambling harms and reducing gambling behaviour; reorienting relationships with money; and, seeking, securing, and stabilizing shelter. The data suggest that problem gambling treatment within the context of poverty and homelessness benefits from an approach and setting that meets the unique needs of this community. The introduction of gambling treatment into this multi-service delivery model addressed the complex needs of the service users through integrated and person-centered approaches to care that responded to client needs, fostered therapeutic relationships, reduced experiences of discrimination and stigma, and enhanced recovery. In developing the Gambling Addiction Program, the agency drew on evidence-based approaches to problem gambling treatment and extensive experience working with the target population. Within a short timeframe, the program supported participants in the process of recovery, enhancing their understanding and control of their gambling selves, behaviours, and harms. This project demonstrates that gambling within the context of poverty requires a unique treatment space and approach."
https://openalex.org/W4225647583,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, are heterogeneous disorders with a multifactorial nature involving impaired bioenergetics. Stem-regenerative medicine and bioenergetics have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets in the neurologic field. The rationale of the present study was to assess the potential of human-derived adipose stem cells (hASCs) to transdifferentiate into neuronal-like cells (NhASCs and neurospheres) and explore the hASC bioenergetic profile. hASC neuronal transdifferentiation was performed through neurobasal media and differentiation factor exposure. High resolution respirometry was assessed. Increased MAP-2 neuronal marker protein expression upon neuronal induction (p<0.05 undifferentiated hASCs vs. 28-36 days of differentiation) and increased bIII-tubulin neuronal marker protein expression upon neuronal induction (p<0.05 undifferentiated hASCs vs. 6-28-36 days of differentiation) were found. The bioenergetic profile was detectable through high-resolution respirometry approaches in hASCs but did not lead to differential oxidative capacity rates in healthy or clinically diagnosed PD-hASCs. We confirmed the capability of transdifferentiation to the neuronal-like profile of hASCs derived from the forearms of human subjects and characterized the bioenergetic profile. Suboptimal maximal respiratory capacity trends in PD were found. Neuronal induction leading to positive neuronal protein expression markers is a relevant issue that encourages the suitability of NhASC models in neurodegeneration."
