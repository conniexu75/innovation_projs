https://openalex.org/W2061903838,"The spin Hall effect (SHE) of light is very weak because of the extremely small photon momentum and spin-orbit interaction. Here, we report a strong photonic SHE resulting in a measured large splitting of polarized light at metasurfaces. The rapidly varying phase discontinuities along a metasurface, breaking the axial symmetry of the system, enable the direct observation of large transverse motion of circularly polarized light, even at normal incidence. The strong spin-orbit interaction deviates the polarized light from the trajectory prescribed by the ordinary Fermat principle. Such a strong and broadband photonic SHE may provide a route for exploiting the spin and orbit angular momentum of light for information processing and communication."

An archetypal correlated material is vanadium dioxide (VO2), which is insulating only at temperatures below a characteristic phase transition temperature. We show that electrolyte gating of epitaxial thin films of VO2 suppresses the metal-to-insulator transition and stabilizes the metallic phase to temperatures below 5 kelvin, even after the ionic liquid is completely removed. We found that electrolyte gating of VO2 leads not to electrostatically induced carriers but instead to the electric field–induced creation of oxygen vacancies, with consequent migration of oxygen from the oxide film into the ionic liquid. This mechanism should be taken into account in the interpretation of ionic liquid gating experiments."

C. Wang et al. (p. 610 , published online 21 March) and Wacker et al. (p. 615 , published online 21 March) describe crystal structures of two members of the serotonin family of receptors bound to antimigraine medications or to a precursor of the hallucinogenic drug LSD. Subtle differences in the way particular ligands bind to the receptors cause substantial differences in the signals generated by the receptor and the consequent biological responses. The structures reveal how the same ligand can activate one or both of the two main serotonin receptor signaling mechanisms, depending on which particular receptor it binds."

Based on rock samples collected in North America and Morocco, Blackburn et al. (p. 941 , published online 21 March) acquired accurate ages for events surrounding the mass extinction that occurred ∼201 million years ago, between the Triassic and Jurassic Periods. The timing of the disappearance of marine and land fossils and geochemical evidence of the sequential eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province imply a strong causal relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1974461875,"The theories of aero- and hydrodynamics predict animal movement and device design in air and water through the computation of lift, drag, and thrust forces. Although models of terrestrial legged locomotion have focused on interactions with solid ground, many animals move on substrates that flow in response to intrusion. However, locomotor-ground interaction models on such flowable ground are often unavailable. We developed a force model for arbitrarily-shaped legs and bodies moving freely in granular media, and used this ""terradynamics"" to predict a small legged robot's locomotion on granular media using various leg shapes and stride frequencies. Our study reveals a complex but generic dependence of stresses in granular media on intruder depth, orientation, and movement direction and gives insight into the effects of leg morphology and kinematics on movement."
https://openalex.org/W2081587092,"Developmental signals such as Wnts are often presented to cells in an oriented manner. To examine the consequences of local Wnt signaling, we immobilized Wnt proteins on beads and introduced them to embryonic stem cells in culture. At the single-cell level, the Wnt-bead induced asymmetric distribution of Wnt-β-catenin signaling components, oriented the plane of mitotic division, and directed asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes. Before cytokinesis was completed, the Wnt-proximal daughter cell expressed high levels of nuclear β-catenin and pluripotency genes, whereas the distal daughter cell acquired hallmarks of differentiation. We suggest that a spatially restricted Wnt signal induces an oriented cell division that generates distinct cell fates at predictable positions relative to the Wnt source."
https://openalex.org/W2062267695,"Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA and initiate innate immune responses. Several synthetic agonists of TLR7-TLR8 display novel therapeutic potential; however, the molecular basis for ligand recognition and activation of signaling by TLR7 or TLR8 is largely unknown. In this study, the crystal structures of unliganded and ligand-induced activated human TLR8 dimers were elucidated. Ligand recognition was mediated by a dimerization interface formed by two protomers. Upon ligand stimulation, the TLR8 dimer was reorganized such that the two C termini were brought into proximity. The loop between leucine-rich repeat 14 (LRR14) and LRR15 was cleaved; however, the N- and C-terminal halves remained associated and contributed to ligand recognition and dimerization. Thus, ligand binding induces reorganization of the TLR8 dimer, which enables downstream signaling processes."

(p. 479 , published online 21 March) screened for genes involved in O-glycosylation that affected Lassa virus infection and identified candidates involved in glycosylation. Individuals from different pedigrees exhibiting WWS had unique mutations among genes identified in the genetic screen.

We present a design strategy to create gridiron-like DNA structures. A series of four-arm junctions are used as vertices within a network of double-helical DNA fragments. Deliberate distortion of the junctions from their most relaxed conformations ensures that a scaffold strand can traverse through individual vertices in multiple directions. DNA gridirons were assembled, ranging from two-dimensional arrays with reconfigurability to multilayer and three-dimensional structures and curved objects."
https://openalex.org/W2024594795,"Catastrophic landslides involve the acceleration and deceleration of millions of tons of rock and debris in response to the forces of gravity and dissipation. Their unpredictability and frequent location in remote areas have made observations of their dynamics rare. Through real-time detection and inverse modeling of teleseismic data, we show that landslide dynamics are primarily determined by the length scale of the source mass. When combined with geometric constraints from satellite imagery, the seismically determined landslide force histories yield estimates of landslide duration, momenta, potential energy loss, mass, and runout trajectory. Measurements of these dynamical properties for 29 teleseismogenic landslides are consistent with a simple acceleration model in which height drop and rupture depth scale with the length of the failing slope."
https://openalex.org/W2038653503,"Export of organic carbon from surface waters of the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean decreased during the last ice age, coinciding with declining atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations, signaling reduced exchange of CO(2) between the ocean interior and the atmosphere. In contrast, in the Subantarctic Zone, export production increased into ice ages coinciding with rising dust fluxes, thus suggesting iron fertilization of subantarctic phytoplankton. Here, a new high-resolution productivity record from the Antarctic Zone is compiled with parallel subantarctic data over the past million years. Together, they fit the view that the combination of these two modes of Southern Ocean change determines the temporal structure of the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO(2) record, including during the interval of ""lukewarm"" interglacials between 450 and 800 thousand years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2067982366,"Spatial analysis using maps to associate geographic information with disease can be traced as far back as the 17th century. Currently, the widespread diffusion of geospatial data acquisition technologies is enabling creation of highly accurate spatial (and temporal) data relevant to health research.

New approaches in geography and related fields, capitalizing on advances in technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and computer cartography, are often referred to collectively as geographic information science (1, 2). GPS and related systems make it possible to integrate highly accurate geographic location and time with virtually any observation. GIS provides the means to store, share, analyze, and visualize real-time and archived spatial data. It also permits the integration of multiple layers of interdisciplinary spatial data, such as health, environmental, genomic, social, or demographic data, for interactive spatial analysis and modeling.

Spatial and spatiotemporal statistical methods (3), such as multilevel analysis, spatial data mining, and agent-based modeling, provide ways of relating health and disease to specific genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors (4). The density, accuracy, and specificity of current geospatial data also facilitate sophisticated spatial and spatiotemporal analysis and the modeling of complex spatial health processes at the level of the individual rather than the aggregate (5, 6) (see the figure). Research based on data-intensive real-time GPS/GIS methods with miniaturized “wearable” environmental and biomedical monitors is generating advances in exposure assessment, as well as in mobility and obesity studies (7). In addition to individual interventions, this research can lead to outcomes such as the design of healthier environments which enhance access to parks and quality foods, and better treatment programs for a wide range of health conditions, from asthma to diabetes.

GIS visualization and analytical tools also enable researchers to identify spatial patterns and to model specific processes of disease diffusion or contagion, such as of pandemic influenza viruses, or evolving genetic strains of hepatitis or tuberculosis. Researchers have integrated patient demographics, daily activities, and HIV viral concentrations to map and model changing spatial patterns of HIV infections and their relationships to health care treatment programs (8), or to social risk factors (9). Researchers have also used GIS data, spatial statistics, and interactive mapping to identify HIV concentration hotspots near the Mexico–U.S. border (10). This kind of GIS-based analysis enables proactive and timely delivery of tailored prevention and treatment strategies, such as HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy intervention, and education to the affected communities.

Geospatial data on health and social environments have also been used to provide information about health disparities. Using GIS-based ethnic density measures and spatial data on mothers’ residential locations, a recent study of infant health inequalities among Bangladeshi immigrant women in New York City found that their infants were most vulnerable to poor health outcomes, such as low birth weight, when living either in very isolated settings or in areas of the highest ethnic density (11).

With real-time interactive GPS/GIS functionality (12) now increasingly embedded in cell phones and low-cost navigation and other mobile devices, individual citizens also are contributing to the flow of health-related geospatial data. These activities are variously referred to as participatory GIS, crowd-sourcing, or volunteered geographic information (x). Despite unresolved issues of privacy and quality assurance, the ability to access georeferenced data from millions of people could be transformative.

For example, by analyzing data from 15 million mobile-phone subscribers, Wesolowski et al. (13) could examine the complex interactions between human and animal movements and the spread of malaria in Kenya. From Japan to California, volunteers with GPS-enabled real-time air-quality monitoring systems are assessing exposures to air pollution and radiation at spatial resolution levels and data densities not previously feasible (14).

Better institutional and educational models for successfully integrating the spatial dimension into health research and practice are needed to achieve the full benefits of these new capabilities in a timely manner (15, 16). There is also an urgent need for the creation of distributed, interoperable spatial data infrastructures to integrate health research data across and within disparate health research programs. In addition to fostering standards and scientific access, such large-scale spatial data infrastructures are themselves powerful new resources for generating and testing hypotheses, detecting spatial patterns, and responding to health threats.

Ongoing collaborations between the NIH and the Association of American Geographers are addressing key technical and institutional challenges (e.g., standards, interoperability, common terminology, data confidentiality) to facilitate the generation, coordination, and use of the rapidly growing body of geospatial health data (17). Research agendas that systematically incorporate spatial data and analysis into global health research hold extraordinary potential for creating new discovery pathways in science (18)."
https://openalex.org/W2046727187,"The typical pattern of morphological evolution associated with the radiation of a group of related species is the emergence of a novel trait and its subsequent diversification. Yet the genetic mechanisms associated with these two evolutionary steps are poorly characterized. Here, we show that a spot of dark pigment on fly wings emerged from the assembly of a novel gene regulatory module in which a set of pigmentation genes evolved to respond to a common transcriptional regulator determining their spatial distribution. The primitive wing spot pattern subsequently diversified through changes in the expression pattern of this regulator. These results suggest that the genetic changes underlying the emergence and diversification of wing pigmentation patterns are partitioned within genetic networks."
https://openalex.org/W2127761342,"Cardiac pacemaker cells autonomously generate electrical impulses that initiate and maintain the rhythmic contraction of the heart. Although the majority of heart cells are thought to originate from the primary and secondary heart fields, we found that chick pacemaker cells arise from a discrete region of mesoderm outside of these fields. Shortly after gastrulation, canonical Wnts promote the recruitment of mesodermal cells within this region into the pacemaker lineage. These findings suggest that cardiac pacemaker cells are physically segregated and molecularly programmed in a tertiary heart field prior to the onset of cardiac morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018736340,"Biological membrane fission requires protein-driven stress. The guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) dynamin builds up membrane stress by polymerizing into a helical collar that constricts the neck of budding vesicles. How this curvature stress mediates nonleaky membrane remodeling is actively debated. Using lipid nanotubes as substrates to directly measure geometric intermediates of the fission pathway, we found that GTP hydrolysis limits dynamin polymerization into short, metastable collars that are optimal for fission. Collars as short as two rungs translated radial constriction to reversible hemifission via membrane wedging of the pleckstrin homology domains (PHDs) of dynamin. Modeling revealed that tilting of the PHDs to conform with membrane deformations creates the low-energy pathway for hemifission. This local coordination of dynamin and lipids suggests how membranes can be remodeled in cells."

We show that at pH = 9 this method can be tuned to grow larger particles with single stable domain magnetic (> 20-30 nm) or even multi-domain behavior (> 80 nm). The crystal growth kinetics resembles surprisingly observations of magnetite crystal formation in magnetotactic bacteria. The physicochemical parameters required for mineralization in these organisms are unknown, therefore this study provides insight into which conditions could possibly prevail in the biomineralizing vesicle compartments (magnetosomes) of these bacteria."

Phosphatidylserine-exposing platelets with a key role in the coagulation process disconnect from a thrombus by integrin inactivation via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that αIIbβ3 inactivation in procoagulant platelets relies on a sustained high intracellular Ca2+, stimulating intracellular cleavage of the β3 chain, talin, and Src kinase. Inhibition of calpain activity abolished protein cleavage, but only partly suppressed αIIbβ3 inactivation. Integrin αIIbβ3 inactivation was unchanged in platelets from Capn1−/− mice, suggesting a role of the calpain-2 isoform. Scott syndrome platelets, lacking the transmembrane protein TMEM16F and having low phosphatidylserine exposure, displayed reduced αIIbβ3 inactivation with the remaining activity fully dependent on calpain. In platelets from Ppif−/− mice, lacking mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation, agonist-induced phosphatidylserine exposure and αIIbβ3 inactivation were reduced. Treatment of human platelets with cyclosporin A gave a similar phenotype. Together, these data point to a dual mechanism of αIIbβ3 inactivation via calpain(-2) cleavage of integrin-associated proteins and via TMEM16F-dependent phospholipid scrambling with an assistant role of mPTP formation.

Integrin αIIbβ3 plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation in response to physiological agonists. Once in its activated conformation, αIIbβ3 accomplishes platelet-platelet interactions via bridges of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Under thrombotic conditions in flowing blood, αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation mediates thrombus formation and, finally, occlusion of a damaged cardiac or carotid artery (1Jackson S.P. Arterial thrombosis: insidious, unpredictable and deadly.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1423-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Microscopic observations have shown that both in vivo and in parallel-plate flow chambers, the aggregated platelets in a thrombus are surrounded by patches of procoagulant platelets with quite distinct properties (2Heemskerk J.W. Mattheij N.J. Cosemans J.M. Platelet-based coagulation: different populations, different functions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The latter platelets characteristically are elevated in cytosolic Ca2+, have a rounded morphology with attached microparticles, and expose the negatively charged lipid, phosphatidylserine (PS). 3The abbreviations used are: PSphosphatidylserineAF647Alexa Fluor 647CvxconvulxinmPTPmitochondrial permeability transition porePEphycoerythrinThrthrombin. This contrasts to the classical pseudopod-containing structure of aggregated platelets in a thrombus, which do not expose PS (3Munnix I.C. Kuijpers M.J. Auger J. Thomassen C.M.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2484-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Time-lapse videos show that the rounded morphology arises during platelet disconnection from the thrombus core, suggesting a well controlled mechanism of platelet detachment (4Kulkarni S. Jackson S.P. Platelet factor XIII and calpain negatively regulate integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function and thrombus growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30697-30706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This population of PS-exposing platelets is known to bind multiple coagulation factors, greatly promoting the process of thrombin generation (3Munnix I.C. Kuijpers M.J. Auger J. Thomassen C.M.

Spatial distribution of factor Xa, thrombin, and fibrin(ogen) on thrombi at venous shear.Plos One. 2010; 5: e10415Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the platelet detachment is mediated by inactivation or closure of previously activated αIIbβ3 integrins (6Cosemans J.M. Iserbyt B.F. Deckmyn H. Heemskerk J.W. Multiple ways to switch platelet integrins on and off.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of such a process is not well understood. phosphatidylserine Alexa Fluor 647 convulxin mitochondrial permeability transition pore phycoerythrin thrombin. Activation of αIIbβ3 leads to the appearance of high affinity binding sites for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor at the platelet surface. The signaling mechanism to αIIbβ3 activation, unraveled in considerable detail, involves several pathways, i.e. via a phospholipase C and protein kinase C route, resulting in transient Ca2+ fluctuations, and via phosphoinositide 3-kinase route. The consequence is activation of a chain of regulatory proteins CalDAG-GEFI, Rap1b, and Rap1-GTP-interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) (7Shattil S.J. Kim C. Ginsberg M.H. The final steps of integrin activation: the end game.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 8Watson S.P. Auger J.M. McCarty O.J. Pearce A.C. GPVI and integrin αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); and these establish interaction of the cytoskeleton proteins, kindlin-3 and talin-1, with the β3 chain of the αIIbβ3 complex, with, as a result, unclasping of the αIIb and β3 chains (9Ma Y.Q. Qin J. Plow E.F. Platelet integrin αIIbβ3: activation mechanisms.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Nieswandt B. Varga-Szabo D. Elvers M. Integrins in platelet activation.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another proposed mechanism of αIIbβ3 activation is that talin-1 modulates the integrin conformation by a tilting effect on the β3 chain (11Kim C. Ye F. Hu X. Ginsberg M.H. Talin activates integrins by altering the topology of the β transmembrane domain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In response to ADP and ADP-releasing platelet agonists, the conformational change of αIIbβ3 is considered to be an intrinsically reversible process (6Cosemans J.M. Iserbyt B.F. Deckmyn H. Heemskerk J.W. Multiple ways to switch platelet integrins on and off.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The active integrin itself can evoke multiple signaling events in platelets (12Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Integrins: dynamic scaffolds for adhesion and signaling in platelets.Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A key role in this so-called outside-in signaling pathway is provided by the protein tyrosine kinase Src, which is constitutively associated with the β3 cytoplasmic tail (13Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Src kinase activation by direct interaction with the integrin β cytoplasmic domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Src, for instance, activates other tyrosine kinases such as Syk (8Watson S.P. Auger J.M. McCarty O.J. Pearce A.C. GPVI and integrin αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, a functional role of the Ca2+-dependent thiol protease, calpain, has been suggested in integrin αIIbβ3 activation and signaling, but this has remained controversial. Calpain may either activate αIIbβ3 by cleaving talin (14Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. Calpain cleavage promotes talin binding to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or counteract the high affinity conformational state of αIIbβ3 by cleaving the cytoplasmic tail of the β3 chain (15Pfaff M. Du X. Ginsberg M.H. Calpain cleavage of integrin β cytoplasmic domains.FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although essentially all platelet agonists cause αIIbβ3 activation, only strong agonists are capable of inducing the formation of procoagulant, PS-exposing platelets. Effective inducers of the latter response are the combination of the glycoprotein VI agonist convulxin (Cvx) with thrombin (Thr), or otherwise Ca2+ ionophores such as A23187 and ionomycin (16Arachiche A. Kerbiriou-Nabias D. Garcin I. Letellier T. Dachary-Prigent J. Rapid procoagulant phosphatidylserine exposure relies on high cytosolic calcium rather than on mitochondrial depolarization.Arterioscler.

Platelet receptor interplay regulates collagen-induced thrombus formation in flowing human blood.Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Common to these agonists is that they induce a high and sustained rise in cytosolic Ca2+, which is considered to trigger the Ca2+-operated membrane protein, TMEM16F, which regulates the scrambling of phospholipids and exposure of PS (18Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 19van Kruchten R. Mattheij N.J. Saunders C. Feijge M.A. Swieringa F. Wolfs J.L. Collins P.W. Heemskerk J.W. Bevers E.M. Both TMEM16F-dependent and TMEM16F-independent pathways contribute to phosphatidylserine exposure in platelet apoptosis and platelet activation.Blood. 2013; 121: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In platelets from Scott syndrome patients, who lack a functional TMEM16F, agonist-induced PS exposure is greatly diminished (20Munnix I.C. Cosemans J.M. Auger J.M. Heemskerk J.W. Platelet response heterogeneity in thrombus formation.Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 102: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Castoldi E. Collins P.W. Williamson P.L. Bevers E.M. Compound heterozygosity for two novel TMEM16F mutations in a patient with Scott syndrome.Blood. 2011; 117: 4399-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, contributing to TMEM16F-mediated phospholipid scrambling is the Ca2+-dependent depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and formation of a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (19van Kruchten R. Mattheij N.J. Saunders C. Feijge M.A. Swieringa F. Wolfs J.L. Collins P.W. Heemskerk J.W. Bevers E.M. Both TMEM16F-dependent and TMEM16F-independent pathways contribute to phosphatidylserine exposure in platelet apoptosis and platelet activation.Blood. 2013; 121: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that mouse platelets lacking cyclophilin D (Ppif gene), an mPTP component, are defective in PS exposure (22Jobe S.M. Wilson K.M. Leo L. Raimondi A. Molkentin J.D. Lentz S.R. Di Paola J. Critical role for the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and cyclophilin D in platelet activation and thrombosis.Blood. 2008; 111: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Another platelet population often described in the literature is that of coated platelets (23Dale G.L. Coated-platelets: an emergic component of the procoagulant response.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 24Jobe S.M. Leo L. Eastvold J.S. Dickneite G. Ratliff T.L. Lentz S.R. Di Paola J. Role of FcRγ and factor XIIIa in coated platelet formation.Blood. 2005; 106: 4146-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These are formed by dual stimulation with collagen and thrombin (but not Ca2+ ionophore) and can be characterized by high and stable surface retention of labeled fibrinogen. Fibrinogen as well as other platelet secretion products (e.g. factor V, thrombospondin, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor) bind to these platelets in an αIIbβ3-independent way via transglutaminase activity. Procoagulant and coated platelets represent two not completely overlapping populations, as not all PS-exposing platelets display high fibrinogen binding (2Heemskerk J.W. Mattheij N.J. Cosemans J.M. Platelet-based coagulation: different populations, different functions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).

The final concentration was 1 × 108/ml, unless indicated otherwise. Washed platelets in (modified) Hepes buffer, pH 7.45, were incubated with the calpain inhibitors, calpeptin (200 μm) or MDL28170 (200 μm), or vehicle for 15 min, as desired. Platelets were stimulated with Cvx (100 ng/ml), Thr (8 nm), or ionomycin (20 μm). Samples (5 × 107 platelets) were taken at the indicated time points and lysed in ice-cold 4× lysis buffer (600 mm, 10 mm Tris, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 4% Nonidet P-40).

Light transmission traces, reflecting platelet aggregation, were measured using a Chronolog aggregometer under constant stirring (37 °C). Platelets (1 × 108/ml) in Hepes buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 were stimulated with 4 nm Thr and/or 100 ng/ml Cvx, or with 10 μm ionomycin; experiments were performed in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tirofiban. Aggregation of platelets was also assessed by single cell count analysis using a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics). For flow cytometry, washed human or mouse platelets (1 × 108/ml) were preincubated with the indicated inhibitors or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle for 10 min and stimulated in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 with 4 nm thrombin and/or 100 ng/ml convulxin, or with 10 μm ionomycin. In samples taken after 5–30 min, surface expression of PS was detected with AF647-labeled annexin A5. In addition, activated integrin αIIbβ3 was detected using FITC-labeled PAC1 mAb for human platelets or PE-labeled JON/A mAb for mouse platelets. Samples were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers). Platelet samples were fixed and stained for transmission electron microscopy, as described before (30Cosemans J.M.

In brief, PPACK/fragmin-anticoagulated mouse blood was flowed over a coverslip coated with collagen type I in a transparent parallel-plate perfusion chamber, at shear rate of 1000 s−1 for 4 min. Thrombi formed on the collagen surface were poststained with AF647-annexin A5 and PE-JON/A mAb in modified Hepes buffer, pH 7.45, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml heparin. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were captured for analysis of surface area coverage of adherent platelets and of platelets with active integrins or exposed PS (32Cosemans J.M. Schols S.E.

Haemost. 2009; 102: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The impaired adhesion of PS-exposing platelets seemingly contrasts to the observation that, in platelet suspensions, the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin (causing full PS exposure) produces changes in light transmission that are suggestive of platelet aggregation (34Wolfs J.L. Comfurius P. Rasmussen J.T. Keuren J.F. Lindhout T. Zwaal R.F. Bevers E.M.

Pathogenetic analysis of three cases with a bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation induced by Ca2+ ionophores.Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We reinvestigated this by first stimulating washed human platelets with 4 nm Thr or 100 ng/ml Cvx. As shown in Fig. 1A, this resulted in a rapid increase of light transmission, which was almost fully suppressed by the αIIbβ3 antagonist tirofiban (inhibition at 25 min 87 ± 3% and 72 ± 4%, respectively; mean ± S.D., n = 4). Integrin-dependent platelet aggregation with Thr or Cvx was confirmed by a major reduction in single platelet count (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the combined application of Cvx/Thr or addition of 10 μm ionomycin provoked similar rapid increases in light transmission (Fig. 1A). However, the Cvx/Thr-induced light transmission increase was only partly suppressed with tirofiban (inhibition 60 ± 7% at 25 min). In comparison, tirofiban did not affect the light transmission increase induced by ionomycin (−9 ± 8%). Platelet lysis could be excluded because single cell count analysis indicated that ionomycin treatment resulted in a platelet count that remained at 90% of the original count (Fig. 1B). Electron microscopic analysis indicated that, unlike the pseudopod-containing platelets formed by thrombin, ionomycin treatment resulted in single, rounded platelets with a translucent appearance (Fig. 2). Together, these data indicate that the pseudo-aggregation observed after Cvx/Thr or ionomycin stimulation is a consequence of the morphological change with a rounded and translucent platelet structure, reducing light transmission, rather than a consequence of integrin-dependent platelet aggregate formation. The absence of integrin activation with these agonists was further demonstrated by dual color flow cytometry, using FITC-PAC1 mAb and AF647-annexin A5, probing activated αIIbβ3 and PS exposure, respectively. Upon stimulation with Cvx/Thr, initially a population of platelets only binding PAC1 mAb was formed, which was gradually replaced by a population of PAC1-negative platelets which only bound annexin A5 (Fig. 1, C and D). Within the time interval of 5–30 min, 40 ± 12% (n = 4) of platelets lost the capability to bind PAC1 mAb. Similar results were found when fluorescent lactadherin was used instead of annexin A5 (data not shown). Integrin closure could not be explained by a decrease in expression levels of αIIb and β3 chains because these levels were even increased after stimulation with Thr, Cvx, or Cvx/Thr. This increase in expression levels is explained by an increase membrane surface due to granule secretion, as detected by CD62P expression (supplemental Table S1). In response to 10 μm ionomycin, the majority of platelets bound annexin A5 but not PAC1 mAb (Fig. 1, E and F). However, at low ionomycin doses (<5 μm), transient PAC1 mAb binding was detected, accompanied by a corresponding reduction in single platelet count (data not shown). Expression levels of αIIb and β3 remained unchanged after high ionomycin stimulation (supplemental Table S1), thus indicating that this treatment precludes or antagonizes integrin activation. Increased expression levels of αIIb and β3 were not observed, which was explained by a diminished secretion after ionomycin stimulation compared with Cvx/Thr stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that PS exposure induced by these strong agents is accompanied by either closure of activated integrin or by lack of integrin activation, which prevents the formation of large platelet aggregates. Interestingly, Fig. 1, C and D, points to a small population of Cvx/Thr-stimulated platelets, capable of binding both PAC1 mAb and annexin A5. Flow cytometric studies were performed to characterize this dual-labeled platelet population. It remained unchanged in size upon stimulation with Cvx/SFLLRN (thrombin receptor-activating peptide) or in the presence of transglutaminase inhibitor, cadaverine (data not shown). This population for the major part (<4%) did not exhibit high fibrinogen binding. Hence, these platelets could not be identified as “coated,” i.e. containing a transglutaminase-dependent fibrin coat. Other experiments showed that the population of dual-labeled platelets reduced in size, when incubations"

Using transgenic mice, we show that the mammalian middle ear develops through cavitation of a neural crest mass. These cells, which previously underwent an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation upon leaving the neural tube, undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation to form a lining continuous with the endodermally derived auditory tube. The epithelium derived from endodermal cells, which surrounds the auditory tube and eardrum, develops cilia, whereas the neural crest-derived epithelium does not. Thus, the cilia critical to clearing pathogenic infections from the middle ear are distributed according to developmental derivations. A different process of cavitation appears evident in birds and reptiles, indicating that this dual epithelium may be unique to mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1991938712,"The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) are receptor tyrosine kinases that upon binding to collagens undergo receptor phosphorylation, which in turn activates signal transduction pathways that regulate cell-collagen interactions. We report here that collagen-dependent DDR1 activation is partly regulated by the proteolytic activity of the membrane-anchored collagenases, MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). These collagenases cleave DDR1 and attenuate collagen I- and IV-induced receptor phosphorylation. This effect is not due to ligand degradation, as it proceeds even when the receptor is stimulated with collagenase-resistant collagen I (r/r) or with a triple-helical peptide harboring the DDR recognition motif in collagens. Moreover, the secreted collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-13 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane-type MMPs (MT4- and MT6-MMP) have no effect on DDR1 cleavage or activation. N-terminal sequencing of the MT1-MMP-mediated cleaved products and mutational analyses show that cleavage of DDR1 takes place within the extracellular juxtamembrane region, generating a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment. Metalloproteinase inhibitor studies show that constitutive shedding of endogenous DDR1 in breast cancer HCC1806 cells is partly mediated by MT1-MMP, which also regulates collagen-induced receptor activation.

https://openalex.org/W1982600437,"We have investigated the role of ceramide in the cellular adaptation to folate stress induced by Aldh1l1, the enzyme involved in the regulation of folate metabolism. Our previous studies demonstrated that Aldh1l1, similar to folate deficiency, evokes metabolic stress and causes apoptosis in cancer cells. Here we report that the expression of Aldh1l1 in A549 or HCT116 cells results in the elevation of C16-ceramide and a transient up-regulation of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) mRNA and protein. Pretreatment with ceramide synthesis inhibitors myriocin and fumonisin B1 or siRNA silencing of CerS6 prevented C16-ceramide accumulation and rescued cells supporting the role of CerS6/C16-ceramide as effectors of Aldh1l1-induced apoptosis. The CerS6 activation by Aldh1l1 and increased ceramide generation were p53-dependent; this effect was ablated in p53-null cells. Furthermore, the expression of wild type p53 but not transcriptionally inactive R175H p53 mutant strongly elevated CerS6. Also, this dominant negative mutant prevented accumulation of CerS6 in response to Aldh1l1, indicating that CerS6 is a transcriptional target of p53. In support of this mechanism, bioinformatics analysis revealed the p53 binding site 3 kb downstream of the CerS6 transcription start. Interestingly, ceramide elevation in response to Aldh1l1 was inhibited by silencing of PUMA, a proapoptotic downstream effector of p53 whereas the transient expression of CerS6 elevated PUMA in a p53-dependent manner indicating reciprocal relationships between ceramide and p53/PUMA pathways. Importantly, folate withdrawal also induced CerS6/C16-ceramide elevation accompanied by p53 accumulation. Overall, these novel findings link folate and de novo ceramide pathways in cellular stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2051927740,"The cytosolic protein c-FLIP (cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin 1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) is an inhibitor of death receptor-mediated apoptosis that is up-regulated in a variety of cancers, contributing to apoptosis resistance. Several compounds found to restore sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL, a TNF family death ligand with promising therapeutic potential, act by targeting c-FLIP ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in c-FLIP protein degradation. However, the mechanism by which ROS post-transcriptionally regulate c-FLIP protein levels is not well understood. We show here that treatment of prostate cancer PPC-1 cells with the superoxide generators menadione, paraquat, or buthionine sulfoximine down-regulates c-FLIP long (c-FLIP(L)) protein levels, which is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Furthermore, pretreatment of PPC-1 cells with a ROS scavenger prevented ubiquitination and loss of c-FLIP(L) protein induced by menadione or paraquat. We identified lysine 167 as a novel ubiquitination site of c-FLIP(L) important for ROS-dependent degradation. We also identified threonine 166 as a novel phosphorylation site and demonstrate that Thr-166 phosphorylation is required for ROS-induced Lys-167 ubiquitination. The mutation of either Thr-166 or Lys-167 was sufficient to stabilize c-FLIP protein levels in PPC-1, HEK293T, and HeLa cancer cells treated with menadione or paraquat. Accordingly, expression of c-FLIP T166A or K167R mutants protected cells from ROS-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death. Our findings reveal novel ROS-dependent post-translational modifications of the c-FLIP protein that regulate its stability, thus impacting sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL."
https://openalex.org/W1970296682,"Cocoa agroforests can significantly support biodiversity, yet intensification of farming practices is degrading agroforestry habitats and compromising ecosystem services such as biological pest control. Effective conservation strategies depend on the type of relationship between agricultural matrix, biodiversity and ecosystem services, but to date the shape of this relationship is unknown. We linked shade index calculated from eight vegetation variables, with insect pests and beneficial insects (ants, wasps and spiders) in 20 cocoa agroforests differing in woody and herbaceous vegetation diversity. We measured herbivory and predatory rates, and quantified resulting increases in cocoa yield and net returns. We found that number of spider webs and wasp nests significantly decreased with increasing density of exotic shade tree species. Greater species richness of native shade tree species was associated with a higher number of wasp nests and spider webs while species richness of understory plants did not have a strong impact on these beneficial species. Species richness of ants, wasp nests and spider webs peaked at higher levels of plant species richness. The number of herbivore species (mirid bugs and cocoa pod borers) and the rate of herbivory on cocoa pods decreased with increasing shade index. Shade index was negatively related to yield, with yield significantly higher at shade and herb covers<50%. However, higher inputs in the cocoa farms do not necessarily result in a higher net return. In conclusion, our study shows the importance of a diverse shade canopy in reducing damage caused by cocoa pests. It also highlights the importance of conservation initiatives in tropical agroforestry landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W1997285584,"Purpose Metabolic changes upon antiangiogenic therapy of recurrent glioblastomas (rGBMs) may provide new biomarkers for treatment efficacy. Since in vitro models showed that phospholipid membrane metabolism provides specific information on tumor growth we employed in-vivo MR-spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of human rGBMs before and under bevacizumab (BVZ) to measure concentrations of phosphocholine (PCho), phosphoethanolamine (PEth), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and glyceroethanolamine (GPE). Methods 1H and 31P MRSI was prospectively performed in 32 patients with rGBMs before and under BVZ therapy at 8 weeks intervals until tumor progression. Patients were dichotomized into subjects with long overall survival (OS) (>median OS) and short OS (<median OS) survival time from BVZ-onset. Metabolite concentrations from tumor tissue and their ratios were compared to contralateral normal-appearing tissue (control). Results Before BVZ, 1H-detectable choline signals (total GPC and PCho) in rGBMs were elevated but significance failed after dichotomizing. For metabolite ratios obtained by 31P MRSI, the short-OS group showed higher PCho/GPC (p = 0.004) in rGBMs compared to control tissue before BVZ while PEth/GPE was elevated in rGBMs of both groups (long-OS p = 0.04; short-OS p = 0.003). Under BVZ, PCho/GPC and PEth/GPE in the tumor initially decreased (p = 0.04) but only PCho/GPC re-increased upon tumor progression (p = 0.02). Intriguingly, in normal-appearing tissue an initial PEth/GPE decrease (p = 0.047) was followed by an increase at the time of tumor progression (p = 0.031). Conclusion An elevated PCho/GPC ratio in the short-OS group suggests that it is a negative predictive marker for BVZ efficacy. These gliomas may represent a malignant phenotype even growing under anti-VEGF treatment. Elevated PEth/GPE may represent an in-vivo biomarker more sensitive to GBM infiltration than MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2022229528,"Introduction Lung cancer, the most prevalent malignant cancer in the world, remains a serious threat to public health. Recently, a large number of studies have shown that an epidermoid growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), Erlotinib, has significantly better efficacy and is better tolerated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a positive EGFR gene mutation. However, access to this drug is severely limited in China due to its high acquisition cost. Therefore, we decided to conduct a study to compare cost-effectiveness between erlotinib monotherapy and carboplatin-gemcitabine (CG) combination therapy in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Methods A Markov model was developed from the perspective of the Chinese health care system to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two treatment strategies; this model was based on data from the OPTIMAL trial, which was undertaken at 22 centres in China. The 10-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated. To allow for uncertainties within the parameters and to estimate the model robustness, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. Results The median progression-free survival (PFS) obtained from Markov model was 13.2 months (13.1 months was reported in the trial) in the erlotinib group while and 4.64 months (4.6 months was reported in the trial) in the CG group. The QALYs were 1.4 years in the erlotinib group and 1.96 years in the CG group, indicating difference of 0.56 years. The ICER was most sensitive to the health utility of DP ranged from $58,584.57 to $336,404.2. At a threshold of $96,884, erlotinib had a 50%probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions Erlotinib monotherapy is more cost-effective compared with platinum-based doublets chemotherapy as a first-line therapy for advanced EGFR mutation- positive NSCLC patients from within the Chinese health care system."
https://openalex.org/W2171421390,"We present schema redescription as a methodology to characterize canalization in automata networks used to model biochemical regulation and signalling. In our formulation, canalization becomes synonymous with redundancy present in the logic of automata. This results in straightforward measures to quantify canalization in an automaton (micro-level), which is in turn integrated into a highly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of large-scale automata networks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a method to link micro- to macro-level dynamics – a crux of complexity. Several new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity (modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks), identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the convergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete information about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster. We use this model to show that our analysis does not contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about its behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor basin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal conditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the resilience of these to stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable to any complex network that can be modelled using automata, but we focus on biochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the (decentralized) control that orchestrates cellular activity – with the ultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues ‘compute’."

On June 1, 2003 Prince Edward Island (PEI) enacted a province-wide smoking ban in public places and workplaces. Changes in hospital admission rates for cardiovascular (acute myocardial infarction, angina, and stroke) and respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) conditions were examined before and after the smoking ban.Crude annual and monthly admission rates for the above conditions were calculated from April 1, 1995 to December 31, 2008 in all PEI acute care hospitals. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average time series models were used to test for changes in mean and trend of monthly admission rates for study conditions, control conditions and a control province after the comprehensive smoking ban. Age- and sex-based analyses were completed.The mean rate of acute myocardial infarctions was reduced by 5.92 cases per 100,000 person-months (P = 0.04) immediately after the smoking ban. The trend of monthly angina admissions in men was reduced by -0.44 cases per 100,000 person-months (P = 0.01) in the 67 months after the smoking ban. All other cardiovascular and respiratory admission changes were non-significant.A comprehensive smoking ban in PEI reduced the overall mean number of acute myocardial infarction admissions and the trend of angina hospital admissions."

While previous research has elucidated the factors associated with congruence between patients' preferred and actual place of death, it is not known how the perspective of the family influences the place of death. This study examined whether family preference for place of death mediates the relationship between patient preference and actual place of death.A total of 258 cancer patients (home death, n = 142; hospital death, n = 116) who had received terminal care in Japan were analyzed. Measures included patients' demographic variables, patient and family preferences for place for death, actual place of death, patients' functional status, use and intensity of home care, availability of inpatient bed, living arrangement, and amount of extended family support.Patient-family congruence on preferred place of death was 66% in patients who died at home and 47% in patients who died at other places (kappa coefficient: 0.20 and 0.25, respectively). In a multiple logistic regression model, patients were more likely to die at home when patients were male (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.53, 1.06-6.05) and when their family preferred death at home (OR, 95% CI: 37.37, 13.82-101.03). A Sobel test revealed that family preference mediated the relationship between patient preference and place of death (p<0.05).This study is, to our knowledge, the first to unveil the role of the family in the relationship between patient preference and place of death in Japan. In order to honor patients' wishes to die at home, supporting caregivers in the family may be an essential component of terminal care."
https://openalex.org/W2032878546,"Major dengue epidemics have been observed in the Indian subcontinent since the 1980s and have occurred with increased hospitalizations and mortality. In 2011, the first major epidemic of dengue occurred in Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan, and resulted in 21,685 confirmed cases and 350 deaths. To investigate the possible viral causes for the increased epidemic activity, we determined the predominant serotype and characterized the viruses genetically. Of 50 patients carefully selected as probable dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever, 34 were positive by virologic testing (i.e. PCR and/or virus isolation). DENV-2 was detected in 32 patients and DENV-1 in two. A total of 24 partial and three full DENV genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of the capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelope genes comprising 2500 nucleotides in length indicated that all DENV-2 isolates in Pakistan since 2007 form a monophyletic lineage that is endemic in the country. These viruses were all of the cosmopolitan genotype (IV) and most closely related to viruses isolated in India and Sri Lanka in the past two decades. Phylogenetic analyses of data currently available in GenBank suggest that the Cosmopolitan genotype has diverged into two geographically distinct sub-lineages: sub-lineage IV-a has only been observed in Southeast Asia, China and Oceania, while IV-b is prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. These results highlight the increased diversity of dengue viruses as they spread geographically within the region."
https://openalex.org/W2077098573,"We integrated biological experimental data with mathematical modelling to gain insights into the role played by L-alanine in amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion (AASIS) and in D-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), details important to the understanding of complex β-cell metabolic coupling relationships. We present an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based simplified kinetic model of core metabolic processes leading to ATP production (glycolysis, TCA cycle, L-alanine-specific reactions, respiratory chain, ATPase and proton leak) and Ca2+ handling (essential channels and pumps in the plasma membrane) in pancreatic β-cells and relate these to insulin secretion. Experimental work was performed using a clonal rat insulin-secreting cell line (BRIN-BD11) to measure the consumption or production of a range of important biochemical parameters (D-glucose, L-alanine, ATP, insulin secretion) and Ca2+ levels. These measurements were then used to validate the theoretical model and fine-tune the parameters. Mathematical modelling was used to predict L-lactate and L-glutamate concentrations following D-glucose and/or L-alanine challenge and Ca2+ levels upon stimulation with a non metabolizable L-alanine analogue. Experimental data and mathematical model simulations combined suggest that L-alanine produces a potent insulinotropic effect via both a stimulatory impact on β-cell metabolism and as a direct result of the membrane depolarization due to Ca2+ influx triggered by L-alanine/Na+ co-transport. Our simulations indicate that both high intracellular ATP and Ca2+ concentrations are required in order to develop full insulin secretory responses. The model confirmed that K+ATP channel independent mechanisms of stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, via generation of mitochondrial coupling messengers, are essential for promotion of the full and sustained insulin secretion response in β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2172240001,"Introduction Considerable evidence suggests that patients with more advantaged Socio-Economic Positions undergo Total Hip and Knee Replacement (THR/TKR) more often, despite having a lower need. We questioned whether more disadvantaged Socio-Economic Position is associated with an lower improvement in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and a lower patient satisfaction after THR/TKR. Methods Patients who underwent primary THR/TKR in one academic and three community hospitals between 2005 and 2009, were eligible for inclusion. The highest completed levels of schooling were aggregated to index social class. We compared the improvement in HRQoL and postoperative satisfaction with surgery (measured using the Short-Form 36 (SF36) and an 11-point numeric rating scale of satisfaction) between the aggregated groups of highest completed levels of schooling, using linear mixed model analysis, with center as a random effect and potential confounders (i.e. age, gender, Body Mass Index and Charnley's comorbidity classification) as fixed effects. Results 586 THR patients and 400 TKR patients (40% of all eligible patients) agreed to participate and completed all questionnaires sufficiently. We found no differences in HRQoL improvement in any dimension of the SF36 in THR patients. Patients with a higher completed level of schooling had a larger improvement in role-physical (9.38 points, 95%-CI:0.34–18.4), a larger improvement in general health (3.67 points, 95%-CI:0.56–6.79) and a smaller improvement in mental health (3.60 points, 95%-CI:0.82–6.38) after TKR. Postoperative patient satisfaction did not differ between different highest completed level of schooling groups. Discussion Completed level of schooling has no effect on the improvement in HRQoL and patient satisfaction in a Dutch THR population and a small effect in a similar TKR population. Undertreatment of patients with more disadvantaged Socio-Economic Position cannot be justified, given the similar improvement in HRQoL and postoperative level of satisfaction with surgery between the social groups examined."

https://openalex.org/W1970733395,"IgGs from patients with multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) purified on MBP-Sepharose in contrast to canonical proteases hydrolyze effectively only myelin basic protein (MBP), but not many other tested proteins. Here we have shown for the first time that anti-MBP SLE IgGs hydrolyze nonspecific tri- and tetrapeptides with an extreme low efficiency and cannot effectively hydrolyze longer 20-mer nonspecific oligopeptides corresponding to antigenic determinants (AGDs) of HIV-1 integrase. At the same time, anti-MBP SLE IgGs efficiently hydrolyze oligopeptides corresponding to AGDs of MBP. All sites of IgG-mediated proteolysis of 21-and 25-mer encephalytogenic oligopeptides corresponding to two known AGDs of MBP were found by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography, TLC, and MALDI spectrometry. Several clustered major, moderate, and minor sites of cleavage were revealed in the case of 21- and 25-mer oligopeptides. The active sites of anti-MBP abzymes are localised on their light chains, while heavy chains are responsible for the affinity of protein substrates. Interactions of intact globular proteins with both light and heavy chains of abzymes provide high affinity to MBP and specificity of this protein hydrolysis. The affinity of anti-MBP abzymes for intact MBP is approximately 1000-fold higher than for the oligopeptides. The data suggest that all oligopeptides interact mainly with the light chains of different monoclonal abzymes of total pool of IgGs, which possesses a lower affinity for substrates, and therefore, depending on the oligopeptide sequences, their hydrolysis may be less specific than globular protein and can occur in several sites."
https://openalex.org/W2139385641,"The ability of molecular chaperones to overcome the misfolding and aggregation of proteins is essential for the maintenance of proper protein homeostasis in all cells. Thus far, the best studied disaggregase systems are the Clp/Hsp100 family of “ATPases associated with various cellular activities” (AAA+) ATPases, which use mechanical forces powered by ATP hydrolysis to remodel protein aggregates.

This establishes a useful framework to understand the molecular mechanism by which binding interactions from a molecular chaperone can be used to overcome protein aggregates in the absence of external energy input from ATP. Protein homeostasis is vital to all cells and requires the proper production, folding, localization, assembly, and degradation of all cellular proteins (1Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention.Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Crucial to the maintenance of protein homeostasis is an elaborate network of “molecular chaperones” (2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

However under stress conditions, the folding capacity of the chaperone network could be exceeded or impaired, leading to protein aggregation. A special set of chaperone machineries, the “disaggregases,” plays a crucial role in rescuing these detrimental processes. The best studied disaggregases belong to the Hsp100 family: Hsp104 in yeast and ClpB in bacteria (5Doyle S.M. Wickner S. Hsp104 and ClpB: protein disaggregating machines.Trends Biochem.

Despite the fascinating activity displayed by ClpB/Hsp104, their homologues have not been found beyond bacteria and yeast cells. Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence indicate that maintenance of protein homeostasis in mammalian cells is critically dependent on cellular programs to overcome the deleterious effects of protein aggregation (9Cohen E.

However, the mechanism by which protein aggregates can be disassembled based solely on the substrate binding energy of a chaperone remains elusive. Many questions arise in addressing these mechanisms. First, what are the precise binding interactions between cpSRP43 and its substrate proteins? Previous work has demonstrated a specific interaction of cpSRP43 with a highly conserved 18-amino acid loop, L18, between TM2 and TM3 of LHC proteins (22Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the ability of cpSRP43 to prevent LHC proteins from aggregation implies that it must also protect the hydrophobic TMs of the substrate protein. Consistent with this notion, the binding affinity between cpSRP43 and full-length LHCP is at least an order of magnitude higher than that for the L18 peptide (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q.

Structural basis for specific substrate recognition by the chloroplast signal recognition particle protein cpSRP43.Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus additional interactions most likely exist between LHCP and cpSRP43, but the nature of these interactions remains to be determined. Second, how does cpSRP43 use these binding interactions to effect the reversal of protein aggregation? Previous kinetic analyses revealed that disaggregation is a cooperative process during which multiple cpSRP43 molecules recognize and actively remodel the LHCP aggregate (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, how the recognition and remodeling of the protein aggregate were accomplished by cpSRP43 has been elusive. By combining molecular genetics with kinetic and thermodynamic analysis, here we present evidence that the interaction of cpSRP43 with its substrate proteins is composed of two components: sequence-specific recognition of the L18 motif and highly promiscuous interactions with hydrophobic TMs. These interactions enable distinct steps in the cpSRP43-mediated disaggregation of LHC proteins: initial recognition and subsequent remodeling and disruption of the aggregate. The balance of these binding interactions with the energetics of packing interactions within the aggregate dictates the efficiency of the disaggregation reaction. To construct the LHCP TM mutants (see Table 1), a pair of unique restriction sites was introduced into the expression plasmid encoding LHCP before and after the sequences encoding TM1, TM2, or TM3. The sequences coding for the TMs were replaced with PCR fragments encoding alternative TMs using the corresponding restriction sites. TM deletion mutants and Lhcb5 cysteine mutants were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). cpSRP43, LHCP, and its variants were purified as described (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Description of the LHCP TM mutants Two independent methods were used to determine the apparent dissociation constant Kdapp for cpSRP43-substrate binding. (i) The first method was prevention of LHCP aggregation by cpSRP43, monitored by light scattering at 360 nm after a 10-min incubation of the substrate protein with varying concentrations of cpSRP43 (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The light scattering is linearly proportional to the concentration of LHCP except at very low concentrations (Ref. 12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2013; 288: 1340-13430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). The percentage of soluble substrates (% soluble) was analyzed as a function of cpSRP43 concentration. The data were fit to Equation 1, % soluble =100 ×[L]+[43]+Kdapp−([L]+[43]+Kdapp)2−4×[L][43]2×[L](Eq. 1) in which [L] is the LHC protein concentration and [43] is the cpSRP43 concentration. (ii) The second method was fluorescence anisotropy, as described previously (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, all anisotropy measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Fluorolog 3-22 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). Fluorescein-labeled LHCP or its variants (100 nm) were diluted into buffer containing different concentrations of cpSRP43. The samples were excited at 450 nm, and the fluorescence anisotropy was recorded at 524 nm. The data were fit to Equation 2, Aobsd =A0+ΔA ×[L]+[43]+Kd−([L]+[43]+Kd)2−4×[L][43]2×[L](Eq. 2) in which Aobsd is the observed anisotropy value, A0 is the anisotropy value without cpSRP43, ΔA is the total change in anisotropy, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The Kd values measured by these two methods produced consistent results for the substrates tested (see Fig. 2A). Disaggregation reactions were performed as described previously (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with the exception that aggregate formation was allowed to proceed for 1 min before the addition of cpSRP43. The observed light scattering intensity was normalized to that prior to the addition of cpSRP43. The disaggregation time courses were fit to an exponential function, Equation 3, A=Af+ΔAe−kobsd t(Eq. 3) in which A is the observed light scattering, Af is the amount of light scattering at t → ∞, ΔA is the extent of light scattering change, and kobsd is the observed rate constant. The fractions disaggregated (K) were calculated as (ΔA/(ΔA + Af)). The cpSRP43 concentration dependences of the value of K were fit to Equation 4, K=Kmax×[43]h(K1/2)h+[43]h(Eq. 4) in which Kmax is the extent of disaggregation at saturating cpSRP43 concentration, K½ is the concentration of cpSRP43 that enables 50% solubilization of the aggregates, and h is the Hill coefficient. Kinetic analysis was performed and analyzed as described previously (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to obtain the forward rate disaggregation rate constant, kf, from the observed rate constants (kobsd, Equation 3) and the extent of disaggregation (K). The cpSRP43 concentration dependence of the kf values was fit to Equation 5, k=k0×〈Km〉h〈Km〉h+[43]h+kmax×[43]h〈Km〉h+[43]h(Eq. 5) in which k0 is the rate of spontaneous LHCP disaggregation in the absence of the chaperone, 〈Km〉 is the concentration of cpSRP43 required to achieve half-maximal disaggregation rate, h is the Hill coefficient, and kmax is the disaggregation rate constant at saturating cpSRP43 concentration. For some of the irreversible mutants (see Table 4, red), both the reaction equilibrium and the kinetics did not show detectable cooperative concentration dependences. Therefore, the data were fit to Michaelis-Menten equations (Equations 6 and 7).

Although direct evidence remains to be obtained, the following strongly suggests that the formation of an initial recognition complex between cpSRP43 and LHCP aggregates is fast when compared with subsequent remodeling and disassembly of the aggregate. First, in all the binding experiments, the cpSRP43-LHCP interaction is complete within the timescale of manual mixing (≤15 s), much faster than the overall disaggregation rates. Second, given an affinity of ∼2 μm for the cpSRP43-L18 motif interaction (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Stengel K.F. Holdermann I.

Structural basis for specific substrate recognition by the chloroplast signal recognition particle protein cpSRP43.Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the typical range of macromolecular association rate constants (106-108 m−1 s−1), the dissociation rate constant of the recognition complex would be in the range of 2–200 s−1, much faster than the overall disaggregation reaction. Together, these observations suggest that the remodeling and disassembly of the aggregate is the rate-limiting step in the disaggregation reaction. Therefore, the cpSRP43 concentration required to achieve half of the maximal rate of disaggregation, 〈Km〉, provides an empirical measure for the average binding affinity of cpSRP43 to the aggregate. The energetics of packing interactions that drive aggregate formation were probed with a sedimentation assay. Briefly, preformed LHCP aggregates (10 μm) were resolubilized by various concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride or urea for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE. The intensities of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands for the pellet and soluble fractions were quantified using ImageJ (25Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Image processing with Image J.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The data were fit to a two-state model (Equation 8) analogous to that for protein folding (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1998: 508-614Google Scholar), F( soluble )=11+e−m(U50+[ ureal )/RT(Eq. 8) in which fraction soluble is calculated as (S/(S+P)), R is the gas constant, T is temperature, U50 is the urea concentration to achieve 50% solubilization, and m is a constant of proportionality. Linear regression analysis was performed using Mathematica to identify a weighted linear combination of U50 and lnKd values that best reproduces the lnkmax values in Table 4. This was carried out by identifying the global minimum for the scoring function (Equation 9) f(α,β,γ)=∑[lnkmax,i−(αU50,i+βlnKd,i+γ)]2(Eq. 9) All molecular biology manipulations, including site-directed mutagenesis, transformation, and plating, were performed on a Tecan Freedom EVO liquid-handling robot. 5A. Nisthal and S. L. Mayo, manuscript in preparation. Constructs were sequence-verified and rearrayed into master plates. These master plates served to inoculate 10-ml volumes of Instant TB autoinduction media in 24-well plates. After overnight expression at 37 °C, the hexahistidine-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions. Cysteine scanning of the L18 motif was carried out using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Single cysteine mutants of LHCP were analyzed using the light scattering assay as described under “Determination of Binding Affinity between cpSRP43 and Soluble Protein Substrates.” All LHCP variants were normalized to 45 μm and then diluted to 5 μm in 384-well plates by the liquid-handling robot. In the aggregation prevention assay, either no cpSRP43 or an equimolar amount (5 μm) or a 1:3 molar ratio (15 μm) of traditionally purified cpSRP43 was already present in each reaction well. The reaction was followed by absorbance at 360 nm and allowed to proceed for at least 20 min. When measuring disaggregase activity, the cpSRP43 concentration was raised to a 1:6 molar ratio (30 μm) and added ∼1 min after diluting the LHCP protein into aqueous buffer. Again, the reaction was followed for 20 min by measuring the absorbance at 360 nm. For both types of assays, the first time point was measured ∼5 min after mixing, and the final time point was used for data analysis. The percentage of chaperone activity is defined as no chaperone A360− equimolar chaperone A360 no chaperone A360×100(Eq. 10) where the equimolar chaperoneA360 value can be substituted for the A360 values of other chaperone conditions. Relative chaperone activity is then calculated by normalizing the percentage of chaperone activity to the WT LHCP value for each assay plate. To identify binding interactions of cpSRP43 with LHCP that are crucial to its chaperone and disaggregase activities, we performed exhaustive alanine-scanning mutagenesis in LHCP and assayed the chaperone activity using automated protocols on a Tecan Freedom EVO liquid-handling robot.5 Residues in the conserved L18 sequence between TM2 and TM3 of LHCP were further mutated to glycine and lysine. We tested the mutational effects on the interaction of cpSRP43 with LHCP by measuring the ability of cpSRP43 to (i) bind and thus prevent the aggregation of LHCP (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E); and (ii) reverse existing LHCP aggregates (Fig. 1, C and F). Single mutations of every residue in an FDPLGL motif in L18 had large deleterious effects on both activities (Fig. 1, D–F), indicating that this motif plays a crucial role in the ability of cpSRP43 to bind and chap"

Detecting regional cardiac function by advanced non-invasive techniques might be favorable for predicting outcome.LV longitudinal, circumferential and radial peak systolic strains (Ssys) were assessed by speckle tracking imaging (STI) in 44 biopsy-proven systemic AL amyloidosis patients with LV hypertrophy (CA) and in 30 normal controls. Patients were divided into compensated (n = 18) and decompensated (n = 26) group based on clinical assessment and followed-up for a median period of 345 days.Ejection fraction (EF) was preserved while longitudinal Ssys (LSsys) was significantly reduced in both compensated and decompensated groups. Survival was significantly reduced in decompensated group (35% vs. compensated 78%, P = 0.001). LSsys were similar in apical segments and significantly reduced in basal segments between two patient groups. LSsys at mid-segments were significantly reduced in all LV walls of decompensated group. Patients were further divided into 4 subgroups according to the presence or absence of reduced LSsys in no (normal), only basal (mild), basal and mid (intermediate) and all segments of the septum (severe). This staging revealed continuously worse prognosis in proportion to increasing number of segments with reduced LSsys (mortality: normal 14%, mild 27%, intermediate 67%, and severe 64%). Mid-septum LSsys<11% suggested a 4.8-fold mortality risk than mid-septum LSsys≥11%. Multivariate regression analysis showed NYHA class and mid-septum LSsys were independent predictors for survival.Reduced deformation at mid-septum is associated with worse prognosis in systemic amyloidosis patients with LV hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2075569400,"Protein elimination by the ubiquitin-proteasome system requires the presence of a cis-acting degradation signal. Efforts to discern degradation signals of misfolded proteasome substrates thus far revealed a general mechanism whereby the exposure of cryptic hydrophobic motifs provides a degradation determinant. We have previously characterized such a determinant, employing the yeast kinetochore protein Ndc10 as a model substrate. Ndc10 is essentially a stable protein that is rapidly degraded upon exposure of a hydrophobic motif located at the C-terminal region. The degradation motif comprises two distinct and essential elements: DegA, encompassing two amphipathic helices, and DegB, a hydrophobic sequence within the loosely structured C-terminal tail of Ndc10. Here we show that the hydrophobic nature of DegB is irrelevant for the ubiquitylation of substrates containing the Ndc10 degradation motif, but is essential for proteasomal degradation. Mutant DegB, in which the hydrophobic sequence was disrupted, acted as a dominant degradation inhibitory element when expressed at the C-terminal regions of ubiquitin-dependent and -independent substrates of the 26S proteasome. This mutant stabilized substrates in both yeast and mammalian cells, indicative of a modular recognition moiety. The dominant function of the mutant DegB provides a powerful experimental tool for evaluating the physiological implications of stabilization of specific proteasome substrates in intact cells and for studying the associated pathological effects."

We used single-channel electrophysiology to estimate the energy changes caused by mutations of these prolines with regard to unliganded gating (ΔG0) and the affinity change for ACh that increases the open channel probability (ΔGB). The effects of mutations of ProD2 (ϵPro-121/δPro-123) were greater than those of its neighbor (ϵPro-120/δPro-122) and were greater at α-ϵ versus α-δ. The main consequence of the congenital myasthenic syndrome mutation ϵProD2-L was to impair the establishment of a high affinity for ACh and thus make ΔGB less favorable. At both binding sites, most ProD2 mutations decreased constitutive activity (increased ΔG0). LRYHQG and RL substitutions reduced substantially the net binding energy (made ΔGBACh less favorable) by ≥2 kcal/mol at α-ϵ and α-δ, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2030744400,"Increased βcatenin activity correlates with leukemia stem cell expansion and disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We found previously that expression of the CML-related Bcr-abl oncoprotein in myeloid progenitor cells increases expression of Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1). This resulted in Fap1-dependent resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells. Fap1 also interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) protein, but the functional significance of this interaction is unknown. Apc participates in a complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase β (Gsk3β) and βcatenin. Assembly of this complex results in phosphorylation of βcatenin by Gsk3β, which facilitates βcatenin ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In this study, we found increased association of Fap1 with the Apc complex in Bcr-abl(+) myeloid progenitor cells. We also found Fap1-dependent inactivation of Gsk3β and consequent stabilization of βcatenin in these cells. Consistent with this, Bcr-abl(+) cells exhibited a Fap1-dependent increase in βcatenin activity. Our studies identified Fap1-dependent Gsk3β inactivation as a molecular mechanism for increased βcatenin activity in CML."

Adiponectin (ADN) mediates energy metabolism and functions as an immunomodulator. Perioperative ADN levels and perioperative immune functioning could be mutually related. Here we evaluated a potential biological marker to reliably predict the incidence of postoperative infections to prevent such comorbidities. Methods We analyzed 150 consecutive patients who underwent elective gastric cancer surgery at the Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital (Shiga, Japan) from 1997 to 2009; of these, most surgeries (n = 100) were performed 2008 onwards. The patient characteristics and surgery-related factors between two groups (with and without infection) were compared by the paired t-test and χ2 test, including preoperative ADN levels, postoperative day 1 ADN levels, and ADN ratio (postoperative ADN levels/preoperative ADN levels) as baseline factors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to access the independent association between ADN ratio and postoperative infection. Finally, receiver operating curves (ROCs) were constructed to examine its clinical utility. Results Sixty patients (40%) experienced postoperative infections. The baseline values of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, total operating time, blood loss, surgical procedure, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, preoperative ADN levels, and ADN ratio were significantly different between groups. Logistic regression analysis using these factors indicated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and ADN ratio were significantly independent variables (*p<0.05, ** p<0.01, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that the useful cutoff values (sensitivity/specificity) for preoperative ADN levels, ADN ratio, blood loss, operating time, and CRP levels were 8.81(0.567/0.568), 0.76 (0.767/0.761), 405 g (0.717/0.693), 342 min (0.617/0.614), and 8.94 mg/dl (0.583/0.591), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2072321831,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is up-regulated in lung cancer, involves the activation of mitogenic signals and triggers multiple signaling cascades. To dissect these EGFR cascades, we used 14 different phospho-EGFR antibodies to quantify protein phosphorylation using an in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Phosphorylation at EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 was EGF-dependent in the wild-type (WT) receptor but EGF-independent in a cell line carrying the EGFR-L858R mutation. Using a ProtoAarray™ containing ∼5000 recombinant proteins on the protein chip, we found that AURKA interacted with the EGFR-L861Q mutant. Moreover, overexpression of EGFR could form a complex with AURKA, and the inhibitors of AURKA and EGFR decreased EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical staining of stage I lung adenocarcinoma tissues demonstrated a positive correlation between AURKA expression and phosphorylation of EGFR at Thr654 and Ser1046 in EGFR-mutant specimens, but not in EGFR-WT specimens. The interplay between EGFR and AURKA provides an explanation for the difference in EGF dependency between EGFR-WT and EGFR-mutant cells and may provide a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer patients carrying EGFR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2098801447,"Phosphate is required for many important cellular processes and having too little phosphate or too much can cause disease and reduce life span in humans. However, the mechanisms underlying homeostatic control of extracellular phosphate levels and cellular effects of phosphate are poorly understood. Here, we establish Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the study of phosphate effects. We found that Drosophila larval development depends on the availability of phosphate in the medium. Conversely, life span is reduced when adult flies are cultured on high phosphate medium or when hemolymph phosphate is increased in flies with impaired Malpighian tubules. In addition, RNAi-mediated inhibition of MAPK-signaling by knockdown of Ras85D, phl/D-Raf or Dsor1/MEK affects larval development, adult life span and hemolymph phosphate, suggesting that some in vivo effects involve activation of this signaling pathway by phosphate. To identify novel genetic determinants of phosphate responses, we used Drosophila hemocyte-like cultured cells (S2R+) to perform a genome-wide RNAi screen using MAPK activation as the readout. We identified a number of candidate genes potentially important for the cellular response to phosphate. Evaluation of 51 genes in live flies revealed some that affect larval development, adult life span and hemolymph phosphate levels."
https://openalex.org/W2009003035,"Background In the wake of a national economic downturn, the state of California, in 2009–2010, implemented budget cuts that eliminated state funding of HIV prevention and testing. To mitigate the effect of these cuts remaining federal funds were redirected. This analysis estimates the impact of these budget cuts and reallocation of resources on HIV transmission and associated HIV treatment costs. Methods and Findings We estimated the effect of the budget cuts and reallocation for California county health departments (excluding Los Angeles and San Francisco) on the number of individuals living with or at-risk for HIV who received HIV prevention services. We used a Bernoulli model to estimate the number of new infections that would occur each year as a result of the changes, and assigned lifetime treatment costs to those new infections. We explored the effect of redirecting federal funds to more cost-effective programs, as well as the potential effect of allocating funds proportionately by transmission category. We estimated that cutting HIV prevention resulted in 55 new infections that were associated with $20 million in lifetime treatment costs. The redirection of federal funds to more cost-effective programs averted 15 HIV infections. If HIV prevention funding were allocated proportionately to transmission categories, we estimated that HIV infections could be reduced below the number that occurred annually before the state budget cuts. Conclusions Reducing funding for HIV prevention may result in short-term savings at the expense of additional HIV infections and increased HIV treatment costs. Existing HIV prevention funds would likely have a greater impact on the epidemic if they were allocated to the more cost-effective programs and the populations most likely to acquire and transmit the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2019582655,"Genetic aberrancies within epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway are associated with therapeutic outcomes of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the impact of chemotherapy on EGFR-related genes alterations has not been defined in NSCLC. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Neoadj-Chemo) on EGFR activating mutations and associated EGFR-TKIs resistance-related genes.Matched tumor samples were obtained retrospectively from 66 NSCLC patients (stages IIb-IIIb) corresponding to pre- and post- Neoadj-Chemo. EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and confirmed by Amplification Refractory Mutation System technology (ARMS), KRAS mutations, T790M mutation and c-MET amplification were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), ARMS, and real-time PCR, respectively.Before Neoadj-Chemo, EGFR mutations were identified in 33.3% (22/66) of NSCLC patients. Only 18.2% (12/66) of patients carried EGFR mutations after Neoadj-Chemo (p = 0.013). The median peak value of EGFR 19 exon mutations decreased non-significantly after Neoadj-Chemo. KRAS mutation rate decreased from 4.6% (3/66) to 3.0% (2/66) with Neoadj-Chemo. Although the overall percentage of patients exhibiting c-MET amplifications (6.1% [4/66]) did not change with Neoadj-Chemo, two patients transitioned from negative to positive c-MET amplification, and two patients reversed these changes post-Neoadj-Chemo. T790M mutations were absent from all samples.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy tends to decrease the mutation frequency of EGFR mutation and downstream genes, which suggests that real-time samples analysis for genetic aberrancies within EGFR pathways have important value to delineate specific patient populations and facilitate individualized treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2148874491,"Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria survive exposure to extreme acid (pH 2 or lower) in gastric fluid. Aerated cultures survive via regulons expressing glutamate decarboxylase (Gad, activated by RpoS), cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (Cfa) and others. But extreme-acid survival is rarely tested under low oxygen, a condition found in the stomach and the intestinal tract. We observed survival of E. coli K-12 W3110 at pH 1.2–pH 2.0, conducting all manipulations (overnight culture at pH 5.5, extreme-acid exposure, dilution and plating) in a glove box excluding oxygen (10% H2, 5% CO2, balance N2). With dissolved O2 concentrations maintained below 6 µM, survival at pH 2 required Cfa but did not require GadC, RpoS, or hydrogenases. Extreme-acid survival in broth (containing tryptone and yeast extract) was diminished in media that had been autoclaved compared to media that had been filtered. The effect of autoclaved media on extreme-acid survival was most pronounced when oxygen was excluded. Exposure to H2O2 during extreme-acid treatment increased the death rate slightly for W3110 and to a greater extent for the rpoS deletion strain. Survival at pH 2 was increased in strains lacking the anaerobic regulator fnr. During anaerobic growth at pH 5.5, strains deleted for fnr showed enhanced transcription of acid-survival genes gadB, cfa, and hdeA, as well as catalase (katE). We show that E. coli cultured under oxygen exclusion (<6 µM O2) requires mechanisms different from those of aerated cultures. Extreme acid survival is more sensitive to autoclave products under oxygen exclusion."

We aimed to make a new and more accurate prognostic model taking into account the course of disease after TACE. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a prospective cohort study involving 100 HCC patients who underwent TACE at Kobe University Hospital. Indirect calorimetry and blood biochemical examinations were performed before and 7 days after TACE. Time-dependent and time-fixed factors associated with 1-year mortality after TACE were assessed by multivariate analyses. A predictive model of 1-year mortality was established by the combination of odds ratios of these factors. Multivariate analyses showed that the ratio of non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) (7 days after/before TACE) and Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score were independent factors of 1-year mortality after TACE (p = 0.014 and 0.013, respectively). Patient-specific 1-year mortality risk scores can be calculated by summarizing the individual risk scores and looking up the patient-specific risk on the graph. Conclusions The short-term reduction of npRQ was a time-dependent prognostic factor associated with overall survival in HCC patients undergoing TACE. CLIP score was a time-fixed prognostic factor associated with overall survival. Using the prediction model, which consists of the combination of time-dependent (npRQ ratio) and time-fixed (CLIP score) prognostic factors, 1-year mortality risk after TACE would be better estimated by taking into account changes during the course of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2086551544,"Protein-protein interfaces hold the key to understanding protein-protein interactions. In this paper we investigated local interaction network patterns beyond pair-wise contact sites by considering interfaces as contact networks among residues. A contact site was defined as any residue on the surface of one protein which was in contact with a residue on the surface of another protein. We labeled the sub-graphs of these contact networks by their amino acid types. The observed distributions of these labeled sub-graphs were compared with the corresponding background distributions and the results suggested that there were preferred chemical patterns of closely packed residues at the interface. These preferred patterns point to biological constraints on physical proximity between those residues on one protein which were involved in binding to residues which were close on the interacting partner. Interaction interfaces were far from random and contain information beyond pairs and triangles. To illustrate the possible application of the local network patterns observed, we introduced a signature method, called iScore, based on these local patterns to assess interface predictions. On our data sets iScore achieved 83.6% specificity with 82% sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2144881986,"In the current study, we used a canine model of radiation-induced lung injury to test the effect of a single i.v. infusion of 10×106/kg of marrow fibroblasts on the progression of damage following 15 Gy exposure to the right lung. The fibroblasts, designated DS1 cells, are a cloned population of immortalized cells isolated from a primary culture of marrow stromal cells. DS1 cells were infused at week 5 post-irradiation when lung damage was evident by imaging with high-resolution computed tomography (CT). At 13 weeks post-irradiation we found that 4 out of 5 dogs receiving DS1 cells had significantly improved pulmonary function compared to 0 out of 5 control dogs (p = 0.047, Fisher’s Exact). Pulmonary function was measured as the single breath diffusion capacity-hematocrit (DLCO-Hct), the total inspiratory capacity (IC), and the total lung capacity (TLC), which differed significantly between control and DS1-treated dogs; p = 0.002, p = 0.005, and p = 0.004, respectively. The DS1-treated dogs also had less pneumonitis detected by CT imaging and an increased number of TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1, NKX2-1) positive cells in the bronchioli and alveoli compared to control dogs. Endothelial-like progenitor cells (ELC) of host origin, detected by colony assays, were found in peripheral blood after DS1 cell infusion. ELC numbers peaked one day after infusion, and were not detectable by 7 days. These data suggest that infusion of marrow fibroblasts stimulates mobilization of ELC, which is associated with a reduction in otherwise progressive radiation-induced lung injury. We hypothesize that these two observations are related, specifically that circulating ELC contribute to increased angiogenesis, which facilitates endogenous lung repair."
