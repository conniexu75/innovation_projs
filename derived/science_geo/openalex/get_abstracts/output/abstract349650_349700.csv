https://openalex.org/W2419948740,"THE absorption curves of crystals of sodium and A potassium chloride coloured by X-rays obtained by Molnar1 have shown a rise in absorption towards the ultra-violet edge (2,300 A.) of his spectral range. We have made measurements of this V-band2 extending down to 2,000 A. which have established that it is an essential feature of all photochemically coloured alkali halide crystals wholly complementary to the V-band in the visible spectrum. The V-band in the chlorides follows very closely the theoretical absorption curve of a single classical oscillator (Fig. 1). In potassium bromide it has two components, the relative intensity of which depends on the intensity of coloration (Fig. 2)."

Observations of radio-frequency radiation at a wave-length of 60 cm. were made at three sites to determine tme distribution of radio brightness over the solar/fisk and also to investigate possible polarization Effects associated with solar magnetic fields. Previous work1,2,3 at decimetre wave-lengths has suggested that the radiation may be divided into : (a) a thermal component from the 'quiet' sun, and (6) a component which is correlated with sunspot area. Theoretical considerations4, based on the probable existence of temperatures around 10 6 °K. in the corona, suggest that the first component should show 'limb-brightening' at these wave-lengths. A solar eclipse provides an opportunity of testing this prediction. It has been suggested4 also that a general magnetic field on the sun should produce an inequality in the circularly polarized thermal components of the radiation from each hemisphere. The circumstances of this eclipse were such that one hemisphere only was visible at the maximum phase, and this favoured the detection of such an effect."

https://openalex.org/W2069523227,"IN order to estimate the lysine content of wool, using partition chromatography on silica gel1, a sample of ethanol- and ether-extracted wool (Lincoln Hogg, tips removed) was hydrolysed at the boil with 5·l7 N hydrochloric acid for twenty-four hours. An aliquot was then treated with 1-fluoro-2: 4-dinitrobenzene and an unsuccessful attempt made to separate the di-2: 4 dinitrophenyllysine from the other amino-acid derivatives by means of suitable solvents2, owing to considerable overlapping of the various 2: 4-dinitrophenyl amino-acids. However, making use of Porter and Sanger's copper complex technique for the preparation of ε N-2: 4-dinitrophenyllysine3, a relatively simple method for the quantitative estimation of lysine was developed, using a hydrolysate solution containing the equivalent of 5–10 mgm. of the original wool."

https://openalex.org/W2003842464,"IT is well known that the phase-contrast microscope cannot give a faithful representation of optical path-differences as variations of intensity in the image when the detail considered is coarse. This is because light is diffracted by coarse detail through only small angles, and hence the necessary separation of direct and diffracted beams cannot be complete. The edges of large details are therefore emphasized, giving a characteristic appearance to phase-contrast images."

The article included a brief description of the EDSAC (electronic delay storage automatic calculator)1,2, the large electronic calcuring machine which has been built in the Laboratory, and its relationship to the various similar machines now under construction in England and the United States. It is intended to give here some further information about the EDSAC."

https://openalex.org/W1982101965,"IT was first shown by Ziegler and co-workers1 that N-bromosuccinimide (XNBr) reacts with cyclohexene to give 3-bromocyclohexene (I) and succinimide. We have found that if the reaction is carried out in chloroform, benzene or petrol solution in the presence of salts such as tetraethylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium iodide, or triethylamine hydrobromide, 1: 2-dibromocyclohexane (II) is formed instead of 3-bromocycloohexene, in proportions depending on the exact conditions employed. The same effect can be brought about by the addition of small amounts (c. 10 mol. per cent based on N-bromosuccinimide) of triethylamine, which reacts with part of the N-bromosuccinimide to give triethylamine hydrobromide and succinimide."

https://openalex.org/W2034785124,"DAY1,2,3 has recently concluded that the cementing substance (the so-called amorphous ground substance) of the interstitial connective tissue is protein and not mucoid. We have now obtained some evidence in support of this conclusion by histological examination of this tissue from the deep fascia of the rat. Squares of tissue were attached at the four corners to micro-slides by means of collodion3. Some of the slides were immersed for several days in physiologically isotonic saline, some in 60 per cent ethyl alcohol and some in a saturated mercuric chloride solution. In order to try to ensure that a negative staining result would not be obtained merely because any mucoid present had been dissolved out, some of the slides, after the alcohol and saline treatments, were fixed in 10 per cent formalin for ten minutes, some by exposure to formalin vapour4, and some were stained without further fixation. The tissue was then stained by toluidine blue5, by McManus's method of periodic acid followed by Schiff's reagent6,7 or by Hale's method of dialysed iron followed by potassium ferrocyanide8. Some of the alcohol preparations were also impregnated with silver by Foot's method9."

https://openalex.org/W2023730893,"THE Symbols Committee of the Royal Society has met as intervals during recent years to consider various matters brought to its attention, including not only questions of symbols in physics and chemistry, but also to some extent of units and of technology. These subjects have also been discussed recent meetings of the International Unions of Chemistry and of Physics, and of the Conference of Weights and Measures (see Nature, March 19, 1949, p. 427), and it would scarcely be possible to consider those activities separately. It is thought that readers of Nature may find it useful to have a brief account of these important, though perhaps not very exciting, matters, and the task has been remitted to me. Though I think there is general agreement on the part of the Committee, I must take all responsibility for the views expressed here."

https://openalex.org/W2015817816,"IT is well known that wool fibres and human hair can be stretched 30 per cent in water at low temperatures (22° C.) without significant alteration of their elastic properties, provided that extension is carried out rapidly and release is immediate1. The released fibre returns exactly to its original length, and if it is allowed to stand in cold water for twenty-four hours before being re-stretched, the second -load-extension curve is almost identical with the first: the reduction in work for 30 per cent extension is only about 3 per cent in the case of human hair. If, however, the fibre is stretched rapidly and then held at 30 per cent extension for twenty-four hours at 22° C. before release, the reduction in work, again after twenty-four hours rest in water, is 45·5 per cent2."
https://openalex.org/W2042804641,"IN a letter in Nature in 1946 Sir Nelson Johnson1 reported some results of direct measurements of winds at 30 km. by means of observations of shell bursts. Exploration to this height by means of sounding balloons has recently become possible through the development of balloons of large size. Measurements of wind structure are made by radar tracking, and temperature observations are given by radio sonde technique. Seven successful ascents have been made at stations in the south and east of England; five of them were made in midsummer and at night, thus avoiding possible temperature errors due to solar radiation. The other two were day-time ascents in spring, and were confined to wind measurements only. The results of two of the soundings are illustrated in the accompanying diagram."
https://openalex.org/W2070110463,"DURING July 14–16 the physical Society held its summer meeting at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. on the subject of “The Ionosphere and the Propagation of Radio Waves”. The purpose of the conference was to survey research work in progress and particularly to relate the knowledge acquired by the academic workers to that obtained by the practical users. There were five sessions devoted to different aspects of the subject."
https://openalex.org/W2098273141,"AMONG the many problems aggravated by human aggravated by human gregariousness, none is more pressing than that of the supply of water. Life, whether bodily, domestic or industries, is impossible without a continuous and reliable source of water. Early settlers were, for the moel part, influenced in their choice of sites by the ready availability of springs, rivers or dipping-wells. But if the settlement flourished the local supplies soon became inadequate in volume and dangerous in quality. Cities became plague-stricken for reasons obvious enough to us, but mysterious and supernatural to their inhabitants."
