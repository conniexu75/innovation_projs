https://openalex.org/W1989480363,"The crystal structure of fresnoite, Ba(2)(TiO)[Si(2)O(7)], consists of [Si(2)O(7)](6-) double groups and titanium-centered square pyramids linked to form flat sheets. Intercalated between these sheets are Ba(2+) ions in highly distorted pentagonal antiprisms. The structure of fresnoite is related to that of melilite, (Ca,Na)(2)(Mg,Al[Si(2)(7)]."
https://openalex.org/W1993101354,An investigation of the relationship of morning emergence and body temperature in Phrynosoma demonstrated a rhythmic anticipation of conditions favorable for normal activity. Such a rhythm offers a mechanism by which ectothermic reptiles can use safe nocturnal shelters without loss of activity time in the morning.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that the facilitation results from diffusion of carbon monoxide- hemoglobin as well as carbon monoxide, but that the overall process is partially limited by the reaction rates of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1991730762,"Fatty acids in pollen of five coniferous species were isolated and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. It was found that 0.76 to 0.89 percent of the dry weight of pollen was fatty acid in three species of Pseudotsuga and 1.25 to 1.33 percent in two species of Pinus. Major components in Pseudotsuga were oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids, whereas in Pinus they were linolenic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2002633508,"Wood cut by Castor canadensis(?) has been found at or near the base of five peat deposits studied in open exposure. Beavers apparently entered the region about 12,000 years ago and rapidly occupied most low-lying places. Many existing bogs may be the result of early dams. The disturbance of pond sediments by beavers probably affects pollen stratigraphy. Charred wood in early beaver structures indicates forest fires and the possibility that the climate was drier than it is today."
https://openalex.org/W2080337503,"High-temperature (about 2800 degrees C) vapor fractionation of a silicate glass that originally contained 82 percent by weight of SiO(2) resulted in a decrease of the silica content to 45 percent. Oxygen isotope analyses show that the O(18)/O(16) ratio increased from 13.80 per mil in the starting material to 14.47 and 15.03 per mil in the residuum. This suggests that bediasites, which also exhibit an increase in this ratio with decreasing content of silica, have been subjected to a process of vapor fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W1974387412,A sound produced by the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) under conditions of fright is described and illustrated. It is suggested that a similar sound may be the basis of the long-distance alarm signal reported in other cetaceans.
https://openalex.org/W1999048509,"A highly fossiliferous sample dredged in September 1961 from a submerged terrace at a depth of 500 to 520 meters off Honolulu contains a reef fauna suggesting deposition at depths of 10 meters or less. The corals and pelagic foraminifers indicate a probable Miocene age. The Hawaiian rise was in existence prior to that time, and the submarine terrace and associated reef were subsequently submerged to their present position."
https://openalex.org/W2054235330,"Neurocrine activity has been demonstrated for the first time in the Ophiuroidea and for only the second time in the phylum Echinodermata. Three types of neurosecretory cells have been shown, by means of histological staining techniques, to occur in the principal motor ganglia. The secretory products are carried away from the cell bodies by axon transport but cannot be traced to special terminal reservoirs. It is possible that the neurosecretory products diffuse into adjacent coelomic spaces for further transport. It is suggested that in the echinoderms neurocrine secretions may be associated with control functions which in other phyla are regulated by. endocrine products."
https://openalex.org/W2088380823,"Several technologies to convert coal to liquid and gaseous fuels are being developed in the United States, some with support from the Department of Energy. Substitution of these technologies for those currently being used will produce different health and environmental hazards. In this article, selected health and environmental effects of four coal conversion and four existing technologies are compared. For each technology, the emission estimates for complete fuel cycles, including all steps in fuel use from extraction to the end use of space and water heating by electricity or direct combustion, were prepared by means of the Brookhaven Energy System Network Simulator model. Quantitative occupational health and safety estimates are presented for the extraction, transportation, distribution, processing, and conversion activities associated with each technology; also included are some public health damage estimates arising from fuel transportation and air pollution impacts. Qualitative estimates of health damage due to polycyclic organic matter and reduced sulfur are discussed. In general, energy inefficiencies, environmental residuals, and hence implied environmental effects and health damage increase in the order: (i) direct combustion of natural gas and oil, (ii) direct combustion of synthetic gas and oil, (iii) central-station electric power produced from synthetic gas, (iv) central-station electric power produced from coal, and (v) central-station electric power produced by the combustion of synthetic liquid fuels. The compliance and conflict of these technologies with the amendments of the Clean Air Act and other legislation are discussed."

The performance of the two groups was essentially the same. No significant facilitation or decrement in performance was noted, and in no instance were hallucinations, delusions, or other unusual phenomena reported."
https://openalex.org/W2020046297,"The C(13):C(12) ratios of the carbonate comprising ""normal,"" ""faunal,"" and ""mixed"" coal balls are consistent with the hypothesis that calcareous coal balls contain varying proportions of two kinds of carbonate: (i) precipitated carbonate formed in the coal swamp and characteristically deficient in C(13), and (ii) extraneous detrital material, mainly fossil fragments relatively enriched in C(13)."
https://openalex.org/W2022641275,"Pectin decreases the heat coagulation of many proteins, including the soluble proteins of pea stems, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin. This observation probably explains the decrease in heat coagulation of proteins from pea stems following in vivo auxin administration, since auxin causes a great increase in the soluble pectin content of treated cells."

https://openalex.org/W2042449587,"Ice crystals in the form of right hexagonal prisms have faces that form 90° prisms. Light rays were traced through these prism faces by computer calculation, and the light patterns that would be produced in the sky for a particular distribution of crystal orientations were simulated. Crystals with random orientations produce a 46° halo. Hexagonal plate crystals with nearly horizontal end faces produce circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs. Hexagonal column crystals with horizontal axes produce supralateral and infralateral arcs. Plate crystals spinning about a horizontal axis that is a face diagonal of the crystal produce a series of arcs touching the 46° halo. Each of these effects was simulated for several elevations of the sun."
https://openalex.org/W1986103828,Large amounts of iodide are accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract of tadpoles despite the presence of ligatures on the bile duct or esophagus or on both structures. These ligatures exclude the possibility that the iodine-131 tracer reaches the gastrointestinal tract by way of the bile or esophagus. The iodide in the gastrointestinal tract localizes largely in the stomach. The stomach therefore acts as an iodide pump and may be responsible for the maintenance of the iodide levels that are needed in metamorphosis.

https://openalex.org/W1990780873,"Thermoinduction for 1 week, followed by 48 hours of vitamin treatment of seeds, resulted in complete annihilation of the cold effect, the plants from the treated seeds having shown a significant increase in elongation of the root and shoot and an increase in the fresh weight as well as in the dry matter over vernalized and unvernalized controls. An increase in vegetative vigor was also noted after treatment with vitamins at lower concentrations in the unvernalized series. Cold treatment not combined with vitamin treatment resulted in a decrease in vegetative vigor."

So far as is known, they do not. They do contain nitrates and nitrites, the precursors of nitrosamines."
