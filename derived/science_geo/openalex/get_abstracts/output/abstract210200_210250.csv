https://openalex.org/W1980698238,"THE induction of squamous carcinoma of the stomach and, of the oesophagus in the rat by N-nitroso-N-methyl-urethane (NMU)1 and by some other nitrosamines2 has been reported. Squamous tumours of the stomach have been known to develop following treatment with various other carcinogens; but very few instances have been reported of the induction of tumours of the glandular part of the stomach in rodents. Such tumours have usually been produced by direct intramural injection of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons3. One adenocarcinoma resulted after administration of 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide through a stomach fistula to 16 rats which had in addition percutaneous applications of 20-methylcholanthrene4. Recently, Stewart et al.5 induced adenocarcinomata of the glandular stomach in four out of 47 rats, given 2,7-bis(acetamido)fluorene in diet."

Owing to the antigenicity of animal material and the restricted supply of human factor2, other sources of this labile factor have been sought. Plasma, kept frozen after being separated from fresh blood, is now being widely utilized in the management of haemophilia. This raises for consideration the effect of different methods of freezing on factor VIII and other blood-clotting factors."

Samples (50 µl.) of the semen, used within 6 h of collection, were mixed with 50 µl. of a solution containing 0.1 mM adenosine triphosphate, 2 mM magnesium sulphate, 10 mM potassium chloride and 1µc. of the labelled substrate dissolved in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH. 7.4. The mixtures were incubated aerobically at 37° C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period the enzyme systems were inactivated by the addition of 400 µl. of boiling ethanol and the mixtures centrifuged at 500g. The radioactive substances present in the supernatants were separated by two-dimensional paper chromatography, visualized by autoradiography and the carbon-14 measured by the techniques described by Smith and Moses1."
