https://openalex.org/W2034385545,"Ceramide is an important lipid signaling molecule and a key intermediate in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Recent studies have implied a previously unappreciated role for the ceramide N-acyl chain length, inasmuch as ceramides containing specific fatty acids appear to play defined roles in cell physiology. The discovery of a family of mammalian ceramide synthases (CerS), each of which utilizes a restricted subset of acyl-CoAs for ceramide synthesis, strengthens this notion. We now report the characterization of mammalian CerS2. qPCR analysis reveals that CerS2 mRNA is found at the highest level of all CerS and has the broadest tissue distribution. CerS2 has a remarkable acyl-CoA specificity, showing no activity using C16:0-CoA and very low activity using C18:0, rather utilizing longer acyl-chain CoAs (C20–C26) for ceramide synthesis. There is a good correlation between CerS2 mRNA levels and levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin containing long acyl chains, at least in tissues where CerS2 mRNA is expressed at high levels. Interestingly, the activity of CerS2 can be regulated by another bioactive sphingolipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), via interaction of S1P with two residues that are part of an S1P receptor-like motif found only in CerS2. These findings provide insight into the biochemical basis for the ceramide N-acyl chain composition of cells, and also reveal a novel and potentially important interplay between two bioactive sphingolipids that could be relevant to the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and the opposing functions that these lipids play in signaling pathways."

The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of cisplatin in cancers and side effects in normal tissues are largely unclear. Recent work has suggested a role for p53 in cisplatin-induced renal cell apoptosis and kidney injury; however, the signaling pathway leading to p53 activation and renal apoptosis is unknown. Here we demonstrate an early DNA damage response during cisplatin treatment of renal cells and tissues. Importantly, in the DNA damage response, we demonstrate a critical role for ATR, but not ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), in cisplatin-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. We show that ATR is specifically activated during cisplatin treatment and co-localizes with H2AX, forming nuclear foci at the site of DNA damage. Blockade of ATR with a dominant-negative mutant inhibits cisplatin-induced p53 activation and renal cell apoptosis. Consistently, cisplatin-induced p53 activation and apoptosis are suppressed in ATR-deficient fibroblasts. Downstream of ATR, both Chk1 and Chk2 are phosphorylated during cisplatin treatment in an ATR-dependent manner. Interestingly, following phosphorylation, Chk1 is degraded via the proteosomal pathway, whereas Chk2 is activated. Inhibition of Chk2 by a dominant-negative mutant or gene deficiency attenuates cisplatin-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. In vivo in C57BL/6 mice, ATR and Chk2 are activated in renal tissues following cisplatin treatment. Together, the results suggest an important role for the DNA damage response mediated by ATR-Chk2 in p53 activation and renal cell apoptosis during cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

Cisplatin is a highly effective antineoplastic agent that has been widely used for cancer therapy (1Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). However, the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin is limited by its toxicity to normal tissues, notably the kidneys (3Arany I. Safirstein R.L. Semin.

As a result, effective interventions for renoprotection during cisplatin chemotherapy are currently lacking. Recent work has suggested a role for p53 signaling in renal cell apoptosis and cisplatin nephrotoxicity (10Cummings B.S. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du Q. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic as well as genetic blockade of p53 ameliorates cisplatin-induced renal cell apoptosis in vitro and nephrotoxicity in vivo (15Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Wei Q. Dong G. Yang T. Megyesi J. Price P.M. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: F1282-F1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the upstream signaling pathway(s) that leads to p53 activation under this pathological condition remains elusive. A plausible mechanism of p53 activation during cisplatin nephrotoxicity is DNA damage (1Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). It is known that cisplatin forms covalent bonds with the purine bases in the DNA, primarily resulting in 1,2- or 1,3-intrastrand cross-linking (2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 19Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Cross-linking by cisplatin blocks DNA replication and gene transcription and might further result in double strand breaks (2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 19Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52084-52092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The consequent genotoxic stress triggers the activation of a signaling cascade, which may lead to p53 phosphorylation and activation. The major molecular sensors of DNA damage include ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) (21Yang J. Yu Y. Hamrick H.E. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Roos W.P. Kaina B. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 440-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage or genotoxic stress, these protein kinases are recruited to the site of DNA damage, forming nuclear “foci” (22Roos W.P. Kaina B. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 440-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 23Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 24Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). This is followed by recruitment and activation of other signaling molecules, including Chk1 and Chk2, inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (22Roos W.P. Kaina B. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 440-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 25Norbury C.J. Zhivotovsky B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2797-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Importantly, these protein kinases can phosphorylate and activate p53 (22Roos W.P. Kaina B. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 440-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 25Norbury C.J. Zhivotovsky B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2797-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Despite the general understanding of DNA damage response, it is not entirely clear how the initial DNA lesion induced by cisplatin is detected and leads to p53 activation and cell death (1Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 2Wang D. Lippard S.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). In the case of cisplatin nephrotoxicity, whether a DNA damage response is triggered and how it is involved in p53 activation and subsequent renal cell apoptosis are completely unknown (4Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Investigation of the signaling cascades activated by cisplatin in various cell types would advance our understanding of cisplatin toxicity in normal nonmalignant as well as cancerous tissues. In the current study, we show that ATR, but not ATM or DNA-PK, is activated during cisplatin treatment of renal cells and tissues. ATR further activates Chk2 to induce p53 activation and apoptosis. These results suggest an important role for the ATR-Chk2 signaling axis in p53 activation and renal cell apoptosis during cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

Recombinant p53 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Carbobenzoxy-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin and 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin for caspase assay were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Cisplatin treatment of cultured cells was conducted as described earlier (15Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J.

Cisplatin was used at 20 μm for RPTC cells, 40 μm for HEK cells, 100 μm for normal and ATR-deficient fibroblasts, and 50 μm for HCT116 cells. After cisplatin treatment, cells were morphologically analyzed or harvested to collect cell lysates for various biochemical analyses. For in vivo study, male C57BL/6 mice of 8 weeks purchased from Jackson Laboratory were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 30 mg/kg cisplatin to induce kidney injury as previously (30Jiang M.

All animal work was performed in accordance with the animal use protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and User Committee of the Medical College of Georgia and Veterans Affairs Medical Center at Augusta. Dominant negative ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 containing active site mutations (kinase-dead) were described previously (28Wang J. Wiltshire T. Wang Y. Mikell C. Burks J. Cunningham C. Van Laar E.S.

RPTC and HEK cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). RPTC cells had relatively low (∼20-30%) transfection efficiency. To identify the transfected cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was co-transfected with the target gene at a ratio of 1:5. The subsequent examination was focused on the GFP-labeled (transfected) cells. HEK cells showed a high (over 80%) transfection efficiency; thus, they were used for biochemical and whole cell population analyses to determine the effects of transfected genes. As a control, empty vectors were used for transfection. Renal tissues and cells were lysed with the immunoprecipitation lysis buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (36Wang J. Pabla N. Wang C.Y. Wang W. Schoenlein P.V. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1300-F1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, or Chk2. The resultant immunoprecipitates were added to a protein kinase reaction containing 20 μm ATP and 12.5 ng/μl recombinant p53 as the phosphorylation substrate. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, 2% SDS was added to terminate the reaction. The reaction samples were then subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis to detect the levels of p53 phosphorylation to indicate the protein kinase activity of various protein kinases immunoprecipitated from the cells and tissues. Cells were lysed with the immunoprecipitation lysis buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors and then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (36Wang J. Pabla N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19948-19954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS buffer for gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies against various proteins. Protein concentration in various cell lysates was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce. Equal amounts (usually 10 μg) of protein were loaded in each lane for electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were then incubated in a blocking buffer and then exposed to the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antigens on the blots were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. RPTC cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips. After cisplatin treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% milk, and 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were subsequently exposed with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-phosphorylated H2AX and goat anti-ATR), followed by incubation with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-rabbit and Cy3-labeled donkey-anti-goat secondary antibodies. After three washes, signals were examined by confocal microscopy using Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate channels. Morphological Examination—For morphological examination, untreated or treated cells were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 2-5 min. Phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy were then used to examine the cellular and nuclear morphology. Cells undergoing apoptosis showed cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Four fields with ∼200 cells/field were checked in each group to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. Caspase Assay—A caspase assay was used as a biochemical marker of apoptosis as described previously (29Jiang M. Pabla N. Murphy R.F. Yang T. Yin X.M. Degenhardt K. White E. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular extracts by 1% Triton X-100 were added to an enzymatic reaction with 50 μm carbobenzoxy-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, a fluorogenic peptide substrate of caspases. After 1 h of reaction at 37 °C, fluorescence was measured at excitation 360 nm/emission 530 nm. A nanomolar amount of liberated 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin indicates the caspase activity in the given sample. Annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate/Propidium Iodide Staining—Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining was performed using a kit from BD Pharmingen as described recently (29Jiang M. Pabla N. Murphy R.F. Yang T. Yin X.M. Degenhardt K. White E. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK cells were detached by trypsinization and harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were then resuspended in binding buffer at a density of 1-2 × 106 cells/ml. The single cell suspension of 100 μl (1-2 × 105 cells) was incubated with 5 μl of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 5 μl of propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the mixture was diluted with 400 μl of binding buffer and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For each sample, total of 10,000 events were counted. Cytosolic and membrane-bound organellar fractions were separated by using digitonin, which at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane without solubilizing intracellular organelles, including mitochondria (18Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du Q. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 37Wang J. Wei Q. Wang C.Y. Hill W.D. Hess D.C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19948-19954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.05% digitonin in an isotonic buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.1)) for 2 min at room temperature. The soluble extract was collected as a cytosolic fraction and used for analysis of cytochrome c release by immunoblot analysis. Data were expressed as means ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The statistical differences between two groups studied were determined by t test. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant differences. Activation of ATR, but Not ATM or DNA-PK, during Cisplatin Treatment of Renal Tubular Cells—Our previous work has established an in vitro model of cisplatin nephrotoxicity using cultured RPTC cells (15Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this model, 20 μm cisplatin induces 50-60% apoptosis in 16 h. Notably, p53 is activated early (2-4 h) following cisplatin treatment, and its level increases thereafter. To examine the DNA damage-responsive protein kinases, we collected cell lysate after 0-8 h of cisplatin treatment and then immunoprecipitated ATM, DNA-PK, and ATR. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant p53 as substrate. Protein kinase activity was indicated by p53 phosphorylation in the assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, the kinase activity of ATM (shown as phosphorylated p53 (P-p53)) was markedly reduced after 2-4 h of cisplatin treatment and became undetectable at 8 h. Similarly, DNA-PK activity was decreased in cisplatin-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our recent work (36Wang J. Pabla N. Wang C.Y. Wang W. Schoenlein P.V. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1300-F1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), total protein levels of ATM and DNA-PK did not change significantly during 0-8 h of cisplatin incubation (Fig. 1, A and B). The results suggest that the observed decreases of ATM and DNA-PK activity during cisplatin treatment were due to inactivation of these two protein kinases. In contrast, we detected a progressive increase of ATR kinase activity during cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1C), whereas total ATR expression remained constant. Semiquantification by densitometry of the blots is shown in Fig. 1D. Clearly, ATM and DNA-PK are inactivated, whereas ATR is activated during cisplatin treatment of RPTC cells (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the activation status of ATM, we treated RPTC cells with either cisplatin or etoposide and analyzed ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981 (38Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, cisplatin did not induce significant ATM phosphorylation, whereas etoposide did in the same experiment. To gain insights into ATR activation during cisplatin treatment, we analyzed the formation of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) protein complex, which has been implicated in ATR activation during genotoxic stress (23Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 24Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). ATR was immunoprecipitated from untreated and cisplatin-treated RPTC cells. The resultant immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for the presence of various proteins. As shown in Fig. 1F, cisplatin treatment induced co-immunoprecipitation of ATR with all three 9-1-1 proteins. In addition, RPA70 and Rad17 were also detected in this protein complex (Fig. 1F). In contrast, ATM did not form complexes with these proteins during cisplatin treatment (not shown). Together, the results suggest a specific activation of ATR during cisplatin treatment of renal tubular cells. Accumulation of ATR to Nuclear Foci during Cisplatin Treatment—A critical indication of ATR activation during genotoxic stress is the accumulation of ATR to nuclear foci, where signaling proteins accumulate and interact in response to DNA damage (23Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 24Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). To examine the changes of ATR localization, we conducted immunofluorescence. In untreated control RPTC cells, ATR showed a fine staining in the nucleus (Fig. 2A, Untreated cells). After cisplatin treatment, ATR staining became coarse and punctate, showing the typical appearance of nuclear foci (Fig. 2A, Cisplatin treated cells). Importantly, at the nuclear foci, ATR co-localized with phosphorylated H2AX (Fig. 2A, p-H2AX), a known DNA damage response protein and phosphorylation target of ATR. The accumulation of ATR and phosphorylated H2AX to nuclear foci was detected at 2 h of cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2A) and increased thereafter (not shown). By immunoblot analysis, we further confirmed that H2AX was phosphorylated during cisplatin treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Notably, H2AX phosphorylation was diminished in ATR-deficient cells but not in ATM-deficient cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ATR is the major protein kinase for H2AX phosphorylation at the nuclear foci during cisplatin treatment. Together, these results provide further evidence for an early DNA damage response and ATR activation during cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Role of ATR in p53 Phosphorylation during Cisplatin Treatment—Cisplatin induces an early p53 activation in renal tubular cells, leading to apoptotic gene expression and apoptosis (15Jiang M. Yi X.

With these observations, we hypothesized that the DNA damage response mediated by ATR might contribute significantly to cisplatin-induced p53 activation in renal tubular cells. To test this possibility, we initially examined the effects of dominant-negative ATR (dn-ATR) on p53 activation. RPTC cells were transiently transfected with dn-ATR or a control empty vector. GFP was co-transfected to identify the transfected cells for further examination. After cisplatin treatment, P-p53 was analyzed by immunofluorescence to reveal p53 activation. In untreated control cells, the signal of P-p53 was minimal (Fig. 3A, Untreated). Following cisplatin treatment, the cells that were transfected with empty vector showed strong P-p53 staining (Fig. 3A, Cisplatin treated, Vector + GFP, arrows), w"

Whether this is mediated by regulating alpha-synuclein expression levels remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed levels of alpha-synuclein in blood and human post mortem brain tissue including the substantia nigra using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in vivo. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs356219, a tagging SNP for a disease-associated haplotype in the 3' region of the SNCA gene, has a significant effect on SNCA mRNA levels in the substantia nigra and the cerebellum. Further, the ""protective"" genotype 259/259 of the PD-associated promoter repeat NACP-Rep1 is associated with lower protein levels in blood than genotypes 261/261, 259/261, and 259/263. In conclusion, we provide evidence that alpha-synuclein levels are influenced by genetic variability in the promoter and 3' region of the SNCA gene in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2105126729,"The sense of taste informs the body about the quality of ingested foods. Tastant-mediated signals are generated by a rise in free intracellular calcium levels ([Ca(2+)]i) in the taste bud cells and then are transferred to the gustatory area of brain via connections between the gustatory nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves) and the nucleus of solitary tract in the brain stem. We have recently shown that lingual CD36 contributes to fat preference and early digestive secretions in the mouse. We show here that 1) the induction of an increase in [Ca(2+)]i by linoleic acid is CD36-dependent in taste receptor cells, 2) the spontaneous preference for or conversely conditioned aversion to linoleic acid requires intact gustatory nerves, and 3) the activation of gustatory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract elicited by a linoleic acid deposition on the tongue in wild-type mice cannot be reproduced in CD36-null animals. We conclude that the CD36-mediated perception of long-chain fatty acids involves the gustatory pathway, suggesting that the mouse may have a ""taste"" for fatty foods. This system would constitute a potential physiological advantage under conditions of food scarcity by leading the mouse to select and absorb fatty foods. However, it might also lead to a risk of obesity and associated diseases in a context of constantly abundant food."
https://openalex.org/W2030808286,"The life cycle of protein kinase C (PKC) is controlled by multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps. The maturation of PKC requires three ordered phosphorylations, one at the activation loop and two at COOH-terminal sites, the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif, to yield a stable and signaling-competent enzyme. Dephosphorylation of the enzyme leads to protein degradation. We have recently discovered a novel family of protein phosphatases named PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) whose members terminate Akt signaling by dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif on Akt. Here we show that the two PHLPP isoforms, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, also dephosphorylate the hydrophobic motif on PKC betaII, an event that shunts PKC to the detergent-insoluble fraction, effectively terminating its life cycle. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that the PH domain is necessary for the effective dephosphorylation of PKC betaII by PHLPP in cells, whereas the PDZ-binding motif, required for Akt regulation, is dispensable. The phorbol ester-mediated dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic site, but not the turn motif or activation loop, is insensitive to okadaic acid, consistent with PHLPP, a PP2C family member, controlling the hydrophobic site. In addition, knockdown of PHLPP expression reduces the rate of phorbol ester-triggered dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif, but not turn motif, of PKC alpha. Last, we show that depletion of PHLPP in colon cancer and normal breast epithelial cells results in an increase in conventional and novel PKC levels. These data reveal that PHLPP controls the cellular levels of PKC by specifically dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif, thus destabilizing the enzyme and promoting its degradation."

EC-SOD has a polycationic matrix-binding domain that binds to polyanionic constituents in the matrix.

Although the mechanism of EC-SOD protection is not fully understood, these studies indicate that EC-SOD plays an important role in regulating inflammatory responses to pulmonary injury. Hyaluronan is a polyanionic high molecular mass polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix that is sensitive to oxidant-mediated fragmentation.

In vitro human polymorphic neutrophil chemotaxis studies indicate that oxidative fragmentation of hyaluronan results in polymorphic neutrophil chemotaxis and that EC-SOD can completely prevent this response. Intratracheal injection of crocidolite asbestos in mice leads to pulmonary inflammation and injury that is enhanced in EC-SOD knock-out mice.

Hyaluronan/hyaluronic acid (HA) 2The abbreviations used are:HAhyaluronanEC-SODextracellular superoxide dismutasePMNhuman polymorphic neutrophilECMextracellular matrixROSreactive oxygen speciesBALFbronchoalveolar lavage fluid. is a negatively charged, high molecular mass polysaccharide found predominantly in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Under physiologic conditions, hyaluronan exists as a high molecular mass polymer in excess of 106 Da. It does not induce inflammatory or proliferative genes as a native high molecular mass polymer. However, recent studies have found that low molecular mass hyaluronan fragments accumulate in tissues after injury (1Hernnas J. Nettelbladt O. Bjermer L. Sarnstrand B. Malmstrom A. Hallgren R. Eur. Respir. J. 1992; 5: 404-410PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hallgren R. Samuelsson T. Laurent T.C. Modig J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 139: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These low molecular mass hyaluronan fragments have been shown to be capable of activating macrophages and inducing the expression of genes whose functions are relevant to chronic inflammation (3McKee C.M. Penno M.B. Cowman M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Bao C. Noble P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan turnover and degradation increase during inflammation, and lower molecular mass species of hyaluronan accumulate. Importantly, this accumulation is detected prior to the influx of inflammatory cells and deposition of collagen, which suggests that low molecular mass hyaluronan accumulation is an early event in the development of inflammatory pulmonary disease (4Nettelbladt O. Bergh J. Schenholm M. Tengblad A. Hallgren R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 139: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of hyaluronan turnover and degradation are still unknown, it is generally accepted that free radicals, especially the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, play an important role in the degradation process of hyaluronan (5Casalino-Matsuda S.M.

Although the mechanisms of asbestos-induced lung injury are not fully understood, numerous studies suggest that reactive oxygen species may contribute to ECM degradation and enhanced inflammation and abnormal repair in asbestos-induced lung injury models (10Fattman C.L.

An important factor in determining the surface and biological reactivity of asbestos fibers is their ability to participate in redox reactions that generate free radicals.

The oxidative stress-related nature of asbestos-associated lung injury makes it a good model to study the possible relationship between free radical-induced hyaluronan degradation and the possible protective effects of antioxidants in vivo. In fact, studies show that asbestos-induced lung injury is associated with excessive ECM turnover, and hyaluronan is one of the ECM components that accumulates in asbestos-induced lung injury (18Bjermer L.

Recent studies suggest that low molecular mass hyaluronan accumulates in sites of injury and induces chemokine gene expression in human alveolar macrophages from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (3McKee C.M.

Failure to remove ECM degradation products from the site of tissue injury results in the host succumbing to persistent inflammation that can progress to fibrosis. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is the predominant extracellular SOD, and it is expressed at especially high levels in mammalian lungs compared with other tissues (20Fattman C.L. Schaefer L.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 236-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This antioxidant scavenges the potentially harmful superoxide free radical, which suggests that it may play an important role in protecting against pulmonary diseases characterized by oxidative stress (13Tan R.J.

Furthermore, EC-SOD knock-out mice show enhanced lung injury and inflammation compared with wild-type mice in both asbestos- and bleomycin-induced lung injuries (10Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A.

Although the mechanisms in which EC-SOD prevents inflammation in response to lung injuries are not clear, its location in the extracellular matrix and ability to bind to negatively charged components in the matrix suggest that one mechanism may be to prevent oxidative modification/degradation of these matrix components. These properties of EC-SOD led to the hypothesis that one mechanism in which EC-SOD may prevent inflammation is by binding to hyaluronan and preventing oxidant-induced formation of proinflammatory low molecular mass hyaluronan fragments. Binding of Mouse EC-SOD to Hyaluronan EAH-Sepharose—Mouse EC-SOD was purified from mouse lungs (Pelfreeze) as described previously (23Fattman C.L. Enghild J.J. Crapo J.D. Schaefer L.M. Valnickova Z.

A 5-ml HA-Sepharose column was prepared by coupling 50 mg of HA (Streptococcus sp., from Sigma) to 6 ml of EAH-Sepharopore™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.12 g of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Pierce) according to the method of Tengblad (24Tengblad A.

Prior to coupling, HA was digested with 33 units of testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 3 h in 50 m l of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 5.8. For chromatography, purified mouse EC-SOD was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and applied to the HA-Sepharose column (5 ml). The column was washed 20 times with 1 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and the flow-through was collected. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (for full-length EC-SOD) or by step elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.1–1 m NaCl for proteolyzed EC-SOD). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteolysis of Mouse EC-SOD—Purified mouse EC-SOD was incubated with trypsin (1:0.3 molar ratio of EC-SOD to active site-titrated trypsin) at 37 °C for 1 has previously described (26Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Trypsin was inhibited with 0.1 mm DCI at 25 °C for 30 min, and the samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes for EC-SOD detection. Protection of ROS-mediated Hyaluronan Degradation by EC-SOD—ROS were generated by the Cu(II)/H2O2 system. This system was chosen because it generates both superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. The reaction mechanism has been described previously (27Kato Y. Kitamoto N. Kawai Y. Osawa T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Zhao F.

The reaction proceeds faster at alkaline pH, but was carried out at pH 7.4 to lower the reaction rate. 20 μg of pure high molecular mass hyaluronan from Streptococcus sp. in the range of 5.0 × 105 to 1.2 × 106 (Calbiochem) was added to 30 μl of 0.1 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 50 μm CuSO4 and human EC-SOD purified from human aorta (26Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or CuZn-SOD (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations. Formation of ROS was initiated by the addition of 100 μm H2O2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose or 7% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were stained in the dark at room temperature overnight with Stains-All dye (1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethylnaphtho[1,2-d]thiazolin-2-ylidene)-2-methylpropenyl]naphtha[1,2-d] thiazolium bromide; Fisher). DNA restriction fragments produced by BstEII digestion ofλ DNA from New England Biolabs Inc. and dual color protein standard (Bio-Rad) were used as size markers. Bromphenol blue (Sigma) was used to track the sample movement. Western Blot Analysis—Western analysis was performed as previously described (22Fattman C.L. Chu C.T. Kulich S.M. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EC-SOD was detected with antibody (1:10,000 dilution) against mouse EC-SOD as previously described (11Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol.

Neutrophil Chemotaxis Assay—A neutrophil chemotaxis assay using a modified Boyden chamber was used to evaluate the migration of purified human primary neutrophils (PMNs) across a transwell membrane in response to hyaluronan treated with ROS in the absence or presence of EC-SOD. Human PMNs were isolated as previously described from 50 ml of blood drawn from volunteers, as approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh (29Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Randoux A. Dufer J. Borel J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The PMN pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Fisher) for cell counting. PMNs were used at a final concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 1 ml of pure high molecular mass hyaluronan (Calbiochem) at 5 mg/ml and washed with phosphate-buffered saline after overnight incubation. PMNs (5 × 106) were added to the upper chamber of transwell inserts with a5-μm pore size (Corning Glass) to create the modified Boyden chamber (30Zen K. Reaves T.A. Soto I. Liu Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 309: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The lower chambers contained 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and various doses of ROS with or without the presence of EC-SOD (1000 units/well). ROS was generated using a CuSO4/H2O2 system as previously described (20Fattman C.L. Schaefer L.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 236-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). ROS are generated by adding 100 μm H2O2 to CuSO4 solution (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 50 μm CuSO4, pH 7.4), and superoxide production was determined by a colorimetric assay using WST-1 proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science). If EC-SOD was present, it was added to wells prior to the addition of ROS. The wells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Lower chamber supernatants were collected on ice, and cell counts were performed on a Beckman Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Controls included the use of plates not coated with hyaluronan to ensure that chemotactic responses were not secondary to the generation of ROS alone and omission of hydrogen peroxide from the reaction to ensure that chemotaxis did not occur in response to hyaluronan-coated plates alone. Animals—All animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male C57BL/6 (Taconic, Germantown, NY) and EC-SOD knock-out mice (congenic with the C57BL/6 strain of mice), 8–10 weeks old and 5–6 mice per group, were treated with 0.1 mg of NIEHS crocidolite asbestos (>10 μm in length) or 0.1 mg of titanium dioxide (Sigma) by intratracheal instillation as previously described (11Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Tan R.J. Fattman C.L. Watkins S.C. Oury T.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 2006-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized 14 days post-treatment. Lungs were removed, quick frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used for biochemical analysis after bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained. BALF Analysis—BALF was obtained by intratracheal administration and recovery of 0.8 ml of 0.9% saline. Lavage recovery from each animal was consistently 85–90% of that instilled. Total protein was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce). Total white blood cell counts were measured using a Beckman Z1 Coulter Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The remaining BALF were stored at –80 °C for further analysis. Quantification of Hyaluronan Levels—BALF and serum hyaluronan were measured using the hyaluronan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT). The concentration of hyaluronan in the sample was determined using a standard curve of known amounts of hyaluronan. Sizing Hyaluronan in Lung Tissue—Lung tissues were digested with protease digestion buffer (0.15 m NaCl containing 1000 units/ml Pronase from Streptomyces griseus; Calbiochem) at 55 °C overnight, followed by inactivation of protease activity by boiling the samples at 100 °C for 10 min. Samples were concentrated with centrifugal filter (10,000 kDa cut-off; Millipore). Concentrated samples along with known molecular mass hyaluronan standards (1300, 500, 132, and 35 kDa) were electrophoresed on a 0.5% agarose gel or 7% polyacrylamide gel, stained with 0.005% Stain-All for overnight, and then destained with water for 2 days and exposing to amber light for 30 min. HA-agarose gels were photographed on a Geliance 600 Imaging System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and polyacrylamide gels were photographed on Kodak Gel Logic 2200 imaging system (New Haven, CT). The captured agarose gel images were analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to document hyaluronan bands on the gel. A standard curve was determined by the running distance of known molecular mass hyaluronan standards. Hyaluronan peaks in the samples were calculated against the standard curve. Band peaks were analyzed from triplicate sample for each group. Reverse Transcription-PCR for Hyaluronan Synthases—Lung total cellular RNA was isolated by an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After determining the concentration, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and amplified using Power SYBR Green kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the Applied Biosystems two-step reverse transcription-PCR procedure (n = 3/group). The reaction was performed by an Applied Biosystems 7300 real time PCR system. Mouse Has sequences were used for this analysis (31Bai K.J. Spicer A.P. Mascarenhas M.M. Yu L. Ochoa C.D. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The primers had the following sequences: Has1 forward, 5-AGTATACCTCGCGCTCCAGA-3, Has1 reverse, 5-AGCAGCAGTAGAGCCCAGAG-3; Has2 forward, 5-AACAGGGTGTTGAGTCTGGG-3; Has2 reverse, 5-TAAACCACACGGACACTGGA-3; Has3 forward, 5-CGGGTGAAGGAGAGACAGAG-3; Has3 reverse, 5-GCAATGAGGAAGAATGGGAA-3. PCR for glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed as a control, using the following primers: forward, 5-AATGCATCCTGCACCACCAA-3; reverse, 5-GTAGCCATATTCATTGTCATA-3. Hyaluronan Zymography—Hyaluronidase activities were detected by hyaluronan zymography (32Ikegami-Kawai M. Okuda R. Nemoto T. Inada N. Takahashi T. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Miura R.O. Yamagata S. Miura Y. Harada T. Yamagata T. Anal.

Mouse serum was diluted with 5 volumes of 0.15 m NaCl, and the diluted samples were mixed with an equivalent volume of Laemmli's sample buffer containing 4% SDS and no reducing reagent. The mixtures were applied to 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.17 mg/ml HA. After electrophoresis at 25 mA, the gels were rinsed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The gels were incubated with fresh incubation buffer (0.1 m sodium formate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 3.5) for 24 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the gels were rinsed with water and incubated with 0.1 mg/ml Pronase in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. The gels were rinsed again with 20% ethanol, 10% acetic acid solution for 10 min and stained with Alcian blue solution (0.5% Alcian blue in 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid) overnight. After destaining with 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid, the hyaluronan-hydrolyzing proteins were detected as transparent bands against a blue background, and the images were photographed with an Eastman Kodak Co. imaging system. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by group comparisons using Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests using the computer program Prizm (GraphPad). Statistical significance is set at p < 0.05. Mouse EC-SOD Directly Binds to Hyaluronan—EC-SOD has a polycationic matrix-binding domain, which has high affinity for polyanionic components in the matrix, such as heparan sulfate. Because hyaluronan is also a polyanionic component in the matrix, we hypothesized that EC-SOD may directly bind to hyaluronan and that this interaction may protect hyaluronan from oxidative degradation. To determine if EC-SOD can bind to hyaluronan, purified mouse EC-SOD was applied to a hyaluronan EAH-Sepharose column. The bound protein was subsequently eluted by NaCl, and the collected fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. This analysis revealed that mouse EC-SOD directly binds to hyaluronan in vitro (Fig. 1A). The Matrix-binding Domain of EC-SOD Is Necessary for Binding to Hyaluronan—To study the involvement of the EC-SOD matrix-binding domain in hyaluronan binding, this domain was removed by limited proteolysis with trypsin, as described previously (26Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Proteolysis with trypsin produces a truncated EC-SOD subunit (Fig. 1B), which retains its full enzymatic activity but lacks the C-terminal matrix-binding domain. When this form of EC-SOD was added to the hyaluronan EAH-Sepharose column, it was unable to bind to the hyaluronan, as indicated by its presence only in the flow-through (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the matrix-binding domain of EC-SOD is responsible for the binding to hyaluronan. Hyaluronan Is Highly Sensitive to ROS-mediated Degradation and EC-SOD Prevents Its Degradation—A fixed amount of hyaluronan was exposed to ROS generated by the Cu(II)/H2O2 system. Analysis of hylauronan molecular mass distribution in these samples revealed that the copper solution or H2O2 alone does not induce any hyaluronan degradation, whereas the ROS generated by the combination decreased the average molecular size of the hyaluronan. These studies indicate that ROS led to degradation of hyaluronan in a dose-related manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The agarose gel used in Fig. 2A shows the shift of the major hyaluronan molecular mass from high to low, whereas the polyacrylamide gel used in Fig. 2B shows the degraded hyaluronan that is unable to be captured in Fig. 2A. To examine the functional relevance of the EC-SOD/hyaluronan interaction and the importance of the EC-SOD matrix-binding domain, we exposed a fixed amount of pure high molecular mass hyaluronan to ROS in the presence or absence of purified human EC-SOD and CuZn-SOD. Notably, co-treatment with EC-SOD was found to inhibit ROS-mediated hyaluronan degradation (Fig. 2C) in a dose-response manner. 300 units of EC-SOD can totally prevent ROS-induced hyaluronan degradation in our system. The EC-SOD gene is ∼60% homologous to Cu-Zn SOD, especially in the region of the active site (35Zelko I.N. Mariani T.J. Folz R.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), whereas compared with EC-SOD, CuZn-SOD lacks the matrix-binding domain, and it is not as efficient as EC-SOD at preventing ROS-induced hyaluronan degradation, since higher concentrations are needed to get the same protection effects (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the EC-SOD matrix-binding domain enhances the protective effects provided by EC-SOD. EC-SOD Inhibits Neutrophil Chemotaxis Induced by Preventing Oxidative Hyaluronan Fragmentation—Isolated human neutrophils were added to a modified Boyden chamber and incubated for 2 h. Neutrophil immigration across a 0.5-μm transwell membrane was measured using the Beckman Coulter Counter. ROS-induced hyaluronan fragmentation led to an increase in PMN chemotaxis across the transwell membrane compared with samples without ROS (Fig. 3) (p < 0.05), and EC-SOD inhibited this response (p < 0.05 versus hyaluronan with ROS). Optimal hyaluronan fragment-induced chemotaxis effect was inhibited by 1000 units/ml purified human EC-SOD preadministered before ROS generation. There was no significant difference between the control samples and hyaluronan with both ROS and EC-SOD (Fig. 3). No chemotaxis was observed with high molecular mass hyaluronan alone or ROS in the absence of hyaluronan (not illustrated). Asbestos-induced Lung Injury and Inflammation Are Exacerbated in EC-SOD-null Mice—Asbestos exposure of EC-SOD gene knock-out mice and wild-type mice provides an excellent in vivo model to elucidate the role of EC-SOD in hyaluronan degradation in response to free radical-induced lung injury. Previous studies from our laboratory found that EC-SOD gene knock-out mice show more severe lung injury compared with wild-type mice after asbestos treatment (11Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M.

While most reports have focused on the inducible isoform, COX-2, the contribution of COX-1 to the inflammatory response is unclear. In the present study, the contribution of COX-1 in the neuroinflammatory response to intracerebroventricular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated using COX-1 deficient (COX-1(-/-)) mice or wild-type (COX-1(+/+)) mice pretreated with SC-560, a selective COX-1 inhibitor. Twenty-four hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, COX-1(-/-) mice showed decreased protein oxidation and LPS-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus compared with COX-1(+/+) mice. COX-1(-/-) mice showed a significant reduction of microglial activation, proinflammatory mediators, and expression of COX-2, inducible NOS, and NADPH oxidase. The transcriptional down-regulation of cytokines and other inflammatory markers in COX-1(-/-) mice was mediated by a reduced activation of NF-kappaB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Administration of SC-560 prior to LPS injection also attenuated the neuroinflammatory response by decreasing brain levels of prostaglandin (PG)E(2), PGD(2), PGF(2alpha), and thromboxane B(2), as well as the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine. These findings suggest that COX-1 plays a previously unrecognized role in neuroinflammatory damage."

Binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail is required for β3 activation, and the integrin-binding PTB-like F3 domain of talin is sufficient to activate β3 integrins. Here we report that, whereas the conserved talin-integrin interaction is also required for β1 activation, and talin F3 binds β1 and β3 integrins with comparable affinity, expression of the talin F3 domain is not sufficient to activate β1 integrins. β1 integrin activation could, however, be detected following expression of larger talin fragments that included the N-terminal and F1 domains, and mutagenesis indicates that these domains cooperate with talin F3 to mediate β1 activation. This effect is not due to increased affinity for the integrin β tail and we hypothesize that the N-terminal domains function by targeting or orienting talin in such a way as to optimize the interaction with the integrin tail. Analysis of β3 integrin activation indicates that inclusion of the N-terminal and F1 domains also enhances F3-mediated β3 activation.

Furthermore, differences between talin-mediated activation of β1 and β3 integrins and the role of regions outside of the talin F3 in integrin activation have not been explored. By investigating activation of β1 integrins we find that the minimal β3-activating F3 fragment of talin is not sufficient for β1 activation but additional N-terminal domains are required.

In experiments on CHO cells the α5β1 integrin expression was assessed in parallel by staining with PB1 (44Brown P.L. Juliano R.L. Science. 1985; 228: 1448-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO or HT1080 cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 24 h later cells were suspended and incubated with biotinylated recombinant GST-FN9–11 in the presence or absence of integrin activators or inhibitors. For each preparation of biotinylated GST-FN9–11 the effective concentration was determined by titration. Cells were washed and bound FN9–11 was detected with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. Five minutes prior to analysis, propidium iodide (2 μg/ml final) was added. FN9–11 binding to live (propidium iodide-negative) transfected (GFP-positive) cells was assessed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). The activation index was defined either as AI = (F – F0)/(Fmax – F0) or AI = (F – F0)/(Fintegrin), where F is the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI) of FN9–11 binding, F0 is the GMFI of FN9–11 binding in presence of 0.4 μm 3F inhibitor or 5 mm RGD peptide (Sigma) or 10 mm EDTA, Fmax is the GMFI of FN9–11 binding in the presence of 0.01 mg/ml of 9EG7 or 2 μm Mn2+, Fintegrin is the normalized GMFI of PB1 binding to transfected cells. The activation state of wild-type or chimeric αIIbβ3 integrins was assessed by measuring the binding of the ligand mimetic anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody PAC1 in three-color flow cytometric assays as described previously (17Calderwood D.A.

Cells were washed and bound PAC1 was detected with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotech). Five minutes prior to analysis propidium iodide was added. PAC1 binding to live, transfected (GFP-positive) cells was assessed. Activation was quantified and an activation index calculated as defined above, where F is the GMFI of PAC1 binding, F0 is the GMFI of PAC1 binding in presence of EDTA or RGD peptide, and Fmax is the GMFI of PAC1 binding in the presence of 2 μm Mn2+. To measure the activation of mutant αIIbα5β3β1A integrins CHO cells were transfected with vectors encoding αIIbα5 and wild-type or mutant β3β1A. Twenty-four hours later cells were suspended and stained with PAC1, washed, and stained with anti-αIIbβ3 antibody D57 on ice, and the binding of PAC1 and D57 was detected using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. PAC1 binding to live, integrin expressing (D57 positive) cells was measured and an activation index calculated as above. The PTB-like Domain of Talin Is Not Sufficient to Activate β1 Integrins—To investigate activation of β1 integrins by talin we expressed αIIbβ3-activating fragments of the talin1 FERM domain containing subdomains F3 or F2 and F3 (talin1 F3 and talin1 F2F3) in CHO cells and assessed the activation state of endogenous α5β1 integrin by measuring the binding of a recombinant soluble integrin-binding fragment of fibronectin (FN9–11), in flow cytometric assays (19Tadokoro S.

FN9–11 is composed of fibronectin type III repeats 9 to 11 and its binding is specific as it can be inhibited by function blocking anti-α5β1 antibodies, RGD peptides, 3F, or EDTA and stimulated by the β1-activating antibody 9EG7, or Mn2+ (Fig. 1A and data not shown). However, despite efficient transfection, assessed by measuring expression of co-transfected GFP and good expression of the F3 or F2F3 domains of talin1, assessed by Western blotting, FN9–11 binding was not increased by the talin fragments indicating that α5β1 was not activated (Fig. 1, A–C). This was confirmed by calculation of an activation index, the ratio of specific (EDTA, 3F, or RGD peptide inhibitable) binding to maximal (9EG7 or Mn2+ stimulated) specific binding. Similar results were obtained with the closely related F3 or F2F3 domains from talin2 (Fig. 1B), talin1 F2F3 constructs fused to GFP, and with HA-tagged full-length talin1 (not shown). We previously showed talin F3-mediated activation of β3 integrins using the αIIbβ3-specific ligand-mimetic antibody PAC1 as a reporter (18Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether differences between PAC1 and FN9–11 detection of integrin activation account for the lack of β1 activation, we measured the activation of chimeric αIIbα5β3β1A integrins stably expressed in CHO cells. These integrins have the intracellular domains of α5β1A fused to the αIIbβ3 extracellular and transmembrane domains, and so can bind PAC1 (45Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Talin fragments did not induce PAC1 binding to these integrins (Fig. 1D). To examine whether the lack of talin-mediated activation was due to the presence of the α5 cytoplasmic tail we also examined activation of chimeric integrins containing the α6Aβ1A cytoplasmic domains (αIIbα6Aβ3β1A) (45Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Once again talin fragments containing the F3 domain were unable to activate these integrins (Fig. 1E). However, talin F2F3 could activate chimeric αIIbα5β3 integrins (Fig. 1F). This reveals that the inability of talin fragments to activate β1 integrins does not correlate with the presence of the α5 cytoplasmic tail, but rather with the β1 tail. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the differences in β1 and β3 integrin activation were due to other differences between the cell lines used, we expressed talin F2F3 in an αIIbβ3-expressing CHO cell line. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were detached, washed, and divided into two sets; one was probed with PAC1 to assess αIIbβ3 activation, the other with FN9–11 to assess α5β1 activation (to prevent FN9–11 binding to αIIbβ3, measurements were made in the presence of RO44-9883 a small molecule αIIbβ3 inhibitor that does not induce trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation (36Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)). These experiments clearly show talin F2F3 activation of αIIbβ3 but not α5β1 (Fig. 1G). Finally we tested the ability of talin fragments to activate FN9–11 binding to β1 integrins in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, in HEK293 human embryonic kidney epithelial cells and in NIH/3T3 murine fibroblastic cells. Once again talin F2F3 failed to induce FN9–11 binding (Fig. 1H and data not shown). Thus using two different reporters of integrin activation, and measuring activation of endogenously and exogenously expressed integrins with a range of basal activation states, in several cell lines, we find that expressed talin fragments are capable of activating β3 but not β1 integrins. Talin Binds Integrin β1 and β3 Tails via a Conserved Mechanism—Activation of β3 integrins requires engagement of the β3 tail by the talin F3 domain (19Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V.

Because we found that C3 (C3b) is degraded in sera from patients with STSS, we investigated the mechanism of C3 (C3b) degradation by S. pyogenes. We incubated human C3b or serum with recombinant SpeB (rSpeB), a wild-type S. pyogenes strain isolated from an STSS patient or its isogenic ΔspeB mutant and examined the supernatant by Western blotting with anti-human C3b. Western blot and Biacore analyses revealed that rSpeB and wild-type S. pyogenes rapidly degrade C3b. Additionally, C3 (C3b) was not detected in sera collected from infected areas of STSS patients. Furthermore, the survival rate in human blood and in mice was lower for the ΔspeB mutant than the wild-type strain. Histopathological observations demonstrated that neutrophils were recruited to and phagocytosed the ΔspeB mutant, whereas with the wild-type strain, few neutrophils migrated to the site of infection, and the bacteria spread along the fascia. We observed the degradation of C3 (C3b) in sera from STSS patients and the degradation of C3 (C3b) by rSpeB. This suggests that SpeB contributes to the escape of S. pyogenes from phagocytosis at the site of initial infection, allowing it to invade host tissues during severe infections.

Therefore, many researchers have focused on S. pyogenes, and some aspects of the infection have been elucidated.The initial step of S. pyogenes infection is bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells through extracellular matrix proteins, for example, fibronectin (3Hanski E.

Fibronectin-binding proteins of S. pyogenes have been identified as adhesins and invasins, and their role in the invasion of epithelial cells by S. pyogenes has been examined in several studies (6Cue D.

To cause systemic and septic infections, S. pyogenes must evade the immune system of the host and survive in plasma, after which the organisms may spread into various organs via the blood stream. Histopathological studies have demonstrated that there are few or no inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophils) at the site of infection in patients with STSS and severe streptococcal infections (8Cockerill III, F.R.

Cue D. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6206-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the surface protein FbaA of S. pyogenes recruits complement regulatory protein factor H (FH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1Stevens D.L.

Based on this, the we postulated that C3b is inactivated on the surface of S. pyogenes. To date, however, there have been few reports on C3 (C3b)-degrading molecules in S. pyogenes or other bacteria.We recently found that C3 (C3b) is degraded in sera from infected areas in patients with STSS but not in sera from healthy volunteers. Additionally, genetic inactivation of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), a cysteine protease, in S. pyogenes decreases the bacterium resistance to phagocytosis and reduces its ability to spread into various organs in mice (16Lukomski S. Burns Jr., E.H. Wyde P.R. Podbielski A. Rurangirwa J. Moore-Poveda D.K. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 771-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kuo C.F. Luo Y.H. Lin H.Y. Huang K.J. Wu J.J.

These studies, however, did not examine how SpeB contributes to bacterial propagation in vivo. On the basis of the previous findings, we hypothesized that S. pyogenes produces one or more C3 (C3b)-degrading proteases, one of which is SpeB, allowing the bacterium to evade the host immune system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman Sera and Streptococcal Strains—All of the studies on patients and volunteers were performed with approval of the ethics committee Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry and Asahi General Hospital, and all patients gave informed consent. Human blood samples were collected from the veins of eight healthy volunteers (age 31.3 ± 4.9 years) and during surgery in 13 patients with STSS (age 35.2 ± 23.8 years) from an infected area in the acute phase at the surgical site (supplemental Fig. S1). S. pyogenes strain SSI-9 (serotype M1) was isolated from a Japanese patient with STSS (4Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and its isogenic ΔspeB mutant was constructed with a suicide vector as described previously (18Okamoto S. Kawabata S. Terao Y. Fujitaka H. Okuno Y. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, we amplified an internal portion of the speB gene by PCR and ligated it into pSF151 (19Tao L. LeBlanc D.J. Ferretti J.J. Gene. 1992; 120: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Strain SSI-9 was transformed with the resulting plasmid by electroporation, and the transformant was selected on a spectinomycin-containing agar plate. Following verification of targeted mutagenesis by colony-directed PCR (4Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we designated the ΔspeB mutant as strain TR-11. There was no growth difference on laboratory medium between strains SSI-9 and TR-11 (18Okamoto S. Kawabata S. Terao Y. Fujitaka H. Okuno Y. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Construction of Recombinant SpeB—rSpeB was prepared as follows. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from S. pyogenes strain SSI-9 as a template for PCR. The entire length of the speB gene was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CATGCCATGGATAAAAAGAAATTAGGTATCAG-3′ (sense, containing an NcoI recognition site) and 5′-CCCCCGGGAGGTTTGATGCCTACAACAGCACTTTGG-3′ (antisense, containing a SmaI recognition site). To produce rSpeB with a C-terminal histidine tag, the PCR fragment was digested with NcoI and SmaI and then cloned into NcoI/SmaI-digested pIVEX2.3-MCS vector (Roche Applied Science). The scpA (streptococcal C5a peptidase) gene was provided by Dr. P. P. Cleary (University of Minnesota) (11Chen C.C. Cleary P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was ligated into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences KK). The resulting plasmids, which harbored the speB or the scpA gene, were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysE (Novagen), and the transformant was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 24 h. The rSpeB protein was produced as a 43-kDa zymogen and converted to 28-kDa active form by self-processing during purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and diethylaminoethyl column chromatography (Bio-Rad). The rScpA protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences KK) and diethylaminoethyl column chromatography. The purified rSpeB and rScpA (C5a peptidase) proteins were dialyzed against PBS.Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described previously (5Terao Y. Kawabata S. Nakata M. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47428-47435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sera from patients with STSS or healthy volunteers were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with a solution of 5% skim milk and 10% goat serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals), the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human C3b serum (Nordic Immunology). Immunoreactive bands were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (Moss). To examine the proteolytic activity of SpeB, 5 μl of C3b (Calbiochem, 200 μg/ml) or human sera were incubated with an equal volume of rSpeB (0–10 μm), wild-type strain SSI-9 (2 × 106 cfu/ml), or the ΔspeB mutant strain TR-11 (2 × 106 cfu/ml). Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, each mixture was examined by Western blot analysis with anti-human C3b serum.N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—The targeted protein was separated using 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) for 1 h and then destained with 7.5% acetic acid containing 40% methanol and washed with distilled water for 24 h. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using the Edman degradation method with an ABI protein sequencer model 491HT (Applied Biosystems).Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (Biacore)—The direct surface plasmon resonance was measured using the Biacore X biomolecular interaction monitoring system (Biacore International AB). Biacore analysis was performed as described previously (20Terao Y. Yamaguchi M. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human C3b was diluted and adjusted to 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and then immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip CM5 (Biacore International AB) using an Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore International AB). Lyophilized rSpeB was suspended in HBSP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and adjusted to 2.5, 5, and 10 μm. For binding analysis, rSpeB was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 37 °C. C3b degrading activity was quantified as the decrease in resonance units on the sensorgram and analyzed with BIA evaluation software version 4.02 (Biacore International AB) as described previously (21Steinrücke P. Aldinger U. Hill O. Hillisch A. Basch R. Diekmann S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Bactericidal Test—In vitro whole blood bactericidal assays were performed with a modified version of the bactericidal test described by Lancefield (22Lancefield R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1957; 107: 525-544Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes strains from patients were cultured until mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm = 0.5–0.6) and adjusted with PBS or culture supernatant to 2–5 × 103 cfu/ml. Human whole blood was collected from a healthy donor, who was asked to confirm that the donor did not have an infection. The blood was also examined by ASO-latex (Seiken) to confirm that it was not infected with S. pyogenes. The blood was heparinized, and 90-μl samples of it were mixed with 10 μl of each bacterial suspension. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C on a rotary mixer, the mixtures were grown on blood-agar plates, and the number of colonies were counted. For the C3b inhibition assay, rabbit anti-C3b or preimmune F(ab′)2 fragment was prepared using an ImmunoPure F(ab′)2 preparation kit (Pierce), and, prior to the bactericidal assay, 10 μg of the F(ab′)2 fragment was incubated with 100 μl of human blood at 37 °C for 1 h.Infection of Mice—All of the animal procedures complied with the Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry guidelines and were approved by the institutional animal care and ethics committee. BALB/c mice (6-week-old, female) were purchased from Charles River Japan. S. pyogenes strains were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase and washed twice with PBS. The bacteria were suspended in PBS, and the suspensions were adjusted to 2 × 106 cfu/ml. The mice were anesthetized and injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the quadriceps with 0.1 ml of bacterial suspension followed by 0.9 ml of air to form an air pouch (17Kuo C.F. Luo Y.H. Lin H.Y. Huang K.J. Wu J.J. Lei H.Y. Lin M.T. Chuang W.J. Liu C.C. Jin Y.T. Lin Y.S. Microb. Pathog. 2004; 36: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Lancefield R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1957; 107: 525-544Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized and blood was collected every 24 h for 7 days, and 100 μl of the blood were spread on blood-agar plates and incubated at 37 °C. All of theβ-hemolytic colonies were examined for the presence of S. pyogenes by colony-directed PCR with fbaA-specific primers and counted. In addition, muscle samples were obtained under anesthesia from mice that received an intramuscular injection. The samples were taken so that a wide margin around the abscess or the injection site was collected. The excised tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) solution (Fluka) or were immunostained with rabbit anti-FbaA serum (4Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and an EnVision kit (Dako).C3 (C3b) Degradation and Measurement of Complement Activity in Vivo—BALB/c mice were infected with strain SSI-9 or TR-11 in the quadriceps, and blood samples were collected on days 0, 2, 7, and 14. Whole blood was centrifuged, and the serum was analyzed using a complement activity measuring kit, CH50 (Seiken). Two weeks after infection, each quadriceps section was incised, shredded, and frozen at -80 °C. After 10 min, the tissues were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately applied to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. C3 (C3b) degradation at the site of infection was examined by Western blotting using anti-C3b serum.Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between the means of groups was evaluated using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All of the tests were analyzed using Stat-View J-5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSC3 (C3b) Was Not Detected in Sera Collected from Infected Areas of STSS Patients—In most cases of STSS, histopathological examination showed little or no infiltration of neutrophils around S. pyogenes at early stages of infection, and the bacterial organisms are found along the fascia (Fig. 1). To investigate the interaction between the host and S. pyogenes in STSS, during operations, sera were collected from the infected area of STSS patients. We then examined whether S. pyogenes isolated from an STSS patient can degrade complement C3 (C3b), a complement fragment that plays an important role in innate immunity by activating the alternative pathway and by binding to the bacterial surfaces to mediate opsonization. In the alternative pathway, C3b acts with factor B to form the alternative pathway C3 convertase. Subsequently, the C3 convertase may act with an additional C3b molecule to form the alternative pathway C5 convertase. During activation via classical pathway, C4 acts with C2 to form the classical pathway C5 convertase upon addition of a C3b molecule, and then the C5 convertase generates C5a. Therefore, elimination of C3 (C3b) by S. pyogenes is expected to prevent the accumulation of C5a, the most powerful anaphylatoxin, reducing neutrophil migration and bacterial opsonization. As shown in Fig. 2, Western blotting with anti-C3b showed that C3b (C3) was not present in sera from patients with STSS collected from the site of infection, whereas C3 (C3b) was clearly detected in sera from all of the healthy volunteers. In contrast, C5 in blood were very low level. There was not a significant difference among all samples from the healthy volunteers and patients with STSS by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, we speculated that, in STSS, C3 (C3b) is degraded into fragments at sites of infection by S. pyogenes proteases.FIGURE 2Analysis of C3 (C3b) in human serum samples. C3 (C3b) was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-C3b serum. A, blood samples were collected from eight healthy volunteers (age 31.3 ± 4.9 years). Purified C3b (lane C3b) and control healthy serum (lane C; Sigma) were used as positive controls. B, blood samples were collected from 13 patients with STSS (age 35.2 ± 23.8 years). In both panels, lane M contains molecular mass markers. The blood samples from patients with STSS were from infected areas (see Fig. S1), which means that the healthy donor bloods from veins might not be an exact control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Streptococcal Cysteine Protease SpeB Degrades Complement C3 (C3b)—S. pyogenes expresses two major proteases, one of which is an extracellular cysteine protease named SpeB (24Bohach G.A. Hauser A.R. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1665-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is a cell-associated serine protease named C5a peptidase (11Chen C.C. Cleary P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the ability of recombinant SpeB (rSpeB) and C5a peptidase to degrade purified C3b in healthy human serum. Fig. 3A shows that the purified human C3b (>116-kDa bands; black arrows) was degraded by rSpeB into ∼85-kDa fragments (gray arrowheads). In contrast, recombinant C5a peptidase, ScpA, could not degrade C3b (data not shown). Furthermore, rSpeB degraded C3b in serum, even though it contains a variety of ions and inhibitors (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7).FIGURE 3Degradation of C3b by SpeB protease. A, purified C3b or healthy human serum was incubated with rSpeB or S. pyogenes for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-C3b serum. The black arrows indicate intact C3b or alternatively processed forms, and the red arrowheads show the C3b degradation products. Lane 1, molecular mass markers; lane 2, 1 μg of purified C3b; lane 3, 10 μm purified rSpeB; lanes 4–6, 1 μg of C3b with 0.1–10 μm rSpeB; lane 7, healthy human serum; lane 8, healthy human serum with 10 μm rSpeB; lane 9, healthy human serum and wild-type strain SSI-9 (1 × 104 cfu/well); lane 10, healthy human serum with the ΔspeB strain TR-11 (1 × 104 cfu/well). B, 100 μl of 1 μm rSpeB or S. pyogenes strains SSI-9 or TR-11 (1 × 104 cfu/well) were added to 5% skim milk agar. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the proteolytic activities were observed under the light. C, reverse transcription-PCR analysis of S. pyogenes strain SSI-9 and TR-11. Total RNA was extracted from each strain at the mid-log phase and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with targeted gene-specific primer pairs, as described previously (4Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Okamoto S. Kawabata S. Terao Y. Fujitaka H. Okuno Y. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the role of native SpeB in C3b degradation, we compared its degradation in serum by wild-type S. pyogenes strain SSI-9, which was isolated from a patient with STSS, and its isogenic ΔspeB mutant strain TR-11, which was constructed by integrating the spectinomycin resistance gene into the speB gene. Homologous recombination in TR-11 was confirmed by colony-directed PCR (data not shown) and by the loss of the proteolytic activity on skim milk agar (Fig. 3B). Western blotting showed that SSI-9 but not TR-11 could cleave serum C3 (C3b) (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 9). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was used to investigate the transcriptional levels of other virulence genes in strain TR-11, which confirmed that the major virulence factors were not affected by deletion of the speB gene, as compared with the wild-type strain SSI-9 (Fig. 3C). We also extracted the cleaved fragment of C3b from a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence to be GQREVVAD, which was identical to the N terminus of the β-chain (25Bruijn de M.H. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, the other SpeB-cleavage sites were determined by using a partial cleavage condition (15 min, 37 °C). Identical sites were used, as follows: LLPVG (156 amino acid residues from the N terminus of C3), SNLDEDIIA (749 amino acid residues), DPERLGREG (948 amino acid residues), and IQPGA (1472 amino acid residues). These results showed that SpeB was able to cleave one or more sites of the C3 (C3b) molecule.Recombinant SpeB Rapidly Degrades C3b—These results might support the hypothesis that SpeB contributes to the inhibition of the complement system by degrading C3b; however, there was a problem that required further investigation. To evade opsonization or inhibit other immunological functions of C3b, it is necessary that S. pyogenes cannot only degrade C3b but also carry out the degradation rapidly when the two proteins come into contact. Biacore analysis confirmed that rSpeB can rapidly cleave immobilized C3b (Fig. 4A). The arrow in Fig. 4A indicates that the C3b in contact with SpeB shifted to a hydrolysis product. The initial rates of hydrolysis of C3b can be obtained from the initial slopes (first 30 s) in the sensorgram (Fig. 4A, lines a–c). In this system, 1000 resonance units correspond to a mass shift of 1 ng/mm2 (26Sternberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. Science. 1991; 143: 513-526Google Scholar). A plot of the initial rate of C3b cleavage as a function of the rSpeB concentration was linear (Fig. 4B). Biacore analysis further demonstrated that 10 μm rSpeB degrades C3b at an initial rate of 12 pg/s (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Biomolecular interactions of human C3b and rSpeB. A, Biacore analysis was performed to examine the proteolysis of human C3b by rSpeB. C3b (100 μg/ml) was immobilized on a sensor chip CM5. HBSP was used as a running buffer and was delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 37 °C. The concentration of rSpeB was adjusted to 2.5–10 μm, and a 60-μl injection volume was used. The reduction in resonance unit values indicates the extent of proteolytic cleavage. The vertical arrow indicates that the C3b in contact with SpeB shifted to a hydrolysis product. B, initial rate of C3b degradation as a function of the rSpeB concentration. The initial rate of proteolysis (first 30 s) was determined from the initial slope in the sensorgram (lines a–c in panel A). The correlation coefficient was 0.9978.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Survival Rate in Human Blood Was Lower for the ΔspeB Mutant than the Wild-type Strain—We next examined the survival of wild-type strain SSI-9 and ΔspeB strain TR-11 in the blood of healthy, uninfected volunteers. A 3-h bactericidal test (Fig. 5A) showed that strain SSI-9 survived significantly at a higher rate than strain TR-11 (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the wild-type strain survived at a higher rate when the suspension was made in culture supernatant than when it was made in PBS (p < 0.005), but this difference was not observed for the mutant strain.

https://openalex.org/W1970357219,"Anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) belongs to an important class of endogenous lipids including amides and esters of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, collectively termed “endocannabinoids.” Recently we have shown that AEA inhibits differentiation of human keratinocytes, by binding to type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R). To further characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect, we investigated the expression of epidermal differentiation-related genes after AEA treatment. We observed that keratin 1 and 10, transglutaminase 5 and involucrin are transcriptionally down-regulated by AEA. Most importantly, we found that AEA is able to decrease differentiating gene expression by increasing DNA methylation in human keratinocytes, through a p38, and to a lesser extent p42/44, mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway triggered by CB1R. An effect of AEA on DNA methylation because of CB1R-mediated increase of methyltransferase activity is described here for the first time, and we believe that the importance of this effect clearly extends beyond the regulation of skin differentiation. In fact, the modulation of DNA methylation by endocannabinoids may affect the expression of a number of genes that regulate many cell functions in response to these substances.

However, additional metabolic routes seem to contribute to the synthesis of AEA (9Liu J. Wang L. Harvey-White J. Osei-Hyiaman D. Razdan R. Gong Q. Chan A.C. Zhou Z. Huang B.X. Kim H.Y. Kunos G. Proc.

Another major endocannabinoid is 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), for which specific metabolic enzymes have been recently discovered (11Dinh T.P. Carpenter D. Leslie F.M. Freund T.F. Katona I.

Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2005; 4: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together with AEA, 2-AG and congeners, the proteins that bind and metabolize these substances form the endocannabinoid system (ES) (3Marzo Di V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 134-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Paradisi A. Oddi S. Maccarrone M. Curr. Drug Targets. 2006; 11: 1539-1552Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Full and functional ES has been found virtually in all tissues and its relevance within the central nervous system has been clearly demonstrated (15Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Peripheral endocannabinoids seem to play a crucial role in modulating the autonomic nervous, reproductive, endocrine, and immune systems (16Marzo Di V. Matias I. Nat.

Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has been focused on the possible role of AEA and other endocannabinoids in regulating cell growth and differentiation, and collected evidence suggests that AEA might have pro-apoptotic activity (22Guzman M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 23Maccarrone M. Endocannabinoids: The Brain and Body's Marijuana and Beyond. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006: 451-466Google Scholar). In this context, we have shown that human keratinocytes have a functional ES that enables them to bind and metabolize AEA; moreover, ES was shown to be implicated in the control of epidermal differentiation, through a CB1R-dependent mechanism (24Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33896-33903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The epidermis, which forms the uppermost compartment of the skin, represents a barrier against the environment, provided by terminally differentiating keratinocytes (25Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 26Kalinin A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3069-3070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal differentiation begins with the migration of keratinocytes from basal layer, composed of proliferating cells, and ends with the formation of the cornified cell envelope, an insoluble protein structure found in differentiated keratinocytes (27Candi E. Schmidt R. Melino G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation and differentiation occur sequentially and are characterized by the expression of specific proteins, such as keratins and transglutaminases (28Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 29Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Activation of several keratinocyte differentiation genes requires the opening of chromatin structure and demethylation of specific genomic promoter regions. Variation in overall DNA methylation between differentiated and undifferentiated cells has been reported in a number of different models (30Ehrlich M. Gama-Sosa M.A. Huang L.H. Midgett R.H. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gehrke C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 31Lyon S.B. Buonocore L. Miller M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DNA of differentiated keratinocytes has been shown to contain less 5-methylcytosine than DNA of undifferentiated keratinocytes (32Veres D.A. Wilkins L. Coble D.W. Lyon S.B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, agents known to inhibit DNA methylation (i.e. 5-azacytidine, 5AC) and histone deacetylation (i.e. sodium butyrate, NaB) are also known to inhibit growth and to promote differentiation of keratinocytes (33Rosl F. Durst M. Hausen Zur H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Schmidt R. Cathelineau C. Cavey M.T. Dionisius V. Michel S. Shroot B. Reichert U. J. Cell.

Cell Tissue Kinet. 1989; 22: 361-375PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that differentiating keratinocytes have decreased levels of endogenous AEA, because of increased degradation of this lipid through FAAH. In addition, we have shown that exogenous AEA inhibits keratinocyte differentiation in vitro, leading to a CB1R-dependent reduction of cornified envelope formation and transglutaminase activity (24Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33896-33903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that endocannabinoids regulate neuritogenesis, axonal growth, and synaptogenesis in differentiated neurons (36Rueda D. Navarro B. Martinez-Serrano A. Guzman M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46645-46650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Galve-Roperh I. Aguado T. Rueda D. Velasco G. Guzman M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 2319-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that endocannabinoids are general signaling cues responsible for the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of endocannabinoids, and in particular of AEA, on cell differentiation, we sought to investigate the effects of exogenous AEA on the gene expression pattern of differentiating human keratinocytes. arachidonoylethanolamide type-1/2 cannabinoid receptor fatty acid amide hydrolase N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D 2-arachidonoylglycerol endocannabinoid system 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 5-azacytidine N-arachidonoyldopamine keratin 1/10 transglutaminase 5 methylation-specific PCR DNA methyltransferase epidermal differentiation complex arachidonoyl-2-chloroethylamide mitogen-activated protein kinase reverse transcription. Materials—Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. AEA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 5-azacytidine (5AC), and N-arachidonoyldopamine (NADA) were purchased from Sigma. S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine was from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Arachidonoyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). PD98059 and SB203580 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). N-Piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carboxamide (SR141716) was a kind gift from Sanofi-Aventis (Montpellier, France). Cell Culture and Treatments—HaCaT cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of minimum essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% nonessential amino acids, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cell differentiation was induced by treating HaCaT cells with TPA (10 ng/ml) plus CaCl2 (1.2 mm) for 5 days (38Candi E. Oddi S. Terrinoni A. Paradisi A. Ranalli M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35014-35023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). AEA and related compounds were added at the indicated concentrations directly to the serum-free culture medium, at the same time as TPA plus calcium (24Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N.

Culture medium containing freshly prepared AEA and the other reagents was changed daily during the treatment. Culture medium containing vehicles alone was added to controls under the same conditions (24Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33896-33903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After each treatment, cell viability was determined by Trypan Blue dye exclusion. The treatment of differentiating HaCaT cells with 5AC was performed by seeding 3 × 106 cells in 100-cm2 tissue culture flasks. After 24 h, cells were exposed to 1 μm 5AC for 5 days. Real-time PCR Assay—RNA was extracted using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) from proliferating and differentiating HaCaT cells, following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR reactions were performed using the RT-PCR SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1 μg of total RNA was used to produce cDNA with 10 units/μl SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, in the presence of 2 units/μl RNaseOUT, 1.25 μm oligo(dT)20, 1.25 ng/μl random hexamers, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP mix, and DEPC-treated water. The reaction was performed using the following RT-PCR program: 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min, 85 °C for 5 min, then, after addition of 0.1 units/μl of Escherichia coli RNase H, the product was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. For expression studies, the target transcripts were amplified in ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using the following primers: keratin 10 (K10) F1 (5′-ACGAGGAGGAAATGAAAGAC-3′), K10 R1 (5′-GGACTGTAGTTCTATCTCCAG-3′); keratin 1 (K1) F1 (5′-AGAAAGCAGGATGTCTGG-3′), K1 R1 (5′-AAACAAACTTCACGCTGG-3′); involucrin (INV) F1 (5′-CTCTGCCTCAGCCTTACT-3′), INV R1 (5′-GCTGCTGATCCCTTTGTG-3′); transglutaminase 5 (TG5) F1 (5′-TCAGCACAAAGAGCATCCAG-3′), TG5 R1 (5′-TTCAGGGAGACTTGCACCAC-3′); β-actin F1 (5′-TGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG-3′) and β-actin R1 (5′-TTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′). Actin was used as housekeeping gene for quantity normalization. One microliter of the first strand cDNA product was used for amplification in triplicate in a 25-μl reaction solution containing 12.5 μl of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and 10 pmol of each primer. The following PCR program was used: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Immunoblotting Analysis—HaCaT cell protein extracts (20 μg per lane) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride sheets (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk and 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h, and then were incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-K10 (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution; Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA) and mouse anti-actin (1:1000 in blocking solution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20, filters were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 in blocking solution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Detection was performed using West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce, Rockford, IL). DNase I Sensitivity Assay—The procedure for the isolation of nuclei was reported previously (39Lee Y.W. Klein C.B. Kargacin B. Salnikow K. Kitahara J. Dowjat K. Zhitkovich A. Christie N.T. Costa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A total of 5 × 105 nuclei in DNase I buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were treated with increasing amounts (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 units) of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) in a reaction volume of 200 μl for 30 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm EDTA), containing 1 mg of proteinase K per ml, followed by incubation at 55 °C for 2 h. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and was ethanol-precipitated. The K10 gene was amplified by PCR (50 ng/reaction; 30 cycles) with the primers K10P WF and K10P WR, described below for the methylation-specific PCR. The PCR products were separated on 1.6% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Bisulfite DNA Modification—Genomic DNA was isolated from HaCaT cells using DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA was performed using the CpGenome DNA Modification kit (Chemicon International Inc, Temecula, CA). Briefly, DNA (1 μg) was denaturated by adding NaOH (0.2 m) for 10 min at 50 °C. 550 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite at pH 5.0 was added and mixed, and samples were incubated at 50 °C for 16 h in a water bath. Modified DNA was then bound to a micro-particulate carrier and was desalted by repeated centrifugation and resuspension in 70% ethanol. The conversion to uracil was completed by alkaline desulfonation, and DNA was finally eluted from the carrier by heating in TE buffer for 15 min at 60 °C. DNA preparations were either used immediately or stored at –20 °C. Methylation-specific PCR—PCR analysis was performed as previously described (40Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). 2 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by using PCR master mix (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), containing 25 units/ml of TaqDNA polymerase, 400 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 μm of each primer. The amplification program was as follow: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The primers used for K10 amplification (M: methylation specific, U: specific for unmethylated sequence, W: unmodified specific) were the following: K10P MF (5′-AGTTTTCGTTTTCGTAGTCGTC-3′), K10P MR (5′-CGAATATAACCTCACCCCG-3′), K10P UF (5′-GGAGTTTTTGTTTTTGTAGTTGTT-3′), K10P UR (5′-AACCAAATATAACCTCACCCCA-3′), K10P WF (5′-AGCTTCCGCCTCCGTAGCCGCC-3′), and K10P WR (5′-CGAATGTGACCTCACCCCG-3′). PCR products were loaded on a 1.8% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and were visualized under UV illumination. Genomic Methylation Level—A modification of the methyl-accepting assay (41Broday L. Lee Y.W. Costa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used to determine the methylation level of DNA isolated from HaCaT cells. DNA (200 ng) was incubated with 4 units of SssI methylases (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in the presence of 1.5 mm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine and 1.5 mm nonradioactive S-adenosylmethionine (New England Biolabs). The reaction mixtures (20 μl), in the manufacturer's buffer containing 0.1 μg of RNase A, were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reactions were terminated by adding 300 μl of stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mm EDTA, 5% 2-propyl alcohol, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mg of proteinase K per ml, 0.25 mg of carrier DNA per ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and was ethanol-precipitated. The recovered DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of 0.3 m NaOH and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was spotted on Whatman GF/C filter discs, dried, and then washed five times with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid followed by 70% (v/v) ethanol. Filters were placed in scintillation vials and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C with 500 μl of 0.5 m perchloric acid. Then, 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and the 3H incorporation was determined by a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Higher levels of [3H]methyl group incorporated into DNA were indicative of lower levels of genomic DNA methylation (41Broday L. Lee Y.W. Costa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assay of DNA Methyltransferase—Cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% sodium azide, 10% Tween-80, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. De novo methyltransferase activity was measured as previously described (42Xiong Y. Dowdy S.C. Podratz K.C. Jin F. Attewell J.R. Eberhardt N.L. Jiang S.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2684-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Adams R.L. Rinaldi A. Seivwright C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1991; 22: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cellular protein extracts (30 μg) were incubated in the presence of 3 μg of double-stranded oligonucleotides and 2.4 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 90 μl of stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mm EDTA, 3% (w/v) 4-amino salicylate, 5% butyl alcohol, 0.25 mg/ml calf thymus DNA, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubating at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction mixture was then spotted on Whatman GF/C filter paper discs (Fisher Scientific, East Brunswick, NJ), and filters were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed in 70% ethanol, and dried at 56 °C for 20 min. Finally, filters were submerged in UltimaGold scintillation mixture (Packard, Meriden, CT) and radioactivity was measured in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter (LS 5000TD). A blank control reaction was done simultaneously using cell extracts that were heated to 80 °C for 15 min to inactivate the methyltransferase activity. The results, expressed as counts per min (cpm), were corrected by subtracting the background level. Statistical Analysis—The data reported in this article are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations, each performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat 3 program (GraphPad Software for Science, San Diego, CA). AEA Inhibits Keratinocyte Differentiation by Regulating Gene Expression—Spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) can be induced to differentiate by treatment with TPA plus calcium (38Candi E.

Fig. 1 shows that, as expected, induction of differentiation of HaCaT cells for 5 days determines a significant increase in expression of genes known to be up-regulated during differentiation, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Notably, the increase in keratin 1 (K1), keratin 10 (K10), and transglutaminase 5 (TGase 5) (Fig. 1, A, B, D), which are all induced later during epidermal differentiation (38Candi E. Oddi S.

Crish J.F. Murthy S. Rorke E.A. Welter J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 613-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly AEA treatment significantly reduced activation of differentiating genes. In addition, we observed that the mRNA level reduction (∼50%) after AEA treatment was paralleled by a decreased protein level, at least in the case of K10 (Fig. 1E). These findings are well in line with our previous observation that AEA inhibits cornified envelope formation (24Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33896-33903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and suggest that AEA is able to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation by modifying the gene expression profile of these cells. Inhibition of DNA Methylation Prevents the Effects of AEA on Gene Expression—Because it has been shown that DNA methylation levels change during keratinocyte differentiation (32Veres D.A. Wilkins L. Coble D.W. Lyon S.B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that inhibitors of methylation promote this phenomenon (33Rosl F. Durst M. Hausen Zur H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that AEA was affecting gene expression levels through alteration of DNA methylation. Treatment of HaCaT cells with TPA plus calcium in the presence of 1 μm 5AC, an inhibitor of DNA methylation (48Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 49Santi D.V. Norment A. Garrett C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6993-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in K10 expression, as compared with cells treated only with TPA plus calcium, suggesting that inhibition of DNA methylation allows increased transcription of this gene (Fig. 2). Most importantly, treatment with 1 μm 5AC abolished the effect of AEA on K10 expression levels, which were comparable to those of cells differentiated without AEA (Fig. 2). These data strongly suggest that inhibition of differentiation by AEA occurs through changes in chromatin methylation patterns, because inhibition of DNA methylation is sufficient to prevent AEA effects on keratinocyte differentiation. AEA Decreases Gene Transcription by Inducing DNA Methylation—To validate the hypothesis that AEA could change DNA methylation levels in the K10 locus, we used a DNase I sensitivity assay, by which we tested nuclease accessibility in nuclei isolated from HaCaT cells. Proliferating cells exhibited marked resistance to increasing concentrations of DNase I compared with differentiating cells (Fig. 3A), where K10 gene was completely digested with one enzyme unit. As expected, treatment with 1 μm 5AC enhanced the sensitivity to DNase I treatment by reducing the methylation levels. Consistent with its possible role in regulating methylation levels, treatment of differentiating cells with AEA induced a strong resistance to DNase I digestion. Once again, 5AC was able to revert this effect, confirming a role for methylation in the activity of AEA on keratinocyte differentiation. To further confirm that the observed changes i"
https://openalex.org/W2061032348,"NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motif. Screening of a comprehensive human SH3 phage library revealed the N-terminal SH3 of Crk and CrkL as the preferred binding partners. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding of NS1 proteins of the 1918 virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain to Crk/CrkL SH3 but not to other SH3 domains tested, including p85α and p85β. Endogenous CrkL readily co-precipitated NS1 from cells infected with the H7N3 virus. In transfected cells association with CrkL was observed for NS1 of the 1918 and H7N3 viruses but not A/Udorn/72 or A/WSN/33 NS1 lacking this sequence motif. SH3 binding was dispensable for suppression of interferon-induced gene expression by NS1 but was associated with enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host cell signaling. NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motif.

Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host cell signaling. Pandemic as well as seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus represent major threats to global public health. In the last century three major pandemics have occurred, in 1918, 1957, and 1968, caused by H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian flu), and H3N2 (Hong Kong flu) viruses, respectively. Of these, the Spanish flu was the most severe and is estimated to have caused over 40 million deaths worldwide (1Subbarao K. Swayne D.E. Olsen C.W. Kawaoka Y. Influenza Virology: Current Topics. Caister Academic Press, Wymondham, UK2006: 229-280Google Scholar). Recent human infections by highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A viruses have increased the concern that another global pandemic may occur. Influenza A virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family of enveloped viruses. Its genome is organized into eight single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments that code for 11 identified viral proteins (2Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1487-1531Google Scholar). NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is encoded by the shortest RNA segment 8. It is expressed early in viral replication cycle, and it is not a component of the virus particle (2Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1487-1531Google Scholar). Instead, NS1 is a multifunctional virulence factor that promotes virus replication in the host cell and helps to evade antiviral immunity (3Garcia-Sastre A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 283: 249-280PubMed Google Scholar, 4Garcia-Sastre A. Biron C.A. Science. 2006; 312: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 5Krug R.M. Yuan W. Noah D.L. Latham A.G. Virology. 2003; 309: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In particular, NS1 uses several mechanisms to prevent suppression of influenza A virus replication by the type I interferon system of the host. Recent studies have demonstrated that during influenza A virus infection NS1 protein activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 3The abbreviations used are:SH3Src homology 3PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseIFNinterferonMBPmaltose-binding proteinTBSTris-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininISREinterferon-stimulated response elementWTwild type.3The abbreviations used are:SH3Src homology 3PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseIFNinterferonMBPmaltose-binding proteinTBSTris-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininISREinterferon-stimulated response elementWTwild type. signaling pathway, apparently via its association with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (6Shin Y.K.

Activation of the PI3K pathway seems to be important for influenza A virus replication, because in cell culture studies recombinant viruses with mutations that prevented binding of NS1 to p85 formed much smaller plaques and grew to 10-fold lower titers than the wild-type virus (9Hale B.G.

Moreover, compounds that inhibit PI3K can strongly suppress influenza A virus replication (7Ehrhardt C. Marjuki H. Wolff T. Nurnberg B. Planz O. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. Cell.

This tyrosine lies in the context similar to a YXNM motif, which upon tyrosine phosphorylation can serve as a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of p85 (11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar), but apparently NS1 interacts with p85β in an SH2-independent manner (12Hale B.G. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Randall R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 1372-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, p85 contains an SH3 domain, and Zhou and co-workers (6Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have suggested that a PXXP sequence in NS1, which resembles the consensus of an SH3-binding motif (see below), may also contribute to the p85 interaction. SH3 domains are small protein modules that mediate inter- and intramolecular protein interactions and are often found in proteins regulating cellular signaling pathways, cytoskeletal organization, and membrane trafficking (14Li S.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Mayer B.J. Saksela K. Cesareni G. Gimona M. Sudol M. Yaffe M. Structure and Function of Modular Protein Domains. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004: 37-58Google Scholar). SH3 domains recognize short proline-rich sequences, which are typically characterized by (+)-XΦPXXP (class I) or PXΦPX-(+) (class II) consensus sequences (where X is any amino acid; (+) indicates a positively charged residue; and Φ indicates a hydrophobic residue) (15Mayer B.J.

Since the discovery that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pathogenicity factor Nef regulates the host cell via binding to SH3 domains of Src family protein kinases (18Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), SH3 domain binding capacity has been demonstrated for many other proteins encoded by viral as well as bacterial pathogens (19Tan S.L.

We noted that, unlike most other NS1 proteins from human strains of influenza, the NS1 sequence of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18/H1N1 (25Basler C.F. Reid A.H. Dybing J.K.

Denson J. Mehta P.K. Su X. Mukatira S. Finkelstein D.B. Xu X. Wang J. Ma J. Fan Y. Rakestraw K.M. Webster R.G. Hoffmann E. Krauss S. Zheng J. Zhang Z. Naeve C.W. Science. 2006; 311: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We have recently generated an essentially complete (n = 296) collection of human SH3 domains in the form of a phage display library to allow comprehensive and unbiased identification of preferred SH3 partners for cellular and viral ligand proteins of interest (27Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study we have made use of this novel research tool to identify the Crk family adapter proteins as high affinity ligands for the NS1 protein of the 1918 virus. Cells and Viral Infections—Human embryonic kidney 293FT, human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7, and human A549 lung carcinoma cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 0.6 μg/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm glutamine. Influenza A virus strains A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (H7N3) and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) were grown in 11-day-old embryonated eggs, and the virus stock was aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. The hemagglutination titers of the viruses were 256, and their infectivity in A549 cells was 1 × 107 and 2 × 107 plaque-forming units per ml, respectively. Virus infection of A549 cells was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for 20 h at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. To metabolically label virus-infected cells with [35S]methionine, the cells were washed with and changed into methionine-free media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mCi of [35S]Met (GE Healthcare) 4 h after infection and grown for an additional 16 h. At 20 h after infection cells were collected, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed. Plasmid Constructs—A synthetic gene fragment encoding A/Brevig Mission/1/18 NS1 was purchased from GENEART (Regensburg, Germany). A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000/H7N3 cDNA was cloned from total cellular RNA of virus-infected cells by standard methods. A/Udorn/72 and A/WSN/33 NS1 inserts were derived from pcDNA3.1-based constructs already described (28Melen K. Kinnunen L. Fagerlund R. Ikonen N. Twu K.Y. Krug R.M. Julkunen I. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5995-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To generate the mammalian NS1 expression vectors, these fragments were inserted into the EF1α enhancer-driven vector pEBB-mycN by PCR-mediated cloning and confirmed by DNA sequencing. pEBB-mycN is a derivative of pEBB (from Bruce Mayer, University of Connecticut) (29Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), in which translation starts upstream of the insert to include a Myc epitope-containing peptide (MEQKLISEEDLGS) at the N terminus. Codon changes to A/Brevig and A/Mallard NS1 gene were generated by overlap PCR mutagenesis, cloned into pEBB-mycN, and verified by sequencing. Bacterial GST and MBP fusion protein expression vectors for NS1 proteins were constructed by inserting the corresponding NS1 cDNAs into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) and pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs) vectors, respectively. To generate the plasmid p85α-BP, an oligonucleotide duplex encoding for the peptide CLNCFRPLPPLPPPPR (30Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was inserted into the polylinker of pMAL-c2x. A DNA fragment encoding for a 123-amino acid biotin acceptor domain from Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase (start, MKLK; end, IKIG) was PCR-amplified from the PinPoint-Xa1 T-vector (Promega) and inserted between the GST gene and the multiple cloning site of pGEX-4T1 to generate pGEX-PP. Codon optimized cDNAs for the SH3 domains of Crk, CrkL, p85α, p85β, and Eps8L1 derived from the human SH3 library (27Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were subsequently cloned in-frame after the biotin acceptor domain in pGEX-PP. To generate C-terminally biotinylated Crk and CrkL expression constructs, human CrkII and CrkL cDNAs with stop codons replaced by a KpnI site were fused with the above-described biotin acceptor domain fragment in pEBB. ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid contains a 30-bp interferon-stimulated response element-containing fragment from the ISG15 gene (31Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving firefly luciferase expression (obtained from J. Darnell Jr., Rockefeller University, New York). As a control for transfection efficiency and cell viability, we used the plasmid pcDNA-Renilla, which was created by inserting Renilla luciferase cDNA from pRL-null (Promega) into pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen). Antibodies and Other Reagents—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-Myc (Sigma), mouse anti-CrkL (Upstate), mouse anti-phospho-Akt(Ser-473) (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-NP (32Ronni T. Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Julkunen I. Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2764-2774PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and guinea pig anti-NS1 (28Melen K. Kinnunen L. Fagerlund R. Ikonen N. Twu K.Y. Krug R.M. Julkunen I. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5995-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Streptavidin IRDye800CW, IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, and IRDye680 goat anti-mouse IgG were from LI-COR Biotechnology. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Recombinant Proteins and Binding Assays—GST and MBP fusion proteins expressed from pGEX-4T1 and pMAL-c2x protein expression vectors were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Screening of the human SH3 phage library using the GST-NS1 fusion proteins was done as described previously (27Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein binding assay was done as in Kärkkäinen et al. (27Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with some modifications. MBP-NS1 proteins, MBP-p85α-BP, or plain MBP was coated on 96-well plates (200 ng/well). Wells were blocked with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h and washed twice with TBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). MBP proteins were then incubated with 2-fold dilutions of GST-biotin-SH3 domains in TBS for 1.5 h. Wells were then washed three times with TBST, followed by a 1-h incubation with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (1:2000 dilution in TBS; GE Healthcare). After three washes with TBST, 50 μl of substrate reagent ABTS Single Solution (Invitrogen) was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured 20 min later. Protein Pulldowns and Western Blots—For protein pulldown experiments, 293FT cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation method with 10 μg of NS1 expression vectors in 10-cm plates. For avidin pulldown experiments cells were transfected also with 3 μg of Crk or CrkL expression constructs encoding for C-terminally biotinylated proteins. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed on ice with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CrkL antibody and Dynabeads protein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) or avidin pulldowns with Tetralink tetrameric avidin resin (Promega). To examine the phosphorylation status of Akt, Huh-7 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 4 μg of Myc-tagged NS1 expression plasmids or empty plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection cells were lysed on ice with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and lysates were used for Western blotting to detect phospho-Akt or myc-NS1. Immobilon Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore) or Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) was used for detection. Reporter Gene Assays—To measure the activation of the ISRE promoter, Huh-7 cells were transfected in 12-well plates with 0.2 μg of ISRE-Luc, 5 ng of pcDNA-Renilla, and 1 μg of NS1 expression vectors or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 22 h post-transfection, the reporter gene was induced by treatment with 100 IU/ml of IFN-β (Betaferon, Schering) for 7 h. Cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity was measured using dualluciferase assay system (Promega) and Sirius luminometer (Berthold detection systems). Renilla luciferase construct was used as an internal control to normalize relative luciferase activity. Consensus SH3-binding Motif in NS1—To look for potential virally encoded ligands for cellular SH3 proteins, we used the ScanProsite search engine to identify consensus SH3 domain-binding motifs in viral protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL data base. One interesting protein that was noted to contain a perfect class II SH3-binding motif was NS1 of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18/H1N1; A/Brevig below). Analysis of NS1 protein sequences from other strains of influenza A revealed that this sequence motif is very common among avian influenza A viruses but only rarely found in viruses isolated from humans (Fig. 1). In addition to A/Brevig, only three other human-derived NS1 sequences containing this motif could be found from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource data base. Notably, two of these viruses represented recent zoonotic transmissions from birds with an H5N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/481/97/H5N1 (33Shaw M. Cooper L. Xu X. Thompson W. Krauss S. Guan Y. Zhou N. Klimov A. Cox N. Webster R. Lim W. Shortridge K. Subbarao K. J. Med. Virol. 2002; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) and an H7N3 virus (A/Canada/rv504/2004/H7N3 (26Obenauer J.C. Denson J. Mehta P.K. Su X. Mukatira S. Finkelstein D.B. Xu X. Wang J. Ma J. Fan Y. Rakestraw K.M. Webster R.G. Hoffmann E. Krauss S. Zheng J. Zhang Z. Naeve C.W. Science. 2006; 311: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar)). Accordingly, this sequence motif is not present in the NS1 proteins of human influenza A viruses commonly used for laboratory studies, such as A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) (see Fig. 1). Identification of SH3 Partners of NS1—To examine their SH3 binding potential and preferences, NS1 proteins encoded by A/Brevig and an avian strain containing the same consensus motif (A/mallard/Netherlands/12/00/H7N3; A/Mallard below) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and used as ligands for affinity screening of our comprehensive human SH3 phage display library (27Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both proteins bound avidly to SH3 clones in the library as compared with plain GST protein used as a control for nonspecific binding (not shown). Sequencing of the phagemid genomes obtained after a single round of affinity selection with these NS1 proteins revealed that more than 90% of the phages contained the N-terminal SH3 domain of the adapter protein Crk or its close homologue CrkL. To confirm and study in more detail the NS1/SH3 interactions revealed by phage screening, we generated recombinant GST fusion proteins of the N-terminal SH3 domains of Crk and CrkL. Because the SH3 of p85 has been suggested to bind to PXXP sequences found in many influenza A NS1 proteins (6Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) we also generated GST-SH3 fusion proteins of p85α and p85β. In addition, the SH3 of Eps8L1, which is known to prefer atypical PXXDY-containing ligands (34Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was included as a negative control. Between the GST and SH3 moieties in these fusion proteins, we inserted a biotin acceptor domain from P. shermanii transcarboxylase, which during expression in E. coli becomes efficiently biotinylated at a single lysine residue, and can be conveniently detected with avidin-based reagents (35Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As targets for these SH3 domains, we expressed maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion constructs A/Udorn, A/Mallard, and A/Brevig NS1 proteins. The latter were coated onto the bottom of 96-well plates and probed with serial dilutions of biotinylated Crk, CrkL, p85α, p85β, or Eps8L1 SH3 domains in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like sandwich assay. As shown in Fig. 2, SH3 domains of Crk and CrkL bound avidly to A/Mallard NS1-coated wells, showing significant binding signals even when tested at sub-micromolar concentrations (see Fig. 2A). By contrast, p85α and p85β SH3 domains were equally negative in binding to A/Mallard NS1 as was Eps8L1 SH3 or CrkL SH3 in binding to the control wells coated with plain MBP. Although the absolute binding to Crk/CrkL SH3 domains was slightly weaker, very similar results were obtained by using A/Brevig NS1 as the immobilized ligand (data not shown). In agreement with the lack of a consensus SH3-binding motif in A/Udorn NS1, none of the tested SH3 domains showed measurable binding to Udorn NS1 protein (Fig. 2B). To confirm the functionality of the p85 SH3 domain proteins used in this study, we fused MBP with a peptide (CLNCFRPLPPLPPPPR) that has been optimized for binding to p85α using phage display (30Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Positive binding to this peptide under identical assay conditions (Fig. 2C) indicated that the failure of p85α and p85β SH3 domains to bind to the NS1 proteins of A/Mallard and A/Udorn (Fig. 2, A and B) as well as A/Brevig and A/WSN (data not shown) was indeed a valid result and not because of a general lack of functionality of our p85 SH3 proteins. Binding of Crk and CrkL to NS1 in Transfected Cells—To extend these findings to full-length proteins expressed in human cells and to compare NS1-binding by Crk and CrkL, we generated expression vectors for these proteins tagged at their N termini with the transcarboxylase biotin acceptor domain. As in our previous studies on divergent protein interactions (36Kesti T. Ruppelt A. Wang J.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Tasken K. Saksela K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this strategy allowed sensitive and equal detection of the tagged Crk and CrkL proteins when co-transfected into 293FT cells together with NS1 proteins from different influenza A viruses (Fig. 3). To ensure equal detection of the different NS1 proteins used in this experiment, these expression constructs were tagged with a Myc peptide epitope. Similar expression of all NS1 proteins in the lysates of transfected cells and equal recovery of the biotinylated Crk and CrkL proteins using avidin-coated beads were observed, whereas the amounts of co-precipitated NS1 proteins differed dramatically (Fig. 3, top panel). Both Crk and CrkL associated strongly with A/Brevig and A/Mallard NS1 proteins, but they failed to co-precipitate any A/Udorn NS1. Binding to A/WSN NS1 was equally negative (data not shown). Thus, in good agreement with the recombinant protein data involving isolated Crk/CrkL SH3 domains, in transfected cells full-length Crk/CrkL proteins bound well to NS1 proteins containing a class II SH3-binding consensus site but not detectably to NS1 proteins lacking this motif. CrkL-NS1 Complex in Influenza A Virus-infected Cells—Because of the similar NS1 binding profiles of Crk and CrkL, lack of known differences in their cellular functions, and the availability of a good antibody against Crk, NS1 binding by CrkL was chosen as the subject of our subsequent studies. To examine whether binding of endogenous cellular CrkL with NS1 protein produced during influenza A virus infection could be demonstrated, we infected A549 cells with A/Mallard and examined the presence of NS1 in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from lysates of these cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, a readily detectable amount of NS1 co-precipitated from the A/Mallard-infected cells using the α-CrkL antibody, corresponding in intensity to the NS1 signal derived from a fraction of the total lysate equaling 10% of the fraction used for the α-CrkL immunoprecipitation. By contrast, no such signal was seen in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from uninfected cells or from control (α-HA) immunoprecipitates from the A/Mallard-infected cells, thus confirming the specificity of the observed CrkL/NS1 co-precipitation. A similar A549 infection experiment was carried out in which A/Udorn was included for comparison. Because of the sequence divergence of the A/Mallard and A/Udorn NS1 proteins, quantitative comparison of the expression levels of these proteins in their native form was not possible using any of the immunological reagents that we tested (data not shown). Therefore, we chose to infect A549 cells with matched titers of A/Mallard and A/Udorn viruses, and subjected the infected cells to metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. Because A/Mallard and A/Udorn NS1 proteins contain a comparable number of methionine residues, their presence in anti-CrkL immunoprecipita"

The major proteases cathepsin L1 (FheCL1) and cathepsin L2 (FheCL2) were recombinantly produced and biochemically characterized. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that residues at position 67 and 205, which lie within the S2 pocket of the active site, are critical in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity. FheCL1 exhibits a broader specificity and a higher substrate turnover rate compared with FheCL2. However, FheCL2 can efficiently cleave substrates with a Pro in the P2 position and degrade collagen within the triple helices at physiological pH, an activity that among cysteine proteases has only been reported for human cathepsin K. The 1.4-A three-dimensional structure of the FheCL1 was determined by x-ray crystallography, and the three-dimensional structure of FheCL2 was constructed via homology-based modeling. Analysis and comparison of these structures and our biochemical data with those of human cathepsins L and K provided an interpretation of the substrate-recognition mechanisms of these major parasite proteases. Furthermore, our studies suggest that a configuration involving residue 67 and the gatekeeper residues 157 and 158 situated at the entrance of the active site pocket create a topology that endows FheCL2 with its unusual collagenolytic activity. The emergence of a specialized collagenolytic function in Fasciola likely contributes to the success of this tissue-invasive parasite."

ABCE1 is a 68-kDa ABC enzyme consisting of a cysteine-rich N-terminal region followed by two ABC type nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The crystal structure of this tandem cassette NBD region of ABCE1 has been determined (20Karcher A. Buttner K. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Hopfner K.P.

The highly conserved cysteine-rich N-terminal region of ABCE1 is unique among ABC enzymes. Sequence analysis as well as genetic interactions with iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) cluster biogenesis enzymes indicated that this motifs of yeast ABCE1 are [Fe-S] binding sites most likely comprising a ferredoxin-like fold and coordination (15Kispal G.

[Fe-S] clusters, composed of non-heme iron and acid-labile inorganic sulfide, constitute one of the most ancient, widely distributed, and structurally and functionally diverse class of prosthetic groups. [Fe-S] clusters can occur in a variety of stoichiometries, including [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters. Many [Fe-S] clusters mediate electron transfer in redox reactions. However, other functions can include fold stabilization, substrate binding, and substrate activation (33Rees D.C. Howard J.B.

Mutations in the predicted [Fe-S] cysteine ligands of the ABCE1 in general lead to cell inviability in yeast, demonstrating that not only the NBDs but also the cysteine-rich domain is essential for ABCE1 function (15Kispal G.

Thus, a structural framework for this domain and its physical and functional interaction with the NBDs is the key for understanding the biochemical function of ABCE1. To derive the complete multidomain functional architecture of ABCE1, we determined the crystal structure of the complete ABCE1 protein from Pyrococcus abyssi in complex with Mg2+ and ADP to 2.8 Å resolution. The fold and double [4Fe-4S] binding environment of the N-terminal FeS domain is structurally similar to bacterial-type ferredoxin domains, which are found in a variety of oxidoreductases. However, the FeS domain of ABCE1 also possesses some uncharacteristic features, such as unique loop insertions that could indicate functional sites. The short 12 Å distance of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters, typically associated with efficient electron transfer reactions, raises the possibility that ABCE1 is involved in an electron transfer process reaction. Protein Expression and Purification—The coding sequence of P. abyssi ABCE1 (pabABCE1) was amplified from genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides AAAAAAAACATATGGTGAGGAAAATGAGGATCGCG and TTTTTTGCGGCCGCGGCGTAGTAGTATTCTCCCCTTGC. The purified PCR product was cloned into a modified pET28 vector (Novagen). The vector pET28-N-strep containing the pabABCE1 gene was constructed in several steps. Two annealed oligonucleotides (5′-CATGGCTAGCTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAAGGCGCTCA-3′ and 5′-TATGAGCGCCTTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAGCTAGC-3′) that contain the DNA sequence for the short Strep-tag II peptide (MASWSH-PQFEKGAH) were ligated into a pET28 vector (Novagen) using NcoI and NdeI restriction sites. The coding sequence for pabABCE1 was inserted into the plasmid using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen, T7 promoter) cells were transformed with the resulting plasmid. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics to an A600 = 0.6-0.8. Gene expression was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol and disrupted by sonication. After sedimenting cell debris and other insoluble material, pabABCE1 was purified aerobically by heat denaturation of the lysate (70 °C for 10 min), Resource Q ion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity chromatography using standard/manufacturer suggested protocols. Reconstitution of the [Fe-S] Cluster—All experimental steps of the reconstitution procedure were made anaerobically inside a glove box (Coy Laboratories) in an atmosphere containing 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. The atmosphere contained less than 2 ppm 02, and all buffer solutions were degassed and pre-incubated in the glove box for at least 48 h. Purified pabABCE1 was transferred into the anaerobic chamber, and the buffer containing purified ABCE1 was exchanged to 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol using a disposable PD10 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). For reconstitution of the [Fe-S] cluster, pabABCE1 was concentrated to 5 mg/ml (1.5 ml) and incubated overnight at 6 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 2 mml-cysteine, 2 mm FeCl2, and 2.5-5 μm E. coli IscS (separately expressed and purified as described (36Cupp-Vickery J.R. Urbina H. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). Reconstituted pabABCE1 was purified in the anaerobic chamber by Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity chromatography. After buffer exchange (PD10, Bio-Rad) to 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, the protein was concentrated with Centricon-10 ultrafiltration units (Amicon) to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and used in crystallization trials. Crystallization, Crystallographic Data Collection, Model Building, and Refinement—pabABCE1 crystallized in the space group p43212 with cell dimensions a = b = 63.2, c = 319.4 Å. Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m calcium acetate (pH 7.3) and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350) and grew after incubation for several days at 20 °C under anaerobic conditions inside a glove box (Coy Laboratories). Crystals were transferred to a stabilizing buffer (0.2 m calcium acetate (pH 7.3) and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20% glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A data set to 2.8 Å resolution collected at beamline PX1 at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villingen, Switzerland) was processed with XDS (37Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Phases were determined by molecular replacement with the program MolRep (38N.

Electron density for the protein residues as well as for the two [Fe-S] clusters was clearly apparent in 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc density maps and was used to trace the missing N-terminal 75 residues with MAIN (39Turck, D.

Refinement included overall anisotropic B factor and bulk solvent corrections, simulated annealing, positional refinement, and restrained individual B factor refinement. The solvent was generated with CNS and verified by manual inspection. We omitted 5% of the reflection data from the beginning of refinement on to calculate Rfree for cross-validation.

After initial “brute force” alignment, the dynamic programming-based operator was used with standard settings. The quality and correctness of the alignment was verified by graphical inspection. Figures and Coordinates—Structural figures were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific). Purification and Reconstitution of the [Fe-S] Cluster Containing ABCE1—Initial attempts to crystallize full-length P. abyssi (pab)ABCE1 out of a standard E. coli overexpression system were unsuccessful, presumably because of incomplete [Fe-S] cluster formation and additional oxidation of the [Fe-S] clusters during protein purification. To facilitate [Fe-S] cluster formation during overexpression, we co-overexpressed the E. coli ISC (iron-sulfur-cluster) operon on a separate plasmid (41Kriek M. Peters L. Takahashi Y. Roach P.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we subsequently reconstituted/repaired the [Fe-S] clusters of the purified protein in vitro in an anaerobic chamber containing a 95% nitrogen plus 5% hydrogen atmosphere by adding the E. coli IscS protein (separately expressed and purified (36Cupp-Vickery J.R. Urbina H. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) along with Fe2+, cysteine, and pyridoxal phosphate. IscS catalyzes the formation of S2- from cysteine. S2- and Fe2+ assemble into the [Fe-S] clusters. The reconstituted ABCE1 showed a strong 418-nm absorption peak characteristic for proteins containing [4Fe-4S] clusters and was further used for crystallization. Crystallization and Structure Determination—pabABCE1 crystallized under anaerobic conditions in the space group P43212, with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The crystals diffracted x-rays to a resolution of 2.8 Å. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the previously determined pfuΔFeS-ABCE1 structure as the search model. The residues for the ironsulfur cluster domain (residues 1-75) along with two [4Fe-4S] clusters were clearly visible in 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps and could be readily interpreted (Fig. 1). The final model, refined at 2.8 Å resolution, comprised all 593 protein residues along with two Mg2+-ADP moieties, two [4Fe-4S] clusters, and 124 solvent molecules (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Structural overview. a, stereo plot of a ribbon representation of pabABCE1 with highlighted secondary structure (“top view”). The FeS domain is shown in green, along with Corey-Pauling-Koltun models of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters (red iron, yellow sulfur). The two nucleotide binding domains NBD1 and NBD2 are displayed in yellow and orange, respectively. NBD1 contains a helix-loop-helix insertion (HlH, blue). The two NBDs are oriented into the head-to-tail orientation by the ABCE1-specific hinge domain (pale blue). The FeS domain binds to NBD1 and is situated at the lateral opening of the nucleotide binding cleft.

It consists of four structural domains; that is, an N-terminal [Fe-S] cluster containing domain (FeS domain), two ABC ATPase-type nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), and a hinge domain (Fig. 2). The structures of the NBDs and the hinge region are similar to the equivalent regions in the previously reported structure of pfuΔFeS-ABCE1 and are described in detail in Karcher et al. (20Karcher A. Buttner K. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Hopfner K.P. Structure. 2005; 13: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NBD1 and NBD2 face each other in the typical head-to-tail orientation of ABC enzymes, creating a roughly 10-14-Å-wide interface cleft (backbone positions). This interface cleft harbors two composite ATP binding sites that are formed by the conserved Walker A, Walker B/D-loop, and Q-loop motifs of one NBD and the signature motif of the opposing NBD. In the obtained crystal form, both active sites contain an Mg2+-ADP moiety (or Ca2+-ADP because of the crystallization solution), retained from the heterologous expression (Figs. 1b and 2). Stably bound ADP molecules have also been found in other ABC-type ATPases (23Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 42Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and have been observed with other crystal forms of ABCE1 from different organisms (20Karcher A. Buttner K. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Hopfner K.P. Structure. 2005; 13: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 3A. Karcher, unpublished data. It is possible that nucleotide exchange in ABCE1 necessitates allosteric control by binding to a yet to be identified substrate or interacting partner, perhaps similar to the mismatch DNA provoked ADP → ATP exchange of the mismatch sensor MutS (43Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The orientation of NBD1 and NBD2 is mediated by the hinge domain, formed by highly conserved sequence regions between the two NBDs and at the C terminus of ABCE1 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). The hinge domain is tightly bound along the NBD1:NBD2 interface and may form a pivot point for the putative ATP-driven conformational changes between NBD1 and NBD2. The signature motifs, which bind to the opposing ATP γ-phosphates in the ATP-bound conformation of ABC enzymes, are ∼11 Å away from their expected position in the presence of ATP. Because mutations in both invariant serine residues of the signature motifs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RLI1p are lethal in S. cerevisiae (20Karcher A. Buttner K. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Hopfner K.P. Structure. 2005; 13: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is likely that the NBDs of ABCE1 undergo a tweezer-like motion similar to that of MalK (28Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The most intriguing and unique feature of ABCE1 is the FeS domain (residues 1-75, Fig. 2). The FeS domain is a small ellipsoid domain of 20 Å × 20 Å - 30 Å dimensions. It is positioned at the lateral opening of the cleft between NBD1 and NBD2 and directly binds to the outside of Lobe I of NBD1 (β5, β6, β11, β12). We observe no direct contacts of the FeS domain to the clamp and NBD2. However, lobe II of NBD2 and the FeS domain are only separated by 5 Å, and it is possible that the FeS domain also interacts with NBD2 during the ATP-dependent conformational cycle of ABCE1. The FeS Domain Has a Ferredoxin-fold and Possesses Two [4Fe-4S] Clusters—The structure of ABCE1 reveals that the FeS domain has the (βαβ)2 fold of the “bacterial type” ferredoxins (Fig. 4a). Ferredoxins function as electron-transfer mediators in diverse biological redox systems and are grouped into “plant” and bacterial types (44Sticht H. Rosch P. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

The major Ptd-l-Ser binding function of lactadherin has been localized to its C2 domain, which shares homology with the C2 domains of blood coagulation factor VIII and factor V. Correlating with this homology, purified lactadherin competes efficiently with factors VIII and V for Ptd-l-Ser binding sites, functioning as a potent anticoagulant. We have determined the crystal structure of the lactadherin C2 domain (Lact-C2) at 1.7Å resolution. The bovine Lact-C2 structure has a β-barrel core that is homologous with the factor VIII C2 (fVIII-C2) and factor V C2 (fV-C2) domains. Two loops at the end of the β-barrel, designated spikes 1 and 3, display four water-exposed hydrophobic amino acids, reminiscent of the membrane-interactive residues of fVIII-C2 and fV-C2. In contrast to the corresponding loops in fVIII-C2 and fV-C2, spike 1 of Lact-C2 adopts a hairpin turn in which the 7-residue loop is stabilized by internal hydrogen bonds. Further, central glycine residues in two membrane-interactive loops may enhance conformability of Lact-C2 to membrane binding sites. Mutagenesis studies confirmed a membrane-interactive role for the hydrophobic and/or Gly residues of both spike 1 and spike 3. Substitution of spike 1 of fVIII-C2 into Lact-C2 also diminished binding. Computational ligand docking studies identified two prospective Ptd-l-Ser interaction sites.

Lactadherin is a Mr 47,000 glycoprotein that was identified as a component of milk fat globules. Lactadherin has been known as PAS-6/7, indicating the two glycosylation variants (1Hvarregaard J.

The C domains of lactadherin share homology with each other and with the discoidin family of lectin domains, including the lipid-binding “C” domains of blood coagulation factor VIII and factor V (2Stubbs J.

Despite similar nomenclature, these C domains do not share sequence homology with the Ca2+-binding C2 domains of synaptotagmin, protein kinase C, or phospholipase C.

The demonstrated functions of lactadherin relate to binding Ptd-l-Ser and/or the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins.Lactadherin binds to the phospholipid bilayer that surrounds the central triglyceride droplet of milk fat globules, apparently stabilizing the bilayer (3Butler J.E. Pringnitz D.J. Martens C.L. Crouch N. Differentiation. 1980; 17: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lactadherin is also found within milk ductules of the mammary gland, localized on the apical portion of secretory epithelium (3Butler J.E. Pringnitz D.J. Martens C.L. Crouch N. Differentiation. 1980; 17: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During breast involution, lactadherin bridges Ptd-l-Ser on fat globules and apoptotic epithelial cells to integrins on phagocytic cells, mediating apoptotic clearance (14Hanayama R. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16886-16891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lactadherin secreted by macrophages aids clearance of apoptotic lymphocytes, bridging exposed Ptd-l-Ser of the dying cells and macrophage integrin(s) (7Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 15Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miyasaka K. Aozasa K. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2004; 304: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Aging mice that are deficient in lactadherin develop splenomegaly and immune complex glomerulonephritis, apparently because of impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphocytes (15Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miyasaka K. Aozasa K. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2004; 304: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Recently, lactadherin has been found to be associated with accelerated athero-sclerosis in mice (16Ait-Oufella H. Kinugawa K. Zoll J. Simon T. Boddaert J. Heeneman S. Blanc-Brude O. Barateau V. Potteaux S. Merval R. Esposito B. Teissier E. Daemen M.J. Leseche G. Boulanger C. Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2168-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Lactadherin of humans was also found to bind to and help the clearance of amyloid β-peptide, which implied a possible means of controlling overproduction of amyloid β-peptide, the hallmark of Alzheimer disease (17Boddaert J. Kinugawa K. Lambert J.C. Boukhtouche F. Zoll J. Merval R. Blanc-Brude O. Mann D. Berr C. Vilar J. Garabedian B. Journiac N. Charue D. Silvestre J.S. Duyckaerts C. Amouyel P. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).We have recently found that purified lactadherin functions as a potent anticoagulant (18Shi J. Gilbert G.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 2628-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and as a reagent for detection of Ptd-l-Ser exposure early in apoptosis of immortalized leukemia cells (19Shi J. Shi Y. Waehrens L.N. Rasmussen J.T. Heegaard C.W. Gilbert G.E. Cytometry. 2006; 69: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Homology between the lactadherin C domains and those of factor VIII and factor V correlates with the capacity of lactadherin to compete efficiently for membrane binding sites on Ptd-l-Ser-containing membranes. The capacity for effective competition is explained, in part, by stereoselective binding of Ptd-l-Ser (20Shi J. Heegaard C.W. Rasmussen J.T. Gilbert G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1667: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Lactadherin inhibits the factor Xase complex, in which factor VIII functions, and the prothrombinase complex, in which factor V functions. Interestingly, factor V and factor VIII do not compete efficiently with each other for membrane binding sites (21Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Barter S. Clouse S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15861-15868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gilbert G.E. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17261-17268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas lactadherin displaces both with half-maximal displacement at 1-4 nm (18Shi J. Gilbert G.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 2628-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Lactadherin also competes for membrane binding sites of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins, inhibiting the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. The coagulation inhibitory properties and Ptd-l-Ser-detecting properties of lactadherin contrast with those of annexin V and other tested Ptd-l-Ser-binding proteins. The chief difference is that lactadherin binds to membranes with Ptd-l-Ser content below the threshold for annexin V and competes for most or all of the membrane binding sites. Annexin V and other Ptd-l-Ser-binding proteins have a more limited capacity for competition (18Shi J. Gilbert G.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 2628-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the capacity of lactadherin to interact with a range of Ptd-l-Ser-containing binding sites and to compete efficiently with coagulation proteins is an unusual feature.Crystal structures have been published for the C2 domains of both factor V (fV-C2) (13Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and factor VIII (fVIII-C2) (23Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The common feature is a β-barrel core with three relatively long loops protruding from one end. Both fV-C2 and fVIII-C2 have 3-4 water-exposed hydrophobic residues protruding from long loops, leading to a hypothesis that membrane binding is mediated by insertion of these residues into the membrane. Functionality of these hydrophobic residues has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (24Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Gilbert G.E. Kaufman R.J. Arena A.A. Miao H. Pipe S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6374-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The crystal structures have also provided a basis for speculation as to the amino acids that interact with the hydrophilic head group of Ptd-l-Ser. The mutagenesis experiments have not provided support for the proposed Ptd-l-Ser-binding head group binding sites. Sequence homology between lactadherin C2 domain (Lact-C2) and fV-C2/fVIII-C2 (Fig. 1A) predicts that Lact-C2 will also adopt a central β-barrel motif and have relatively long loops that display potential membrane-interactive amino acids.Both fV-C2 and fVIII-C2 undergo conformational changes that are related to membrane binding. The conformational flexibility of fV-C2 is illustrated by the different conformation of the largest membrane-interactive loop in the three crystal structures (13Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Some conformational flexibility of fVIII-C2 is illustrated by comparison of this crystal structure with the co-crystal of fVIII-C2 with a monoclonal antibody B02C11. When fVIII-C2 is in complex with B02C11, the two strands of the third loop on the membrane-interactive surface rotated ∼70° (26Spiegel Jr., P.C. Jacquemin M. Saint-Remy J.M. Stoddard B.L. Pratt K.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). fVIII-C2 also undergoes a conformational change in response to ESH8, a monoclonal antibody with an epitope that does not overlap with B02C11 (27Saenko E.L.

Med. 1999; 9: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of ESH8-induced conformational change include increased affinity for von Willebrand factor and decreased affinity for phospholipid membrane (27Saenko E.L. Shima M.

The conformational flexibility of both fVIII-C2 and fV-C2 suggests that the lactadherin C2 domain may also have conformational flexibility that could impact membrane-binding functionality.We have determined the crystal structure of the Lact-C2. The results demonstrate a β-barrel core very similar to those of fV-C2 and fVIII-C2 and several hydrophobic amino acids on the membrane-interactive surface. However, one of the membrane-interactive loops of Lact-C2 has a markedly different structure than the corresponding loop structures of either fV-C2 or fVIII-C2. Strategically placed glycine residues appear likely to enhance local flexibility. The membrane binding involvement of the hydrophobic residues and glycines has been tested by mutagenesis studies followed by membrane binding assays. Conformational docking studies, utilizing the Autodock software package, have identified two hypothetical Ptd-l-Ser binding sites that differ from the previously proposed Ptd-l-Ser binding sites on either fVIII-C2 or fV-C2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Purification of the C2 Domain of Lactadherin—The C2 domain of bovine lactadherin was cloned by PCR from a bovine mammary gland library (Stratagene). Forward and reverse primer sequences were 5′-CCCTTGGAGACGAGTATGTGAGAC and 5′-CGGCCAGGCCTACCACTAACAG, respectively. The product was ligated into the Topo 2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and then excised and cloned into the pET28 bacterial expression vector (Novagen). Transformed E. coli were grown in 400 ml of LB media in a 2.5-liter low profile culture flask and cultured at 37 °C with constant shaking until the A600 reached 1.0. Cultures were induced with 10 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C with constant shaking at 175 rpm. Cells were pelleted and frozen at -20 °C overnight and then lysed in B-PER (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) and eluted with a step gradient of 4, 8, 30, 100, and 200 mm imidazole with 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Lact-C2 eluted primarily at 200 mm imidazole. Total protein of all fractions was analyzed with the micro-BCA assay (Pierce). The peak fractions were analyzed on a LabChip BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) for appropriately sized protein bands. Positive fractions were pooled and subjected to thrombin cleavage at room temperature for 2 h to remove the His6 tag (17.5 μg of thrombin/mg of total protein). Thrombin was inactivated by the addition of 3:1 molar ratio of PPACK (Calbiochem). Cleavage was assessed by LabChip BioAnalyzer analysis. The product was then concentrated on an Ultrafree-15, molecular weight cut-off 10,000 concentrator (Millipore, Inc.) and further purified by gel filtration over Sephadex G50, medium size (AP Biotech or Sigma). The resulting purified C2 domain eluted as a single peak with the LabChip BioAnalyzer with a molecular weight less than the uncleaved product by 3000, corresponding to the engineered cleavage peptide. The protein concentration was determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 44,620 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm.Fluorescence Labeling of Lact-C2—One milligram of pure Lact-C2 was labeled with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the removal of free fluorescein by gel filtration followed by buffer exchange on an Ultrafree-15 concentrator, the labeling efficiency was determined by comparison of absorbance at 280 nm versus absorbance at 488 nm, correcting for the absorbance of fluorescein at 280 nm. The molar ratio of fluorescein/Lact-C2 was 1.4. The labeled Lact-C2 is referred to hereafter as Lact-C2FITC.Liposphere Membrane Binding Assay—Glass microspheres of 1.6-μm nominal diameter (Duke Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) were cleaned, size-restricted, and covered with a phospholipid bilayer (lipospheres), as previously described (21Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Barter S. Clouse S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15861-15868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipospheres were washed three times in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.1% defatted bovine albumin, 10 μm egg PC as sonicated vesicles; stored at 4 °C; and used within 8 h of synthesis. Lact-C2FITC was incubated with lipospheres for 10 min at room temperature, and membrane-bound Lact-C2FITC was measured by flow cytometry. This procedure was performed on 150-μl aliquots with an approximate liposphere concentration of 1 × 106/ml using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data acquisition was triggered by forward light scatter with all photomultipliers in the log mode. Noise was reduced during analysis by eliminating events with forward and side scatter values different from those characteristic of the lipospheres. Geometric mean log fluorescence was converted to linear fluorescence for values depicted in the figures. Only experiments in which the fluorescence histogram indicated a log normal distribution, as judged by inspection, were analyzed quantitatively. Flow cytometry experiments were performed in 0.14 m NaCl, 0.02 m Trizma (Tris base)-HCl, 0.1% bovine albumin, pH 7.5.Crystallographic Analysis—Crystals of lactadherin C2 were grown at 17 °C by vapor diffusion in a hanging drop against a reservoir solution containing 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 10% isopropyl alcohol. The tiny crystals initially obtained were used subsequently as seeds to produce diffraction quality crystals.Crystallographic data were collected on an R-axis IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator. Crystals were cooled to 80-100 K in a nitrogen gas stream prior to collection. The isopropyl alcohol content in the crystallization drop was sufficient for cryoprotection. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the DENZO and SCALEPACK software packages (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Lact-C2 Mutants—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create an EcoRI-HindIII PCR fragment corresponding to Lact-C2 in which the codons targeted for substitution were mutated to GCX, predicting an amino acid substitution of alanine. For the third mutant, the primer pair 5′-TTTTCTCGAGCTACTACAAAAACA TGTTCGCTAGCTGGTTTCCCTAC and 5′-TTTTCTCGAGGCTGTGATCTGCTTGTTGGG was utilized to change the native sequence of WGLSAF from spike 1 to a predicted amino acid sequence of MFA. After ligation of the PCR fragments using XhoI, the mutagenized and EcoRI- and HindIII-digested fragments were then ligated into EcoRI- and HindIII-digested pET28a vector. The resulting mutants were expressed as described above. Purification differed in that the cells were sonicated in a lysis buffer of 0.7% Sarkosyl, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 17 mm NaH2PO4, 68 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; the elution buffer was 300 mm imidazole in the lysis buffer at pH 8.0. Buffer exchange was effected utilizing Ultrafree-15, molecular weight cut-off 10,000 concentrators into 20 mm ethanolamine, 25 mm NaCl, pH 9.0. Mutants were loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted utilizing a 20-ml continuous gradient to 1 m NaCl, 20 mm ethanolamine, pH 9.0. The mutants each eluted as a single major peak. Absorbance of ultrafiltrates from these samples at 234, 220, and 200 nm (see below) versus control spectra from Sarkosyl in the same buffer indicated that the free residual Sarkosyl concentrations were <10 μm, whereas the concentrations of all mutants were >10 μm. As a control for the purification conditions, purified Lact-C2 was transferred to the same elution buffer and repurified as described for the mutants. Lact-C2 prepared in this way was utilized for experiments depicted in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4Binding of Lact-C2 hydrophobic spike mutants versus Lact-C2 to membranes containing Ptd-l-Ser. A, emission spectra of phospholipid vesicles (PLV) alone (heavy solid line) or in the presence of 20 nm Lact-C2 (heavy dashed line). Control spectra are provided for buffer (dashed line) and buffer containing Lact-C2 (solid line). The dansyl emission of phospholipid vesicles increased ∼4-fold in the presence of Lact-C2. The phospholipid concentration was 3.0 μm small unilamellar vesicles of composition Ptd-l-Ser/dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/PC 20:5:75. Experiments were performed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Results are representative of four experiments. B, integrated fluorescence emission for Lact-C2 and three mutants. Fluorescence of phospholipid vesicles alone, corrected for the measured rate of photobleaching, were subtracted from each emission spectra collected as in A. The residual emission spectra were integrated from 450 to 600 nm. The results indicate that transferred fluorescence energy for mutants WGL and FG was reduced more than 90% and more than 95% for the mutant FVIII loop.

https://openalex.org/W2083662151,"Ferritin plays an important role in the storage and release of iron, an element utilized in cellular processes such as respiration, gene regulation, and DNA replication and repair. Ferritin in animals is composed of 24 ferritin L (FTL) and ferritin H (FTH) subunits in ratios that vary in different cell types. Because the subunits are not functionally interchangeable, both L and H units are critical for maintaining iron homeostasis and protecting against iron overload. FTL and FTH are regulated primarily at a post-transcriptional level in response to cellular iron concentrations. Individual regulation of FTL and FTH is of much interest, and although transcriptional differences between FTL and FTH have been shown, differences in their post-transcriptional regulation have not been evaluated. We report here that FTL and FTH are differentially regulated in 1% oxygen on a post-transcriptional level. We have designed a quantitative assay system sensitive enough to detect differences between FTL and FTH iron regulatory elements (IREs) that a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay does not. The FTL IRE is the primary responder in the presence of an iron donor in hypoxic conditions, and this response is reflected in endogenous FTL protein levels. These results provide evidence that FTL and FTH subunits respond independently to cellular iron concentrations and underscore the importance of evaluating FTL and FTH IREs separately.

Iron, although central to human health, is the keystone in many human diseases. Excess iron can contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to protein, lipid, and DNA damage (1Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5404) Google Scholar). Iron accumulation is a hallmark symptom of both aging and several neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, understanding the dynamic mechanisms of iron regulation may be the key to treatments and cures. The iron storage protein ferritin is pivotal to coordinating iron metabolism. Ferritin is composed of L and H subunits that, although highly conserved, are genetically separate (2Caskey J.H. Jones C.

Storage and protection of the iron prevents undesirable reactions of Fe+2 with oxygen, which may result in the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (7Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar, 8Powell A.K. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 515-561PubMed Google Scholar). Storage of the iron by ferritin also protects the cell against the formation of insoluble ferric oxide; blocking the oxidation of Fe+2 to Fe+3, a reaction otherwise favored at physiological pH and oxygen tension. Ferritin L (FTL) subunits, although void of catalytic activity, are thought to facilitate nucleation and mineralization of the iron center (9Levi S. Yewdall S.J. Harrison P.M. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). H and L subunits spontaneously assemble in a 24-subunit protein with a flexible H:L ratio (10Bomford A. Conlon-Hollingshead C. Munro H.N. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 1735-1739PubMed Google Scholar) but is usually consistent within a cell, except in the case of chronic iron overload (12Dickey L.F. Sreedharan S. Theil E.C. Didsbury J.R.

Effectively regulating subunit ratio as well as total ferritin is critical to cell survival. FTL and FTH subunits are not interchangeable, and FTL is unable to compensate for the function of FTH in knock-out mice (15Ferreira C. Santambrogio P. Martin M.E. Andrieu V. Feldmann G. Henin D.

Several studies have also uncovered a relationship between FTH and cancer (20Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), linking ferritin expression and cell proliferation (21Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Biasiotto G. Arosio P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanisms associated with differential regulation of FTL and FTH in disease are not well understood, highlighting the need for both focused research in the area and for more refined molecular tools to complete the task. Because iron must be both readily accessible for cell metabolism and easily stored to prevent cell damage, a tight hierarchy of ferritin transcriptional and translational regulation mechanisms exists (for review see Refs. 20Torti F.M.

Post-transcriptional control of both FTL and FTH is exerted by iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). IRP binding interactions with an iron regulatory element (IRE), a stem-loop structure in the 5′-untranslated region of the ferritin transcript, prevent translation of the transcript, and binding is in direct response to primary signals in the cellular environment, such as oxygen and iron concentration. IRE structures control the translational regulation of ferritin L and H. IREs are stem-loop structures 20–30 nucleotides in length with a conserved CAGUG apical loop sequence (25Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, an optional C-bulge is often found in the IRE sequence. This structure within the stem may be needed for efficient IRP binding (26Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Ferritin L and H IREs have only 49.5% identity, and because small changes in the nucleotide sequence in both stem and loop translate to larger changes in IRP binding ability (28Sierzputowska-Gracz H.

Biochemistry (Mosc). 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), differences in IRE structures may be the basis for differential translational regulation of L and H subunits. In turn, IRP1 and IRP2 are differentially sensitive to IRE structure (32Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 33Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 34Chen Y. Varani G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). IRP1 binding to the IRE encompasses the stem-loop (35Schlegl J. Gegout V. Schlager B. Hentze M.W. Westhof E. Ehresmann C.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); this, combined with sequence variation in the known IREs, suggests a physiological graded response to iron. To address this issue we designed a novel in vivo reporter system that isolates and quantifies IRE/IRP interaction, improving upon prior systems (38Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Henderson R.J. Patton S.M. Connor J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1743: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Goetze B. Grunewald B. Kiebler M.A. Macchi P. Sci STKE. 2003; 2003: PL12PubMed Google Scholar), with the advantages of co-expression from a bi-directional promoter in stably transfected cells. We exploited this reporter system to discern distinct differences in FTL and FTH translation in response to iron replete and iron deplete conditions in normoxic and hypoxic environments. We found that in lowered oxygen conditions (1% oxygen) FTL is the primary responder to an increase in iron concentrations on a translational level. This differential response was not seen in typical normoxic (20% oxygen) tissue culture conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify differential regulation of FTL and FTH at the translational level. Materials–Rabbit polyclonal antibody against FTL and mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin were from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against FTH was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The chicken polyclonal antibody against IRP1 was kindly provided by Dr. Betty Leibold (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against IRP2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (IRP-2 7H6). T7 RNAP, RNase A, RNase T1, and ribonucleotides were from Ambion (Austin, TX). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. All of the tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. Construction of Plasmids/Vectors–To isolate the post-transcriptional effects of IRP/IRE binding, a series of reporter constructs were assembled under the control of a bidirectional inducible tet promoter that connected the forward (hRLUC) and reverse (FLUC) genes (41Sammarco M.C. Grabczyk E. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our promoter system was designed to work with the constitutively expressed tet repressor expressed in the Invitrogen T-REx cell lines. Our promoter is “off” in the absence of doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative. Insertion of FTL and FTH IREs–The oligonucleotides FTLA1 (gatctgcggtcccgcgggtctgtctcttgc), FTLA2 (ttcaacagtgtttggacggaacagatccggggactctc), FTLB1 (tccaaacactgttgaagcaagagacagacccgcgggaccgc), and FTLB2 (ctagagagagtccccggatctgttccg) were annealed to form part of the human ferritin L chain 5′-untranslated region (AF117958) with sticky ends compatible with BamH1 and NheI. Oligonucleotides FTHA1 (gatctccgagagtcgtcggggtttcctgct), FTHA2 (tcaacagtgcttggacggaacccggcgctcgttccccaccc), FTHB1: (tccgtccaagcactgttgaagcaggaaaccccgacgactctcgg), and FTHB2 (ctagagggtggggaacgagcgccgggt) were similarly annealed to make part of the human ferritin H chain 5′-untranslated region (D28463). The control plasmid pBI-16 CON was digested with NheI and BamH1, which were immediately 5′ to hRLUC, and the annealed FTL and FTH oligonucleotides were inserted to make pBI-16-FTL and pBI-16-FTH, respectively. For gel shift templates, the annealed FTL and FTH oligonucleotides were inserted into BglII and XhoI cut pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI). The constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Transfections and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines– To integrate our constructs into a stable cell line in a consistent chromosomal location, we utilized the Invitrogen Flp-In T-REx system. To generate stable cell lines, Flp-In™ T-REx-293 cells were co-transfected with either pBI-16-FTL or pBI-16-FTH and the Flp™ recombinase plasmid pOG44 using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were not passaged more than five times before transfection. Stable integrants were selected by culture in hygromycin B (75 μg/ml) and blasticidin-HCl (15 μg/ml). Individual colonies were isolated and used for assays. All of the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). A minimum of 20 colonies for each construct was evaluated for comparable hRLUC/FLUC expression to determine that the cell lines used in our experiments were a valid representation of the indicated construct. Cell lines were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for 24 h before use in the luciferase experiments. Hypoxic samples were incubated in a Billups-Rothenberg hypoxia chamber (Del Mar, CA), in 1% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2. Dual Luciferase Assay–The dual luciferase reagent kit from Promega was used according to the manufacturer's directions. The cells were seeded in a 96-well solid-bottomed DYNEX Microlite TCT (tissue culture treated) white luminometer plate and induced with doxycycline for 24 h. After 24 h of induction, each well was washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen), and lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the luminescence assays were performed in a Turner Biosystems Veritas plate-reader luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA) with an integration time of 10 s according to the Promega dual luciferase reagent protocol. To make a positive control cell lysate, the BI-16-CON cell line was induced with doxycycline for 24 h, lysed in large quantities, and stored at –80 °C. Two 20-μl aliquots of the positive control were used in each plate for each luminometer assay. In addition, two 20-μl aliquots of a negative control lysate, made from the parental HEK 293 Flp-In™ T-REx cell line lacking luciferases, as well as two 20-μl reagent-only (no cell lysate) controls, were also included in each plate. The plates were kept protected from the light before initiating the luminometer assay. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR–HEK 293 cells were grown for 24 h under normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions, with no treatment (NT), 50 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), or 100 μm desferrioxamine (DFO). RNA was extracted from the cells and made into cDNA using Superscript III™ Celldirect cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturers protocol. Quantitative real time PCR was carried out in a Stratagene MX3000 sequence detection system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan primer sets designed for hRLUC and FLUC were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA) and used at a final concentration of 400 nm. The primer sets were: FLUC sense, aagattcaaagtgcgctgctggtg; FLUC antisense, ttgcctgatacctggcagatggaa; FLUC probe, 5′-FAM-tacacgaaattgcttctggtggcgct-TAMRASp-3′; hRLUC sense, aatggctcatatcgcctcctggat; hRLUC antisense, tggacgatcgccttgatcttgtct; and hRLUC probe, 5′-FAM-tggttcgagctgctgaaccttccaaa-TAMRASp-3′. The cycling conditions were 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 30 s. Standard curves for each primer set were made with dilutions of pBI-16 CON. The data were analyzed using the Mx3000P software (version 2.0). Immunoblots–HEK 293 Flp-In™ T-REx cells were plated at <50% confluency and treated the next day with complete medium (NT) or medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml FAC or 100 μm DFO. The cells were then grown under normoxic (20%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for 24 h. The cells were scraped and lysed in 2× Laemmli Buffer (20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, fresh 125 mm dithiothreitol). IRP1 and IRP2 Western blots were performed by loading 100 μg of protein on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel (37.5:1). FTL and FTH Western blots were performed by loading 40 μg of protein on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel (37.5:1). The proteins were transferred to Immobilon Psq membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer apparatus and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 20% evaporated Carnation milk/PBS mixture. Mouse anti-human IRP2 and chicken anti-rat IRP1 antibody were used at 1:500 and 1:1,000 dilutions, respectively. FTL and FTH rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:10,000 and 1:100,000 dilutions. Mouse anti-actin antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used as directed by the manufacturers, followed by visualization using ECL Advance™ (Amersham Biosciences). The images were obtained with the Kodak Gel Logic 440 imaging system (Rochester, NY) and analyzed with Kodak molecular imaging software (version 4.0). To compare the intensity of the bands under different treatment conditions, a reference lane was used. This reference lane was FAC (normoxia) for the FTL and FTH blots and no treatment (hypoxia) for IRP1 and IRP2 Western blots. The selection of the reference lane was based on the low (almost background) protein levels of the no treatment (normoxic) samples. Bandshift Assays–Unmodified Flp-In™ T-REx-293 cells were used for bandshift assays. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 60 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and 1:100 EDTA-free protease inhibitor in a 60-mm plate. The cells were lysed the day of the assay and were not subject to freezing to avoid destabilizing the cytosolic aconitase iron sulfur cluster. 12 μg of protein was used in each sample. [32P]RNA FTL and FTH transcripts were synthesized using XbaI-linearized pSP72/FTL/T7 or pSP72/FTH/T7 plasmid. Transcription reactions were performed using 5 μl (50 μCi) of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and 1 μl of T7 RNAP containing an RNase inhibitor (Ambion) was added to the probe mixture. The contents were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Following the incubation the reaction was filtered through a Sephadex G-50 fine exclusion column. Both FTL and FTH probes were made to the same specific activity. Bandshift assays were performed as described (42Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) with the following modification: a 4% acrylamide stacking gel was added to the 8% resolving gel. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. A portion of the probe sample amounting to 80,000 cpm was used in the bandshifts. 2.8% 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) was added to the 2ME control sample and incubated 10 min prior to adding the radioactive probe. 2 μl of the probe, diluted in lysis buffer, was added to each sample and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. 2 μl of RNase T1 1 unit/μl and 5 μl of RNase A (0.004 μg/μl) was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 min. 2 μl of heparin (50 μg/ml) was then added and followed by another 10-min room temperature incubation. Band intensity was quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Bandshift analysis was also performed with extracts from cell lines BI-16 CON, BI-16-FTL, and BI-16-FTH to confirm binding uniformity within the construct lines. Data Analysis–Upon testing our cell lines we found that there was variation between lots in the Promega dual luciferase reagent kit. To accommodate this variation, each individual hRLUC/FLUC data point was scaled according to the BI-16 positive control cell lysate included in each plate. Statistical significance between the means of different conditions was determined by applying an unpaired t test with no assumption of equal variance in the data. Aconitase Assay–In-gel aconitase activities were assayed as described (42Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were treated for 24 h in either normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. The cell culture medium was supplemented with either 50 μg/ml FAC or 100 μm DFO or was left untreated. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 4 mm citrate) and were kept on ice in aconitase loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue). DNA in the protein samples was sheared by passage through a 25-gauge syringe needle. 100 μg of lysate was separated on an 8% acrylamide gel (37.5:1) in aconitase gel buffer (132 mm Tris base, 132 mm borate, 3.6 mm citrate) with a 4% acrylamide stacking gel (19:1) (67 mm Tris base, 67 mm borate, 3.6 mm citrate). The gel was prerun for 30 min at 180 V and then run for 180 V for 3 h in aconitase running buffer (20.5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 3.6 mm citrate) at 4 °C after loading. The gel was then transferred to the aconitase overlay (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm NADP, 2.5 mm cis-aconitic acid, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide, 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate, 5 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase). The gel was incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the dark. The images were obtained with the Kodak Gel Logic 440 imaging system and analyzed with Kodak molecular imaging software (version 4.0). The assay was performed after mitochondrial isolation on both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions to confirm that cytosolic aconitase activity was being monitored (Data not shown). A Bidirectional Reporter System Accurately Reflects IRE/IRP Interaction–To isolate IRE/IRP regulation, we employed a dual reporter system using a control firefly luciferase (FLUC), co-expressed with a Renilla luciferase (hRLUC), linked to a 5′ IRE (Fig. 1A). Transcription of the reporters was controlled by a bidirectional, doxycycline-inducible promoter system of our own design (41Sammarco M.C. Grabczyk E. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The system was devised so that an IRP binds the IRE in the hRLUC mRNA and prevents translation but has no effect on the translation of the co-expressed FLUC RNA. The ratio of hRLUC:FLUC luminescence can be used to quantify collective IRE/IRP binding. To determine whether our constructs quantified the IRE/IRP response, as designed, we established stable HEK 293 cell lines that contained a single copy of a bidirectional construct (Fig. 1A) in a single chromosomal location. Flp-In cell lines with constitutive expression of the tetracycline repressor are readily available from Invitrogen as Flp-In™ T-REx 293 cells. In addition, IRP regulation in varying oxygen conditions cells had previously been assessed in HEK 293 (43Schneider B.D. Leibold E.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3404-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 44Hanson E.S. Rawlins M.L. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40337-40342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), facilitating data interpretation. Stable cell lines were made containing the FTL IRE (BI-16-FTL), the FTH IRE (BI-16-FTH), as well as a control cell line with no functional IRE (BI-16-CON) linked to the hRLUC reporter. The IRE bearing constructs differed by only a few base pairs (Fig. 1B), and each IRE was predicted to fold (45Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10253) Google Scholar) into similar stem-loop structures (Fig. 1C). Transcription of the reporters was induced with doxycycline, and the cells were treated with either 50 μg/ml of the iron donor, FAC, or 100 μm of the iron chelator, DFO, before incubation in typical tissue culture oxygen conditions (atmospheric 20% O2/5% CO2). The addition of 50 μg/ml FAC increased hRLUC translation, and the addition of 100 μm DFO decreased hRLUC translation in both BI-16-FTL and BI-16-FTH cell lines (Fig. 2A, normoxic samples) in accordance with the predicted IRE/IRP interaction. Relative hRLUC expression in the presence of DFO is higher in the BI-16-FTL cell line than in the BI-16-FTH cell line (p < 0.05). There was no difference between FTL and FTH cell lines with regard to the addition of FAC, or with no treatment at all. A slight decline in the luciferase expression ratio was observed in the DFO- and FAC-treated BI-16-CON samples compared with no treatment (p < 0.05). In the case of the DFO-treated samples, the slight decrease (11%) in relative hRLUC seen in BI-16-CON is eclipsed by the marked decrease seen in the BI-16-FTL and BI-16-FTH samples. This result is also consistent with previous findings that DFO treatment is associated with a small decline in other investigated protein levels (43Schneider B.D. Leibold E.A. Bloo"
https://openalex.org/W1974358011,"Protein phosphatase 2Cϵ (PP2Cϵ), a mammalian PP2C family member, is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in the negative regulation of stress-activated protein kinase pathways. We show that PP2Cϵ is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein with a transmembrane domain at the amino terminus and the catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain library using PP2Cϵ as bait resulted in the isolation of a cDNA that encoded vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA). VAPA is an ER resident integral membrane protein involved in recruiting lipid-binding proteins such as the ceramide transport protein CERT to the ER membrane. Expression of PP2Cϵ resulted in dephosphorylation of CERT in a VAPA expression-dependent manner, which was accompanied by redistribution of CERT from the cytoplasm to the Golgi apparatus. The expression of PP2Cϵ also enhanced the association between CERT and VAPA. In addition, knockdown of PP2Cϵ expression by short interference RNA attenuated the interaction between CERT and VAPA and the sphingomyelin synthesis. These results suggest that CERT is a physiological substrate of PP2Cϵ and that dephosphorylation of CERT by PP2Cϵ may play an important role in the regulation of ceramide trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.

Recently, evidence has accumulated that in mammalian cells VAPA participates in the regulation of inter-organelle transport of membrane lipids by recruiting lipid transfer proteins to the ER membrane. VAPA associates with a short, conserved peptide sequence termed the “two phenylalanines in an acidic tract” (FFAT) motif that is found in several lipid transfer proteins including ceramide transport protein CERT, oxysterol-binding protein, Opi1 protein, and PITP/Nir/rdgB families (4Brickner J.H.

In mammalian cells ceramide is synthesized in the ER and transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is converted to sphingomyelin (SM). The ceramide transport protein CERT plays a key role in the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (18Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 19Hanada K. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Kawano M. Biochim. Biophys.

CERT consists of several distinct domains including a Steroidogenic acute regulator-related lipid transfer (START) domain capable of specifically extracting ceramide from membrane, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that serves to target the Golgi apparatus by recognizing phosphatidylinositol 4-monphophatate, and a FFAT motif, which interacts with VAPA. In addition to these functional domains, CERT possesses a regulatory sequence referred to as a serine repeat (SR) motif between the PH domain and FFAT motif (21Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17758-17766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Ser/Thr residues of the SR motif are phosphorylated in vivo. These phosphorylation sites match the typical consensus motif for protein kinase CK1 in which Ser-132 would serve as priming phosphorylation site for sequential phosphorylation of down-stream Ser/Thr residues within the motif. Enhanced phosphorylation of these sites results in down-regulation of CERT activity; under such conditions ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus diminishes as a result of repression of both the ceramide transfer activity of the START domain and the phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate binding activity of the PH domain (21Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17758-17766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A loss of SM and cholesterol from the plasma membrane induces dephosphorylation of the SR motif, resulting in activation of CERT. However, the protein phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylation of CERT has not yet been identified. Protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) is a member of major protein serine/threonine phosphatase superfamily (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) conserved among eukaryotes. Thus far, 13 distinct PP2C homologs (PP2Cα, PP2Cβ, PP2Cγ/FIN13, PP2Cδ/ILKAP, PP2Cϵ, PP2Cζ, PP2Cη, PP2Cκ, Wip1, CaMKP/hFEM2/POPX2, CaMKP-N/POPX1, NERPP-2C, and SCOP/PHLPP) have been identified in mammalian cells (22Tamura.

In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that PP2Cs play important roles in the regulation of cellular functions such as stress response, cell cycle, cytoskeleton organization, mRNA splicing, and Wnt signaling (22Tamura.

PP2Cϵ was originally identified by us as a negative regulator of stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (28Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K.

Ectopic expression of PP2Cϵ in mammalian cells represses the activity of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 and apoptosis-regulating kinase 1, two mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases. PP2Cϵ keeps these kinases in an inactive state in quiescent cells by associating with and dephosphorylating them. PP2Cϵ associates with transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 and apoptosis-regulating kinase 1 in quiescent cells, but the association was transiently suppressed in response to treatment of the cells with interleukin-1 and H2O2, respectively, which activate these respective kinases. On the basis of these results we proposed that PP2Cϵ regulates transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 and apoptosis-regulating kinase 1 pathways by a common regulatory mechanism (28Li M.G.

J. 2007; 405: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PP2Cϵ has a unique hydrophobic region composed of 60 amino acids at the amino terminus whose function is not yet known. During the course of studies to elucidate the functional role of the amino-terminal region of PP2Cϵ, we noticed that PP2Cϵ is an ER resident integral membrane protein and identified VAPA as a binding partner of PP2Cϵ on ER. Furthermore, we obtained evidence suggesting that PP2Cϵ regulates CERT function through dephosphorylation of its SR motif. Materials—Restriction enzymes and other modifying enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Glutathione Sepharose-4B, protein G-agarose beads, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, ECL plus kit and l-[U-14C]serine were obtained from GE Healthcare. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA), anti-GST, anti-GS28, and anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GM130 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Complete protease mixture was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Production of Anti-PP2Cϵ Antiserum—Polyclonal antibodies recognizing PP2Cϵ were raised in rabbits against a mixture of the peptides QHLQDYEKDKENSVLC and CPLSHDHKPYQLKERKR (corresponding to residues 149-163 and 225-241 of mouse PP2Cϵ, respectively). Antibodies were affinity-purified on NSH-Sepharose covalently coupled to these peptides. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A cDNA encoding a dominant negative mutant of mouse PP2Cϵ(D302A) was cloned into the pGBK-T7 to produce “bait” vector. This construct was used to screen a human brain cDNA library in the pACT2 vector. The dominant negative mutant was used because it was expected to associate with its substrate more stably than the wild type in the cells (28Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12013-12021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In a screen of 1 × 106 library clones, 5 independent clones encoding human VAPA were isolated. Plasmid Constructs—Human VAPA and human CERT cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA of HEK293 cells. Plasmids expressing GST-VAPA and HA-CERT were prepared by inserting these cDNAs into pCX-GST-MS and pcDNA-HA-MS vectors, respectively. Plasmids expressing PP2Cϵ and PP2Cϵ-FLAG were constructed by inserting the PP2Cϵ cDNA into pcDNA-3 and pcDNA-MS-FLAG vectors, respectively. Plasmids expressing ΔN-PP2Cϵ and FLAG-ΔN-PP2Cϵ were constructed by inserting the PP2Cϵ cDNA encoding amino acids 58-360 into pcDNA-3 and pcDNA-FLAG-MS vectors, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to generate deletion mutants of PP2Cϵ and VAPA using the directed PCR method. To produce GFP fusion proteins, pEGFP-N3-M vector was used in which an inherent initiating ATG codon was mutated to GTG to prevent non-fused GFP protein from being produced. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. At ∼90% confluency, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. The total amount of DNA used for transfection was 1.6 μg per well of a 12-well plate. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24-48 h before harvest. Cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysate containing 200 μg of protein was incubated for 0.5 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads (5 μl). After washing the beads 5 times with lysis buffer, the bound protein was subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 0.5 h at 25 °C and developed by chemiluminescence using ECL plus kit. Dilution of antibody was 1:500 for anti-GST antibody, 1:1000 for anti-PDI, anti-HA, and anti-PP2Cϵ antibodies, and 1:2000 for horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The intensity of the band was quantified by imaging analyzer (FLA-7000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Subcellular Fractionation of Mouse Brain—Mouse brain (1.2 g) was homogenized in 3 volumes of solution A (0.32 m sucrose, 1mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min to eliminate nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. The precipitates containing mitochondria were resuspended in solution A. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to produce cytosol and microsomal fraction. The microsomal fraction was homogenized in solution A, and membrane proteins were extracted by the addition of 2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Isolation of Microsomal Membrane from Cultured Cells—The membrane fraction of cultured cells was prepared as described by Nohturfft et al. (30Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS and resuspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sorbitol, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture). The suspension was passed through a 23-gauge needle 25 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sorbitol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor) and centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 3 min. The resulting precipitates were resuspended in Buffer C to obtain the microsomal fraction. Fractionation by Triton X-114—Triton X-114 was added to the microsomal fraction at 4 °C to a final concentration of 2% (v/v) to solubilize the membrane proteins. The Triton X-114-treated sample was layered over a cushion of 0.25 m sucrose containing 0.06% (v/v) Triton X-114, incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 3 min at 300 × g. The supernatant and detergent layers were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteinase K Protection Assay—The microsomal fraction was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K with or without the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Proteolysis was stopped by adding 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—HEK293 cells (4 × 107) were homogenized with a buffer containing 0.1 m KH2PO4, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 m sucrose, passed through a 23-gauge needle 25 times, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was fractionated over sucrose gradients as described for bovine brain (31Walter D.M. Paul K.S. Waters M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29565-29576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, the postnuclear supernatant (1.8 ml) was overlaid on top of 0.86 m sucrose (1 ml) and 1.25 m sucrose (1 ml) step gradient. The gradient was centrifuged in a Hitachi RPS-56T rotor at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The 0.86/1.25 m interface was collected, adjusted to 1.6 m sucrose, and placed in the bottom of the tube followed by overlaying with 1.25 m (0.7 ml), 1.0 m (0.7 ml), 0.86 m (0.7 ml) and 0.5 m (0.7 ml) sucrose solutions. The gradient was centrifuged in a Hitachi RPS-56T rotor at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells seeded on coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine were fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at 25 °C. The coverslips were blocked by incubation with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min followed by 1 h of incubation with primary antibody (dilutions of antibody were 1:1000 for anti-PDI and anti-GM130 antibodies and 1:100 for anti-HA antibody). Cells were then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) for 1 h. The immunostained samples were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized by a confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM5, Oberkochen, Germany). All experiments were performed at least three times with the representative results presented. Knockdown of PP2Cϵ mRNA by Short Interference RNAs (siRNAs)—siRNAs against human PP2Cϵ were synthesized by Invitrogen. Nucleotide sequence of the sense strands of ϵ-3 and ϵ-4 are UAGCAGAGCAAUCAAACACGUUGUG and UGAUCAUGAGACAAAGGAAUAGCGU, respectively. The oligonucleotide (50 pmol) and plasmid (1.6 μg) were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 separately and mixed immediately before transfection to HeLa cells. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, total RNA was isolated, and the amount of PP2Cϵ mRNA was determined by real time PCR system (Takara TP-800, Tokyo, Japan). Metabolic Labeling of Lipid with [14C]Serine—The metabolic labeling of HeLa cells with radioactive serine was performed as described previously (11Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30279-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with siRNAs were incubated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min and then incubated in 1.5 ml of serum free medium containing 37 kBq of l-[U-14C]serine at 37 °C for 2 h. Labeled lipids extracted from the cells were separated on TLC plate (methyl acetate, n-propanol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% CaCl2 = 25/25/25/10/9) and quantified by FLA-7000 imaging analyzer. PP2Cϵ Is Localized in the ER—Unlike PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, whose subcellular localization and activities are controlled by separate regulatory subunits, the members of PP2C family are monomeric proteins and, therefore, are thought to contain distinct domains that influence the subcellular localization or function. In this context we noticed that PP2Cϵ has an aminoterminal non-catalytic region composed of about 60 amino acids in addition to the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain composed of about 300 residues. Because the amino-terminal region was hydrophobic, we speculated that this region might function as a membrane association domain. To test this possibility we transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid for either full-length PP2Cϵ or PP2Cϵ lacking the amino-terminal 57 amino acids (ΔN-PP2Cϵ) and separated the postnuclear supernatant of the cell extracts into cytosolic and membranous fractions. Western blot analysis using anti-PP2Cϵ antiserum revealed that the full-length PP2Cϵ localized to the membrane fraction, whereas ΔN-PP2Cϵ was recovered in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1a). These results suggest that PP2Cϵ is a membrane-associated protein and that the amino-terminal hydrophobic region is required for its membrane association. To determine the subcellular localization of endogenous PP2Cϵ, we separated the postnuclear supernatant of mouse brain extracts into cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. Western blot analysis demonstrated that endogenous PP2Cϵ was mainly localized in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 1b). We then carried out a sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing PP2Cϵ. As shown in Fig. 1c, PP2Cϵ was co-fractionated with PDI, an ER resident protein, but not with GS28, a Golgi marker protein. Furthermore, PP2Cϵ-GFP fusion proteins expressed in HEK293 cells exhibited a diffuse reticular pattern that overlapped with staining of PDI when observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that PP2Cϵ is an ER resident protein. PP2Cϵ Is a Type 1 Integral Membrane Protein of the ER—We next determined whether PP2Cϵ was an ER transmembrane protein, a peripheral membrane protein that associates with transmembrane proteins or a luminal protein that resides in the lumen of ER as a soluble protein. To this end, the microsomal fraction prepared from HEK293 cells expressing PP2Cϵ was treated with a high concentration of salt, alkali, or Triton X-100. Western blot analysis indicated that, whereas PP2Cϵ remained associated with the membrane fraction under a high salt concentration or alkaline conditions (Fig. 2a, lanes 2 and 3), it was solubilized upon treatment with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2a, lane 4), suggesting that PP2Cϵ is either a transmembrane or luminal protein. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the microsomal fraction prepared from HEK293 cells expressing PP2Cϵ was treated with Triton X-114, and the solubilized proteins were subjected to phase separation at 30 °C. PP2Cϵ was recovered in the detergent phase, which contains transmembrane proteins, but not in the hydrophilic phase, which is expected to contain luminal proteins (Fig. 2b). Thus, PP2Cϵ is likely to be a transmembrane (TM) protein. To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of PP2Cϵ projects into the cytosol or the ER lumen, we treated the microsomal fraction prepared from HEK293 cells expressing PP2Cϵ with proteinase K with or without Triton X-100. Our expectation was that, if the carboxyl terminus of PP2Cϵ faces the cytosol like SREBP1, it would be digested by proteinase K even in the absence of Triton X-100. However, PP2Cϵ would be digested by proteinase K only in the presence of Triton X-100 if its carboxyl-terminal region projects into ER lumen like PDI because it is protected from digestion by proteinase K. We found that PP2Cϵ was readily digested by proteinase K irrespective of the presence of Triton X-100, as was observed with SREBP1. This finding suggests that PP2Cϵ exists as a transmembrane protein whose carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain faces the cytoplasm (Fig. 2c). To further confirm the conclusion described above, we carried out the protease protection assay using the microsomal fraction prepared from the cells expressing GST-PP2Cϵ in which GST tag was fused to the amino terminus of PP2Cϵ. Although the majority of GST-PP2Cϵ expressed in the cells was recovered in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown), a significant amount of GST-PP2Cϵ was localized to the microsomal fraction (Fig. 2d, lanes 1 and 4). When immunoblotting was carried out using the anti-PP2Cϵ antibody after the protease digestion of the microsomal fraction, the bands of GST-PP2Cϵ were found to disappear upon the protease treatment (Fig. 2d, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, a faster migrating band whose molecular mass was 27 kDa appeared in accordance with the disappearance of the full-length GST-PP2Cϵ when stained with anti-GST antibody, indicating that GST portion (∼26.5 kDa) was protected from digestion by protease (Fig. 2d, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that the GST portion of the expressed GST-PP2Cϵ was localized in the microsomal lumen, whereas the carboxyl-terminal portion of the GST-PP2Cϵ existed outside of the microsome, supporting the conclusion that the amino-terminal region of PP2Cϵ functions as the TM domain. We were interested in identifying the TM domain of PP2Cϵ. To this end we expressed a series of amino-terminal deletion mutants of PP2Cϵ (Fig. 3a, Δ1-Δ7) in HEK293 cells and examined their subcellular localization. Of these mutants, Δ1, Δ5, Δ6, and Δ7 were localized only to the membrane fraction (Fig. 3b, lanes 2, 6, 7, and 8). Two mutants (Δ2 and Δ4) distributed equally to membranous and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3b, lanes 3 and 5). Most of mutant Δ3, which lacked amino acids between 26 and 45, exhibited cytosolic localization (Fig. 3b, lane 4). Because the region between amino acids 26 and 45 is predicted to form an α-helix (data not shown) and is rich in hydrophobic amino acids, it may function as a TM domain (Fig. 3a). To directly show that the amino-terminal region of PP2Cϵ is involved in the membrane localization, we constructed three GFP fusion proteins, N1-, N2-, and N3-GFP, which were composed of the amino-terminal regions of PP2Cϵ with three different leng"
https://openalex.org/W2081902464,"Although chromosome X open reading frame 6 (CXorf6) has been shown to be a causative gene for hypospadias, its molecular function remains unknown. To clarify this, we first examined CXorf6 protein structure, identifying homology to mastermind-like 2 (MAML2) protein, which functions as a co-activator in canonical Notch signaling. Transactivation analysis for wild-type CXorf6 protein by luciferase assays showed that CXorf6 significantly transactivated the promoter of a noncanonical Notch target gene hairy/enhancer of split 3 (Hes3) without demonstrable DNA-binding capacity. Transactivation analysis was also performed for the previously described three apparently pathologic nonsense mutations, indicating that E124X and Q197X proteins had no transactivation function, whereas R653X protein retained a nearly normal transactivation function. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that wild-type and R653X proteins co-localized with MAML2 protein in nuclear bodies, whereas E124X and Q197X proteins were incapable of localizing to nuclear bodies. Thus, further studies were performed for R653X, revealing the occurrence of nonsense mediated mRNA decay in vivo. Next, transient knockdown of CXorf6 was performed using small interfering RNA, showing reduced testosterone production in mouse Leydig tumor cells. Furthermore, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) protein bound to a specific sequence in the upstream of the CXorf6 coding region and exerted a transactivation activity. These results suggest that CXorf6 transactivates the Hes3 promoter, augments testosterone production, and contains the SF1 target sequence, thereby providing the first clue to clarify the biological role of CXorf6.

Because the mouse homolog (G630014P10Rik, NM_001081354) is transiently expressed in fetal Sertoli and Leydig cells around the critical period for sex development, it is likely that the CXorf6 mutations cause hypospadias primarily because of testicular dysfunction and the resultant compromised testosterone production around that period (3Fukami M.

Genet. 2006; 38: 1369-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, although various genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of hypospadias, it has been widely accepted that hypospadias can be caused by impaired testosterone effects around the critical period for sex development (4Baskin L.S. Ebbers M.B. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2007; 41: 463-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mouse homolog is co-expressed with steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1; aliases, AD4BP and NR5A1) (3Fukami M. Wada Y. Miyabayashi K. Nishino I. Hasegawa T. Nordenskjöld A. Camerino G. Kretz C. Buj-Bello A. Laporte J. Yamada G. Morohashi K. Ogata T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1369-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which regulates the transcription of a vast array of genes involved in sex development (5Morohashi K. Omura T. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 7Ozisik G.

Mastermind-like 2 (MAML2; alias, Mam-3) is a non-DNA-binding transcriptional co-activator in Notch signaling (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7688-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that plays an important role in cell differentiation in multiple tissues by exerting either inductive or inhibiting effects according to the context of the cells (10Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Upon ligand-receptor interaction, Notch intracellular domain (N-ICD) is translocated from the cell surface to the nucleus and interacts with a DNA-binding transcription factor, recombination signal binding protein-J (RBP-J), to activate target genes like hairy/enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) and Hes5 (11Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In this canonical Notch signaling process, MAML2 forms a ternary complex with N-ICD and RBP-J at nuclear bodies, enhancing the transcription of the Notch target genes (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2006; 124: 985-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, not all Hes genes are activated by the canonical Notch signaling pathway (11Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 15Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Among such a distinct class of Hes genes, recent studies have shown that Hes3 can be induced by stimulation with a Notch ligand, via a STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-mediated pathway (17Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Leker R.R. Soldner F. Hoeppner D.J. Ravin R. Poser S.W. Rueger M.A. Bae S.K. Kittappa R. McKay R.D. Nature. 2006; 442: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the lack of Hes3 induction by N-ICD (16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), implies that Hes3 represents a target gene of a noncanonical Notch signaling. Here, we report that CXorf6 produces a protein that has a structural homology with MAML2 and transactivates the Hes3 promoter activity and that CXorf6 is involved in testosterone production and harbors an SF1 target sequence. Structural Analysis of CXorf6 Protein—We searched BLAST and TBlastn data bases using the CXorf6 protein sequence (NP_005482) as a bait. Protein sequences for the CXorf6 orthologs were predicted by comparing the human CXorf6 sequence with the genomic and transcribed sequences of different organisms using Clustal_X (18Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). The unrooted phylogram was generated by Clustal_X (18Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) from the sequence alignment of CXorf6 proteins and was visualized using TreeView 1.6.6 (19Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Primers, Probes, and Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—The sequences of primers, probes, and siRNAs utilized in this study are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Plasmid Vectors Utilized for CXorf6 Analyses—The cDNAs of the full-length CXorf6 (amino acids 1–701) and the minor splicing variant lacking exon 4 (ΔExon 4) were amplified from human fetal testis cDNA (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pEF-BOS vector (20Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) to construct the CXorf6 expression vector for the transactivation analysis. The expression vectors containing cDNAs of nonsense mutants and missense variants of CXorf6 were constructed by mutagenesis. For the subcellular localization analysis, cDNAs for the wild-type, mutant, and variant CXorf6 were designed to lose the start codon and fused to the C-terminal side of the gene encoding either red fluorescent protein (RFP) in pDsRED-monomer C1 vector or green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pAcGFP1-C1 vector (Clontech). For the Western blot analysis, cDNAs missing the start codon were subcloned into pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). We also utilized the following vectors reported in the literature: pEF-BOSneo-mNotch1 RAMIC with cDNA of mouse N1-ICD (21Mizutani T. Taniguchi Y. Aoki T. Hashimoto N. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), pEF-BOSneo-aNotch2 with cDNA of mouse N2-ICD (22Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), pEF-BOS-Mam3 with cDNA of human MAML2 (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), pHes1-luc with the promoter sequence of mouse Hes1 (-467 ∼+46 bp), pHes5-luc with the promoter sequence of mouse Hes5 (-800 ∼+73 bp), pHes3-luc with the promoter sequence of mouse Hes3 (-2,715 ∼+261 bp) (16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), pTP1-luc (pGa 981-6) with an iterated enhancer element with an RBP-J binding site (23Minoguchi S. Taniguchi Y. Kato H. Okazaki T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pEF-BOS-Mam-3-GFP with MAML2-GFP fusion gene (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—We primarily utilized mouse Leydig tumor (MLT) cells (ATCC, CRL-2065™), which retain the capability to produce testosterone and the responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation (24Panesar N.S. Chan K.W. Ho C.S. Steroids. 2003; 68: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), because CXorf6 is a causative gene for hypospadias that is predicted to result from impairment of hCG-dependent testosterone production around the critical period for sex development (4Baskin L.S. Ebbers M.B. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2007; 41: 463-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25Grumbach M.M. Hughes I.A. Conte F.A. Larsen P.R. Kronenberg H.M. Melmed S. Polonsky K.S. 10th Ed. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. Saunders, Philadelphia2002: 842-962Google Scholar) and because the mouse homolog for CXorf6 is expressed in testosterone-producing Leydig cells (3Fukami M. Wada Y. Miyabayashi K. Nishino I. Hasegawa T. Nordenskjöld A. Camerino G. Kretz C. Buj-Bello A. Laporte J. Yamada G. Morohashi K. Ogata T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1369-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We also utilized COS1 cells and HEK293 cells depending on the experimental purposes. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transactivation Analysis of CXorf6—Transactivation function of CXorf6 was analyzed by the luciferase methods. MLT cells seeded in 6-well dishes (1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.6 μg of luciferase reporter vector, 0.6 μg of expression vector for CXorf6 or MAML2, and/or 0.8 μg of expression vector for N1-ICD or N2-ICD, together with 20 ng of pRL-CMV vector used as an internal control. As controls for the expression vectors, empty counterpart vectors were transfected. Luciferase assays performed with a Lumat LB9507 (Berthold) at 48 h after transfection were repeated 4–5 times. DNA Binding Analysis of CXorf6—We searched for conserved regions (CRs) between the mouse Hes3 promoter sequence in the pHes3-luc vector and the human AL031847 sequence containing HES3 and ∼100.2 kb upstream and ∼63.8 kb downstream regions using the BLAST data base and performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for the CRs using a Lightshift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). The procedure was as described in the manufacturer's instructions. In short, MLT cells or COS1 cells cultured in a plate with a diameter of 10 cm were transfected with 5 μg of empty or human CXorf6 cDNA positive vector, and nuclear extracts were obtained at 48 h after transfection. Then, a small amount of nuclear extracts was incubated with each of biotin-labeled 24–35-bp probes (20 fmol) covering the CRs, and the incubation mixture was subjected to gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the biotin-labeled probe was detected by chemiluminescence on a nylon membrane. Western Blot Analysis of CXorf6—Expression vectors for various Myc-tagged CXorf6 proteins (5 μg) were transfected into HEK293 cells in a plate with a diameter of 6 cm. Cell lysates obtained at 48 h after transfection were probed with antibodies for Myc and β-actin utilized as an internal control. Subcellular Localization Analysis of CXorf6—Subcellular localization of CXorf6 proteins was studied by expressing fusion proteins with RFP or GFP. Vectors for fusion proteins (2 μg) were transfected into MLT cells in a glass dish with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The fluorescent signals were observed at 48–72 h after transfection using a laser-scanning microscope LSM510 (version 3.2; Carl Zeiss) shortly after nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD)—Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed for two regions of CXorf6 using lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patient with R653X and his heterozygous mother, with and without the treatment of an NMD inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma; 100 μg/ml, 8-h incubation) (26Freddi S. Savarirayan R. Bateman J.F. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 90: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The occurrence of NMD was assessed by the presence or absence of the PCR products on the agarose gel in the patient and by the heterozygosity or hemizygosity of the PCR products on the electrochromatograms (CEQ 8000 Autosequencer, Beckman Coulter) in the mother after demonstrating a random X-inactivation pattern by the previously described method (27Muroya K. Kosho T. Matsuo M. Ogata T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 84: 384-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, maternal RT-PCR products were subcloned with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen); 100 clones were subjected to sequencing to confirm the stabilization of mRNA with a nonsense mutation after CHX treatment. Expression Analysis of HES3/Hes3—Human cDNA samples of penile and genital skin fibroblasts were prepared by RT-PCR using tissues obtained, after receiving permission, from a prepubertal boy with phimosis and from a prepubertal patient with ambiguous genitalia and mutant androgen receptor gene. Other human cDNA samples were purchased from Invitrogen or Clontech. For mouse Hes3, RT-PCR was performed for the MLT cells. Knockdown Analysis for Mouse CXorf6 Homolog—We performed transient knockdown assay for the mouse CXorf6 homolog using two siRNAs (siRNA1 and siRNA2; final concentration 20 nm). The siRNAs were transfected into MLT cells seeded in 12-well dishes (5 × 104 cells in each well with 1 ml of culture medium, using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen). A nontargeting RNA (4611G, Ambion) was similarly transfected as a negative control. After 48 h of incubation, we the examined mRNA quantity of mouse CXorf6 homolog in the harvested MLT cells and testosterone concentration in the culture medium using half of the wells. The relative amount of mRNA was determined by the Taqman real-time PCR method using the probe-primer mix for mouse CXorf6 homolog (assay No. mm01293665_m1, ABI) on an ABI PRISM 7000, using β2-microglobulin for an endogenous control. Testosterone concentration was measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. In addition, we further analyzed the testosterone production potential of the siRNA-transfected MLT cells in the remaining wells. After changing the old medium with a fresh medium containing hCG (Mochida Pharmaceutical; final concentration, 50 IU/liter), we cultured the cells for a further 1 h and measured testosterone concentration in the medium. These siRNA experiments were performed three times. SF1 Target Sequence in CXorf6—We searched for a putative SF1 binding site in the genomic sequences of CXorf6 (AC109994) and the mouse homolog (NT_039706) and performed DNA binding and the transactivation analyses. For the DNA binding analysis, the 35S-labeled 30-bp probes containing the putative SF1 binding site in CXorf6 were incubated with nuclear extracts of COS1 cells transfected by an empty or human SF1 cDNA positive vector (pRK5) (Addgene) or with recombinant mouse Sf1 protein and were subjected to gel electrophoresis. Similar analysis was also performed for a 32-bp probe harboring the known SF1 binding site of CYP11A1 (28Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as a control. Furthermore, the biotin-labeled 30-bp probes containing the wild-type or the mutated SF1 binding site were incubated with nuclear extracts of COS1 cells transfected by a human SF1 cDNA positive vector (pCMX-PL2) and were subjected to gel electrophoresis. For the transactivation analysis, a fragment (-1,924 ∼-1,690) containing a putative SF1 binding site of CXorf6 was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Furthermore, a reporter vector carrying the mutation in the putative SF1 binding site was generated by mutagenesis. These reporter vectors (0.5 μg) were transfected into the MLT cells together with the empty or human SF1 cDNA positive expression vector (2.5 μg) as well as pRL-CMV vector (20 ng) used as an internal control. The luciferase assays were repeated three times. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and statistical significance was determined by the t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Structural Analysis of CXorf6 Protein—We found that CXorf6 protein has a unique structure with homology to that of MAML2 protein (Fig. 1A). A unique amino acid sequence, which we designated the mastermind-like (MAML) motif, was inferred from sequence alignment with MAML1, MAML2, and MAML3 proteins (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7688-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The MAML motif was well conserved among CXorf6 orthologs identified in frog, bird, and mammals (Fig. 1B). In addition, a serine-rich domain was identified in CXorf6, as well as glutamine- and proline-rich domains. Transcriptional Transactivation by the Wild-type CXorf6 Protein—We examined whether the wild-type CXorf6 (with exon 4) protein is involved in Notch signaling (Fig. 2A). Expression of CXorf6 alone slightly but significantly increased the luciferase activity in the absence of Hes promoters (pGL2 basic only), probably via some backbone vector sequence. This phenomenon was more evident for other vectors such as pGL3 basic and pGL4 basic (not shown). Thus, we utilized pGL2 basic-based luciferase reporter constructs with the promoter sequences of Hes1, Hes5, and Hes3 (16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the canonical Notch target genes Hes1 and Hes5 with the RBP-J binding site (16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), CXorf6 was incapable of enhancing the promoter activities beyond those observed for the pGL2 basic only. MAML2 had no transactivating function, and N-ICDs activated the promoters. The N-ICD-induced promoter activities were further enhanced by CXorf6, probably because of additive or synergic effects via some backbone vector sequence, and by MAML2 because of its co-activator function. The results from the MAML2 and N-ICDs studies were consistent with those reported previously (8Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell.

Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By contrast, for the noncanonical Notch target gene Hes3 without the RBP-J binding site (16Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), CXorf6 alone was capable of enhancing its promoter activity, whereas MAML2 and N-ICDs had no transactivating function. Consistent with this, co-expression of N-ICDs and CXorf6 or MAML2 exhibited no additive or synergic effects on the promoter activity. These results argue that CXorf6 exerts its transactivation activity independently of the RBP-J binding sites. To confirm this, we performed similar analysis using pTP1-luc, which possesses an iterated enhancer element with an RBP-J binding site (23Minoguchi S. Taniguchi Y. Kato H. Okazaki T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, CXorf6 was incapable of enhancing the N-ICD-induced transactivation, whereas MAML2 augmented the N-ICD-induced activities of this promoter (Fig. 2B). DNA Binding Analysis of the Wild-type CXorf6 Protein—We attempted to examine whether the wild-type CXorf6 can bind to the Hes3 promoter sequence directly (supplemental Fig. 1). Comparison of the 2,976-bp mouse Hes3 promoter sequence with the human AL031847 sequence identified five CRs (CR1–CR5). Notably, the five CRs found in the human also resided in the upstream of the coding sequences of HES3, and the orientation of the CR1–CR5 was well conserved between human and mouse, whereas the mouse Hes3 promoter region was associated with repeat sequences between CR4 and CR5. EMSA was carried out using 24–35-bp overlapping biotin-labeled probes covering the CR1–CR5 (total, 25 probes), showing no evidence for the DNA-binding capacity of CXorf6. Transactivation Function of Mutant and Variant CXorf6 Proteins—We next analyzed the transactivating activities of the previously identified three apparently pathologic nonsense mutants and three apparently non-pathologic missense variants of CXorf6 (3Fukami M. Wada Y. Miyabayashi K. Nishino I. Hasegawa T. Nordenskjöld A. Camerino G. Kretz C. Buj-Bello A. Laporte J. Yamada G. Morohashi K. Ogata T. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2037735107,"Involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore in early stages of lipotoxic stress in the pancreatic β-cell lines MIN6 and INS-1 was the focus of this study. Both long term (indirect) and acute (direct) effects of fatty acid (FA) application on β-cell susceptibility to Ca2+-induced MPT induction were examined using both permeabilized and intact β-cells. Long term exposure to moderate (i.e. below cytotoxic) levels of the saturated FA palmitate sensitized β-cell mitochondria to MPT induced by Ca2+. Long term exposure to palmitate was significantly a more efficient inducer of MPT than the unsaturated FA oleate, although upon acute application both caused similar MPT activation. Application of antioxidants, inhibitors of the ceramide pathway, or modifiers of membrane fluidity did not protect β-cell mitochondria from FA exposure. However, significant protection was provided by co-application of the unsaturated FA oleate in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Characterization of MPT pore opening in response to moderate palmitate treatment revealed the opening of a unique form of MPT in β-cells as it encompassed features of both low and high conductance MPT states. Specifically, this MPT showed solute selectivity, characteristic of a low conductance MPT; however, it affected mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential in a way typical of a high conductance MPT. Activation of the full-size/high conductance form of MPT required application of high levels of FA that reduced growth and initiated apoptosis. These findings suggest that in the β-cell, MPTs can act as both initiators of cell death and as versatile modulators of cell metabolism, depending on the mode of the MPT pore induced.

Opening of the “full-size” or “high conductance” MPT causes equilibration across the inner membrane of ions and all solutes up to 1.5 kDa, which induces mitochondrial swelling and the release of mitochondrial proteins capable of apoptosis activation (1Bernardi P.

Acta. 1998; 1366: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because opening of the low conductance MPT does not allow passage of large molecules, but does allow the passage of small ions, mitochondrial ion gradients and energy production are affected. As such, it is thought that the low conductance MPT functions not to induce cell death but to aid in the fine regulation of cell metabolism (6Ichas F. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Extensive evidence documents the high conductance MPT as a cause of generalized mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, and an important mechanism in disease pathologies such as hepatotoxicity (8Reid A.B.

In contrast, low conductance MPT has received far less attention despite reports suggesting it plays an important regulatory role in cell metabolism (12Hausenloy D. Wynne A. Duchen M. Yellon D.

The physiological and pathological significance of MPT in pancreatic β-cells is currently under investigation by several groups. According to recent studies, the induction of cell death in clonal β-cells and pancreatic islets by elevated fatty acids (FA) or other factors involves MPT opening and the release of apoptogenic factors (15Barbu A. Welsh N. Saldeen J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Donath M.Y. Ehses J.A. Maedler K. Schumann D.M. Ellingsgaard H. Eppler E. Reinecke M.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, we and others suggest that the more limited forms of MPT may lead to the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from β-cells, an event that likely precedes or is independent of MPT-associated apoptosis (18Silva J.P.

The occurrence of both high and low conductance MPT in β-cells and their impact on β-cell viability and GSIS, respectively, suggest that MPTs may play a significant role in the initial pathogenesis of diabetes. Chronically elevated FAs (lipotoxicity), a condition often associated with obesity, has deleterious effects on β-cell function and is considered one of the main diabetogenic mechanisms. As such, we examined the effects of saturated and unsaturated FAs on MPT in pancreatic β-cells using as our model system MIN6 and INS-1 β-cell lines. Although lipotoxicity has been extensively studied in these cell lines (17Maestre I. Jordan J. Calvo S. Reig J.A. Cena V. Soria B. Prentki M. Roche E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Busch A.K. Cordery D. Denyer G.S. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 977-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Biden T.J.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the function of full-size and limited size MPT induction in response to FAs has not been previously examined. In this study, we applied moderate concentrations of FA, which are known not to cause apoptosis, as a model of the early stages in the lipotoxic mechanism. This study revealed that long term (48 h) exposure of clonal pancreatic β-cells to palmitate, a saturated FA, caused subsequent activation of MPT in a dose-dependent manner. Acute application of palmitate (applied directly to permeabilized β-cells at the time of assay) revealed similar results. In contrast, the unsaturated FA oleate induced MPT upon acute application but counteracted sensitization to MPT caused by palmitate during long term exposure. The ability of oleate to exert an opposite effect on mitochondrial permeabilization reflects current controversies in the literature, where both activation (17Maestre I. Jordan J. Calvo S. Reig J.A. Cena V. Soria B. Prentki M. Roche E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and protection against MPT by oleate (24Busch A.K. Gurisik E. Cordery D.V. Sudlow M. Denyer G.S. Laybutt D.R. Hughes W.E. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Maedler K. Oberholzer J. Bucher P. Spinas G.A. Donath M.Y. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) were reported. Application of moderate (noncytotoxic) levels of palmitate activated a limited size (acetyl-CoA-impermeable) form of MPT, whereas activation of full-size (acetyl-CoA-permeable) MPT required exposure to higher (cytotoxic) concentrations of palmitate. Unique features of the limited size MPT in β-cells, which distinguish it from the limited size MPTs observed in other cell types, were determined. Graded activation of different MPT forms by FAs suggested involvement of MPT not only in triggering cell death but also in the metabolic regulation of β-cells. Reagents and Materials—Clonal pancreatic MIN6 (a gift from Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University, passage number 40-50) and INS-1 (a gift from Dr. C. Wollheim, University Medical Center, Geneva, passage number 60-80) β-cells were used. Mouse hepatocytes were obtained as described by others (26Fry J.R. Jones C.A. Wiebkin P. Bellemann P. Bridges J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca-Green 5N and Fluo-4 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); cyclosporin H was purchased from Eton Bioscience (San Diego); 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Akt phosphorylation was measured with a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Super Array, Frederick, MD). Growth, Treatment, and Permeabilization of β-Cells—MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 4-6 days of growth with daily medium change, cells were trypsinized and washed in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and permeabilized essentially as described previously (27Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 × 107 cells were suspended in 0.7 ml of KRB buffer containing 80 μg/ml saponin. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the cells were centrifuged (735 × g for 3 min) at 4 °C and washed in cold KRB buffer. At this point more than half of the total cellular protein and more than 80% of soluble malate dehydrogenase were found in the supernatant. Finally, the permeabilized cells were suspended in cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and stored at 0-4 °C until required for experimentation. All experiments were performed on MIN6 cells, and the main findings were validated using INS-1 β-cells. For long term FA exposure, cells were exposed to FA in growth medium supplemented with FA bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (27Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 48 h prior to permeabilization and subsequent experimentation. See under “Results” for the concentrations of FA applied. For acute FA application, FAs were added directly to the assay medium containing permeabilized cells. Again, FA concentrations applied to cells are outlined under “Results.” Respiration Measurements—Mitochondrial O2 consumption was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode coupled to an Oxygraph unit (Hansatech, Pentney, UK). Permeabilized cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.6-0.9 mg of protein/ml in incubation medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 20 μm EGTA, 0.1% BSA, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 7.5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate, pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). Oxygen kinetic traces were treated as described by Estabrook (28Estabrook R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1843) Google Scholar), and respiration rates were converted into molar oxygen units using O2 solubility in sucrose medium, as reported by Reynafarje et al. (29Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Ψm) and Ca2+ Monitoring—Mitchondrial membrane potential was monitored by observing safranin-O fluorescence (30Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 31Vercesi A.E. Bernardes C.F. Hoffmann M.E. Gadelha F.R. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14431-14434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in suspensions of permeabilized cells. Permeabilized cells were incubated in medium that was essentially identical to that used for respiratory assays (see above) but was further supplemented with 2.5 μm safranin. Measurements were performed using a Fluoro-Count plate reader (Packard Instrument Co.) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm. A decrease in fluorescence corresponded to an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. Extramitochondrial Ca2+ was monitored fluoro-metrically using 1 μm Ca-Green 5N at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/530 nm. Estimation of Permeability Transition in β-Cell Mitochondria in Situ—MPT within permeabilized cells was routinely estimated by monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm), which was further verified with Ca2+ and respiration measurements. The mitochondrial origin of the signals was tested using the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and the MPT inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). See the individual figure legends for concentrations of FCCP and CsA applied to cells. Mitochondria were energized by oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate (7.5 mm), which was used as the principal respiratory substrate because glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the most active dehydrogenase in pancreatic β-cells (32MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ΔΨ and Ca2+ kinetics reflect both low and high conductance mitochondrial permeabilization, and specific detection of the high conductance permeability transition in isolated mitochondria is commonly performed using a swelling method (4Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this method cannot be applied to mitochondria in permeabilized β-cells, we discriminated between high and low conductance MPTs directly using a citrate synthase assay (33Korge P. Weiss J.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this assay opening of the large diameter pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane allows access of citrate synthase substrates (acetyl-CoA) to citrate synthase in the mitochondrial matrix. CoA-SH produced in the course of the citrate synthase reaction reduces 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), which registers as a rise in absorbance at 412 nm. See Fig. 6A for a schematic of this assay. Cytotoxicity Detection—Cytotoxic effect in β-cells was estimated by detecting exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate according to manufacturer's (Sigma) instructions. This measurement reflects early apoptotic events and, according to recent reports (34Lecoeur H. Prevost M.C. Gougeon M.L. Cytometry. 2001; 44: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Rello S. Stockert J.C. Moreno V. Gamez A. Pacheco M. Juarranz A. Canete M. Villanueva A. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), necrotic cellular alteration. Epifluorescent imaging of cells treated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate was performed at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/530 nm using an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective, in combination with an Ultrapix camera and a PC computer with Merlin imaging software (LSR Inc., UK). Estimation of Permeability Transition in Intact β-Cells—MPT in intact cells was estimated by monitoring MPT-related changes in intracellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (14Kowaltowski A.J. Smaili S.S. Russell J.T. Fiskum G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C852-C859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chernyak B.V.

Carvalho A.C. Jurkiewicz A. Frussa-Filho R. Smaili S.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinized cells were washed in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 24 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 2.8 mm glucose, pH 7.3) and suspended in the same buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA at ∼10 mg of protein/ml. For intracellular Ca2+ monitoring cell suspensions were loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4-AM for 30 min at room temperature, washed, suspended in the same volume of KRB/BSA buffer, and incubated for another 30 min for complete hydrolysis. For kinetic Ca2+ measurements, loaded cells were diluted in KRB/BSA buffer up to 0.6-0.7 mg of protein/ml and Fluo-4 fluorescence was monitored with a FluoroCount plate reader (Packard Instrument Co.) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm. Cellular loading of Fluo-4 was estimated by comparing the fluorescent signals from a standard solution of the free acid form of Fluo-4 and the loaded cell suspension permeabilized with 80 μg/ml saponin (39Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 1-54Google Scholar). Calibration of the fluorescent signal was performed according to a conventional procedure developed for Fluo-3 (40Merritt J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Grynkiewicz equation [Ca2+] = Kd (F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where the Kd employed was 345 nm (41Gee K.R. Brown K.A. Chen W.N. Bishop-Stewart J. Gray D. Johnson I. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Essentially the same procedure was employed for the ΔΨ measurement except the cells were loaded with 10 μm rhodamine 123 for 20 min. Cyclosporin H (CsH), which has been shown to inhibit the MDR pump (2Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), was used as a control for the possible contribution of MDR pump-associated fluorescent probe extrusion. Also, it has been demonstrated that anion transporters (MDR-related proteins) can also contribute to fluorescent probe extrusion. To control for this, probenecid, which has been shown to inhibit these anion transporters in β-cells (42Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Berggren P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 43Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Berggren P.O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) as well as in other tissues (40Merritt J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Barrand M.A. Bagrij T. Neo S.Y. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was employed. Insulin Secretion Assay and Measurement of Akt Phosphorylation—MIN6 cells cultured in 24-well plates were washed and preincubated for two sequential 30-min periods in glucose-free KRB buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation for 1 h in the same buffer containing 1 or 20 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 5 μm cyclosporin A or 0.15 μm FK-506. GSIS was quantified by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) as described previously (45Dai F.F. Zhang Y. Kang Y. Wang Q. Gaisano H.Y. Braunewell K.H. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21942-21953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation status of Akt was evaluated with a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Super-Array (Frederick, MD). This protocol, which is based on antigen-antibody recognition, allows direct and accurate quantification of both phosphorylated and total Akt at the same time (46Xia S. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13199-13210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The amount of phosphorylated Akt was normalized to total Akt levels and corrected for nonspecific staining by comparison with samples incubated without primary antibodies (according to the manufacturer). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Moderate Fatty Acid Treatment Does Not Induce Apoptosis in Clonal β-Cell Lines—Cells were exposed to various concentrations of palmitate, a saturated FA, and assayed for the onset of apoptosis after 48 h using the annexin V assay. In MIN6 cells, the optimal level of palmitate was found to be 0.5 mm (equilibrated with 0.5% BSA). At this concentration of palmitate exposure, growth of MIN6 cells was found to be 92 ± 12% (p > 0.05, n = 4) of control, as estimated by total cellular protein content, and no detectable apoptosis was observed (Fig. 1). In INS-1 cells, the concentration of palmitate exposure was reduced to 0.10-0.15 mm to maintain cell growth unperturbed. This is close to (47Wang X. Li H. De Leo D. Guo W. Koshkin V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Chan C.B. Der S. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or somewhat lower (17Maestre I. Jordan J. Calvo S. Reig J.A. Cena V. Soria B. Prentki M. Roche E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) than FA levels commonly used in lipotoxic studies on these cell lines. Thus, these conditions were used to model the initial steps of FA-induced β-cell deterioration without pronounced cell death. Acute Application of FAs to β-Cells Induces a CsA-sensitive MPT upon Ca2+ Application—It has long been known that free FAs can directly impact mitochondrial function either through direct inhibition of respiration, respiratory uncoupling, or through the induction of MPT formation (48Bernardi P. Penzo D. Wojtczak L. Vitam. Horm. 2002; 65: 97-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wojtczak L. Schonfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The impact of FAs on mitochondrial function can vary with the type of mitochondria, type of FA, length of FA exposure, and concentration of FA applied (49Wojtczak L. Schonfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 50Schonfeld P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested the impact of acute FA application of various concentrations on mitochondrial function to determine a threshold concentration of FA that acutely induces MPT without direct respiratory inhibition or strong uncoupling. An appreciable inhibition of state 3FCCP respiration (>20% decrease) was found when FA total concentration exceeded 50 μm (data not shown). Mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential in state 4 also remained stable at FA levels below 50 μm. MPT opening was then monitored by Ca2+-induced mitochondrial depolarization that displayed sensitivity to CsA (a commonly used inhibitor of MPT opening). Importantly, we observed that 25 μm palmitate and oleate significantly stimulated MPT pore opening at this low concentration (shown in Fig. 4A). Similar stimulation was reported in liver and heart mitochondria (51Di Paola M. Lorusso M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 52Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); however, in these studies MPT-inducing unbound FA levels were in the micromolar range. Note that 25 μm palmitate corresponds to nanomolar concentrations of unbound FA in BSA (0.1%)-containing medium (53Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long Term Exposure of β-Cells to Palmitate Increases Susceptibility to Ca2+-induced MPT Induction and Decreases Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—Mitochondria from MIN6 cells treated with palmitate for 48 h (Fig. 2A), unlike controls, were completely depolarized by two 50 μm Ca2+ pulses, an effect that was largely reversed by the MPT inhibitor CsA. The effect of long term (48 h) palmitate exposure on INS-1 cells (Fig. 2B), which are more sensitive to MPT induction, was even more pronounced, with CsA unable to reverse the depolarization induced by Ca2+. However, CsA provided protection when added before Ca2+, demonstrating the classical nature of mitochondrial permeabilization in palmitate-treated INS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Mitochondrial depolarization can result from factors other than permeability transition. Unfortunately, methods based on fluorescent probe distribution tend to underestimate mitochondrial permeabilization (4Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of palmitate on MPT induction was further examined using mitochondri"

Several specialized DNA polymerases are members of a novel polymerase family, the Y-family (3Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z.

These enzymes are devoid of 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity and replicate undamaged DNA in vitro with low fidelity and weak processivity (4Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Members of this family in mammalian cells include Polκ, Polι, and Polη, all of which can extend primers for varying distances past various types of template damage (4Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A fourth member of the Y-family, REV1 protein, is able to catalyze the incorporation of only one or two dCMP moieties, regardless of the template base composition (5Lawrence C.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Polκ, Polι, and Polη have been shown to interact with REV1 protein via a highly conserved C-terminal domain in REV1 (6Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C.

Polκ-deficient mouse embryonic stem and fibroblast cells also show moderate sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (19Takenaka K. Ogi T. Okada T. Sonoda E. Guo C. Friedberg E.C. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2000-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, primer extension assays have shown that human Polκ can support TLS across sites of base loss, acetylaminofluorene-G adducts, benzo[a]pyrene-G adducts, and thymine glycol (4Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme does not support primer extension past thymine-thymine (T<>T) dimers or [6,4]pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (4Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Similar to DNA polymerase Polξ, Polκ is also efficient in extending sites of replicative bypass by other specialized polymerases during TLS, at least in vitro (12Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Polκ in mammalian cells promotes pleiotropic genetic alterations and tumorigenesis (20Bavoux C. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Bavoux C. Leopoldino A.M. Bergoglio V. O-Wang J. Ogi T. Bieth A. Judde J.G. Pena S.D. Poupon M.F. Helleday T. Tagawa M. Machado C. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 325-330PubMed Google Scholar). The relaxed fidelity of Polκ renders it error prone when copying undamaged DNA. Hence, access of the enzyme to sites of undamaged DNA must be tightly regulated to avoid mutational catastrophes. It has been reported that Polκ accumulates in microscopically discrete nuclear foci in UV radiation- or BPDE-treated cells (22Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Bergoglio V. Bavoux C. Verbiest V. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal 97 amino acids of Polκ, which include a C2HC zinc finger, a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and a putative PCNA binding site, are important for the localization of Polκ in nuclear foci (22Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism of TLS by Polκ and other specialized DNA polymerases remains unclear. To further our understanding of the role of Polκ in TLS and in spontaneous and DNA damage-associated mutagenesis, we searched for proteins that interact with mouse Polκ by screening a mouse testis cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system (6Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C. Friedberg E.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6621-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We report here that ubiquitin binds strongly to Polκ bait protein. We examined the interaction of ubiquitin with Polκ and show that this interaction requires two novel zinc fingers, called ubiquitin-binding motifs (UBZs) (25Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), resident in the C-terminal half of Polκ. We also demonstrate that Polκ binds monoubiquitinated PCNA more robustly than nonubiquitinated PCNA. The UBZs are required for Polκ to form nuclear foci after UV radiation. We measured the half-life of endogenous Polκ as 5.4 h and show that mutational disruption of the UBZs does not alter the half-life of Polκ protein. Finally, we examined levels of Polκ expression following exposure of mouse cells to BPDE or UVB radiation. Plasmids–For yeast two-hybrid screening, pGBT9/mouse PolK plasmid was cloned as described (6Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C. Friedberg E.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6621-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For binding assays, full-length mouse PolK cDNA was cloned in pCMV-Myc or pCMV-HA (Clontech) to generate Myc or HA fusion proteins. For confocal study, mouse PolK cDNA with the first ATG codon deleted was PCR-amplified and cloned in the SalI site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) to generate an EGFP fusion protein. Human POLK cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned in the BamHI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Isolated UBZs of mPolK were PCR-amplified and cloned into pCMV-Myc (Clontech) or pGEX4T-2 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Ubiquitin, PCNA, and PCNA-ubiquitin chimera (25Bienko M. Green C.M.

Cell Culture and Treatments–COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection experiments COS7 and HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested for further analysis 48 h after transfection. The SV40-transformed human fibroblast MRC5 was kindly provided by Dr. Alan R. Lehmann, University of Sussex. MRC5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection and UV irradiation were carried out as described previously (10Guo C. Sonoda E.

Nuclear Protein Extraction and Western Blotting–Wild-type MEFs were prepared and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described (17Schenten D.

Treatments using genotoxic agents were as follows. 1), BPDE (NCI National Institutes of Health carcinogen repository) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. 1 mm BPDE was added to exponentially growing cells and incubated for 1 h, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh medium. 2), UVB radiation at 25 J/m2 was performed in a UV cross-linker (UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene). Nuclear extracts were harvested as described previously (27Guo C. Gao T. Confer N. Velasco-Miguel S. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) at different time points. Protein Half-life Determination–COS7 cells were transfected with the wild-type and UBZs mutant HA-Polκ constructs. Twenty-four h later, the transfected cells were aliquoted into 8–10 35-mm dishes to continue to culture for ∼16 h. The half-life of Polκ was determined by treating cells with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) for 0–7 h to inhibit protein synthesis and then preparing cell lysates to determine Polκ levels by Western blotting. For endogenous Polκ, wild-type MEFs were treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for 0–9 h. The content of Polκ and β-actin bands was quantified by Photoshop histogram. To calculate the half-life of Polκ protein, the content of the Polκ Western blot bands at each time point was normalized to the control (0 h) Polκ content and also refers to the β-actin content. The normalized data from several independent experiments were averaged together and semi-log plots were generated in Origin 4.1. Linear regression was performed, and the half-life was calculated from the fitted line equation. Antibodies–Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA and mouse monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc were purchased from Covance. Anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Hamster polyclonal antiserum against mouse Polκ was made by our laboratory (27Guo C. Gao T.

Anti-PCNA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lysate Preparation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting–COS7 cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-mPolκ and pCMV5-FLAG-Ub. Harvested cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc-mPolκ and pcDNA3-HA-Ub.

MRC cells were transfected with HA-mPolκ, and 40 h later they were UV-irradiated (25 J/m2). They were then incubated for 7 h prior to Triton extraction and cross-linking. Triton-insoluble proteins were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-PCNA as described (10Guo C. Sonoda E. Tang T.S. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol.

For interaction between truncated/mutant mPolκ and GST-PCNA or GST-Ub constructs, transfected COS7/MRC5 cells were lysed with HEPES buffer and incubated with equal amounts of GST fusion proteins as described previously (10Guo C.

Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against mPolκ or with monoclonal antibodies against Myc (9E10), HA (16B12), or PCNA. Immunofluorescence Microscopy–MRC5 cells were transfected using a panel of mutated/truncated EGFP-mPolκ and EGFP-hPolκ constructs and cultured for ∼40 h. They were then UV-irradiated and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (10Guo C. Sonoda E. Tang T.S. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol.

Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U confocal laser scanning microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. A minimum of 200 nuclei were analyzed for each construct and treatment. Mouse Polκ Interacts with Ubiquitin via Two Ubiquitin-binding Zinc Finger Domains and Undergoes Ubiquitination in Vivo–By screening a mouse testis cDNA library using mouse Polκ as bait, we identified both ubiquitin B and REV1 as interacting moieties. Because ubiquitin B is a polypeptide containing four tandem ubiquitin moieties, we anticipated that Polκ would also bind to monoubiquitin. This was confirmed by GST pull-down using purified Polκ and GST-ubiquitin (Fig. 1A). We observed that mouse Polκ protein, in addition to binding ubiquitin, undergoes monoubiquitination in vivo. HA-Polκ and FLAG-ubiquitin were expressed in COS7 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Not surprisingly, HA-Polκ protein was detected in the immunoprecipitate, reflecting its interaction with ubiquitin (Fig. 1B). However, an additional slower migrating band was reproducibly observed, suggesting the presence of monoubiquitinated HA-Polκ protein (Fig. 1B). This was directly confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Polκ from cells cotransfected with Myc-Polκ and HA-Ub followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1C). Sequence analysis revealed that the duplicated C2HC zinc cluster domains in mouse Polκ (29Gerlach V.L. Aravind L. Gotway G. Schultz R.A. Koonin E.V. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11922-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) are in fact novel ubiquitin-binding domains called UBZs (25Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The mouse UBZs (each ∼30 amino acids in length) are located between amino acid residues 608 and 800 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the UBZs in Polκ are required for binding ubiquitin, we incubated a fragment of Polκ bearing just the two UBZs (UBZ1 + UBZ2) with GST-ubiquitin and confirmed the interaction (Fig. 2B). To further document the requirement of the UBZs in Polκ for its interaction with ubiquitin, we generated a series of mutant constructs that deleted the N-terminal UBZ (UBZ1) (Polκ-UBZ1Δ), the C-terminal UBZ (UBZ2) (Polκ-UBZ2Δ), or both (Polκ-UBZΔ). Additionally, we generated constructs in which the amino acids Asp-642 and/or Asp-784 were mutated to Ala (D642A in UBZ1*, D784A in UBZ2*, D642A and D784A in UBZ*). Deletion of either UBZ significantly impaired binding to GST-ubiquitin (Fig. 2C), and deletion of both UBZs completely eliminated the interaction (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when selected amino acids in the Polκ UBZs were mutated to alanine (Fig. 2D). Mutational inactivation of the UBZs in Polκ also impaired its monoubiquitination (Fig. 2E), and their deletion completely abolished monoubiquitination of Polκ (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results suggest that the Polk UBZs are required for interaction between Polκ and ubiquitin and for monoubiquitination of the polymerase. The UBZs Are Required for Enhanced Association between Polκ and Monoubiquitinated PCNA–Recent studies have demonstrated that monoubiquitination of PCNA in cells exposed to UV radiation promotes a more robust interaction of this accessory replication protein with Polη, Polι, and REV1 protein (10Guo C.

McDonald J.P. Mead S. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2847-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether an enhanced association also exists between Polκ and monoubiquitinated PCNA, we examined their interaction by GST pulldown experiments (26Guo C. Tang T.S. Bienko M. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Dikic I. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8892-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with results shown previously (31Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the interaction of purified Polκ with PCNA-Ub was more robust than with native PCNA (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the enhanced interaction is mediated via the UBZ domains, we incubated cell lysates expressing wild-type Polκ or those carrying mutations in the UBZ domains with GST-PCNA fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B, the enhanced association with GST-PCNA-Ub was not observed with UBZ mutant preparations. To further support the result, HA-Polκ and its UBZ deletion derivatives were expressed in cells exposed to UV radiation to generate monoubiquitinated PCNA. The chromatin fraction was then isolated and immunoprecipitated with PCNA antibodies. Consistent with the results shown above, the amount of precipitated wild-type, but not UBZ-deleted, Polκ was significantly increased after UVC treatment (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the level of UBZ-deleted Polκ in chromatin fractions was significantly reduced after UVC treatment (Fig. 3C). We isolated the chromatin fraction from wild-type cells after UVC treatment and immunoprecipitated it with anti-PCNA antibodies. Consistent with the results shown above, the amount of precipitated endogenous Polκ was significantly increased after UVC treatment (Fig. 3D). In summary, the results of the experiments reported thus far indicate that mouse Polκ can interact with ubiquitin in vitro, an interaction that requires functional UBZs, and that Polκ can itself undergo monoubiquitination. A robust association between monoubiquitinated PCNA and Polκ also requires functional UBZs. Polκ UBZs Are Required for Association of Polκ with Replication Factories in Cells Exposed to UV Radiation–To validate the results described above in living cells, we transfected wild-type and UBZ-deleted EGFP-mouse Polκ constructs into fibroblasts. We observed strict nuclear localization of EGFP-mouse Polκ protein, regardless of the presence or absence of the UBZs (Fig. 4A). As reported previously for human Polκ (22Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in ∼4% of cells transfected with wild-type EGFP-mouse Polκ the protein was concentrated in nuclear foci (Fig. 4A). When cells transfected with EGFP-mouse Polκ were exposed to UV radiation and incubated for 8–16 h, the fraction of cells with discrete nuclear foci increased to ∼55.3% (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the number of cells with mouse Polκ foci was higher than that observed when cells were transfected with human Polk and exposed to UV radiation (Fig. 4B). This observation was confirmed using a different EGFP-human Polκ construct (22Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, foci were not detected (with or without UV radiation exposure) in cells transfected with EGFP-mouse Polκ lacking the UBZs (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with EGFP-mouse Polκ carrying mutations in the UBZs (Fig. 4B). Hence, the UBZ domains are required for association of Polκ with replication factories in cells exposed to UV radiation. Mutation of the Polκ UBZs Does Not Alter the Half-life of the Protein–Given that Polκ is intrinsically error prone, regulation of Polκ levels is presumably important for maintenance of genetic integrity. To investigate the stability of Polκ in vivo, MEFs were treated with CHX for various lengths of time. Endogenous Polκ was degraded slowly with a half-life of 5.4 h (Fig. 5A). To determine whether the UBZ domains affect the half-life of the protein, COS7 cells were transfected with wild-type and UBZ mutant Polκ and were treated with CHX for various lengths of time. Although the turnover rate of these exogenous proteins (∼3.7–4.2 h) was relatively faster than that of endogenous Polκ, we observed essentially similar half-lives between wild-type and UBZ mutant Polκ (Fig. 5, B and C). Levels of Polκ Expression Are Increased in Cells Exposed to BPDE or UVB Radiation–Cells from two groups of independently generated Polκ knock-out mice are abnormally sensitive to BPDE and less so to UV radiation exposure (16Ogi T. Shinkai Y. Tanaka K. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15548-15553Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Schenten D. Gerlach V.L. Guo C. Velasco-Miguel S. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. Rajewsky K. Esposito G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To elucidate the underlying mechanism of this sensitivity, we examined the levels of nuclear Polκ after UVB and BPDE treatments. Examination of MEFs exposed to UVB radiation at different times revealed a progressive increase in the amount of Polκ 24–48 h after UVB exposure (Fig. 6A). Similarly, increased steady-state levels of Polκ were observed 8–30 h after exposure of MEFs to 1 mm BPDE for 1 h (Fig. 6B). To further support this conclusion, whole cell lysates were harvested at different times after exposure of MEFs to 1 mm BPDE for 1 h. Equal amounts of whole cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Polκ antibodies, and bound endogenous Polκ was detected with hamster anti-Polκ antibodies. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 6B, increased levels of Polκ were observed 8–24 h after BPDE treatment (Fig. 6C). Persistent arrested DNA replication can threaten the viability of dividing cells. The observation that many eukaryotic cells, in particular those from higher eukaryotes, are endowed with multiple low fidelity specialized DNA polymerases that can catalyze DNA synthesis past sites of base damage in vitro has yielded important insights about DNA damage tolerance (2Friedberg E.C. Lehmann A.R. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 499-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Regardless of the specific types of base damage in DNA handled by TLS, a question of considerable interest is how switching is effected at sites of arrested replication between high fidelity polymerases in the replicative machinery and one or more specialized enzymes that support TLS. Recent observations indicate that PCNA provides the central scaffold to which various TLS polymerases can bind to access the replicative ensemble stalled at a lesion and to execute their roles in lesion bypass (32Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 33Huang T.T. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined how a particular polymerase is selected to carry out TLS past a blocking lesion. To further our understanding of the biological role of Polκ during TLS in mammalian cells, we searched for interacting partners and identified ubiquitin. Hence, like the other Y-family polymerases, Polη, Polι, and Rev1 (25Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2847-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Polκ binds ubiquitin. Although the precise biological function of this interaction remains to be determined, this binding likely reflects an interaction of Polκ with monoubiquitinated PCNA (31Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that recently identified ubiquitin-binding motifs in Polκ (UBZs) are required for its interaction with PCNA, suggesting specific molecular events associated with the Polκ/PCNA interaction, especially in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents such as UV radiation. Our studies represent the first demonstration of this phenomenon in living cells. Similar to the UBZs in Polη and the ubiquitin-binding motif in Polι (25Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), the UBZs in Polκ are critical for the accumulation of the protein in replication foci when cells suffer DNA damage. Unlike the ubiquitin-binding motifs in REV1 (26Guo C. Tang T.S. Bienko M. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Dikic I. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8892-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), deletion/mutation of the UBZs completely abolished the basal level of focus formation by wild-type Polκ protein, suggesting that the basal level of Polκ foci may represent a response to spontaneous DNA damage. Surprisingly, the number of cells with visible mouse Polκ foci (∼55.3%) is significantly greater than that observed with human Polκ (∼25%) upon exposure to UV radiation (22Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present studies also demonstrate that like other Y-family polymerases, mouse Polκ protein can be monoubiquitinated and that the UBZs in the protein are required for this modification. The biological significance of monoubiquitination of Y-family polymerases is not understood. However, this post-translational modification may contribute to regulation of Y-family polymerases in or out of replication factories (25Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 33Huang T.T. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We reported previously the presence of multiple PolK transcripts in mouse testis (27Guo C. Gao T. Confer N. Velasco-Miguel S. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Many of the putative Polκ protein isoforms thus identified lack UBZ domains. It is thus of considerable interest to determine whether the putative Polκ isoforms are indeed expressed in vivo and what novel biological functions they may have. In addition to protein-protein interactions, Polκ activity may be regulated by its cellular levels. Polκ is apparently a relatively stable protein in vivo, and mutation of the UBZs does not alter the half-life of the protein. Consistent with this observation, the majority of Polκ in vivo is not monoubiquitinated, and polyubiquitinated Polκ is apparently absent. Polκ-deficient mouse and chicken cells manifest sensitivity to killing by BPDE (16Ogi T. Shinkai Y. Tanaka K. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15548-15553Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific requirement for Polκ to bypass this planar polycyclic lesion in DNA. Conceivably, adducts in DNA with similar planer polycyclic structures generated by cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives, such as steroid hormones and estrogen, generate the same requirement. Consistent with this notion, PolK mRNA is highly expressed in the adrenal cortex early during mouse embryonic development (28Velasco-Miguel S. Richardson J.A. Gerlach V.L. Lai W.C. Gao T. Russell L.D. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We and other laboratories reported previously that the mouse PolK gene is transcriptionally up-regulated following exposure to UVB and BPDE treatments (28Velasco-Miguel S. Richardson J.A. Gerlach V.L. Lai W.C. Gao T. Russell L.D. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Ogi T. Mimura J. Hikida M. Fujimoto H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that exposure to these DNA-damaging agents promotes up-regulation of the gene. Consistent with this interpretation, the present studies demonstrate a progressive increase in steady-state levels of Polκ protein after such treatments. The biological significance of these expression patterns remains to be established. We thank Dr. Alan R. Lehmann for MRC5 cells and EGFP-hPolκ plasmid, Dr. Valerie Gerlach for preparing EGFP-C1-hPolκ construct and rabbit anti-Polκ, Drs. Tom Gillete and Lisa McDaniel for helpful discussion, and J.

We show here in the microglia cell line Ra2 that PAK1 regulates NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) activity in a stimulus-specific manner. Thus, conditional expression of PAK1 dominant-positive mutants enhanced, whereas dominant-negative mutants inhibited, NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide generation following formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Both Rac1 and the GTP exchange factor VAV1 were required as upstream signaling proteins in the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced activation of endogenous PAK1. In contrast, PAK1 mutants had no effect on superoxide generation downstream of FcγR signaling during phagocytosis of IgG-immune complexes. We further present evidence that the effect of PAK1 on the respiratory burst is mediated through phosphorylation of p47Phox, and we show that expression of a p47Phox (S303D/S304D/S320D) mutant, which mimics phosphorylation by PAK1, induced basal superoxide generation in vivo. In contrast PAK1 substrates LIMK-1 or RhoGDI are not likely to contribute to the PAK1 effect on NADPH oxidase activation.

Collectively, our findings define a VAV1-Rac1-PAK1 signaling axis in mononuclear phagocytes regulating superoxide production in a stimulus-dependent manner. The superoxide-generating phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) consists of integral membrane subunits gp91Phox and p22Phox and cytosolic subunits p40Phox, p47Phox, p67Phox, and the small GTPase Rac1 or Rac2.

Only in activated phagocytes do the cytosolic factors translocate to the membrane to interact with cyt b558 and initiate superoxide production (1Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In vitro, purified membranes containing cyt b558 demonstrate superoxide production when reconstituted with high concentrations of p67Phox and prenylated, GTP-loaded Rac1 (2Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N.

Upon cell activation, p47Phox undergoes phosphorylation of multiple serine residues. This induces exposure of binding domains that can interact with p22Phox (4Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T.

Several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rac1 have been implicated in NADPH oxidase activity in neutrophils or in vitro, including VAV1 (15Kim C. Marchal C.C. Penninger J. Dinauer M.C.

Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). An important effector molecule for Rac1 is the serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which to a large extent mediates the effects of Rac1 and Cdc42 on the actin cytoskeleton (17Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal part, PAK1 contains a small GTPase-binding site, the p21-binding domain (PBD; amino acids 67-150), partially overlapping with the so-called auto-inhibitory domain (AID; amino acids 83-149), which is thought to engage in intramolecular bonding with the C-terminal kinase domain of PAK1 thereby preventing activity. However, binding of activated (GTP-loaded) Rac1 or Cdc42 to the PBD relieves this allosteric inhibitory mechanism, freeing the kinase domain for activity (18Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).It was recently shown that inhibition of PAK1 by the AID fragment exerts an inhibitory effect on the neutrophil respiratory burst (19Martyn K.D. Kim M.J. Quinn M.T. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Blood. 2005; 106: 3962-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are several putative mechanisms whereby PAK1 can affect NADPH oxidase activity, including RhoGDI phosphorylation (20DerMardirossian C. Schnelzer A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or regulation of actin dynamics involved in NADPH oxidase assembly. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays have established that p47Phox is a substrate of PAK1 (19Martyn K.D. Kim M.J. Quinn M.T. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Blood. 2005; 106: 3962-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M.

Blood. 2005; 106: 3962-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and whether such an effect is exerted through phosphorylation of p47Phox, remains unresolved.In the following we have investigated the role of PAK1, and its immediate upstream regulators VAV1 and Rac1, in NADPH oxidase activation in murine microglia. Using lentivectors to achieve efficient conditional expression of wild type or dominant-negative or -positive mutants of PAK1, VAV1, and Rac1, we demonstrate that PAK1 function is required for NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production following fMLP (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) stimulation and that this PAK1 activity depends on VAV1 and Rac1 as upstream signaling proteins. In contrast, we found no evidence for a role of PAK1 in IgG-immune complex-induced NADPH oxidase activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe murine microglia cell line Ra2 (56Sawada, M. (January 10, 2007) U.

A Ra2 cell line referred to as 045 was established by transduction with lentivector pLOX TW rtTA (25Vutskits G.V. Salmon P. Mayor L. Vutskits L. Cudre-Mauroux C. Soriano J. Montesano R. Maillet P.

Following transduction of Ra2 045 with GFP-expressing vector pLOX TW GFP, more than 95% of the cells expressed high levels of GFP after overnight induction with 0.1-0.3 μg/ml doxycycline, conditions that were also used for induction of all rtTA-regulated transgenes in this study. By extrapolating results obtained from titering of pLOX TW GFP virus on Ra2 045 cells, we estimate that cells have received pLOX TW-PAK1, VAV1, Rac1, and p47Phox lentivectors in a concentration of 20-40 multiplicities of infection, which resulted in high level expression of transgene in more than 90% of cells as estimated by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. In case of double transduction, PAK1-expressing Ra2 cells were superinfected with VAV1-L213A, Rac1-N17, or p47Phox-GFP-expressing lentivectors as specified.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—To analyze phosphorylation of endogenous murine PAK1, Ra2 microglia in suspension in HBSS were stimulated with 4 μm fMLP at 37 °C, and aliquots withdrawn at intervals were plunged into ice-cold PBS to stop the reaction. Following centrifugation, and lysis of pellet in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm MOPS, pH 8) with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma), immunoprecipitation with anti-PAK1 antibodies was carried out as described below. To analyze the effect of dominant-negative VAV1 and Rac1 on PAK1 activation, Ra2 microglia overexpressing PAK1 wild type alone, or in combination with either dominant-negative VAV1-L213A or Rac1-N17, were suspended in HBSS and stimulated with 2.5-5 μm fMLP at 37 °C for 2 min. Stimulation was stopped by addition of a large volume of ice-cold PBS. Following centrifugation and lysis of cell pellet in RIPA buffer, the precleared lysate was incubated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads and rabbit anti-PAK1 antibodies (4 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed in RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for subsequent electrophoresis, and Western blotted with rabbit or goat antibody specifically recognizing PAK1 phosphorylated at Thr-423 or mouse antibody recognizing the Myc tag of PAK1 wild type. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Ra2 microglia were harvested and washed in PBS, pelleted, and lysed in 5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% SB3-10, and 40 mm Trizma (Tris base), pH 10.1. After lysis, reduction with 4 mm tributylphosphine and alkylation of the samples with 15 mm iodoacetamide, aliquots were adjusted for protein concentration (Bio-Rad) and appropriate ampholytes (Bio-Rad) added. Then, 11-cm, pH 3-10, IPG strips (Bio-Rad) or pH 6-11 IPG strips (Sigma) were equilibrated overnight with 150 μl of lysate containing 300 μg of protein. Alternatively, for p47Phox-GFP immunoprecipitates, 11-cm, pH 5-8 or pH 4-7, IPG strips (Bio-Rad) were used. The next day isoelectric focusing (15,000-20,000 V-h for neutral pH strips and 70,000-80,000 V-h for pH 6-11 strips) and second dimension electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed. Protein was subsequently semidry-transferred to PVDF membranes and Western-blotted with anti-RhoGDI mAb (Transduction Laboratories) or polyclonal rabbit anti-p47Phox antibodies (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and kindly provided by Dr. Bill Nauseef, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, and Dr. Frans Wientjes, Dept. of Medicine, University College London, UK). Signal was developed with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Superoxide Production—Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was used to measure fMLP- or PMA-induced superoxide release as described previously (26Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with the exception that luminescent signal was measured in a thermostated Synergy HT microplate reader equipped with an injection module. Ra2 microglia in HBSS buffer on ice were warmed 1-2 min in a 37 °C water bath before dispensing into microtiter plates (Wallac black isoplates) at 100,000 cells/well. Subsequently, superoxide production of cells in suspension (plates were intermittently shaken to prevent cell lodging) was measured every 5-9 s at 37 °C before and after stimulation with 4 μm fMLP or 100 ng/ml PMA (final concentrations) delivered through the injector module. Alternatively, Ra2 cells were pre-incubated with or without 200 nm BIM-1 for 5 min before injection of arachidonic acid at a final concentration of 10 μm and measurement as above. To measure superoxide emitted during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, we used 5,7-DHCF-conjugated bovine serum albumin-IgG immune complexes (FcOxyburst, Molecular Probes), which form aggregates sufficiently large to be phagocytosed. One million Ra2 cells were incubated with FcOxyburst at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in a volume of 300 μl of HBSS on ice for 1 h, briefly centrifuged at low speed, resuspended, and then kept on ice in the dark until FACS analysis. Reaction was started by adding an excess of 37 °C HBSS containing a low concentration of goat anti-rabbit Alexa 633 antibodies to identify and gate cells with bound IgG aggregates. The cells were placed in a 37 °C thermostated chamber of a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) equipped with laser lines of 488 and 633 nm to excite 5,7-DHCF and Alexa 633, respectively, and emission filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and allophycocyanin detection, respectively. Cells with bound IgG aggregates (∼50% of total population, little variation between cell lines) were gated, and fluorescence intensity of 5,7-DHCF was sampled for 3000-5000 cells every 3rd min for up to 9 min. Mean fluorescence intensity of goat -anti-rabbit Alexa 633 after 30-60 s of mixing with antibodies was taken as measure of IgG-aggregate binding capacity of the cells, and 5,7-DHCF fluorescence was normalized to this value. Under the conditions used, 10 μm DPI or 1 mml-NMMA inhibited 5,7-DHCF fluorescence emission by 90 and 52%, respectively.Immunofluorescence—Ra2 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, and immunocytochemistry essentially performed as described (27Vilhardt F. Nielsen M. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with mouse anti-Myc mAb to detect PAK1, mouse anti-HA mAb to detect Rac1-N17, and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin to visualize fibrillary actin. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope with a C-Apochromat ×63, 1.2 oil immersion objective, using the 488 nm argon and 543 nm helium-neon laser lines for excitation of Alexa 488 and 568, respectively. Confocal sections (1.0-1.5 μm) were collected and saved as 512 × 512-pixel images at 8-bit resolution before import into Adobe Photoshop for compilation.RESULTSConditional Expression of Wild Type and Mutant PAK1 Protein in Murine Microglia Cell Line Ra2—The established Ra2 murine microglia cell line (23Inoue H. Sawada M. Ryo A. Tanahashi H. Wakatsuki T. Hada A. Kondoh N. Nakagaki K. Takahashi K. Suzumura A. Yamamoto M. Tabira T.

We investigated PAK isoform expression in these cells using PAK1-specific antibodies and a pan-PAK antibody recognizing a domain highly conserved in PAK1, -2, and -3 isoforms. Human HL60 cells were included for comparison. As seen in Fig. 1A, Ra2 cells expressed only PAK1 protein, whereas HL60 cells expressed PAK1 and either PAK2 or -3. For further analysis, Ra2 microglia were transduced with lentivector expressing the tetracycline-transactivating response protein (rtTA) and the resulting subline named Ra2 045. These cells were subsequently superinfected with lentiviral vectors expressing human wild type or mutant PAK1 protein, including PAK1-K299A, PBD (p21-binding domain), PAK1-T423E, and PAK1-H83L/H86L (see Table 1 for an overview of mutants used in this study) under the control of the rtTA/doxycycline-responsive promotor (25Vutskits G.V.

Transduced PAK1 protein in the different Ra2 cell populations was visualized by immunofluorescence using α-Myc antibodies (red) to localize transgene PAK and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin to stain filamentous actin (green). Neither PAK1 wild type, K299A, nor PBD-H83L caused major alterations of the fibrillary actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand dominant-positive PAK1-T423E induced blebbing of the plasma membrane (arrows) in a high proportion of cells, whereas PAK1-H83L/H86L promoted extension of broad lamellipodia (arrows). For comparison, expression of dominant-negative Rac1-N17, visualized with α-HA tag antibodies (red), caused complete cell rounding with loss of ruffles, filopodia, and lamellipodia. Bars in all panels are 10 μm. The shown images are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Morphological Effect of PAK1 Wild Type and Mutant Protein in Microglia—PAK1 is well known to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in mesenchymal cell types (28Dharmawardhane S. Brownson D. Lennartz M. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J.

To further verify the effect of expressed PAK1 transgenes, we therefore examined F-actin distribution by phalloidin staining in Ra2 cells expressing the various PAK1 mutants. Neither PAK1 wild type nor the K299A or PBD-H83L dominant-negative mutant proteins had any major effect on overall structure of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2) but could be seen to colocalize with actin in cortical structures. In contrast, PAK1-T423E had a tendency to induce plasma membrane “blebbing,” whereas the other active mutant PAK1-H83L/H86L greatly increased the extension of broad lamellipodia. The blebbing induced by PAK1-T423E expression was only present in a subpopulation of cells and did not result in increased cell death. Interestingly, this phenotype is indistinguishable from that of overexpression of the PAK1 substrate LIMK-1 alone (data not shown) and indicates that PAK1-T423E and -H83L/H86L differentially activate PAK1 targets that control cytoskeleton dynamics. For comparison, expression of dominant-negative Rac1-N17 induced collapse of the actin cytoskeleton into a cortical patch causing rounding of cells and inhibition of lamellipodia, filopodia, and membrane ruffle formation. Collectively the data indicate that PAK1 mutants were functional in Ra2 cells and resulted in specific cytoskeletal phenotypes. As there is a correlation between actin dynamics and NADPH oxidase function (31Heyworth P.G. Robinson J.M. Ding J. Ellis B.A. Badwey J.A. Histochem.

Plastre O. Sawada M. Suzuki K. Wiznerowicz M. Kiyokawa E. Trono D. Krause K-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42136-42143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), including fMLP, which in neutrophils is known to induce PAK1 activation (21Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the fMLP-induced respiratory burst by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (luminol E-CL) in Ra2 cells transduced with wild type or mutant PAK1, including the auto-inhibitory PBD fragment of PAK1. This region of PAK1 (amino acids 67-150) contains both the auto-inhibitory domain of PAK1 (also called AID), and binding sites for small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, expression of PAK1 wild type and the K299A mutant did not have a major effect on the respiratory burst, although PAK1-K299A consistently delayed the response. In contrast, expression of the PBD fragment inhibited superoxide production almost completely, and expression of PAK1-T423E and -H83L/H86L caused more than a 2-fold increase in superoxide release. To exclude that PBD, which binds both Rac1 and PAK1, was exerting its inhibitory effect by sequestering GTP-loaded"

Based on its novel structure, VSV G has been classified as class III viral fusion protein, having a predicted bipartite fusion domain comprising residues Trp-72, Tyr-73, Tyr-116, and Ala-117 that interacts with the host cell membrane to initiate the fusion reaction. Here, we carried out a systematic mutagenesis study of the predicted VSV G fusion loops, to investigate the functional role of the fusion domain. Using assays of low pH-induced cell-cell fusion and infection studies of mutant VSV G incorporated into viral particles, we show a fundamental role for the bipartite fusion domain. We show that Trp-72 is a critical residue for VSV G-mediated membrane fusion. Trp-72 could only tolerate mutation to a phenylalanine residue, which allowed only limited fusion. Tyr-73 and Tyr-116 could be mutated to other aromatic residues without major effect but could not tolerate any other substitution. Ala-117 was a less critical residue, with only charged residues unable to allow fusion activation.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 2The abbreviations used are:VSV Gglycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virusPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMLVmurine leukemia virusgBglycoprotein BHVS-1herpes simplex virus 1. is a prototypic virus in the Rhabdoviridae, which includes many important human, animal, and plant pathogens, including Rabies virus (1Lyles D.S. Rupprecht C.E. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. eds). Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1363-1408Google Scholar). VSV is an enveloped virus that is well known to infect cells via a low pH-dependent fusion reaction within endosomes (2Le Blanc I. Luyet P.P. Pons V. Ferguson C. Emans N. Petiot A. Mayran N. Demaurex N. Faure J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Regan A.D. Whittaker G.R. Pohlmann S. Simmons G. eds.

Virology. 2005; 338: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The virus contains a single envelope protein, termed the glycoprotein (G), which mediates both attachment to host cells and fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. This fusion event delivers the VSV genome into the host cell for viral replication. In addition to being a critical determinant of viral pathogenesis, VSV G has also served as an important model for protein folding and transport through the secretory pathway of cells (5Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). VSV G is used extensively in pseudotyped virus systems and as a delivery system for gene therapy applications (6Cronin J. Zhang X.Y. Reiser J. Curr. Gene Ther. 2005; 5: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and, due to the fact that VSV preferentially replicates and destroys immortalized or tumorigenic cells, the virus has been of great interest as an oncolytic agent in anticancer treatment (7Duntsch C.D. Zhou Q. Jayakar H.R. Weimar J.D. Robertson J.H. Pfeffer L.M. Wang L. Xiang Z. Whitt M.A. J.

The mature VSV G protein is an ∼65-kDa type I transmembrane protein containing 511 amino acids that oligomerizes into a homotrimer during transport to the cell surface, where the trimer is then assembled into the viral particle (8Jayakar H.R. Jeetendra E. Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike many other viral glycoproteins (9Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 241-280Google Scholar), VSV G is not subject to proteolytic priming for fusion activation. The fusogenic ability of VSV G has been of significant interest, because, unlike the proposed “spring-loaded” and essentially irreversible metastable state for the pre-fusion state of other fusion proteins such as influenza HA strain X-31 (10Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), VSV G is apparently fully reversible for fusion activation; it exists in a dynamic equilibrium between the pre-fusion and post-fusion states (11Gaudin Y. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 379-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, whereas most viral fusion proteins can be categorized into an obvious structural group, either class I or class II (12Colman P.M. Lawrence M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Kielian M. Virology. 2006; 344: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the distinct structural features of VSV G (14Roche S. Bressanelli S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Science. 2006; 313: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Roche S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Bressanelli S. Science. 2007; 315: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) have resulted in it being considered a novel “class III” fusion protein (16Weissenhorn W. Hinz A. Gaudin Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A critical feature of any viral fusion protein is the so-called “fusion peptide” (17Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285: 25-66PubMed Google Scholar), which inserts into the target membrane and is instrumental in initiating the merging of the two lipid bilayers (18Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In class I fusion proteins (e.g. influenza hemagglutinin and paramyxovirus F), the fusion peptide is a linear sequence that, in the case of influenza HA, is externalized by proteolytic cleavage and comprises a short kinked α-helix (19Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In class II fusion proteins, e.g. Semliki Forest virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus, the fusion peptide comprises an internal loop at one end of the fusion domain (20Allison S.L. Schalich J. Stiasny K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Prior to determination of its x-ray structure, the identification of the VSV G fusion peptide was challenging. Initial attempts to understand membrane fusion utilized hydrophobic photolabeling and demonstrated that VSV was able to interact with the host cell membrane in response to low pH, and that residues 59-221 of the G protein were in close proximity to the membrane during this process (21Durrer P. Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W. Graf R. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17575-17581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of VSV G demonstrated that modification of a highly conserved region (residues 118-139) abolished fusion activity or modified the pH of fusion activation (22Fredericksen B.L. Whitt M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Li Y. Drone C. Sat E. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4070-4077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in particular, the mutations G124A, P127G/L, and A133K dramatically decreased cell-cell fusion activity. Other mutations at this region, such as F125Y and D137N, shifted the optimum pH for G protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. Overall, the region between amino acids 118 and 139 was generally considered to represent an internal fusion peptide for VSV G (17Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285: 25-66PubMed Google Scholar). However, other studies demonstrated that amino acids 395-418 (the membrane-proximal region) have an significant influence on fusion (25Shokralla S. He Y. Wanas E. Ghosh H. Virology. 1998; 75: 39-50Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and additional studies identified region 145-164, termed the p2-like peptide, as being a pivotal domain in facilitating glycoprotein G-mediated membrane fusion (26Carneiro F.A. Lapido-Loureiro P.A. Cordo S.M. Stauffer F. Weissmuller G. Bianconi M.L. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Bisch P.M. Poian A.T. Eur. Biophys.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13789-13794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A synthetic p2 peptide was shown to mediate liposome-liposome fusion in a low pH- and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner (27Carneiro F.A. Stauffer F. Lima C.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Poian Da A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13789-13794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that the action of the p2-like peptide was specifically facilitated by electrostatic interactions between phosphatidylserine and two histidine residues within this region (26Carneiro F.A. Lapido-Loureiro P.A. Cordo S.M. Stauffer F. Weissmuller G. Bianconi M.L. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Bisch P.M. Poian A.T. Eur. Biophys.

Unlike for some other viral fusion proteins, notably Semliki Forest virus E1 (29Ahn A. Gibbons D.L. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3267-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), there is no apparent requirement for interaction of the VSV G fusion loops with specific lipids (30Teissier E. Pecheur E.I. Eur. Biophys. J. 2007; 36: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although VSV G-mediated binding to and fusion with liposomes is enhanced by the presence of acidic phospholipid head groups (e.g. phosphatidylserine) and cholesterol (31Yamada S. Ohnishi S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). With the availability of high resolution x-ray structures for both the pre- and post-fusion forms of the VSV G ectodomain (amino acids 1-410), it was subsequently suggested that domain IV of VSV G comprises the fusion domain (14Roche S. Bressanelli S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Science. 2006; 313: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Roche S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Bressanelli S. Science. 2007; 315: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), because it has considerable structural similarity to the fusion domains of class II fusion proteins. Domain IV (residues 51-180) of VSV G is composed of an extended β-sheet with two obvious loops at one end and has a conserved set of four hydrophobic residues exposed at the end of the loops (Trp-72, Tyr-73, Tyr-116, and Ala-117) (Fig. 1). The hydrophobic nature of this bipartite fusion loop is conserved across a wide range of divergent rhabdoviruses (Fig. 1). This arrangement of hydrophobic loops is highly reminiscent of the fusion peptide (or fusion loop) of a class II fusion protein (20Allison S.L. Schalich J. Stiasny K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, a significant difference for VSV G is that the hydrophobic amino acids are shared over two non-contiguous loops, whereas for class II fusion proteins the key amino acids are on a contiguous stretch of primary sequence. In support of the suggestion that this bipartite loop comprises a critical fusion domain, selection of fusion-defective mutants previously identified one of these amino acids (Ala-117 in the second loop region) as having a critical function in VSV G-mediated membrane fusion (22Fredericksen B.L. Whitt M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation was previously referred to as an A133K substitution due to different numbering of amino acids in the G protein sequence. Based on the available x-ray structure of VSV G, here we systematically mutated the proposed bipartite fusion loop of VSV G (residues Trp-72, Tyr-73, Tyr-116, and Ala-117) and characterized how these amino acids modulate membrane fusion activity. These data represent an analysis of the molecular architecture of the fusion-active loops of VSV G, a founder member of the class III family of viral fusion proteins. Cell Culture—Vero E6 cells and 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid phCMV-VSV G encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana glycoprotein (VSV G) (NCBI accession number CAC47944) (32Beyer W.R. Westphal M. Ostertag W. Laer von D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Jean Dubuisson (Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille Cedex, France). Site-directed mutagenesis using phCMV-VSV G as a template was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). According to the manufacturer's protocol, pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were designed to introduce the desired mutations. Mutations were then confirmed by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Automated 3730 DNA Analyzer at the Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center. Biotinylation of Surface Protein and Immunoprecipitation—Vero E6 cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant VSV G-expressing plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, for 24 h at 37 °C, or for 36 h at 32 °C. For cell-surface biotinylation, the transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then cells were labeled with 250 μg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. The biotin-labeled cells were then added to 150 mm ice-cold glycine solution for 20 min to quench unlabeled free biotin followed by an ice-cold PBS wash. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxylcholic acid, pH 7.4), including complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and the cell lysates were affinity-purified using immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the NeutrAvidin beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by the addition of SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample loading buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. The surface-biotinylated VSV G protein was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-VSV G monoclonal antibody P5D4 (kindly provided by Dr. Ari Helenius, ETH-Zurich), and images were obtained from LAS-3000 mini Fujifilm imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd). The biotinylation assay was repeated three times, and the results obtained in the Western blot were quantified using IP Lab software (Scanalytics) and plotted in Sigma Plot 9.0 (Systat Software). Syncytium Formation Assay and Luciferase Reporter Gene Fusion Assay—Subconfluent Vero cells in 24-well plates were transfected with phCMV-VSV G plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant G protein, using Lipofectamine 2000, for 24 h at 37 °C or 32 °C before induction of syncytium formation. To examine low pH-induced syncytia formation, the transfected cells were rinsed once with PBS and then incubated with HMSS fusion buffer (5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MES, 5 mm sodium succinate 150 mm NaCl, adjusted to the indicated pH with HCl, stored at room temperature) for 1 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fresh culture medium for another 3 h after fusion induction. Finally, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and without being permeabilized, the cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-VSV G ectodomain-specific monoclonal antibody I 14 (clone 1E9F9) (33Lefrancois L. Lyles D.S. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 394-398PubMed Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Ari Helenius, ETH-Zurich) and Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). Using a 20× Plan Apo objective (numerical aperture, 0.75). Images were captured with a Sensicam EM camera (Cooke Corp.) using IP Lab software (Scanalytics). For quantification of syncytium formation, the percentage of cells involved in syncytia was determined by counting the ratio of cells in syncytia containing three or more nuclei to total cells in the field. The experiments were repeated three times, and >500 cells from at least 5 different fields were counted in each experiment. Cell-cell fusion mediated by G protein was also quantified by a luciferase reporter gene assay, with plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Tom Gallagher, Loyola University, Chicago, IL. In brief, 293T cells in each well of a 24-well plate were co-transfected with 125 ng of plasmid encoding luciferase cDNA under control of T7 promoter and 125 ng of VSV G wild-type or mutant plasmids, using 1 μl of Exgen 500 (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) at either 37 °C or 32 °C depending on the mutants used for transfection. 24 h post-transfection, transfected 293T cells were overlaid at a 1:3 ratio with 293T cells, which had been previously transfected with a plasmid encoding T7 polymerase. The 293T cell mixtures were cultured for 1 h to allow cells to adhere to the plate. Cell-cell fusion was induced with low pH buffer as described above. The cells were lysed 4 h post-fusion, and the supernatants were measured for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light emission was measured using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Production and Transduction of VSV G-pseudotyped Virions—VSV G protein-pseudotyped particles were generated from a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based transfer vector system as described previously (34Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 35Blanchard E. Belouzard S. Goueslain L. Wakita T. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. Rouille Y. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6964-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) with plasmid-encoding luciferase flanked by retroviral packaging sequences and an MLV Gag-Pol construct were kindly provided by Dr. Jean Dubuisson (Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille Cedex, France). The phCMV-VSV G wild-type or mutant plasmids, together with the plasmids encoding luciferase, murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol, were transfected into 293T cells using Exgen 500 (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 48 h or 32 °C for 72 h depending on the VSV G mutants used in the transfection. The supernatants containing pseudotyped particles were harvested 48 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-sized membranes before used for infection assay. To analyze G protein incorporation into pseudotyped particles, the viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, 700 μl of viral supernatants was layered on the top of 300 μl of 30% sucrose cushion and subject to ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 2 h in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman), before the samples were analyzed by Western blot. The monoclonal antibodies P5D4 and R187 (American Type Culture Collection), recognizing the G protein and the MLV Gag protein, respectively, were used to detect VSV G and the retroviral Gag protein in the Western blot. Transduction of pseudoparticles was performed using Vero E6 cells. For a typical infection assay, 100 μl of supernatant containing either wild-type or mutant G protein-pseudotyped MLV particles was used to infect Vero E6 cells for 72 h. The cells were lysed 72 h post-infection, and luciferase activity in the lysates was measured using the same method as described above for the luciferase-based cell-cell fusion assay. Mutagenesis of the VSV G Fusion Loops and Cell Surface Expression—To determine the functional properties underlying the molecular architecture of the VSV G fusion loops, we performed a systematic mutagenesis study of the four residues predicted to comprise the bipartite fusion loop (Trp-72, Tyr-73, Tyr-116, and Ala-117). In each case we substituted a variety of amino acids with different R groups; comprising bulky aromatic residues (e.g. Phe, Tyr, and Trp), polar uncharged residues (e.g. Asn), non-polar aliphatic residues (e.g. Val and Ala), and both positively and negatively charged residues (e.g. Arg and Asp). These mutants are shown in Table 1, along with a qualitative measure of their surface expression, using immunofluorescence microscopy of the G protein in non-permeabilized Vero cells. Mutants were qualitatively scored as being surface-expressed at medium or high levels (at least half of the level of expression of wild type), or at low or very low levels (less than half of the level of expression of wild type) (see Table 1). At 37 °C, many mutants showed low, or very low, levels of surface expression. However, in these cases surface expression could often be rescued by lowering the temperature to 32 °C. All mutants showed high expression at both 37 °C and 32 °C when total G protein was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy of permeabilized Vero cells (data not shown). Mutants with low or very low surface expression had extensive localization to an intracellular compartment (data not shown). Only those mutants that showed a qualitatively medium or high level of cell surface expression at 32 °C were considered suitable for subsequent fusion and entry assays. These mutants were tested further by quantitative assays, using a combination of cell surface biotinylation and streptavidin pull down of total cell surface material, followed by Western blotting for the G protein. These results are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. All the mutants selected for further analysis had surface expression of >50% of the wild-type at 32 °C.TABLE 1Surface expressions for amino acid substitutionsTarget amino acidAmino acid substitutionSurface expression at 37 °CSurface expression at 32 °CTarget amino acidAmino acid substitutionSurface expression at 37 °CSurface expression at 32 °CTrp-72F+++++++Tyr-116F++++++++Y++++++W++++++++V+++++V+++++A+++++A+++++T+++T+++K+++K+++Tyr-73F++++++++Ala-117K+++++++W++++++++N++++NTaNT, not tested.V++++F++++NTA++++H++++NTT+++D++++NTN+++R++++NTa NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab Cell-Cell Fusion and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays of Wild-type and Mutant VSV G—To examine membrane fusion mediated by wild-type and mutant VSV G, we first performed cell-cell fusion assays on Vero cells followed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize syncytia formation. Plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant G protein were transfected into Vero cells for 24 h, and then the transfected cells were treated briefly with fusion buffer at pH 6.6, pH 6.1, or pH 5.7. These pH values were chosen based on previous studies showing that, although G is optimally fusogenic at pH 5.7 and does not fuse at pH 6.6, some mutants only show changes in syncytia formation under suboptimal conditions (i.e. pH 6.1) (36Shokralla S. He Y. Wanas E. Ghosh H.P. Virology. 1998; 242: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using visual scoring of syncytia as a read-out of membrane fusion, the wild-type G protein did not fuse at pH 6.6, fused extensively at pH 5.7, and caused limited syncytia formation at pH 6.1 (Fig. 2). In the case of substitution of Trp-72, only small syncytia could be detected for the mutant W72F at pH 5.7, with syncytia barely detectable at pH 6.1. Essentially no syncytia formation occurred for any other substitution of Trp-72, at either pH 6.1 or 5.7. In contrast, substitutions of Tyr-73 and Tyr-116 to Trp or Phe did not dramatically affect cell-cell fusion at pH 5.7, however much more limited fusion than wild-type was apparent at pH 6.1. Substitutions of Tyr-73 and Tyr-116 to Val or Ala completely abolished fusion at both pH 6.1 and 5.7. In general, mutations at position 117 allowed efficient fusion at pH 5.7 when Ala-117 was mutated to uncharged residue (Asn or Phe), but allowed much less fusion when Ala-117 was mutated to a charged residues (Asp, Lys, His, or Arg). These data are quantified in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Quantification of syncytium formation in cells expressing wild-type or mutant VSV G protein. The percentage of cells involved in syncytia at pH 5.7 (A) or pH 6.1 (B) was determined by counting the ratio of cells in syncytia containing three or more nuclei to total cells in the field. The experiments were repeated three times, and greater than 500 cells from at least five different fields were counted in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next employed luciferase as a reporter gene, to quantify the VSV G-based membrane fusion activity. In this assay, we expressed the VSV G protein in 293T cells because of their better transfection efficiency. In all cases, the expression level of the wild type and mutants was comparable to that in Vero E6 cells (data not shown). In this luciferase reporter gene cell-cell fusion assay, induction of luciferase gene expression occurs upon the fusion of cells expressing the T7 polymerase gene and cells expressing both a T7 polymerase driven-luciferase gene and VSV G. Luciferase activity after induction of fusion is used as an indicator of the fusogenic activity of G protein. Co-cultures of 293T cells transfected with wild-type or mutant G protein and T7 polymerase driven-luciferase, and 293T cells transfected with T7 polymerase, were treated with buffer at several pH values (pH 5.1, 5.4, 5.7, 5.9, 6.1, and 6.6), and luciferase activities were then measured after 4 h. These data are shown in Fig. 4, with luciferase activity at pH 6.6 normalized to 1.0 and activities at the lower pH values expressed as the -fold enhancement compared with pH 6.6. Mutation of tryptophan 72 to other residues had a marked effect on membrane fusion (Fig. 4A). At pH 5.7, only substitution of Trp-72 with phenylalanine (W72F) resulted in fusion activity (27% of the wild-type fusion level). In this case, fusion was rescued by lowering the pH, with fusion at pH 5.1 being close to the wild-type level. The substitution of tryptophan for tyrosine (Trp-72Y), also gave a marked pH shift in fusion activation, however in this case fusion at pH 5.1 was only 54% of the wild-type level. For the other mutants tested (W72V and W72A), membrane fusion was at background levels for all pH values tested. Mutation of tyrosine 73 also markedly affected membrane fusion (Fig. 4B). Both phenylalanine and tryptophan substitutions gave a pH-shifted fusion phenotype; at pH 5.1, Y73F and Y73W allowed efficient membrane fusion, although fusion activity at pH 5.7 was only 31 and 29%, respectively, of the level of the wild type. For the other mutants tested (Y73V and Y73A), membrane fusion was at background levels for all pH values tested. Although in this case we cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of fusion was due to limited cell surface expression (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). Mutation of tyrosine 116 gave essentially similar results to Tyr-73 (Fig. 4C). The Y116V and Y116A mutations resulted in background fusion, however substitution with aromatic residues was generally better tolerated; the Y116W mutation behaved essentially as wild-type, and the Y116F mutation had 66% of the fusion activity of wild type at pH 5.7. Interestingly, fusion of the Y116F mutant could not be rescued to wild-type levels by lowering the pH;"
https://openalex.org/W1981220126,"Bone morphogenetic proteins regulate many developmental processes during embryogenesis as well as tissue homeostasis in the adult. Signaling of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is accomplished by binding to two types of serine/threonine kinase transmembrane receptors termed type I and type II. Because a large number of ligands signal through a limited number of receptors, ligand-receptor interaction in the BMP superfamily is highly promiscuous, with a ligand binding to various receptors and a receptor binding many different BMP ligands. In this study we investigate the interaction of BMP-2 with its two high affinity type I receptors, BMP receptors IA (BMPR-IA) and BMPR-IB. Interestingly, 50% of the residues in the BMP-2 binding epitope of the BMPR-IA receptor are exchanged in BMPR-IB without a decrease in binding affinity or specificity for BMP-2. Our structural and functional analyses show that promiscuous binding of BMP-2 to both type I receptors is achieved by inherent backbone and side-chain flexibility as well as by variable hydration of the ligand-receptor interface enabling the BMP-2 surface to adapt to different receptor geometries. Despite the high degree of amino acid variability found in BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB binding equally to BMP-2, three single point missense mutations in the ectodomain of BMPR-IA cannot be tolerated. In juvenile polyposis syndrome these mutations have been shown to inactivate BMPR-IA. On the basis of our biochemical and biophysical analyses, we can show that the mutations, which are located outside the ligand binding epitope, alter the local or global fold of the receptor, thereby inactivating BMPR-IA and causing a loss of the BMP-2 tumor suppressor function in colon epithelial cells.

Receptor activation by the BMP ligand is accomplished by binding and oligomerization of two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II. Transphosphorylation of the intracellular receptor domains results in phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, e.g. SMAD proteins, which then activate gene transcription. BMP-2 binds the type I receptors BMPR-IA and -IB with high affinity and ActR-I with lower affinity (4Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R.

Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These ligands should, therefore, have common structural elements that allow them to bind to the same receptor as well as unique features allowing for discriminative recognition between different cognate receptors. In GDF-5, type I receptor specificity depends on a single residue; substitution of Arg-57 for Ala results in a loss of discriminatory binding capabilities of GDF-5 for BMPR-IB and -IA (20Nickel J. Kotzsch A. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In BMP-2 alanine occupies this exact position, possibly explaining the promiscuous binding to both type I receptors. The loss of type I receptor specificity of human GDF-5 R57L leads to the disease symphalangism characterized by the fusion of the interphalangeal joints (21Seemann P. Schwappacher R. Kjaer K.W.

This finding clearly indicates that GDF-5-induced skeletal malformation can result not only from loss in receptor binding but also from loss in receptor specificity.

Recently, missense mutations in the BMPR1A gene were linked to juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by excessive colorectal polyp growth giving predisposition for colorectal cancer (27Howe J.R.

Concordantly, inactivating mutations in as well as knock-out of SMAD4 can also lead to JPS (27Howe J.R. Sayed M.G. Ahmed A.F. Ringold J. Larsen-Haidle J. Merg A. Mitros F.A. Vaccaro C.A.

Thus, BMP-2, via signaling through BMPR-IA, exhibits a tumor suppressor function in epithelial cells (30Auclair B.A. Benoit Y.D. Rivard N. Mishina Y. Perreault N. Gastroenterology. 2007; 133: 887-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whereas the loss of BMP signaling in JPS can easily be explained for nonsense mutations in BMPR-IA, the mechanism of inactivation of the known missense mutations in the extracellular BMP-2 binding domain of BMPR-IA is not understood due to their location outside the ligand binding epitope. In this study we present a structural and functional study of how ligand-receptor promiscuity for the BMP-2 type I receptor interaction is encoded on a molecular level. Structural analysis of a complex of BMP-2 bound to a BMPR-IB mimic indicates that limited specificity for type I receptor recognition is due to structural plasticity in the receptor as well as in the ligand binding epitope. In vitro and cell-based analyses of BMPR-IA variants with missense mutations in the extracellular part leading to JPS reveal that these mutations result in a loss of structural integrity despite the structural plasticity/flexibility of BMPR-IA found in our comparison of different BMP-2 type I receptor complexes. Protein Preparation—The ectodomains of BMPR-IA and variants thereof were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins and are purified as described (31Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Protein homogeneity was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. For preparation of ligand-receptor complexes, BMP-2 was dissolved in water, and a 2.1-fold excess of the receptor protein in the same volume of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.4 m NaCl was added. The protein complex was concentrated and applied to gel filtration for the removal of excess of receptor protein. Crystallization and Structure Determination—For crystallization, protein concentration of the ligand-receptor complexes was adjusted to 8 mg ml-1. Crystals of the various complexes grew from 0.7 to 0.9 m potassium/sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 to 8.2, 25% ethylene glycol and appeared after 5 days. Datasets were acquired at the beamline PX14.1 at BESSY (Berlin) or on a home source (Rigaku MicroMax007 with VariMax optics) at 100 K. Data were processed with the software CrystalClear (Rigaku). Complex structures were determined employing molecular replacement using the software Phaser and the structure of BMP-2·BMPR-IA (PDB code 1REW) as template. Structures were refined with Refmac Version 5.02, and manual rebuilding was performed using the XBuild module of the software package Quanta2006 (Accelrys). Data collection and refinement statistics are outlined in supplemental Table 4. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded from 185 to 240 nm using 30 scans, a scanning speed of 200 nm min-1, and a 1-nm bandwidth. Receptor proteins were dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.1 mg ml-1. The mean residue ellipticity [θ] was determined from the measured ellipticity θλ by application of [θ] = θλ × 100/(c × d × NA), with c being the molar concentration, d being the path length, and NA being the number of amino acids in the protein. Thermal denaturation data were acquired using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer. Proteins were heated from 20 to 96 °C at a rate of 2 °C min-1. Scans from 185 to 240 nm were acquired at 5 °C temperature increments. After heating to 96 °C, the protein was cooled down to 20 °C at a rate of ∼16 °C/min, and a spectrum was measured to test for refolding. The melting temperature (Tm) was determined from the wavelength showing a maximum difference between the folded and unfolded state. Interaction Analysis—Biosensor-based interaction analysis was performed as described previously (20Nickel J. Kotzsch A. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Receptor ectodomains or BMP-2 were biotinylated and immobilized on a streptavidin-coated CM5 sensor chip. BMP-2 or soluble ectodomains were perfused over the sensor chip using six different analyte concentrations. The sensorgrams were evaluated using the software BIAevaluation 2.4. Bulk face effects were corrected by subtracting a control flow cell (FC1) from all sensorgrams. Dissociation constants were obtained from the kinetic rate constants for complex formation (kon) and dissociation (koff). Mean values with a S.D. of 30% for koff and 15% for kon were deduced from 6-12 independent measurements. SMAD2/3 Luciferase Reporter-Gene Assays—BMP type I-activin type IB receptor chimeras, which have the extracellular domain of the BMP type I receptor (BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, BMPR-IA/IBC, BMPR-IA-P34R, BMPR-IA-Y39D, BMPR-IA-T55I) and the transmembrane helix and intracellular kinase domain of ActR-IB were constructed to measure BMP-2-induced signals uncoupled from endogenous BMP receptors. For transient transfections, HEK293TSA cells were seeded in 24-well poly-(l)-lysine-coated plates (Greiner) at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The cells were cotransfected with 50 ng/well pSV β-gal (Promega), 100 ng/well p(CAGA)12-Luc reporter plasmid, and 50-100 ng/well of the pcDNA3.1 plasmids encoding for the different BMP type I receptors using HEKfectin (Bio-Rad). After 24 h cells were treated with 5 or 10 nm BMP-2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside conversion at 405 nm. Luciferase activity was determined using the Promega luciferase assay kit. All assays were performed twice with each experiment performed in duplicate. BMPR-IA Competition Assay in C3H10T1/2 Cells—C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with the BRE-luciferase reporter construct were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a density of 3 × 104 cells cm-2. After 16 h the medium was exchanged, and the cells were stimulated with 5 nm BMP-2 plus increasing concentrations of BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, BMPR-IA/IBC, and BMPR-IA variants (log 2 dilutions starting from 1 μm) for 72 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined as described above. Each experiment was performed twice, and all assays were performed in duplicate. BMP-2 Induced Inhibition of MPC11 Cell Proliferation—MPC11 cells (ATCC CCL167) were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 103 cells/well. For inhibition of cell proliferation 5 nm BMP2 (IC50 = 5 nm) was added. For competition, increasing concentrations of the receptor ectodomains (2 nm to 1 μm) were added. After 72 h 10 μl of [3H]thymidine (0.25 μCi, Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well. The cells were immobilized after 24 h on fiber mats (Scatron), and the thymidine incorporation was determined using a γ-counter. All assays were performed in duplicate, and the experiments were repeated twice. Cellular Localization of BMPR-IA Variants—Full-length wild type BMPR-IA and the BMPR-IA mutants P34R, Y39D, and T55I were cloned into pcDNA3.1 with CFP fused to the C terminus of the intracellular kinase domain and transiently transfected into HEK293TSA cells using Polyfect (Qiagen). As a control for plasma membrane staining, enhanced yellow fluorescing protein with the palmitylation sequence of the Lyn kinase fused to its N terminus was co-transfected. 24 h after transfection cells were transferred to a poly-(l)-lysine-coated glass slide. Cell nuclei were stained by incubation with Hoechst 33343 and analyzed using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope at 630-fold magnification. For excitation of the fluorophores, wavelengths of 350 nm (Hoechst 33343), 436 nm (CFP), and 490 nm (yellow fluorescent protein) were used. Emission was recorded at 450 nm (Hoechst 33343), 476 nm (CFP), and 535 nm (yellow fluorescent protein). Individual images were analyzed with Leica confocal software (Leica) and merged using the software package ImageJ. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis 2 × 105 HEK293TSA cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 harboring full-length wild type or mutant BMPR-IA with an N-terminal FLAG tag. The transfected cells were incubated in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3) supplemented with mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:200, Sigma) or the same amount of an isotype-specific control antibody (mouse IgG1, clone R73) for 1 h. Cells were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Dianova) for 30 min. After another washing, step cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using the software CellQuest. Living cells were electronically gated according to their light scatter characteristics, which have been determined by counter-staining with propidium iodide. Coordinate Deposition—The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the structures of the complex of BMP-2·BMPR-IA/IBC, BMP-2·BMPR-IA_B1, and BMP-2·BMPR-IA_B12 have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 2QJB, 2QJ9 and 2QJA, respectively). The BMPR-IA/IBC Chimeric Variant Represents a BMPR-IB Mimic—We have created a BMP receptor variant that has the ligand binding epitope formed by the amino acids of BMPR-IB but has a BMPR-IA scaffold (Fig. 1) because crystals of the complex of BMP-2 and BMPR-IBec suitable for structure determination could not be obtained despite great efforts. The equilibrium binding constants for the interaction of BMP-2 with either BMPR-IA or -IB differ only slightly; however, analyses of the binding kinetics reveal clear differences for the binding to both receptors (Table 1). BMP-2 binding to BMPR-IB reproducibly shows a 2-3-fold increased dissociation rate, whereas the association kinetic is almost unaffected. Thus, the parameters for binding kinetics were used to judge whether a variant exhibits BMPR-IA- or BMPR-IB-like binding character.TABLE 1Binding affinities of BMPR-IA/BMPR-IB chimeras to BMP-2Receptor proteinAssociation rate konDissociation rate koffDissociation binding constant KD105 M−1 s−110−4 s−1nMBMPR-IA3.42.40.7BMPR-IA_B14.09.72.4BMPR-IA_B123.03.41.1BMPR-IA/IBC2.811.14.9BMPR-IB2.57.02.7 Open table in a new tab Exchange of residues Lys-88 to Thr-98 in BMPR-IA, located in the loop between helix α1 and β-strand 5, results in the variant BMPR-IA_B1, which already exhibits the same binding parameters for BMP-2 as observed for BMPR-IB. The additional exchange of residues Ala-74 to Tyr-80 located in β-strand 4 (BMPR-IA_B12) reverts the binding characteristics seen for the precursor variant BMPR-IA_B1. A BMPR-IA-like binding characteristic was then observed for all further BMPR-IA/-IB chimeras until all residues in the binding epitope were exchanged for those of BMPR-IB (Fig. 1, a and b). Consistently, all binding parameters of this chimera BMPR-IA/IBC to GDF-5 (20Nickel J. Kotzsch A. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and BMP-2 are indistinguishable from those of wild type BMPR-IB (Table 1). In Vivo Signaling of BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and the Chimera BMPR-IA/IBC Are Similar—Cell-based assays were used to evaluate binding and signaling properties of BMPR-IA/IBC. C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with the BRE-luciferase reporter construct were used to determine inhibition of BMP-2 signaling by the application of type I receptor ectodomain proteins. All receptor ectodomain proteins, BMPR-IAec, BMPR-IBec, and BMPR-IA/IBCec, exhibit a concentration-dependent inhibition of BMP-2-induced SMAD1/5/8 signaling by competing with the endogenous receptors for BMP-2 binding (Fig. 2a). The IC50 value of BMPR-IAec is below 500 nm, whereas that of BMPR-IBec and BMPR-IA/IBCec is 500 nm or slightly higher. To measure how BMPR-IB and BMPR-IA/IBC signal upon BMP-2 binding, we implemented a different luciferase-based reporter-gene assay in HEK293T cells. BMP-2-induced signaling by endogenous receptors was uncoupled from the cellular readout by fusing the extracellular part of BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, or BMPR-IA/IBC to the transmembrane part and kinase domain of ActR-IB. Upon BMP-2 activation these BMPR-ActR-IB receptor chimeras signal via the SMAD2/3 pathway, which does not occur naturally. This assay clearly shows that BMP-2 not only binds to BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and BMPR-IA/IBC but also led to signaling activities of a similar magnitude in our setup (Fig. 2b). In summary, BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB bind BMP-2 with similar affinities, but different binding kinetics indicate differences in the binding mechanism. The newly designed receptor chimera BMPR-IA/IBC, which shares the binding epitope of BMPR-IB, exhibits binding and signaling capabilities indistinguishable from that of wild type BMPR-IB and, thus, can be used as a BMPR-IB mimic in structural and functional studies. Structural Plasticity in the BMP-2 Type I Receptor Complex—We analyzed the structure of the complex of BMP-2 bound to the BMPR-IB mimic BMPR-IA/IBC and compared it to that of the BMP-2·BMPR-IAec complex (32Keller S. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains a full complex consisting of the BMP-2 dimer and two BMPR-IA/IBCec molecules (Fig. 3, a and b). The complex structures of BMP-2·BMPR-IAec and BMP-2·BMPR-IA/IBCec are highly similar (root mean square deviation ∼ 0.8 Å), indicating that the overall complex architecture is unchanged (supplemental Fig. 1). The receptor ectodomain positions within the complex structure are identical for both type I receptors BMPR-IA and BMPR-IA/IBC (root mean square deviation 0.4 Å for Cα of receptor ectodomain without peripheral loops), showing that despite the 18 amino acid exchanges in the ligand binding epitopes, no displacement of the receptor in the wrist epitope is required to adapt the ligand BMP-2 to the different receptor surfaces (Fig. 1b). Thus, a possible explanation for the promiscuity in receptor binding might be in a slight structural variation within the receptor and ligand binding sites to allow binding and recognition of different receptors or ligands. The main binding determinants established in the complex BMP-2·BMPR-IAec (31Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Keller S. Nickel J.

In Escherichia coli, the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways are connected through a common metabolite provided by a single enzyme.

One of the major aims of systems biology is to achieve a global understanding of metabolism by developing models able to describe and predict molecular and cellular functions at the level of whole metabolic pathways (1Bruggeman F.J. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the objective is to obtain comprehensive computer models of an entire living cell and all its functions. To attain such a goal, the International Escherichia coli Alliance was launched in 2002 to consolidate global E. coli modeling efforts. As a part of this global project, we developed a reliable mathematical model for arginine biosynthesis, based on the existing detailed knowledge of the principal regulatory mechanisms operating at both the genetic and the enzymatic levels of arginine metabolism (for reviews see Refs. 2Cunin R.

A molecular kinetic model will be used that is appropriate for the description of highly regulated systems, in particular to establish a hierarchy of the different regulatory mechanisms at work in the system (4Goldbeter A. Nature. 2002; 420: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This model can then be used to predict arginine production in strains containing different modifications of the regulatory circuits. Arginine constitutes about 5% of the total proteins of E. coli. Arginine and its precursor ornithine are used for the biosynthesis of the most common polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, which are required for optimal growth through their involvement in several physiological processes (3Charlier D. Glansdorff N. Böck A. Curtiss R. Kaper J.B. Neidhardt F.C. Nyström T. Rudd K.E. Squires C.L. (eds) module 3.6.1.10. Biosynthesis of Arginine and Polyamines. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2004Google Scholar). In addition, under conditions of nitrogen starvation, arginine can be used as a (poor) nitrogen source by the arginine succinyltransferase pathway (5Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J.

Arginine is synthesized from glutamate in eight enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Five steps involving N-acetylated intermediates lead to ornithine, and three additional steps are required to convert ornithine into arginine (2Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Charlier D. Glansdorff N. Böck A. Curtiss R. Kaper J.B. Neidhardt F.C. Nyström T. Rudd K.E. Squires C.L. (eds) module 3.6.1.10. Biosynthesis of Arginine and Polyamines. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2004Google Scholar). The biosynthetic enzymes are listed in Table 1. The synthesis of all enzymes is subject to repression by arginine, mediated by the repressor ArgR. In addition, the first enzyme of the pathway, N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGSase), 7The abbreviations used are:NAGSaseN-acetylglutamate synthaseCPSasecarbamyl phosphate synthaseCPcarbamyl phosphateOTCaseornithine transcarbamylaseATCaseaspartate transcarbamylase.7The abbreviations used are:NAGSaseN-acetylglutamate synthaseCPSasecarbamyl phosphate synthaseCPcarbamyl phosphateOTCaseornithine transcarbamylaseATCaseaspartate transcarbamylase. is subject to feedback inhibition by arginine (7Vyas S.

In E. coli, a single carbamyl phosphate synthase (CPSase) provides carbamyl phosphate (CP) for both the arginine and the de novo pyrimidine biosyntheses (Fig. 1). Reflecting the dual function of CPSase, its synthesis is subject to cumulative repression by arginine and pyrimidines (9Piérard A. Glansdorff N. Mergeay M. Wiame J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 14: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Piette J. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. Cunin R. Weyens G. Crabeel M. Charlier D. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4134-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, CPSase activity is subject to a complex network of metabolic regulations as follows: inhibition by UMP, antagonized by ornithine and IMP, which are activators (11Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3164-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Piérard A. Science. 1966; 154: 1572-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CP is used for arginine biosynthesis by ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase), an enzyme whose activity is not metabolically regulated. CP is also used by aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) in the first committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. The synthesis of ATCase is repressed by pyrimidines, and its activity is synergistically inhibited by CTP and UTP and activated by ATP (13Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the complex regulations of CPSase and ATCase, which enable the cell to respond to the challenge of providing CP for two pathways with sometimes conflicting demands, the balance of CP utilization between arginine and pyrimidine biosyntheses in different growth conditions cannot be predicted solely by an intuitive approach. The model presented here will be the first to describe in mathematical terms the distribution of the shared metabolite CP between the two biosynthetic pathways. More globally, to understand and describe arginine biosynthesis in quantitative terms, a simple mathematical model that can account for the experimentally observed steady-state levels of the various metabolites of the system needed to be developed. This model should also have the capability to describe the evolution of the concentrations of these metabolites during transitions between steady states. In this study, we focus on a detailed and quantitative description of the arginine metabolic pathway; the evolution of the pyrimidine concentrations, whose levels affect the activities of both CPSase and ATCase, is described by phenomenological equations. A detailed modeling of pyrimidine biosynthesis in E. coli can be found elsewhere (15Rodriguez M. Good T.A. Wales M.E. Hua J.P. Wild J.R. J. Theor. Biol. 2005; 234: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The naturally modular organization of complex metabolic systems can be exploited to simplify their quantitative description (16Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2767) Google Scholar, 17Bruggeman F.J. Westerhoff H.V. Hoek J.B. Kholodenko B.N. J. Theor. Biol. 2002; 218: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the model presented here, a simplification was introduced by representing the system as three modules, connected through a tightly regulated branch point. Each module includes one key regulated step, the other steps within the module being considered as nonlimiting for arginine biosynthesis and noninvolved in other biological processes (Fig. 2). This simplified representation is supported by the results of a recent transcriptome analysis of the arginine regulon, which provided an integrated view of arginine regulation (18Caldara M.

Parameter values from the literature and/or values determined experimentally for wild-type E. coli grown in the absence or in the presence of arginine will be used to develop the model. The model will then be used to determine corresponding steady states in a set of perturbed conditions as follows: a genetically derepressed strain (an argR mutant lacking an active repressor), a strain desensitized for feedback inhibition by arginine of the first biosynthetic step (a feedback-resistant NAGSase mutant), and a strain where a low constitutive synthesis of CP was engineered. Values obtained for all three simulated steady states will be confronted with experimental measurements to validate the model. Finally, the model will be applied to gain further insight into the function of the system, for instance by investigating the synergy between the various regulatory loops. Chemicals—Chemicals are listed in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Strains and Plasmids—P4X (Hfr, metB) is the wild-type strain for this study. P4X, a derivative of E. coli K12 MG1655 through 58-161 and W6 (19Bachmann B.J. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Brooks K. Low B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. eds 2nd. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 1190-1224Google Scholar), is the strain in which previous studies on the arginine biosynthetic system were performed in the Laboratory of Microbiology and Genetics of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. P4XB2 (Hfr, metB, argR) is a genetically derepressed derivative of P4X. P4XJEF8 (Hfr, metB, thrA, ΔcarB-8) harbors a deletion of part of carB (CPSase), which results in a double arginine/pyrimidine auxotrophy (20Mergeay M. Gigot D. Beckmann J. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 133: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Primers used for construction of the following strains are listed in supplemental Table 1. P4XJEF8/pMAC2 (this study) contains plasmid pMAC2 carrying the carAB genes, complementing the ΔcarB-8 defect. To construct the pMAC2 plasmid, the carAB genes were amplified by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA as a BglII-HindIII fragment (primers MC1; MC2). The fragment was then inserted into the suitably restricted pBAD/HisC plasmid (Invitrogen), under the control of the pBAD promoter, to obtain pMAC2. pMAC2 was transformed into P4XJEF8, selecting for resistance to ampicillin. In the presence of glucose, carAB expression from pBAD is strongly repressed (catabolite repression). P4X/pKKcarAB (21Delannay S. Charlier D. Tricot C. Villeret V. Piérard A. Stalon V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) contains a plasmid derived from pKK223-3 (Amersham Biosciences) carrying wild-type carAB under the control of its own operator region. P4XA1 (Hfr, metB, argA-216) (this study) contains the argA-216 mutation conferring feedback resistance to NAGSase (22Rajagopal B.S. DePonte J. Tuchman III, M. Malamy M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain this strain, a pBluescript®II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) derivative pargA-Kan was first constructed, carrying the wild-type argA gene inserted as a BamHI-EcoRI PCR fragment (primers MC3; MC4) and a Kanr cassette inserted as an EcoRI-HindIII PCR fragment (primers MC5; MC6). The argA216 point mutation (22Rajagopal B.S. DePonte J. Tuchman III, M. Malamy M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was then introduced by PCR amplification of the whole pargA-Kan plasmid using a set of complementary primers carrying the mutation (primers MC7; MC8) to obtain the pargA216-Kan plasmid. The argA216 mutation was then introduced in the chromosome of the P4X strain using a recombination method (23Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). P4XA1-ΔR (this study) is a genetically derepressed derivative of P4XA1 in which argR was knocked out using a recombination method. A kanamycin resistance cassette was generated by PCR using primers with 50-nucleotide extensions homologous to sequences upstream and downstream of the argR coding sequence and then introduced in a P4XA1 strain expressing the λRed recombinase. Selecting for kanamycin resistance resulted in the recombinational replacement of the chromosomal argR region by the cassette. After selection, the resistance cassette was removed as described in Datsenko and Wanner (23Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). P4XEC-1 (Hfr, metB, ΔargEC-1) (24Elseviers D. Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 117: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and PA342 (F-, ppc, argH-2, thr, leu, his, thi, strr) (25Glansdorff N. Sand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 108: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were used in cross-feeding tests as indicators for the secretion of ornithine and arginine, respectively. Cross-feeding Experiments—Potential secretor and indicator strains were streaked side-by-side on minimal medium plates (26Glansdorff N. Genetics. 1965; 51: 167-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the appropriate supplement and incubated at 37 °C for the period of time required for cross-feeding in a positive control experiment. In the test for arginine secretion (indicator PA342), the supplement was as follows: glucose (0.5%, w/v), l-methionine (100 μg ml-1), l-threonine (100 μg ml-1), succinate (0.4%, w/v), l-leucine (100 μg ml-1), l-histidine (100 μg ml-1), and thiamine (1 μg ml-1). In the test for ornithine secretion (indicator P4XEC-1), the supplement was glucose (0.5%, w/v), l-methionine (100 μg ml-1), and l-threonine (100 μg ml-1). Growth Conditions—Cells were grown in flasks in a rotary shaker at 37 °C in minimal medium (26Glansdorff N. Genetics. 1965; 51: 167-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 0.67 mm l-methionine (100 μg ml-1). When needed, 0.84 mm l-threonine (100 μg ml-1) and 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin were added to minimal medium. Arginine-rich medium contained 0.47 mm l-arginine (100 μg ml-1). Cells were harvested at mid-log phase (A660 = 0.5). Determination of Enzyme-Specific Activities—Cellular extracts preparation and assays of NAGSase, OTCase, and CPSase activities were performed as described in Caldara et al. (18Caldara M. Charlier D. Cunin R. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3343-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ATCase activity was measured in the presence of 20 mm aspartate and 5 mm CP in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. The carbamyl aspartate formed was measured by the colorimetric method of Prescott and Jones (27Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that activities were measured on dialyzed extracts so that they are true reflections of the amount of each protein present. The enzymatic activity values integrate genetic regulation and whatever post-transcriptional regulation operating on gene expression. (see Ref. 28Sundararaj S. Guo A. Habibi-Nazhad B. Rouani M. Stothard P. Ellison M. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D293-D295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least five times for each condition of the system. Standard deviation was always lower than 20%. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Metabolite Extraction Procedure—Cells were sampled, extracted, and quenched following a protocol communicated by Dr. M. E. Wales (Dept of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University) with modifications. Cells in mid-log phase (A660 = 0.5) were rapidly filtered in a Millipore vacuum manifold through 0.45-μm pore size MF™ membrane filters (Millipore). The filter was placed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 μl of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was homogenized and placed on ice for 30 min. The metabolites were extracted adding an equal volume of freshly prepared 0.7 m tri-N-octylamine in 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane. After homogenization, the solution was incubated on ice for a further 30 min, after which the aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube. Determination of Intracellular Free Nucleotide Concentrations—The analysis was carried out with a Waters high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA). Samples were injected using a Whatman Partisil 10 SAX column (250 × 4.6; 10-μm particle size), previously equilibrated with 1 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.3 (buffer A). The nucleotides were eluted with a discontinuous gradient of buffer A and 750 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8 (buffer B), at a variable flow rate. Every run took 60 min to be completed. During the first 15 min the flow rate was 1.3 ml min-1, and only buffer A was present. In the next 25 min buffer B increased linearly to 100% at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. During the last 20 min, the column was brought back to the initial conditions (buffer A 100%, flow 1.3 ml min-1). The peaks, detected by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (UV detector, Waters), were identified with the help of appropriate external standards, and the concentrations were determined through integration with the Empower-Pro software (Waters). Determination of Intracellular Free Amino Acid Concentrations—For this analysis, the amino acids extracted were first derivatized using a 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccininimidyl carbamate (ACCQ) kit purchased from Waters, and 2-aminobutyric acid was added to each sample as an internal standard. Amino acid concentrations were determined using a 2695 HPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Quattro Micro™ mass spectrometer (Waters). The capillary column (symmetry C18, 3.9 × 150 mm; 5-μm particle size, Waters) was kept at 35 °C. The separation of the derivatized amino acids was carried out using a variable mobile phase with the solutions of 1% formic acid in ultra-pure water (A) and 1% formic acid in methanol (B). The gradient was as follows: 0 min, 90% eluent A, 10% eluent B, flow 0.15 ml min-1; 45 min, 50% eluent A, 50% eluent B, flow 0.15 ml min-1; 46 min, 20% eluent A, 80% eluent B, flow 0.15 ml min-1; 80 min, 20% eluent A, 80% eluent B, flow 0.25 ml min-1; 81 min, 90% eluent A, 10% eluent B, flow 0.25 ml min-1; 90 min, 90% eluent A, 10% eluent B, flow 0.15 ml min-1. The data were processed using the Masslynx 3.5 software (Waters). Calculation of Cellular Maximal Velocities—The model requires cellular maximal velocity (Vm) values for the different enzymatic activities considered as follows: the maximal number of moles of substrate(s) that can be transformed in product(s) per unit of cellular volume and per unit of time. These are different from the Vmax values for the enzymes, which are invariant, and they are calculated from the measured enzyme specific activities in each analyzed condition. The calculation method is described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Cellular maximal velocities will be represented as VMX in the equations, where X is the initial of the enzyme considered. Model Development—The system was represented as three modules connected by a tightly regulated branch point (Fig. 2). The first module is the synthesis of ornithine from glutamate with NAGSase as key enzymatic activity; the second module is the synthesis of arginine from ornithine and CP with OTCase as key enzyme; the third module is the utilization of CP for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis to produce ultimately UTP and CTP, with ATCase as key enzyme. The rigid branch point consists of CP synthesis from glutamine, bicarbonate, and ATP by CPSase, with the complex network of genetic and metabolic regulations controlling CP distribution between the arginine and the pyrimidine biosyntheses. Evolution Equations—The system represented in Fig. 2 is described mathematically by a set of five ordinary differential equations. The first equation describes the evolution of ornithine concentration, represented by β. Knowing that the four steps between N-acetylglutamate, the product of the NAGSase reaction, and ornithine (β) are enzymatically nonregulated and assuming that they are fast, one can write Equation 1, dβdt=VNAGS-VOTC-VMFβKF+β(Eq. 1) where VNAGS and VOTC indicate the rates of the NAGSase and OTCase reactions, representing the production and utilization of ornithine, respectively. The last term represents phenomenologically the consumption of ornithine for polyamine biosynthesis and ornithine secretion. OTCase utilizes both ornithine (β) and CP (α) as substrates. CP, shared with the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis, is produced by CPSase. Thus, its evolution in time is given by Equation 2, dαdt=VCPS-VOTC-VATC(Eq. 2) where VATC stands for the rate of the ATCase reaction, the first committed step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The product of the OTCase reaction is citrulline. This intermediate is not explicitly considered in the model, as it is rapidly transformed into arginine (θ). The arginine evolution is described by Equation 3, dθdt=VOTC+Paθext-VMUθKU+θ-kSθ(Eq. 3) where Paθext stands for the rate of arginine uptake through the plasma membrane. This term has to be considered when the cells are grown in an arginine-rich medium. Arginine is used by E. coli for protein and polyamine synthesis, a process represented phenomenologically by a Michaelis-Menten term. Finally, in some conditions described later, arginine is secreted in the external medium; in such cases, the parameter kS takes a value different from zero. The ATCase reaction produces carbamylaspartate that is transformed to UMP (γ) in four subsequent enzymatic steps that are considered as nonlimiting. UMP is in turn transformed in a few steps into CTP and UTP (δ). Pyrimidine biosynthesis is in itself a complex metabolic pathway (see Ref. 15Rodriguez M. Good T.A. Wales M.E. Hua J.P. Wild J.R. J. Theor. Biol. 2005; 234: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar for a detailed modeling study of pyrimidine biosynthesis in E. coli). Here, we describe the evolution of UMP, UTP, and CTP in a phenomenological, simplified manner that simply allows us to reproduce the appropriate steady states for the pyrimidine concentrations. Those concentrations will thus provide the adequate feedback on arginine biosynthesis, which is the object of this study. The time evolution of UMP concentration (γ) is thus given by Equation 4, dγdt=VATC-k2γ+J0γKpyr+γ(Eq. 4) Parameter k2 is the kinetic constant characterizing the transformation of UMP into CTP and UTP. The last term represents a complex set of pyrimidine nucleotide recycling and interconversion reactions, known as the salvage and interconversion pathways, respectively (31Neuhard J. Kelln R.A. Böck A. Curtiss R. Kaper J.B. Neidhardt F.C. Nyström T. Rudd K.E. Squires C.L. 2nd (eds). Biosynthesis of Arginine and Polyamines. module 3.6.1.10, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar). J0 stands for the maximal rate of UMP production by these pathways. This recycling process can function only if some UMP is provided by de novo synthesis, hence the second factor in this term, with Kpyr the concentration of UMP leading to a half-maximal effect. As CTP and UTP could not always be measured separately, and as they act together on ATCase, they are combined as one variable (δ) in the model. The evolution of this variable is simply represented by the input from UMP and a linear rate of use by the cell (k3) as given in Equation 5, dδdt=k2γ-k3δ(Eq. 5) Enzymic Rate Equations—The next step was to give an appropriate expression for the rates of the four key enzymes (NAGSase, CPSase, ATCase, and OTCase). NAGSase uses glutamate (S1) and acetyl-CoA (S2) as substrates, and is feedback-inhibited by arginine (θ). To adequately model the experimental results of our study of NAGSase inhibition by arginine (32Caldara M. A Systems Biology Approach for the Study of Arginine Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, Transcriptome Analysis, Experimental Perturbation, and Mathematical Modeling. Ph.D. thesis, Vrije Universiteit Brussel2007Google Scholar), the following kinetic expression is used as shown in Equation 6, VNAGS=VMN11+θρ(Kiθ+θ)S1K1+S1S2K2+S2(Eq. 6) where VMN is the cellular maximal velocity of NAGSase, and K1 and K2 indicate the half-saturation constants of this enzyme by glutamate and acetyl-CoA, respectively. Kiθ is the constant of inhibition by arginine, and ρ is an adimensional factor that scales the effect of this inhibition. Rate expression (Equation 6) describes a partial, noncompetitive inhibition of an enzyme (33Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). CPSase has three substrates as follows: bicarbonate (S3), ATP (S4), and glutamine (S5). Ornithine (β) acts as a nonessential activator and UMP (γ) as a competitive inhibitor. Both effectors affect ATP binding. The rate expression for an enzyme regulated in this manner is given by Ref. 33Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar, and is shown in Equation 7, VCPS=VMCS3K3+S3S5K5+S5S4K4+S4γηK4Kiγ+S4βζK4KAβ1+S4K4+γKiγ+βKAβ+S4γηK4Kiγ+S4βζK4KAβ(Eq. 7) where K3, K4, and K5 are the half-saturation constants for bicarbonate, ATP, and glutamine binding, respectively. VMC indicates the cellular maximal velocity of CPSase. η scales the effect of UMP (γ) and ζ the effect of ornithine (β), whereas Kiγ and KAβ represent the concentrations of UMP and ornithine leading to half-maximal effects. ATCase is a well studied allosteric enzyme (for review see Ref. 34Hervé G. Hervé G. Allosteric Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 61-79Google Scholar). A proper modeling of such an enzyme using, for instance, the Monod, Wyman, Changeux formalism (35Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6108) Google Scholar) requires the knowledge of a very large set of parameter values. Here, a phenomenological expression that quantitatively reproduces experimental data was chosen (36Wales M.E. Wild J.R. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & So"
https://openalex.org/W2148760047,"Protein kinase C (PKC) has been widely implicated in positive and negative control of cell proliferation. We have recently shown that treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) during G1 phase inhibits the progression into S phase, an effect mediated by PKCδ-induced up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1. However, PMA treatment in asynchronously growing NSCLC cells leads to accumulation of cells in G2/M. Studies in post-G1 phases revealed that PMA induced an irreversible G2/M cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells and conferred morphological and biochemical features of senescence, including elevated SA-β-Gal activity and reduced telomerase activity. Remarkably, this effect was phase-specific, as it occurred only when PKC was activated in S, but not in G1, phase. Mechanistic analysis revealed a crucial role for the classical PKCα isozyme as mediator of the G2/M arrest and senescence, as well as for inducing p21Cip1 an obligatory event for conferring the senescence phenotype. In addition to the unappreciated role of PKC isozymes, and specifically PKCα, in senescence, our data introduce the paradigm that discrete PKCs trigger distinctive responses when activated in different phases of the cell cycle via a common mechanism that involves p21Cip1 up-regulation.

The diverse effects of phorbol esters both in normal and cancerous cells is due to the existence of numerous intracellular effectors, of which PKC isozymes have been the most widely characterized. The PKC family comprises 3 subfamilies that include 10 structurally related phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases (1Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Members of the classical cPKC (α, βI, βII, and γ) and the novel nPKC (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) subfamilies are activated by phorbol esters and their cellular analogue, the second messenger diacylglycerol, which leads to redistribution (translocation) of the enzymes from cytosol to intracellular membrane compartments, where they phosphorylate specific substrates. The marked heterogeneity in the signaling events and cell type-specific responses triggered by phorbol esters could be explained by the distinctive pattern of expression and intracellular localization of PKC isozymes and their substrates, which ultimately results in selective pathway activation. protein kinase C 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole non-small cell lung cancer phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hydroxyurea multiplicity of infection senescence-associated β-galactosidase. protein kinase C 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole non-small cell lung cancer phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hydroxyurea multiplicity of infection senescence-associated β-galactosidase. One of the paradigms that best exemplifies the functional versatility of PKC isozymes is the regulation of the cell cycle machinery. It became evident in the last years that PKCs can impact on the cell cycle both in positive and negative manners with a strict degree of cell type and isozyme specificity. PKC isozymes have been shown to regulate the progression of cells from G1 to S phase as well as with the transition from G2 to M phase (3Fishman D.D. Segal S. Livneh E. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar) via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. PKCs control the activity of cyclin-Cdk complexes in G1 by modulating the expression of cyclins and Cdk inhibitors (4Black J.D. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gavrielides M.V. Frijhoff A.F. Conti C.J. Kazanietz M.G. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, early studies in vascular endothelial cells showed dual growth stimulatory or inhibitory roles for PKCs depending on which phase in the cell cycle PKC becomes activated. In HUVEC cells phorbol esters potentiate growth factor mitogenic activity when added in early G1 phase, but they inhibit DNA synthesis when added in late G1 phase (6Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23041-23048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, PKCα and PKCϵ enhance cell cycle progression and proliferation by stimulating cyclin D1 transcription (7Soh J.W. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34709-34716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PKCη inhibits cdk2 activity in human keratinocytes, and overexpression of either PKCη or PKCδ, but not PKCα, leads to G1 arrest and differentiation (8Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kashiwagi M. Ohba M. Watanabe H. Ishino K. Kasahara K. Sanai Y. Taya Y. Kuroki T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In several cell types, the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) up-regulates Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and/or p27 (10Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Zeng Y.X. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar). These contrasting effects ultimately impact on the status of Rb phosphorylation, the expression of E2F-regulated genes, and the biological outcome. Several studies have also established key roles for PKC isozymes in G2. For example, PKCβII activation was required for entry into mitosis in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (12Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas PMA was shown to induce G2 arrest by suppression of cdc2 kinase activity in vascular endothelial cells (13Kosaka C. Sasaguri T. Ishida A. Ogata J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C170-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this complexity, it is not surprising that both PKC activators (such as bryostatins or phorbol esters) and PKC inhibitors (such as the PKCβ inhibitor enzastaurin) are in clinical trials for a number of neoplasias (14Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 15Strair R.K. Schaar D. Goodell L. Aisner J. Chin K.V. Eid J. Senzon R. Cui X.X. Han Z.T. Knox B.

Des. 2001; 7: 1725-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because of the contrasting effects of PKC isozymes on cell cycle regulation, a thorough understanding of these mechanisms is essential for the rational design of PKC modulators with anti-cancer activity. Lung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancers worldwide and the major cause of cancer-related mortality. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the most frequent type of lung cancer, is treated in early stages mainly with surgery and radiotherapy, whereas advanced stages receive combination chemotherapy or radiation therapy (18Schiller J.H. Oncology. 2001; 61: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the marked resistance to the various therapies accounts for the high lethality (19Fong K.M. Sekido Y. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Thorax. 2003; 58: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Studies in the last years have proposed PKC isozymes, such as PKCα, as targets for NSCLC therapy. However, a PKCα-specific antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS 3521/LY900003) showed slight or no benefit in NSCLC patients, either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (20Paz-Ares L. Douillard J.Y. Koralewski P. Manegold C. Smit E.F. Reyes J.M. Chang G.C. John W.J. Peterson P.M. Obasaju C.K. Lahn M. Gandara D.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006; 24: 1428-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This is not unexpected since PKCα, like other PKCs, has been shown to be either growth inhibitory or pro-apoptotic in various cancer cell models (21Wen-Sheng W. Cancer Lett. 2006; 239: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Russo M. Palumbo R. Mupo A. Tosto M. Iacomino G. Scognamiglio A. Tedesco I. Galano G. Russo G.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One may speculate that activators of growth inhibitory PKCs rather than PKC inhibitors could have therapeutic benefits for lung cancer, as demonstrated for other types of cancers. It is evident that a deeper knowledge of the roles of individual PKC isozymes in lung cancer would be needed to rationalize the use of PKC as a therapeutic target. Our recent studies have established that treatment of NSCLC cells with phorbol ester in early G1 impairs the progression through S phase, and we have identified PKCδ as the PKC responsible for this effect. PKCδ-induced G1 arrest is mediated through the transcriptional up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 (24Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, as shown in the present article, the paradox seems to be more complex, because in asynchronously growing NSCLC cells phorbol esters lead to the accumulation of cells in G2/M, thus suggesting multiple points of regulation in the cell cycle by PKCs. A more detailed analysis revealed that activation of PKC in late G1-early S leads to a delay in the progression through S phase and irreversible arrest of cells in G2/M, followed by the appearance of a senescence phenotype. Both G2/M arrest and senescence depend on the up-regulation of p21Cip1, but strikingly these effects are mediated by PKCα rather than PKCδ. Exploiting this irreversible induced growth arrest of lung cancer cells in response to PKCα activation may have significant therapeutic implications. Materials—Cell culture media was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PMA was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Gö6976 and rottlerin were purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Propidium iodide, DAPI, and hydroxyurea were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—H358 and H441 lung bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). H322 lung bronchoalveolar carcinoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Albelda (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For synchronization at the G1/S boundary, cells were cultured in normal medium for 24 h, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with 1 mm hydroxyurea (HU) in complete medium. For synchronization in G0, cells were serum-starved for 48 h, and released from G0 by the addition of serum. Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in triplicate and synchronized at the G1/S boundary with HU as described above. Upon release by extensive washing, cells were treated with PMA or vehicle for different times. After extensive washing to remove the PMA, complete growth medium was added. Cells were trypsinized at different intervals and counted with a hemocytometer. Proliferation was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Briefly, 24, 48, or 72 h after PMA treatment cells were pulse-labeled with 3 μCi/ml of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting. For determination of cell cycle profile, cells were stained with propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml) and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described (24Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D.

Adenoviral Infections—Cells were infected with replication-deficient adenoviruses (AdV) for either PKCα or LacZ as a control (23Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M.

After removal of the AdV by extensive washing, cells were incubated in complete medium for 20 h. Expression of PKCα was readily detected 24 h after infection and remained stable for several days (data not shown). Amplification of AdVs was carried out in HEK293 cells. Titers of viral stocks were normally higher than 1 × 109 pfu/cell. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Cell extracts (20 μg of protein/lane) were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MD). After blocking with 5% milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, membranes were incubated with the primary antibody. The following first antibodies were used: anti-PKCα and anti-cyclin D1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-cyclin A1, anti-cyclin B1, anti-cyclin E, anti-E2F-1, anti-p27, anti PKCϵ and anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-p21Cip1, anti-ATF-2 and anti-PKCδ (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-Rb (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-actin and anti-vinculin (Sigma). Either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence. RT-PCR—Cells were lysed with TRIzol, and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (5 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA (2 μl) was subject to 20 PCR amplification cycles using the following primers: p21Cip1 forward 5′-GCGATGGAACTTCGACTTTGT and p21Cip1 reverse 5′-GGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGAT; GADPH forward 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTT and GADPH reverse 5′-GATGGGATTTCCATTGATGACAAGC. RNA Interference (RNAi)—21-bp dsRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Dallas, TX) or Ambion (Austin, TX) and transfected into H358 cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The following targeting sequences were used: PKCα (1: AATCCTTGTCCAAGGAGGCTG; 2: GAACAACAAGGAATGACTT), p21Cip1 (1: AACATACTGGCCTGGACTGTT; 2: ATCGTCCAGCGACCTTCCT), and a control unrelated sequence (Silencer® negative control 7 siRNAi, Ambion). Plasmid Transfections and Promoter Analyses—H358 cells in 12-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of a p21Cip1 Firefly luciferase reporter vector (26Facchinetti M.M. De Siervi A. Toskos D. Senderowicz A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3629-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). A Renilla luciferase expression vector (50 ng, pRL-TK, Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. After transfection, cells were grown overnight in complete medium, synchronized at the G1/S boundary, and lysed. Cells extracts were subject to luciferase determination using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Results were expressed as the ratio between Firefly and Renilla luciferase. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on coverslides placed on 35-mm dishes. After synchronization, cells were stimulated with either PMA or vehicle, and at the indicated times washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min with methanol, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by a 10-min incubation in 100 mm glycine in PBS. After blocking for 30 min with 3% fetal bovine serum in PBS, a mouse anti-p21Cip1 monoclonal antibody (1:250) was added (1 h), followed by washing with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and incubation with a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) was added. After additional washings, DNA was stained using DAPI (0.1 μg/ml, 10 min). Coverslides were washed three times with PBS, mounted with Vectashield, and visualized with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope equipped with a q-imaging Exi digital cooled camera (1360 × 1036 pixels, Burnaby, Canada). Recordings were done using Northern Eclipse 6.0 software (Empix Imaging Inc., Cheektowaga, NY). A 40× planar objective (Nikon) was used for all recordings. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed, collected in ice-cold PBS, and then pelleted and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as described elsewhere (27Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Separation of cytosolic and particulate fractions was performed by ultracentrifugation, as described previously (28Caloca M.J. Fernandez N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M. Kazanietz M.G.

Determination of Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Activity—Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining was carried out as described by Dimri et al. (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5545) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates. After synchronization, cells were stimulated with either PMA or vehicle, and 3 days later fixed with 2% formamide/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS (10 min, room temperature) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with a solution containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 in 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. 24 h later the percentage of SA-β-Gal-positive (blue) cells in each sample was determined after scoring 300 cells using a bright-field microscope. Analysis of Telomerase Activity—Non-isotopic telomerase activity was determined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) using the TRAPEZE® telomerase detection kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and were analyzed using a Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. PMA Causes Irreversible G2/M Arrest in NSCLC Cells—PKC activation with phorbol esters causes a profound inhibition of cell proliferation in lung cancer cells, and our previous work has identified a PKCδ-dependent inhibitory mechanism that limits cell progression from G1 into S phase (24Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, when asynchronously growing H358 NSCLC cells were treated for 30 min with the PKC activator PMA (100 nm), a significant accumulation of cells in G2/M was observed, as determined by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1A, left panel). At 48 and 72 h the population of G2/M cells in response to PMA treatment doubled relative to vehicle-treated cells. A significant accumulation of cells in G2/M in response to PMA was also observed in H441 and H322 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). PKC activation by PMA induces apoptosis in several cellular models (1Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 5Gavrielides M.V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but no evidence of apoptosis in response to PMA was observed in H358, H441, or H322 cells either by flow cytometry (absence of a sub-G0/G1 cell population) or by microscopy (absence of fragmented nuclei after DAPI staining, data not shown). To begin dissecting the mechanisms that lead to the accumulation of H358 cells in G2/M, we decided to synchronize cells with hydroxyurea (HU) and analyze the effects of PMA on S → G2 progression. Approximately 70% of H358 cells were synchronized in late G1 after HU treatment. Upon removal of HU by extensive washing, cells began progressing into S phase at ∼2 h, and into G2 phase at ∼6 h. HU treatment did not seem to cause significant replicative stress, as judged by the ability of cells to complete the cell cycle (supplemental Fig. S1) and reach confluence, the absence of apoptosis, as well as the possibility of subculturing cells for several passages after HU treatment (data not shown). To analyze the effect of phorbol ester treatment on S → G2 progression, H358 cells were treated with PMA (100 nm, 30 min) or vehicle 2 h after HU release, and cell cycle distribution was determined at different times. Fig. 1B shows that PMA caused a significant delay in S → G2 transition. Indeed, while it takes 8 h to reach the maximum % of control cells in G2, this effect is achieved at 11 h in PMA-treated cells. The effect was dependent on the PMA concentration (Fig. 1C, upper panel), as well as the length of incubation, with maximum response at 30 min (Fig. 1C, center panel). The S → G2 delay was observed only when PMA was added in late G1-early S phase (t = 2-5 h) but not when the phorbol ester was added in late S phase (t = 6 h) (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Notably, despite the short duration of the incubation with PMA, the majority of the cells still remained in G2/M 72 h after treatment (Fig. 1B, right panel). Therefore, the delay in S → G2 transition was accompanied by an irreversible arrest that prevented cells to complete the cycle and progress into G1. Indeed, treatment of cells synchronized in the G1/S phase boundary (t = 2 h after HU release) with 100 nm PMA (30 min) abolished proliferation, as determined by cell counting (Fig. 1D, left panel). In agreement with this data, PMA treatment of HU-synchronized cells resulted in a marked inhibition of DNA synthesis, as judged by analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1D, right panel). Irreversible arrest by PMA was also observed in asynchronous cultures of H358 cells, as determined both by cell counting and [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1E). Thus, PMA treatment of H358 cells in S phase leads to irreversible accumulation of cells in G2, arguing for multiple points of regulation of the cell cycle by PKC activation. PMA Induces Senescence in H358 Cells in a Cell Cycle Phase-specific Manner—Morphological analysis of H358, H441, and H322 cells 72 h after PMA treatment, either in asynchronous or HU-synchronized cultures, showed that a significant number of cells became large and flat, and exhibited enlarged nuclei. These features, together with irreversible growth, are hallmarks of senescence (30Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Remarkably, cells remain attached for at least 10 days post-PMA treatment. At that time the phenotypic changes were more pronounced (Fig. 2A), with cells even larger, multinucleated, and with a characteristic vacuolization. We then determined the effect of PMA on telomerase activity, using a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). PMA treatment in S phase caused a significant reduction of telomerase activity in H358 cells (Fig. 2B). To further establish the presence of a senescence phenotype, we measured the expression of SA-β-Gal, a well-established marker of senescence (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5545) Google Scholar). Notably, >50% of H358 cells in asynchronous cultures became SA-β-Gal positive after PMA treatment, compared with <10% in response to vehicle. Similarly, a significant fraction of H441 and H322 become SA-β-Gal positive (Fig. 2C). The proportion of SA-β-Gal positive H358 cells was even higher (>75%) when PMA treatment was carried out in HU-synchronized cells. However, when PMA was added to H358 cells synchronized in early G1 phase, there was only a slight increase in the number of β-Gal positive cells. Therefore, the PMA effect is phase specific, as senescence does not occur when PKC activation was triggered in early G1. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the irreversible G2/M arrest induced by PMA during S phase leads to senescence. The senescence phenotype was also observed in H460 lung cancer cells, as well as in HT-29 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells. 5M. C. Caino, J. L. Oliva, and M. G. Kazanietz, data not shown. p21Cip1 Is Required for PMA-induced G2/M Arrest and Senescence Induction—Analysis of relevant cell cycle markers in NSCLC cells upon HU release revealed a marked elevation in the levels of the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1 in response to PMA, which was sustained even 72 h after treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). p21Cip1 up-regulation is a characteristic feature of senescent cells (31Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Additional studies in H358 cells revealed no significant changes in p27 levels. PMA treatment led to a marked reduction in Rb phosphorylation and in the levels of the transcription factor E2F-1. A sustained reduction in the levels of cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B, as well as induction of cyclin D1, were also observed (Fig. 3B). While the levels of p21Cip1 protein did not change significantly across S phase in H358 cells after HU release (Fig. 3C, upper panel, -PMA), a progressive p21Cip1 up-regulation was observed in response to PMA (Fig. 3C, upper panel, +PMA). Similar results were observed at the mRNA level, as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 3C, lower panel). In addition, PMA treatment of HU-synchronized cells promoted a significant activation of a p21Cip1 luciferase reporter (Fig. 3D). As newly synthesized p21Cip1 protein translocates to the nucleus to exert its inhibitory activity on cyclin-Cdk complexes (32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar), we carried out a subcellular fractionation analysis. ATF-2 and vinculin were used as controls for the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively. A marked elevation of nuclear p21Cip1 in response to PMA was observed (Fig. 3E). Elevated p21Cip1 levels were also detected in the cytosolic fraction, which probably reflects protein recently synthesized. Likewise, immunofluorescence staining"

The localization of hA3G is functionally significant for each of its known activities. hA3G has an intrinsic ability to bind to RNA, and its cytoplasmic localization enables it to bind HIV-1 and retroviral/retroelement RNA (42Chiu Y.L. Witkowska H.E. Hall S.C. Santiago M. Soros V.B. Esnault C. Heidmann T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15588-15593Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 43Kinomoto M.

Cytoplasmic localization also enables hA3G to block reverse transcription for both HIV-1 (49Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C.

Recently, hA3G has been shown to enhance the stability and translation of cellular mRNAs that would be otherwise targeted for degradation by micro RNA (miRNA) by excluding them from p-bodies and enhancing their association with polysomes (52Huang J. Liang Z. Yang B. Tian H. Ma J. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; Google Scholar). Finally, HIV-1 Vif inhibits hA3G activity by shuttling hA3G to proteasomal degradation (53Mariani R. Chen D.

The amino acid motif or cellular chaperone responsible for cytoplasmic retention has yet to be identified. In this report we describe the identification of a novel cytoplasmic retention signal (CRS). Although hA3G has no NLS, we show that the CRS can act dominantly over an NLS from the SV40 large T antigen (68Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). The crucial components of the CRS map to a 16-amino acid region adjacent to the first ZDD motif (amino acids 113–128) that overlaps with critical residues within the domain of hA3G involved in both HIV-1 Gag and Vif interactions (69Schrofelbauer B. Senger T. Manning G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5984-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 70Mangeat B. Turelli P. Liao S. Trono D. J. Biol.

We show that this region is both necessary and sufficient for cytoplasmic retention of reporter constructs that are otherwise nuclear. These findings explain why hA3G is restricted to the cytoplasm and are relevant in the rational design of novel HIV/AIDS therapeutics. Plasmid Construction—Full-length hA3G and deletion mutants (amino acids 1–208, 1–194, 1–156, 1–143, 1–128, 1–111, 1–60, 60–384, 113–384, 130–384, 144–384, 209–384, and 113–128) were PCR-amplified and cloned with restriction sites EcoRV and Not1 into the pIRES-P vector (73Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) with N-terminal reporter constructs of either EGFP-HA or NLS-EGFP-HA. Amino acids PKKKRKV (NLS from SV40 large T-antigen) (68Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) were added to the N terminus of EGFP to create NLS-EGFP. Transfections, Live Cell Imaging, and Western Blotting—293T cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were transfected using FuGENE® 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after 293T cells were transfected, 10 μm final concentration of Hoechst 33342 (Anaspec Inc., San Jose, CA) was added to the cell media, and cells were imaged by a QICIM-IR fast 12 bit monochrome camera viewed by Q capture software (Q-Imaging) through a ×40 Olympus objective with an Olympus IX 70 inverted fluorescence microscope and label-specific chrome filters. After imaging, cells were harvested in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were run on a 10.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose where proteins were detected by western blotting with antibodies: anti-HA (Covance) or anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) and a goat anti-mouse secondary (eBioscience). RNA UV Cross-linking—A 448-nt section of apolipoprotein B mRNA was in vitro transcribed with 32P-radiolabeled ATP and CTP (NEN) using T7 polymerase (Promega) as a probe for nonspecific RNA binding activity. The radiolabeled RNA was gel-isolated and added to cell extracts made from 293T cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-V5-tagged hA3G, N terminus (amino acids 1–208), and C terminus (amino acids 209–384) for 30 min at 4 °C. The RNA was UV-cross-linked to the proteins in the cell extract using short wave UV light in quartz cuvettes at 4 °C for 7 min as described previously (74Smith H.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immediately after UV cross-linking, cell extracts were treated with a mix of RNases T1 and A for 1 h at 37 °C followed by preclearing and immunoprecipitations. The nitrocellulose-transferred protein was exposed to Biomax XAR film (Kodak) for 48 h to identify radiolabeled bands from nucleotides covalently cross-linked to EGFP, EGFP-hA3G, or half domains. The nitrocellulose was subsequently western blotted for GFP (Roche Applied Science) or V5 (Invitrogen) to overlay with the radiolabeled band and to verify that the immunoprecipitation was successful. The CRS Is within the N-terminal Half of hA3G—Previously, we utilized indirect immunostaining of fixed HeLa cells to determine that hA3G was actively retained in the cytoplasm even when a strong NLS from SV40 was added onto the protein (48Bennett R.P. Diner E. Sowden M.P. Lees J.A. Wedekind J.E. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Focusing on the cis-acting sequence determinants for the cytoplasmic localization of hA3G, a live cell assay system was established using transfection of chimeric proteins containing EGFP or NLS-EGFP. This reporter system enabled visualization of the subcellular distribution of hA3G and parts thereof. EGFP was selected because it has no subcellular localization determinants (diffuses freely throughout the cell), does not form multimers, and it, along with its derivatives (i.e. YFP and CFP), has been shown not to affect hA3G functionality or localization when attached to the N terminus of hA3G reporter constructs (45Wichroski M.J.

As expected, EGFP alone was distributed homogenously throughout both the cytoplasm and nucleus of 293T cells (Fig. 1A). The addition of the SV40 NLS to EGFP (NLS-EGFP) resulted in near quantitative nuclear localization of the chimeric protein (Fig. 1B). However, when hA3G was attached to the C terminus of EGFP or NLS-EGFP the chimeric proteins demonstrated a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1, C and D). These data corroborated our earlier study using fixed cells (48Bennett R.P. Diner E. Sowden M.P. Lees J.A. Wedekind J.E. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To begin to determine the position of the CRS within hA3G the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–208) and C-terminal half (amino acids 209–384) of hA3G were attached to NLS-EGFP (NLS-EGFP-NT and NLS-EGFP-CT, respectively) and expressed in 293T cells. Whereas NLS-EGFP-NT was cytoplasmic (Fig. 1E), NLS-EGFP-CT had a predominant nuclear localization (Fig. 1F). This established the N-terminal portion of hA3G as the region containing the CRS.

Although many sirtuins catalyze a well characterized protein/histone deacetylation reaction, there are a number of reports that suggest protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Here we explored the mechanisms of ADP-ribosylation using the Trypanosoma brucei Sir2 homologue TbSIR2rp1 as a model for sirtuins that reportedly display both activities. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed a highly active histone deacetylase (kcat = 0.1 s–1, with Km values of 42 μm and for NAD+ and 65 μm for acetylated substrate). A series of biochemical assays revealed that TbSIR2rp1 ADP-ribosylation of protein/histone requires an acetylated substrate. The data are consistent with two distinct ADP-ribosylation pathways that involve an acetylated substrate, NAD+ and TbSIR2rp1 as follows: 1) a noncatalytic reaction between the deacetylation product O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (or its hydrolysis product ADP-ribose) and histones, and 2) a more efficient mechanism involving interception of an ADP-ribose-acetylpeptide-enzyme intermediate by a side-chain nucleophile from bound histone. However, the sum of both ADP-ribosylation reactions was ∼5 orders of magnitude slower than histone deacetylation under identical conditions.

Although there is general consensus that many sirtuins affect biological pathways by catalyzing the NAD+-dependent deacetylation of target proteins, a number of reports have suggested that some sirtuins catalyze protein ADP-ribosylation, either exclusively or in conjunction with their inherent deacetylase activity. The initial idea that sirtuins are indeed enzymes and could mediate phosphoribosyl transfer came from work on Salmonella typhimurium CobB, a Sir2 homologue that could compensate for the loss of CobT, a phosphoribosyltransferase involved in cobalamin biosynthesis (27Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31788-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Other studies report that sirtuins, including ySir2, Hst2, and Sir2 orthologues from the parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum, possess both protein deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (28Imai S.

T. brucei Sir2 orthologue TbSIR2rp1 localizes to the nucleus and plays a role in DNA repair and silencing in the insect and blood-stream stages of the parasite (38Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P.

Microbiol. 2007; 63: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic relationship between protein deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation has not been elucidated. Here we perform biochemical and kinetic studies to probe the mechanisms of ADP-ribosylation using sirtuin T. brucei TbSIR2rp1 as a model for sirtuins that display both deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed a highly active histone deacetylase, but protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was ∼5 orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, protein/histone ADP-ribosylation by TbSIR2rp1 required an acetylated substrate. We propose that the dependence on acetylated substrate occurs through two distinct pathways. The first pathway involves a direct, noncatalytic reaction between the unique deacetylation product OAADPr (or its hydrolysis product ADPr) and histones. The second pathway is responsible for the majority of TbSIR2rp1-dependent ADPr transfer and involves a mechanism in which a side-chain nucleophile from bound histone attacks an intermediate from the catalytic pathway that normally leads to deacetylated protein and OAADPr. Plasmid Construction—T. brucei genomic DNA was generously provided by Dr. J. Bangs from University of Wisconsin, Madison, and used as a template for the subsequent PCR. TbSir2rp1 was amplified using primers 5′-GGGATCCATGACAGAACCGAAGTTAGCAACC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGACCCTCAACGACTTTTTC-3′ that introduced BamHI and XhoI, upstream and downstream recognition sites, respectively. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and XhoI, and cloned into pGEX-KG (40Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) upstream and inframe of a sequence encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Using BamHI and HindIII, the TbSir2rp1 fragment was released and subcloned into pQE80 (Qiagen) downstream and in-frame of a sequence encoding an His6 tag. Eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 SirT1 was kindly provided by Dr. Eric Verdin from University of California, San Francisco, and used as a template for the following PCR. SirT1 was amplified using primers 5′-GCTTGGGATCCATGGCGGACGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCGACATGATTTGTTTGATGGATAGTTCAT-3′ that introduced upstream BamHI and downstream SalI recognition sites. PCR fragments were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and SalI, and cloned into pQE80 (Qiagen) downstream and in-frame of a sequence encoding a His6 tag. All plasmids were sequence-verified. The SirT1 template contained a deletion of amino acid residues 6–84 resulting in a truncated form of bacterially expressed SIRT1. Protein Expression—Plasmids encoding TbSIR2rp1 and SIRT1 were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE3 and grown in 2× YT media containing 100 mg/liter of ampicillin at 37 °C until an A600 ∼ 0.7 was reached. Cultures were induced with 0.1 g/liter isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–6 h at room temperature. Harvested cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Histidine-tagged proteins were purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), as described by the manufacturer, and eluted with a 0–250 mm imidazole gradient. TbSIR2rp1-GST cells were induced as described above, processed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and purified using glutathione-agarose resin (GE Healthcare) as described by the manufacturer. Purified proteins were dialyzed in the following storage buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0 mm d l-dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Histone Acetylation—Recombinant Xenopus laevis histones were expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (41Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar) and acetylated using the histone acetyltransferase complex, piccolo-NuA4 (picNuA4) (42Berndsen C.E. Albaugh B.N. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Reactions containing 0.2 μm picNuA4, 5 mm DTT, 75 μm acetyl-CoA, and 300 μg recombinant histones in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl were incubated at 24 °C for 1 h. Histone acetyltransferases were then heat-inactivated by boiling at 95 °C for 20 min. picNuA4-acetylated histones (i.e. AcH2A) were used for all the experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Histones H2A and H4 were also chemically acetylated using acetic anhydride in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) using 100× molar excess anhydride. Enzymatic and chemical acetylation were confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Histone concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard or by molar extinction coefficients (ϵ276 nm, H2A = 4050m–1 cm–1, ϵ276 nm, H4 = 5400m–1 cm–1). Peptide Synthesis—Acetylated histone H3 11mer peptide corresponding to the residues around lysine 14 (AcH3, KSTGGK(ac)APRKQ) was synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Peptide Synthesis Facility. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed at the University of Wisconsin Madison Biotechnology Center on an ABI 3200 Q-trap. Deacetylation Assays—Charcoal-binding deacetylase assay was used as described previously (43Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to determine the activity of the TbSIR2rp1 recombinant proteins. Saturation kinetics were performed with 5–750 μm [NAD+] with a fixed concentration of [3H]AcH3 (700 μm). A second set of saturation kinetic curves was performed with a fixed concentration of NAD+ (1 mm), with varying concentrations of [3H]AcH3 peptide from 10 μm to 1 mm. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and contained 0.7 μm TbSIR2rp1 in 1 mm DTT and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Acetylated recombinant histone H2A (AcH2A) saturation curves were generated using a fixed concentration of NAD+ (500 μm) and varying concentrations of [3H]AcH2A (5–100 μm). All reactions were composed of 0.7 μm TbSIR2rp1, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 150 mm NaCl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and were performed under initial velocity conditions where product formed was linear with time. The deacetylation reaction was also monitored by an HPLC method, essentially as described (43Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these assays, time points from a deacetylase reaction were quenched at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 10 min before being analyzed by HPLC. The initial deacetylation rates were calculated by comparing the nicotinamide peak area from each time point to a nicotinamide standard curve. Rates were calculated over the linear portion of the reactions. ADP-ribosylation Assays—Reactions, unless otherwise indicated, contained 3 μm recombinant Sir2 homologues in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 25 μm unlabeled NAD+, and 1–10 μCi of [α-32P]NAD+ (1000 Ci mmol–1; GE Healthcare), for a total reaction volume of 100 μl. As specified, reactions contained 20 μg total (5 μg of each histone subunit) unacetylated or acetylated recombinant histones. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h or times indicated. Reactions that contained AcH3 peptide were incubated with TbSIR2rp1 at 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition of unacetylated recombinant histones. Unincorporated [32P]NAD+ was removed by trichloroacetic acid protein precipitation followed by three acetone washes. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 15 min, and resolved on an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to film or PhosphorImaging screen. Quantification was performed by densitometry using lane-specific background subtraction and a standard curve of [32P]NAD+ with the same specific activity. Reactions containing [32P]OAADPr or biotin-NAD+, used in place of [32P]NAD+, were the same as specified above. Biotin-NAD+, 6-bio-17-NAD+, was synthesized as described previously (44Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2228-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Synthesis of [32P]OAADPr—[32P]OAADPr was synthesized and purified as reported previously (45Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled product was derived from a stock of [α-32P]NAD+ with known concentration and specific activity to ensure identical specific activities among the reaction substrates. Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase Cleavage—The cleavage reaction was conducted as described (46Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). TbSIR2 Deacetylase Activity—T. brucei Sir2-related protein (TbSIR2rp1) was cloned from genomic DNA. Bacterial constructs expressing TbSIR2rp1 either as an His6 or a GST fusion protein were generated. A previous study of the T. brucei SIR2-related protein utilized a GST fusion protein (38Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity of TbSIR2rp1-GST had been observed previously (38Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a quantitative steady-state analysis has not been reported. To verify that both bacterial constructs generated enzymes with similar deacetylase activity, the steady-state kinetic parameters of both purified proteins, termed TbSIR2-His (predicted molecular mass of 38.5 kDa) and TbSIR2-GST (predicted molecular mass of 64.5 kDa), were determined (see Fig. 1, A and B). In these reactions, 0.7 μm enzyme was reacted with 700 μm acetylated histone H3 peptide (KSTGGK(ac)APRKQ) and varied [NAD+] (Fig. 1A) or 1 mm [NAD+] and varied [AcH3] (Fig. 1B). TbSIR2-His and TbSIR2-GST displayed almost indistinguishable deacetylase activity under varied [NAD+], with Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values of 42 ± 3.2 μm, 0.075 ± 0.001 s–1, and 1800 ± 139 m–1 s–1, and 45 ± 3.5 μm, 0.090 ± 0.002 s–1, and 2000 ± 200 m–1 s–1, respectively (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the steady-state kinetic parameters with varied [AcH3], yielded Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values of 82 ± 5.9 μm, 0.060 ± 0.001 s–1, and 730 ± 54 m–1 s–1 for TbSIR2-His and 46 ± 5.8 μm, 0.050 ± 0.001 s–1, and 1100 ± 141 m–1 s–1 for TbSIR2-GST (Fig. 1B). Most importantly, the kinetic values are comparable with those reported for other highly active sirtuin deacetylases (34North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 47Borra M.T. Langer M.R. Slama J.T. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9877-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), establishing TbSIR2rp1 as a bona fide protein deacetylase. Because no significant differences in activity were observed between the two constructs, subsequent experiments were performed with TbSIR2rp1-His, abbreviated TbSIR2, unless otherwise indicated. TbSIR2 Displays ADP-ribosyltransferase Activity—After characterizing TbSIR2 NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity, we explored the ability of the enzyme to catalyze protein ADP-ribosylation. In several reports, sirtuins incubated with [α-32P]NAD+ resulted in 32P-labeling of proteins (histones, bovine serum albumin, and GDH) or of sirtuins themselves (1Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting that these sirtuins possess ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. To begin examining the requirements and mechanism(s) of ADP-ribosylation, we performed initial TbSIR2 assays under conditions similar to those that previously yielded 32P-labeling of histones (38Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with published work (38Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), TbSIR2 was capable of transferring the radiolabel from [α-32P]NAD+ to calf thymus histones (see supplemental Fig. S1A, lane 4). However, because commercially available calf thymus histones are relatively heterogeneous preparations, we repeated the above experiment with purified, recombinant X. laevis histones (H3, H2A, H2B, and H4), which lack detectable post-translational modifications. In dramatic contrast, TbSIR2 had a much lower capacity to transfer the label from [32P]NAD+ to recombinant purified histones (see Fig. S1A, lane 5). Note that both preparations of histones showed a low level of nonspecific, background labeling with the [32P]NAD+ (Fig. S1A, lanes 1 and 2), also previously observed by Liszt et al. (37Liszt G. Ford E. Kurtev M. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21313-21320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Native histone preparations, such as commercially available calf thymus histones, include various amounts of post-translational modifications, including acetylation. We hypothesized that the observed increase in 32P labeling (putative ADP-ribosylation) upon incubation with calf thymus histones versus purified recombinant histones may be due to endogenous acetylation of calf thymus preparations, creating a possible link between the NAD+-dependent deacetylation activity of sirtuins and the putative ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Acetylated Substrate Required for TbSIR2 ADP-ribosylation—To test this hypothesis, we acetylated pure recombinant X. laevis histones with the acetyltransferase complex picNuA4 (42Berndsen C.E. Albaugh B.N. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and we incubated these acetylated histones with TbSIR2 and [32P]NAD+ as described above (Fig. 2A). Both picNuA4-acetylated and unmodified recombinant histones were incubated with [32P]NAD+ in the absence (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4, respectively) or presence of TbSIR2 enzyme (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). Acetylation of the recombinant histones greatly increased the TbSIR2-mediated ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 2A, lane 6) over controls without TbSIR2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Unmodified recombinant histones showed no TbSIR2-dependent increase in labeling compared with control reactions without TbSIR2 (Fig. 2A, lane 7 versus lanes 3 and 4)"

We have identified, using cDNA microarray technology, that IL-18 expression is increased in UMR 106-01 rat osteoblastic cells in response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment. Confirmation of these data using real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed that steady-state levels of IL-18 mRNA increased by 2 h (3-fold), peaked by 4 h (10-fold), and had diminished after 12 h (4.4-fold) and that this regulation was via the protein kinase A signaling pathway and did not involve activation of the PKC signal cascade. PTH regulation of IL-18 was confirmed at the protein level, and analysis of differentiating primary rat calvarial osteoblasts verified that both IL-18 mRNA and protein are regulated by PTH in primary rat osteoblasts. Promoter reporter assays revealed that PTH regulated the upstream IL-18 promoter and induced the exon 1 containing 1.1-kb IL-18 mRNA transcript in primary osteoblast cells. The in vivo physiological role of IL-18 in the anabolic actions of PTH on bone was then assessed using IL-18 knock-out mice. Female IL-18 null mice and wild-type littermate controls were injected with vehicle or 8 μg/100 g of human 1–38 PTH for 4 weeks. In IL-18 knock-out animals the anabolic effect of PTH (determined by bone mineral density changes in the proximal tibia) was abolished in trabecular bone but not in the cortical component. These data characterize the PTH regulation of IL-18 expression in osteoblastic cells and suggest that this cytokine is involved in the anabolic actions of PTH.

Interaction of the PTH ligand with its receptor activates several intracellular signaling pathways within osteoblast cells, including PKA, calcium, PKC, and ERK (5Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Activation of these signaling cascades results in changes in gene expression that ultimately determine the biological response of the cells. However, the specific switch in signaling and or gene expression that directs either a catabolic or anabolic response to PTH is currently unknown. To date several molecules and mechanisms have been identified as being important in the anabolic actions of PTH on bone: they include insulin-like growth factor-I (6Miyakoshi N. Kasukawa Y.

However, a full understanding of the mechanisms driving the anabolic actions of PTH remains to be elucidated so that more effective treatments can be developed to treat skeletal disease where bone replacement is a clinical necessity. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), originally known as interferon-γ-inducing factor, is best know for its role in the immune system where it has pro-inflammatory actions and acts together with IL-12 to promote interferon-γ release from T cells and a subsequent Th1 immune response (13Tsutsui H. Yoshimoto T. Hayashi N. Mizutani H. Nakanishi K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IL-18 can also induce Th2 immune responses in a number of disease states (13Tsutsui H. Yoshimoto T. Hayashi N. Mizutani H. Nakanishi K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most recently IL-18 has been reported to regulate the homeostasis of energy intake and insulin sensitivity (14Netea M.G. Joosten L.A. Lewis E. Jensen D.R. Voshol P.J. Kullberg B.J. Tack C.J. Krieken van H. Kim S.H. Stalenhoef A.F. de Loo van F.A. Verschueren I. Pulawa L. Akira S. Eckel R.H. Dinarello C.A. den Berg van W. der Meer van J.W. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). IL-18 is a secreted protein that acts in a paracrine or autocrine mechanism on a multisubunit cell surface receptor. The IL-18 receptor, like the IL-1 receptor, is a heterodimeric receptor containing two subunits, α and β. Interleukin-18 receptor α, previously known as IL-1R-related protein, binds IL-18 at relatively low concentrations, whereas the IL-18Rβ chain does not bind IL-18 but rather binds to the IL-18·IL-18Rα complex generating what is believed to be a high affinity complex (15Sims J.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition to being expressed in hemopoietically derived cells of the immune system, including Kupffer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells, IL-18 is broadly expressed by mesenchymal cells, including intestinal epithelial cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts (16Udagawa N. Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Mackay A. Owens J. Okamura H. Kurimoto M. Chambers T.J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Following the identification of IL-18 production by osteoblasts it was shown that IL-18 could inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption indirectly in vitro by inducing T-cell production of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (16Udagawa N. Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Mackay A. Owens J. Okamura H. Kurimoto M. Chambers T.J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Horwood N.J.

Subsequently, both subunits of the IL-18 receptors have been identified on both osteoblastic (18Makiishi-Shimobayashi C. Tsujimura T. Iwasaki T. Yamada N. Sugihara A. Okamura H. Hayashi S. Terada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and osteoclastic cells (19Yamada N. Niwa S. Tsujimura T. Iwasaki T. Sugihara A. Futani H. Hayashi S. Okamura H. Akedo H. Terada N. Bone. 2002; 30: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and a direct effect of IL-18 on both these cell types has been demonstrated. Specifically, IL-18 can increase osteoprotegerin expression in osteoblast cells without altering receptor activator of NF-κB ligand production (18Makiishi-Shimobayashi C. Tsujimura T. Iwasaki T. Yamada N. Sugihara A. Okamura H. Hayashi S. Terada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which suggests that a direct mechanism for inhibiting osteoclast production independent of T cells also exists. In addition to inhibiting bone resorption, IL-18 has an anabolic effect on osteoblastic cells (20Cornish J. Gillespie M.T. Callon K.E. Horwood N.J. Moseley J.M. Reid I.R. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These functional data have been restricted to in vitro assays, and the specific in vivo actions of IL-18 are still unknown, however, the generation of an IL-18 transgenic mouse, which overexpresses IL-18 in the bone marrow cavity, showed anatomical and functional changes in the bone microenvironment, including decreased trabecular bone turnover and altered cortical structure (21Kawase Y. Hoshino T. Yokota K. Kuzuhara A. Nakamura M. Maeda Y. Nishiwaki E. Zenmyo M. Hiraoka K. Aizawa H. Yoshino K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that IL-18 can regulate bone metabolism in vivo. We performed microarray analysis on rat osteosarcoma (UMR 106-01) cells, which had been treated with 10–8 m PTH-(1–34) and identified a number of genes that were previously unknown to be regulated by PTH (22Qin L.

Included in the list of novel PTH-regulated genes we identified was IL-18. In the present investigations we have characterized the expression profile of IL-18 in osteoblast cells following PTH treatment and identified that this is a primary response acting through the PKA signal transduction pathway. In addition we have used IL-18 knock-out mice to explore the physiological importance of IL-18 in the anabolic actions of PTH. Chemicals—Synthetic human PTH amino acids 1–38 (hPTH-(1–38)) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). The inhibitors H-89 and GF109203 and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rat PTH amino acids 1–34 (rPTH-(1–34)), PGE2, 8-Br-cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. The anti-rat affinity-purified IL-18 antibody was purchased from R & D Systems. Cell Culture—UMR 106-01 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For the indicated experiments the cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes in the same medium and then changed to serum-free medium the following day for 24 h prior to the addition of the indicated reagents. Primary rat osteoblastic cells were obtained from neonatal rat calvariae by sequential digestion with collagenase and trypsin as previously described (23Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum from day 0 to 6 when they reach confluence. At day 7 the medium was changed to BGJb medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml), β-glycerolphosphate (10 mm). 24 h prior to the indicated time points the cells were serum-starved then treated with 10–8 m PTH for the indicated times. Analysis of mRNA Abundance by Real-time RT-PCR—Cells and tissues were harvested at the indicated time points after hormone treatment. Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma) followed by an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). TaqMan® Reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosciences) was used to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA. PCR was then performed on an Opticon real-time RT-PCR machine (MJ Research) using SYBR® Green PCR Core kit (Applied Biosciences). Analysis of each sample was performed twice for each experiment, and the data in the figures report average values of three experiments ± S.E. For the UMR 106-01 cells, rat β-actin was used as an internal control (F5′-TCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTG- and R5′-CGGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTT-). For the femoral samples and primary osteoblastic cells, rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (F5′-AACCCATCCCATCTTCCAGG- and R5′-CGGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTT-) was used as the internal control. Specific primer sequences for rat IL-18 and interleukin converting enzyme were designed using Primer 3: interleukin converting enzyme (F5′-CGAGACCTGTGCGATCATGT- and R5′-TGAAGCTCCAGAATTTCTGCC-) and IL-18 (F5′-ACAACCGCAGTAATACGGAGCA- and R5′-CGTTGGCTGTTCGGTCGATAT-). Western Blot Analysis—At the indicated time points, cells were lysed in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 20 min, and microcentrifuged for 10 min to remove cell debris prior to freezing. 40 μg of total cell lysate was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions at 150 V for 1 h. The protein was then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 0.2 μg/ml anti-rat IL-18 antibody in 5% milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently the filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma), and the signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from primary rat calvarial osteoblastic cells that had remained untreated or were treated for 4 h with rPTH-(1–34) at the indicated days of in vitro culture. Total RNA was also collected from the adrenal gland, spleen, and pancreas of a 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat. RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA running buffer. The gel was then blotted overnight to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) and UV cross-linked. The filters were incubated for 1 h at 65 °C in prehybridization solution (0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS). Fresh prehybridization solution was then added along with 106 cpm/ml of random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled IL-18 cDNA probe and incubated overnight at 65 °C. The following day, the filters were washed twice for 30–60 min each time with 40 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 5% SDS at 65 °C, and twice with 40 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30–60 min each time. Bound radiolabeled probe was then imaged using a PhosphorImager. Transient Transfections and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Activity Analysis of IL-18 Promoter—The IL-18 1–3 and 1–4 promoter constructs were cloned into pSV0-CAT vector after PCR amplification from the original P1D1 construct (generously supplied by Dr. M. Tone) (24Tone M. Thompson S.A. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6156-6163PubMed Google Scholar). Following PCR amplification the constructs were cloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using TA cloning. The primers and locations are as follows: construct 1–3... –1587 from the start site, forward primer = cataatgaaatgcaatgatacttagca; construct 1–4... –1137 from the start site, forward primer = tggtacctcaacttctccttcct; the reverse primer = cctctttgtgtgatgcaggc. The constructs were then cut from the TOPO vector using HindIII digestion and ligated into pSVO-CAT reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The IL-18 2–1 construct was released from the P1D8 construct (24Tone M. Thompson S.A. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6156-6163PubMed Google Scholar) with HindIII and ligated directly into the pSV0-CAT vector. The constructs were verified by sequencing at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School core DNA automatic sequencing facility. The plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well in 1 ml of serum-free MEM. After 16 h, 1 ml of MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. After 24 h, the cells were treated with either control or PTH-containing media for 6 h. CAT activity was measured by reacting 50 μl of cell lysate in duplicate in a 100-μl reaction volume consisting of final concentrations of 250 μm n-butyrylcoenzyme A and 23 mm [14C]chloramphenicol (0.125 μCi/assay). The values were normalized to protein as determined by the Bradford dye binding method (Bio-Rad). A standard curve using purified CAT was performed in every experiment to determine the linear range of the enzyme assay. ChIP Assays—ChIP analyses were performed using a modification of the Upstate Biotechnology procedure. Briefly, DNA and associated proteins were cross-linked by incubating cells in medium without fetal bovine serum containing 0.8% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1:25 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, scraped, sonicated to generate 400- to 1000-bp DNA fragments, and then diluted 10-fold. 2-ml aliquots were precleared at 4 °C for 1 h with 80 μl of a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% gel slurry and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight using the following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2027) or anti-Runx2 (sc-10758). Immune complexes were collected, washed sequentially in low salt, high salt, lithium chloride, and then followed by two washes in Tris/EDTA buffers. Protein·DNA complexes were eluted with ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3) and heated at 65 °C for 12 h to reverse cross-linking. Supernatant obtained from sonicated chromatin without antibody was used as the input control. Following treatment with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, the DNA was purified and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, and 4-μl aliquots (triplicate samples for each treatment group) were used for PCR. PCR primers used for analysis of the IL-18 promoter were the following: 5′-GCCATTTCTGGCAGTTCTATAAT-3′ (sense: –356 bases upstream from the transcription start site) and 5′-GCTTTGTATTCGGATGCAAATGTT-3′ (antisense: –226 bases upstream of the transcription start site) that flanked the RUNX2 site and produced an amplicon of 130 bp. The conditions for semi-quantitative PCR amplification were as follows: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s. The number of cycles used for a primer set was 31. Products were run on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. In Vivo Injections of PTH into Mice—IL-18 null mice on the DBA/1 background were constructed as previously described (25Wei X.Q. Leung B.P. Arthur H.M. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A breeding colony was established using heterozygous mice to obtain knock-out and wild-type littermate control animals. The femur and tibia of 31-day-old IL-18 null and wild-type littermate control mice were harvested and subjected to peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) analysis. In addition 7- to 8-week-old IL-18 knock-out and littermate control animals were injected subcutaneously 5 of 7 days for 4 weeks with either hPTH-(1–38) dissolved in saline (8 μg/100 g) or vehicle. The animals were euthanized with CO2, and the femur and tibia were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol for pQCT analysis. The animal protocol was approved by Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee. Ex Vivo pQCT for Mouse Tibia—The total, trabecular, and cortical/subcortical BMD of the proximal tibia were evaluated ex vivo using an XCT Research SA (Stratec Medizintechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). A two-dimensional scout scan of the tibia was run for a length of 10 mm. The pQCT scan was initiated 1.4 mm distal from the proximal epiphysis of the tibia in the area of the secondary spongiosa. The scan was 1-mm thick with a voxel size of 90 μm. Using an iterative algorithm, soft tissue (density below 223 mg/cm3) was automatically removed. The density of the remaining tissue was reported as total bone density (milligrams/cm3). The outer 55% of the bone (cortical/subcortical bone density) was peeled away in a concentric fashion to determine trabecular bone density (milligrams/cm3). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Where indicated, data were analyzed by one-tailed unpaired t test using Prizm4 GraphPad software. PTH Stimulates Production of IL-18 mRNA and Protein in Osteoblast-like Cells—We have previously performed a microarray screen of PTH-treated UMR 106-01 cells to identify novel genes regulated by PTH (22Qin L. Qiu P. Wang L. Li X. Swarthout J.T. Soteropoulos P. Tolias P. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19723-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). IL-18 was identified as a novel PTH-regulated gene, and this result has been confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of PTH-treated UMR 106-01 cells in the present study. The increase in steady-state levels of mRNA started 2 h post PTH treatment, peaked at 4 h, and returned to base-line 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1A). In addition, the steady-state levels of interleukin converting enzyme mRNA, the protease responsible for cleavage of pro-IL-18 into an active enzyme, had an increasing trend, which paralleled the changes seen in IL-18 mRNA (Fig. 1A). This change in steadystate levels of IL-18 mRNA produced in response to PTH treatment was translated into an increase in IL-18 protein (Fig. 1B). The increase in IL-18 protein was delayed compared with that seen in the mRNA occurring 8 h after PTH treatment and then remaining elevated for up to 48 h (Fig. 1B). In addition to the time-dependent effect of PTH on the IL-18 protein the effect of the hormone was also dose-dependent (Fig. 1C). PTH Induction of IL-18 Occurs in Primary Calvarial Osteoblasts—To more fully assess the physiological importance of the PTH induction of IL-18 we isolated primary osteoblasts from neonatal rat calvarial cells and assessed the ability of PTH to induce IL-18 as the cells differentiated. These cultures are routinely performed in the laboratory and follow a well characterized gene expression profile associated with primary rat osteoblast differentiation (26Selvamurugan N. Kwok S. Vasilov A. Jefcoat S.C. Partridge N.C. J. Orthop. Res. 2007; 25: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the basal expression of IL-18 in the osteoblast increased progressively as the cells entered differentiation and mineralization (Fig. 2A), a common characteristic of PTH-regulated genes. In addition, primary osteoblastic cells in all three phases of development, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization showed an increase in both steady-state mRNA (Fig. 2B) and protein (Fig. 2C) of IL-18 in response to PTH treatment. PTH Induction of IL-18 Is a PKA-dependent Primary Response—Binding of PTH to its seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled cell surface receptor results in activation of both the PKA and PKC intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, to investigate which of these pathways, PKA or PKC, is responsible for activation of the IL-18 gene, different chemical activators and inhibitors of these pathways were used. The cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP increased IL-18 mRNA to levels equivalent to that seen in cells treated with PTH alone. Similarly, pre-treatment of the osteoblast cells with the selective PKA inhibitor H-89 prevented the PTH induction of IL-18 mRNA (Fig. 3A). However, use of the PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, did not change IL-18 mRNA levels, and pretreatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF109203 did not alter the PTH induction of IL-18 mRNA (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that the PTH-induced activation of the IL-18 gene occurs via the PKA pathway and does not require signaling through PKC. To determine if the induction of IL-18 by PTH was a primary response or if it required de novo synthesis of an intermediate protein, the UMR 106-01 cells were treated with PTH in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Cycloheximide did not influence the PTH induction of IL-18 (Fig. 3B) indicating that de novo protein synthesis is not required in this process and that induction of IL-18 is a direct effect of PTH signaling to the IL-18 gene. IL-18 Is a Target Gene for PGE2—In addition to PTH, PGE2, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 are also involved in regulating bone metabolism via the osteoblast and to determine whether IL-18 may be a target gene of these agents, their ability to regulate IL-18 mRNA was assessed. Primary rat osteoblastic cells were serum-starved for 1 day, then treated with either 1α,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 or PGE2 for various time periods. RNA was harvested, and the IL-18 mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). PGE2 is a mediator of bone metabolism and regulates cell behavior via one of four membrane G-protein-coupled receptors. PGE2 activation of its receptors, PE2 and PE4, stimulates the PKA signal transduction pathway in osteoblast cells via coupling to Gs proteins and cAMP (27Li X. Pilbeam C.C. Pan L. Breyer R.M. Raisz L.G. Bone. 2002; 30: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was not surprising that PGE2 induced expression of IL-18 mRNA in a very similar profile to that seen with PTH (Fig. 4A). However 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, a lipid-soluble hormone that regulates gene transcription via the vitamin D nuclear hormone receptor, did not appear to regulate expression of IL-18 in these cells (Fig. 4B). PTH Transcriptional Regulation of the IL-18 Gene—The rodent IL-18 gene is regulated by two promoters (24Tone M. Thompson S.A. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6156-6163PubMed Google Scholar), which produce transcripts that contain indistinguishable protein coding regions and translate identical IL-18 peptides (Fig. 5A). The two IL-18 mRNA transcripts differ in the length of their 5′-untranslated regions due to transcription initiating from alternative promoters that generate transcripts of 1.1 and 0.9 kb"
https://openalex.org/W2006415662,"Heme carrier HasA has a unique type of histidine/tyrosine heme iron ligation in which the iron ion is in a thermally driven two spin states equilibrium. We recently suggested that the H-bonding between Tyr75 and the invariantly conserved residue His83 modulates the strength of the iron-Tyr75 bond. To unravel the role of His83, we characterize the iron ligation and the electronic properties of both wild type and H83A mutant by a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Although His83 in wild type modulates the strength of the Tyr-iron bond, its removal causes detachment of the tyrosine ligand, thus giving rise to a series of pH-dependent equilibria among species with different axial ligation. The five coordinated species detected at physiological pH may represent a possible intermediate of the heme transfer mechanism to the receptor.

The five coordinated species detected at physiological pH may represent a possible intermediate of the heme transfer mechanism to the receptor. The ability of bacteria to cause diseases depends on many parameters allowing the pathogen to invade the vertebrate host. One of them is its skill to scavenge the host iron ion. Indeed, iron is an essential metal for nearly all living organisms. However, its oxidized iron(III) form is hardly soluble, and its reduced iron(II) form is highly toxic. Therefore, in biological fluids, iron mostly exists as a complex with iron-binding proteins or in heme carrier proteins and is scarcely available. Hence, Gram-negative bacteria have developed multiple iron/heme acquisition systems to survive. Most of them rely on outer membrane receptors either specific for exogenous iron/heme sources present in the biotope or for molecules called siderophores or hemophores. These molecules are synthesized and released by bacteria into the extracellular medium (1Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Their function is to capture iron or heme from the host and to return it to the specific receptor. The first hemophore was discovered in Serratia marcescens (2Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

HasA (heme acquisition system) hemophores form an independent family of highly conserved hemecarrier proteins that are not homologous to any other known proteins. They bind free heme, or extract heme from proteins such as hemoglobin and hemopexin, and deliver it to hemophore-specific outer membrane receptors, termed HasR (1Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), which in turn release it into the bacteria (2Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. marcescens wild-type HasA (HasAWT) is a 19-kDa monomeric protein that binds b-heme with a very high affinity (Kd = 1.9 × 10-11 m) and a 1:1 stoichiometry (8Deniau C. Gilli R. Izadi-Pruneyre N.

Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7050-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the heme loaded hemophore holoHasAWT, the iron ion is in the oxidized form with the lowest redox potential (-550 mV) reported so far for heme-binding proteins (9Izadi N. Henry Y. Haladjian J. Goldberg M.E. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7050-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of holo-HasAWT shows an unprecedented heme-binding site (10Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Heme is held by two extended loops that connect the α and β faces of the protein and is rather exposed to solvent (186 Å2) (Fig. 1). The heme iron ion is bound by an unusual pair of ligands: a tyrosine (Tyr75) and a histidine (His32) (10Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This ligand pair has only been observed in a very few proteins, e.g. some hemoglobins from invertebrates (11Kraus D.W.

Kitagawa T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and mutated heme proteins also present this type of coordination (17Maurus R. Bogumil R. Luo Y. Tang H.L. Smith M. Mauk A.G. Brayer G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12606-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray and NMR data previously showed that, in holoHasAWT, the Tyr75 oxygen forms a tight hydrogen bond with the Nδ1 of a neighboring histidine, His83, that increases the nucleophilic character of Tyr75 and strengthens the Tyr75-iron coordination bond (18Wolff N. Deniau C. Letoffe S. Simenel C. Kumar V. Stojiljkovic I. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Caillet-Saguy C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Bertini I. Piccioli M. Turano P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The role of His83 in heme binding was highlighted by alanine mutagenesis of the two iron axial ligands and of His83, followed by the determination of the Kd for heme in the mutant proteins. Consistently, heme affinity in H83A is 265 times smaller (Kd = 5.0 × 10-9 m) than in HasAWT, whereas the mutation of the axial ligand induces a 400-fold loss of affinity for Y75A and only a 5-fold loss for H32A. Moreover, His83 has been proposed as an alternative iron ligand in the absence of Tyr75 or of both His32 and Tyr75 (20Letoffe S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, in contrast to His32, the Tyr75-His83 pair is conserved in all the hemophores, which suggests that the Tyr75-His83 hydrogen bond plays a central and recurrent role for the activity of these heme carrier proteins. To decipher the structural role of His83 in HasA, we characterized the electronic properties and the iron coordination of holoHasAWT and holoH83A in the oxidized form as a function of pH, using a panel of techniques such as NMR, EPR, x-ray crystallography, resonance Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopies. Although holoHasAWT possesses a unique coordination as a function of pH, substitution of His83 with an alanine residue gives rise to pH-dependent coordination forms with different axial ligation. The role of the Tyr75-His83 hydrogen bond for the stabilization of the Tyr75-iron axial coordination was unraveled. Disruption of this hydrogen bond at physiological pH results in a five-coordinate species that most probably represents an intermediate of the heme transfer mechanism to the receptor. Preparation of HasA Proteins—Wild-type hemophore HasAWT from S. marcescens, and mutant H83A were obtained and cloned as previously reported (2Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Letoffe S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol.

Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were produced at 303 K in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C-glycerol as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources and were purified as described previously (9Izadi N.

The protein concentrations were calculated using the previously determined ϵ277 nm values of 19500 m-1 cm-1 for HasAWT and 18500 m-1 for H83A mutant. Cleavage of the last nine residues (180-188) of HasA proteins was performed using the S. marcescens protease PrtSM to prevent sequential proteolysis of the C-terminal amino acids (22Izadi-Pruneyre N.

Unless otherwise specified, the samples were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer. Heme loading was performed as previously described (19Caillet-Saguy C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Bertini I.

The cyano-complexes were prepared by adding a 15-fold excess of KCN to the proteins (100 mm KCN stock solution in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7). Absorption Spectroscopy—The absorption measurements were achieved in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer at ambient temperature using 1- or 0.2-cm path length cells.

Raman scattering was excited using either 413.1-nm emission from a Kr+ laser (15-20 milliwatt) or 514.1 nm emission from an Ar laser (140 milliwatt). UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy was used to check sample integrity before and after the rR spectra were recorded. The spectra were recorded at ambient temperature as previously described (23Izadi-Pruneyre N. Huche F. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Lecroisey A. Gilli R. Rodgers K.R. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Biol.

The samples of HasA-H83A examined for isotopic sensitivity were prepared from a 0.3 mm stock protein solution. A 9-μl aliquot was diluted into 50 mm CAPS buffer at pH 10.0 prepared in D2O (99.9% 2H) or H218O (96% 18O).

NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on protein samples with concentration ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer adjusted at the requested pH. Onedimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired with 8192 data points either at 16.4 T with a spectral width of 240 ppm or at 11.7 T with a spectral width of 200 ppm. During the recycle delay of 150 or 30 ms, respectively, water suppression was achieved by presaturation. One-dimensional 15N NMR spectra were acquired at 9.4 T with a 30-μs 90° pulse, a spectral width of 450 ppm, 2048 data points, and a recycle delay of 10 ms. Onedimensional 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 16.4 T with a 12.4-μs 90° pulse, a spectral width of 500 ppm, and 4096 data points. Several experiments were performed with carriers at -200, 150, 567, and 850 ppm to identify signals over wide spectral regions. Recycle delays were 10 or 200 ms. 13C T1 values were measured via the inversion recovery sequence. Several series were performed using 10 and 100 ms as recycle delays with the 13C-carrier frequency at different positions to properly invert and excite all 13C resonances. Direct detected 13C-13C COSY experiments were acquired at 16.4 T with 2048 × 256 data points, 1024 scans, and a recycle delay of 300 ms for holo-HasAWT and 4096 × 512 data points, 512 scans, and a recycle delay of 250 ms for holoH83A. Spectral widths of 220 ppm in both dimensions with the carriers at 150 ppm for the indirect dimension and at 110 ppm for the direct dimension were used. Unless otherwise specified, NMR spectra were recorded at 303 K. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer fitted to an Oxford Instrument ESR900 helium flow cryostat. The experiments were carried out on protein samples with concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mm in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 50 mm Tricine, pH 9. Spin quantitations of the low and high spin heme signals were performed in nonsaturating conditions as previously described (23Izadi-Pruneyre N. Huche F. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Lecroisey A. Gilli R. Rodgers K.R. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25541-25550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). X-ray Crystallography—The crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution (4.0 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.02% NaN3) with 1 μl of the reservoir solution (100 mm sodium caco-dylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm Zn(OAc)2, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol). The brownish crystals grew to 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.08 mm3 over a period of 2 months at 20 °C. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) beamline ID14-EH1 using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector. The wavelength of the synchrotron x-rays was 0.933 Å. The crystal was rotated through 90° with a 1.0° oscillation range/frame. The raw data were processed and merged with MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 50-61Google Scholar) and SCALA (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar). The crystals of holoH83A (space group P3221) diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.6 Å. Molecular replacement with holoHasAWT (Protein Data Bank code 1B2V) as model gave a unique solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.72 and a R factor of 35.4%. Refinement was performed using REFMAC5, part of the CCP4 package. The electron density clearly indicated the presence of the heme group but was diffuse and featureless (Fig. 2). Therefore, the geometry of the heme group was tightly constrained to standard values and refined in the two heme orientations related by 180° rotation along the α-γ meso axis identified in holoHasAWT (19Caillet-Saguy C.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the absorbance spectra of holoHasAWT and holoH83A. The spectrum of holoHasAWT at pH 5.6 (Fig. 3A) shows maxima at 406 nm (Soret band), 494, 537, 568, and 618 nm that are consistent with a mixture of two species, one high spin (HS) and one low spin (LS). Indeed, whereas the charge transfer band at 618 nm is characteristic of a HS species, the presence of two Q-bands at 537 and 568 nm indicates the presence of a LS species. The absorbance spectrum did not change upon titration from pH 4.4 to 10.4, showing that the population of the two species is pH-insensitive. It is noteworthy that the addition of KCN to the protein at a 15-fold excess did not produce any spectroscopic changes, either at pH 7.3 or at pH 9.4 (data not shown). In contrast to holoHasAWT, the absorbance spectrum of holoH83A is sensitive to pH. At acidic and neutral pH, the spectra exhibit a Soret maximum at 404 nm, Q-bands at 502 nm and 536 nm, and a CT band at 630 nm (Fig. 3B). This pattern is consistent with the presence of a HS species. When pH increases, bands at 502, 536, and 630 nm decrease, whereas new bands emerge at 490, 543, and 610 nm. The disappearance of the charge transfer band at 630 nm at the advantage of the 610-nm band indicates that the HS species observed at acidic and neutral pH progressively disappears when pH increases for the benefit of a new HS species. Moreover, a LS species appears, as shown by a new band at 576 nm. Thus, at alkaline pH, holoH83A exists as a mixture of a HS and a LS species, the HS species being different from the one observed at acidic pH. Like holoHasAWT, no detectable change was observed after the addition of a 15-fold excess of a KCN solution neither at pH 7.3, where a HS species is dominant, nor at pH 9.4, where two HS species and one LS species are present. Consistent with previously reported NMR data, the rR spectra of holoHasAWT show a mixture of LS and HS species. The rR data further indicate that the HS component of holoHasAWT is a hexacoordinate species. The 1300-1700 cm-1 region of heme rR spectra comprises bands corresponding to porphyrin in-plane vibrational modes. They are diagnostic for oxidation state, coordination number, and spin state of the heme iron atom (44Qin J. La Mar G.N. Dou Y. Admiraal S.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1083-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bertini I. Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems. Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1986Google Scholar). The spectrum of holoHasAWT (Fig. 4A) is indicative of a ferric species with its characteristic ν4 band at 1372 cm-1. The spin state marker bands indicate an equilibrium mixture of six coordinate high spin (6c HS) (ν2, 1561 cm-1; ν3, 1476 cm-1; ν10, under the 1624 cm-1 band) and six coordinate low spin (6c LS) (ν2, 1580 cm-1; ν3, 1503 cm-1; ν10, 1633 cm-1) states. The ratio of the two ν3 and two ν10 band intensities does not change between pH 5.2 and 9.2, whereas the LS bands increase in intensity at the expense of their HS counterparts as the temperature is lowered (data not shown). These observations suggest that the mixture of 6c HS and 6c LS hemes arises from either two pH independent axial ligand sets or a single axial ligand set characterized by a pH-insensitive spin state equilibrium. For hemoproteins, excitation into the tyrosinate-Fe(III) CT band (near 500 nm) can provide resonance enhancement of Raman scattering by vibrations characteristic of bound phenolate. No bands attributable to bound tyrosine vibrations were identified in the 514.5-nm excited rR spectra of HasAWT. However, most rR bands assigned to Fe-Tyr- stretching modes have been observed in spectra of 5c HS hemes (14Uchida T. Stevens J.M. Daltrop O. Harvat E.M. Hong L. Ferguson S.J. Kitagawa T. J. Biol.

Because the heme in HasAWT is clearly six coordinate, Raman scattering by these ν(Fe-Tyr-) and coordinated tyrosinate modes may be poorly enhanced with green excitation. Spectra of holoH83A were recorded over the pH range of 5.2 to 10.0 with both B-band (Soret) and Q-band excitation at 413.1 (Fig. 4) and 514.5 nm (Fig. 5), respectively. Three pH-dependent forms, two HS and one LS, were detected, as suggested by the optical absorbance spectra and show their pH-dependent interconversion. High frequency spectra recorded at pH 5.2 or 7.2 contain ν2, ν3 (Fig. 4A), ν10, ν11, and ν19 (Fig. 5) bands that reveal the presence of 5c and 6c HS hemes. They fall within frequency ranges characteristics of coordination number and spin state, as indicated in the figures. The ν3 band observed at 1477 cm-1 is consistent with a 6c HS heme. The second ν3 band at 1487 cm-1 falls at the low end of the frequency range expected for 5c HS proteins (29Jin Y. Nagai M. Nagai Y. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8517-8527Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The more intense ν2 band is consistent with the presence of a 6c LS species, although no ν3 band attributable to 6c LS heme can be observed in the Soret-excited spectra recorded at pH 5.2 and 7.2. The evidence of the 6c LS species is corroborated by pairs of ν10 and ν11 bands that arise from both HS and LS hemes in the Q-band excited spectra (Fig. 5). Both the 1477- and 1487-cm-1 ν3 bands corresponding to the 6c and 5c HS species persist at pH 9.0, whereas a new ν3 band grows at 1501 cm-1 characteristic of the 6c LS species. The 6c HS and 6c LS ν3 bands increase in intensity with increasing pH relative to the 1487 cm-1 band are consistent with a transition from 5c to 6c and with an equilibrium between 6c HS and 6c LS hemes at alkaline pH. The relative intensities of the HS and LS pairs of ν10 and ν11 bands with increasing pH corroborate the presence of this equilibrium (Fig. 5). Spin state equilibria of this nature have been reported for hydroxide complexes of various heme proteins (34Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. J. Biol. Inorganic Chem. 1998; 3: 274-281Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Song S.H. Boffi a. Chiancone E. Rousseau D.L.

Persistence of bands attributable to 5c HS heme at pH 9 and 10 clearly shows that complete conversion to the hydroxide complex is not achieved under the conditions of the rR experiment. The low frequency region rR spectra are useful in identifying metal-ligand vibrations and porphyrin deformations, many of which involve motion of peripheral substituents (37Indiani C. Feis A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10360-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HoloH83A (Fig. 4B) exhibits bands in the 480-570-cm-1 range, where ν(Fe-OH) bands of HS and LS heme hydroxides occur. However, because the frequencies of these bands are insensitive to both D2O and 18OH2, they are assigned to porphyrin modes (44Qin J. La Mar G.N. Dou Y. Admiraal S.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1083-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands between 380 and 425 cm-1 are due to propionate and vinyl bending modes and do not vary significantly as a function of pH (Fig. 4B). The HasAWT spectrum exhibits two vinyl bending bands, consistent with the two vinyl-protein interactions. The spectra of holoH83A exhibit a single vinyl bending band in acidic and neutral solution and a broadened band in alkaline solution, suggesting that the structure of the WT heme pocket has been modified. At low pH, a pronounced band is observed at 196 cm-1 (Fig. 4B). Although this is in a region often associated with modes having axial iron-His stretching character, the only such modes that have been identified in ferric hemes are in those having the bis-His axial ligand set. Because this set of ligands is inaccessible in holoH83A, the 196 cm-1 band is concluded to arise from a porphyrin mode. Based on its greater intensity at low pH, where HS pentacoordinate iron dominates the heme speciation, the 196 cm-1 band is attributed to a mode having porphyrin out-of-plane character. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—The analysis of 1H-15N hetero-nuclear single-quantum correlation spectra of holoHasAWT and holoH83A indicate that for both systems the secondary structure and protein folding are maintained over the investigated pH range (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 19Caillet-Saguy C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Bertini I. Piccioli M. Turano P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One-dimensional experiments over large spectral windows were used to monitor the heme coordination sphere. We previously showed that, in HasAWT, HS and a LS species were in fast exchange on the NMR time scale (19Caillet-Saguy C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Bertini I. Piccioli M. Turano P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the protein shows heme methyl resonances with chemical shift values intermediate between those expected for a purely HS S = 5/2 heme iron(III) and those for a purely LS S = 1/2 heme iron(III) (Fig. 6A). One major and one minor set of resonances are visible on the spectrum, corresponding to the two possible orientations of the heme along the α-γ meso axis (10Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A.

In hair follicles, the bulge region of the outer root sheath houses stem cells. We show that explants from the prominent bulge area, but not the bulb, in rodent vibrissa follicles can produce epidermis in a skin model of tissue engineering. Using morphological criteria and keratin expression, we typified epithelial stem cells of vibrissa bulge. Two types of slow-cycling cells (Bb, Bs1) featuring a high colony-forming capacity occur in the bulge. Bb cells are located in the outermost basal layer, express K5, K15, K17, and K19, and feature a loosely organized keratin network. Bs1 cells localize to the suprabasal layers proximal to Bb cells and express K5/K17, correlating with a network of densely bundled filaments. These prominent bundles are missing in K17-null mice, which lack vibrissa. Atypically, both the Bb and Bs1 keratinocytes lack K14 expression. These findings show heterogeneity within the hair follicle stem cell repository, establish that a subset of slow-cycling cells are suprabasal in location, and point to a special role for K5/K17 filaments in a newly defined subset of stem cells. Our results are discussed in the context of long-term survival of engineered tissues after grafting that requires the presence of stem cells."

Most APC gene mutations are detected within the central mutation cluster region (MCR) and are early events in the tumorigenic process. The mutations generate truncated APC peptides that lack a C terminus, causing loss of binding to several partners and to microtubules (4Senda T. Iizuka-Kogo A. Onouchi T. Shimomura A. Med. Mol.

Many APC mutations disrupt APC-dependent β-catenin turnover, causing oncogenic β-catenin to accumulate in the nucleus and activate transcription of genes that promote cell transformation, leading to tumor formation (1Polakis P.

While the mutational loss of APC C-terminal sequences is regarded as integral to the initiation of colon cancer through loss of APC tumor suppressing functions, there is also evidence that APC truncation mutants exert certain dominant functions that might contribute to the tumor cell phenotype.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and more recently were reported to dominantly inhibit cytokinesis (19Caldwell C.M. Green R.A. Kaplan K.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to full-length APC, which is pro-apoptotic when overexpressed in colon cancer cells (20Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), there is also evidence suggesting a pro-survival function of APC mutants in colon tumor cell lines (21Chen T. Yang I. Irby R.

Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we show for the first time a preferential targeting of truncated mutant APC to a unique subcellular location: the mitochondria. We employed a range of complementary methodologies including confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation to demonstrate that unlike wild-type APC, which displays a very poor mitochondrial residency, a sub-set of truncated APC isoforms (mainly those whose sequence terminates prior to amino acid 1555) strongly localize to mitochondria. In SW480 colon cancer cells which express only a truncated form of APC-(1-1338), the loss of mutant APC correlated with induction of apoptosis and also a loss of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 from mitochondria. We propose that the differential targeting of mutant APC to mitochondria promotes the localized accumulation of Bcl-2, and that this provides a novel and unexpected pathway contributing to tumor cell survival. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Treatment—Human SW480 (APC protein truncated at amino acid 1337, referred to as N1337), HT-29 (APC protein truncated at amino acids 853 and 1555, referred to as N853, N1555), HCT 116 (full-length APC) colon carcinoma cells, and U2OS osteosarcoma (full-length APC) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To carry out transient transfections, the cells were seeded at 75% confluence and transfected with 1 μg/ml of DNA in Optimal medium using FuGENE HD reagent as instructed by the supplier (Roche Applied Science.), then processed 48-h later. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide (Sigma) was used at 200 μm. Plasmids—The pCMV-APC plasmids used in this study were kindly supplied by Bert Vogelstein. The GFP-tagged forms of APC including APC-(1-302), APC-(334-900), APC-(1941-2226), and APC-(2650-2843) were previously described (9Sharma M. Leung L. Brocardo M. Henderson J. Flegg C. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17140-17149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGFP-APC-(1379-2080) was generously provided by Dr. Mariann Bienz (24Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). pGFP-Bcl-2 was kindly supplied by Dr. Richard Youle (25Wolter K.G. Hsu Y-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Stable Cell Lines—Stable inducible HEK293 cell lines were created as described previously (22Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6339-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cells were selected in 15 μg/ml blasticidin (Fluka) and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 2 ng/ml tetracycline (Sigma) 16 h. RNA Interference—Double-stranded 21-mer RNA oligonucleotides homologous to sequences in human APC were purchased as purified duplexes (Qiagen Inc) and previously described (17Brocardo M. Näthke I.S. Henderson B.R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The APC DNA target sequences used were as follows: APC-2 (5′-AACGAGCACAGCGAAGAATAG-3′ nucleotides 691-714); APC-d (5′-AGGGGCAGCAACTGATGAAAA-3′ nucleotides 5887-5896); APC-b (5′-ATGGGAAGTGCTGCAGCTTTA-3′ nucleotides 2196-2216); APC-a (5′-AGCCGGGAAGGATCTGTATCA-3′ nucleotides 330-350). The sequence used as control was: 5′-AACGAGCAGTCGCTTCAATAG-3′. SW480 cells at medium density were transfected with 6 μg of RNA duplex in 2 ml of Optimal medium using Lipofectamine ™2000 for 6 h, and harvested 72 h post-transfection for analysis. In those cases in which APC knock down was preceded by GFP-Bcl-2 transient transfection, first the plasmid was transfected using FuGENE reagent for 4 h and then the medium was removed and APC knock down was carried out using Lipofectamine. After 6 h, cells were rinsed, and fresh medium was applied for 48 h. Cells were treated with CMXRos (Molecular Probes) to detect mitochondria and fixed using formalin, and DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 (1:500). APC knock down was confirmed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence Microscopy, Confocal Microscopy, and Deconvolution Image Analysis—Cells were grown on coverslips at medium density and fixed in chilled 1:1 methanol/acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. Note that methanol/acetone is the optimal fixation for detection of CMX-Ros (Molecular Probes); we also used methanol and formalin fixation in other slides to detect APC at mitochondria (mitochondrial staining was in general less obvious with formalin). Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with antibodies directed against APC protein, or the Myc tag. Mitochondria were stained with antibodies against cytochrome c or with Mitotracker Red dye CMXRos (Molecular Probes). Dilutions used were: APC monoclonal antibody Ab7 (1:100, Oncogene Research), unpurified rabbit polyclonal anti-M-APC, corresponding to residues 1034-2130 (1:4000), (8Näthke I.S. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar); anti-Myc tag (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-cytochrome c (1:100, BD Pharmingen). The following secondary antibodies were: Alexa-488 or Alexa-594-conjugated donkey or goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular probes). In all cases, DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 (1:500). Coverslips were mounted with Vectorshield aqueous mountant (Vector Laboratories) and observed and photographed using an Olympus BL51 fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification. A SPOT32 camera was used for general image capture. Cell images for deconvolution were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m inverted microscope with the appropriate bandpass filters. The objectives used were a LD-Plan Neofluar ×40 or a Plan Apochromat Neofluar ×63. Z-stack images were collected at incremental steps of 1 μm. The images were collected for each cell and resolved using iterative deconvolution analysis (AxioVision Rel. 4.5 Software). The three-dimensional image analysis was performed after image capture with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope. The objective used was UPLSAPO 60XW, and z-stacks of 0.2 micron step-size were captured, then analyzed using ImageJ software. Subcellular Fractionation Analysis—Colon cancer cells and inducible cell lines were separated into mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions using the Q-proteome Mitochondria Isolation kit (Qiagen). After washing, cells were suspended in Lysis Buffer, which selectively disrupts the plasma membrane without solubilizing it, resulting in the isolation of cytosolic proteins. Plasma membranes and compartmentalized organelles, such as nuclei, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum, remained intact and were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Disruption Buffer, repeatedly passed through a narrow-gauge needle (26 or 21 gauge), and re-centrifuged to pellet nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant which contains mitochondria and the microsomal fraction was re-centrifuged to pellet mitochondria at 6000 × g for 10 min. After removal of the supernatant, mitochondria were dissolved using a lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). A protease inhibitor solution was added (Roche Diagnostics). The same buffer was used to obtain total cell extracts. For high purity preparations, the mitochondria pellet was resuspended in Mitochondria Purification Buffer and carefully pipetted on top of layers of Purification Buffer and Disruption Buffer (density cushion). The band formed in the interface of both buffers was removed and pelleted in Mitochondria storage buffer. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—The lysate was obtained by subcellular fractionation of lysate from total proteins centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of each supernatant was taken to determine the concentration of protein using Bradford solution. 1 mg of protein was incubated with 2 μg of APC antibody (Ab5, Oncogene Research) or normal mouse IgG (N103, Oncogene Research) overnight at 4 °C with continuous end-over-end mixing. Next, 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous end-over-end mixing. The Protein A Sepharose/immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000× for 1 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated and transferred as described in detail (17Brocardo M. Näthke I.S. Henderson B.R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for the detection: APC (Ab1, 1:100 dilution, Oncogene Research); Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology); survivin (clone 60.11, 1:1000, Novus Biologicals, Inc); purified recombinant protein A/G, peroxidase-conjugated (1:15000, Pierce-Biotechnology); α-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma), cytochrome c (1:100, BD Pharmingen), Prohibitin (1:100, Abcam). Detection of Apoptosis—(a) Flow cytometry. After treatment, attached and floating cells were harvested and fixed with 85% methanol for 2 h. Cells were pelleted and suspended in a hypotonic fluorescent solution including propidium iodide. The percentage of G1 (apoptotic) cells was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). (b) Hoechst staining for apoptotic cell nuclei. Cells were grown on slides and fixed with chilled methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at -20 °C and subsequently stained with (0.05 μg/ml) Hoechst 33258 in 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope, and abnormal nuclei displaying chromosome condensation and fragmentation, were scored as apoptotic. For each measurement, at least three independent experiments and a minimum of 200 cells were analyzed. (c) MitoTracker CMXRos staining. After the treatment with RNAi, the cells were incubated with a solution of MitoTracker CMXRos for 30 min at 37 °C and fixed using similar conditions as described in b. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (apoptotic cells) was detected as a decrease of the intensity of red CMX-positive mitochondrial staining. APC Cancer Mutants Display Enhanced Localization at Mitochondria—We previously detected truncated mutant APC in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear zone of SW480 colon tumor cells (17Brocardo M. Näthke I.S. Henderson B.R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with a staining pattern reminiscent of mitochondrial distribution. To test whether the anti-apoptotic activity of APC(N1337) (encoding the first 1337 amino acids of APC) correlates with mitochondrial localization, we stained SW480 cells with antibodies against APC and the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c. As seen in immunofluorescence microscopy images using antibody Ab7, APC did co-localize with the mitochondria (Fig. 1A). Similar co-staining was observed with the mitochondria-specific dye, Mitotracker (data not shown). Moreover, mitochondrial co-staining of endogenous mutant APC and cytochrome c was detected with anti-APC antibody M-APC, and the specificity of this staining pattern was verified by silencing of APC by RNAi, which caused a loss of staining at mitochondria (Fig. 1B). The mitochondrial staining pattern for APC was also evident in transverse cross-sections of SW480 cells imaged by deconvolution microscopy analysis (Fig. 1C). We noted that full-length APC displayed some co-staining with mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1), but in general was not as pronounced as mutant APC. APC Mutants Are Detectable in Mitochondrial Cell Fractions—APC was detected predominantly in the cytoplasmic fractions of SW480 cells by Western blotting using antibody Ab1 (Fig. 2A, left panel). To confirm the endogenous APC imaging data, mitochondrial extracts were enriched from fractionated cells and analyzed for endogenous APC staining patterns. As shown in Fig. 2A (right panel), the APC (N1337) mutant was clearly detectable in the mitochondrial fraction. In addition we detected a smaller ∼90-kDa cleavage product (26Webb S.J. Nicholson D. Bubb V.J. Wyllie A.H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which was exclusively observed in mitochondria (Fig. 2A). The fractionation approach was optimized to reduce contamination from the cytoplasm (using α-tubulin antibody as marker) and the nucleus (using PCNA antibody as marker), while the mitochondrial enrichment was verified using cytochrome c antibody (Fig. 2A). We then tested HT29 colon cancer cells, which express two different truncated APC mutants encoding the first 853 or 1555 amino acids. Intriguingly, only the shorter APC mutant (N853) was detectable in mitochondrial fractions; the APC(N1555) mutant localized poorly at mitochondria (Fig. 2B, center blot). To confirm this finding, APC was immunoprecipitated from HT29 cell fractions with an antibody recognizing the N terminus (Ab5) and then Western blots probed with a different antibody (Ab1); the IP experiment also showed differential targeting of the shorter APC mutant (Fig. 2C). These data revealed mitochondrial accumulation of specific truncated APC mutants smaller than 1555 amino acids. Cell lines expressing full-length APC were also examined for APC at mitochondria; however, in contrast to the shorter mutant peptides, wild-type APC was expressed poorly in mitochondrial fractions from HCT116 colon cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2B). Mitochondrial Targeting of Mutant APC Detected in APC-inducible Cell Lines—To further validate the above result, we induced stably transfected HEK293 cells to compare mitochondrial staining of inducible full-length APC and C-terminal deletions that correspond to known mutations (N1807, N1309, N750). Full-length Myc-tagged APC displayed a partial and weak co-localization with cytochrome c at mitochondria after 16 h of induction with tetracycline (Fig. 3A, bottom row). However, the mutant APC (N1309), very similar in size to APC (N1337) expressed in SW480 cells, showed a stronger and unmistakable recruitment to mitochondria (Fig. 3A). The N1309 mutation is by far the most frequently occurring APC gene mutation detected in human colon cancers (2Fodde R. Smits R. Clevers H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other APC mutants tested also displayed co-localization with mitochondria by deconvolution microscopy, and confirmed by confocal microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2). In the absence of induction, the anti-Myc antibody gave only a weak background staining, and no clear co-localization with cytochrome c (Fig. 3A). Next, we fractionated extracts from the APC-inducible cell lines and analyzed them by Western blot. The full-length form of APC was less well expressed after induction, and like the N1807 mutant, it displayed only weak mitochondrial detection (Fig. 4A). The N1309 and N750 mutants displayed stronger detection at mitochondria (Fig. 4A). The mitochondrial targeting of mutant APC was not dependent on β-catenin, in that the APC(N750) sequence does not bind to β-catenin. To confirm our results we used more refined mitochondrial preparations isolated by use of a density cushion (Fig. 4B), and observed APC in mitochondrial preparations free of α-tubulin and PCNA. We note that a closer examination of the blots for full-length Myc-tagged APC revealed some smaller degradation products; these constituted a minor pool of the total APC, but accumulated significantly in the mitochondria-enriched fractions (see Fig. 4C). A similar result was seen for Western blots of the ectopic N1807 mutant, possibly explaining its detection in mitochondria by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). We did not observe significant degradation of other proteins in the mitochondrial extracts, and there was not extensive degradation observed for endogenous APC (Fig. 2). This observation is relevant because it suggests that APC cleavage products detected with an antibody that recognizes N-terminal fragments, similar in size to the truncation mutants, accumulate at mitochondria. We conclude that APC locates at mitochondria and that this staining pattern is enhanced by truncating mutations of APC protein, in particular those smaller than 1400 amino acids in size. Mapping the APC Mitochondrial Targeting Region to the Arm Domain—A computer-assisted search of the APC sequence did not identify a classic mitochondrial targeting signal (27Chartrain I. Blot J. Lerivray H. Guyot N. Tassan J-P. Cell Biol. Int. 2007; 31: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore a series of GFP-tagged APC sequences that span the coding region of APC were transiently expressed in U2OS cells and the localization patterns then compared by microscopy and by fractionation/Western blot (Fig. 5). Consistent with the differential staining pattern observed for the N-terminal APC mutants, none of the C-terminal sequences (APC 1379-2080, 1941-2228, or 2650-2843) displayed significant mitochondrial localization by Western blotting, despite their strong cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 5A). Similar results were found by microscopic imaging (Fig. 5B and data not shown). This is an important finding, as it also eliminates involvement of several key binding partners (e.g. β-catenin, Axin, EB1, and DLG-1) in APC mitochondrial recruitment. In contrast, two different N-terminal sequences located to mitochondria. The APC-(1-302) sequence displayed a modest mitochondrial detection relative to the cytosol, whereas the Arm domain sequence (334-900) localized strongly at mitochondria (Fig. 5, A and B). The ratio of mitochondrial/cytosolic expression for APC-(334-900) was consistently similar to that observed for the shorter APC cancer mutants (Figs. 2 and 4), and implicates its involvement in targeting APC to mitochondria. The Arm domain is highly conserved and retained in most APC cancer mutants. APC Truncation Mutants Protect SW480 Cells against Apoptosis and Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The APC mutant (N1337) expressed in SW480 colon cancer cells was previously shown to be resistant to caspase-mediated cleavage and to help protect against apoptosis when overexpressed (28Qian J. Steigerwald K. Combs K.A. Barton M.C. Groden J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The novel mitochondrial localization of this APC mutant has implications for its potential anti-apoptotic role. To study the potential anti-apoptotic function of human APC we tested the influence of transient transfection of APC mutants on resistance to apoptosis. APC constructs (full-length and mutants N932 and N1309) were transfected into SW480 colon tumor cells and the cells then treated with the drug sulindac sulfide, a chemopreventive agent used in colon cancer treatment. As shown in Fig. 6A, sulindac treatment induced apoptosis in SW480 cells as previously described (29Sinicrope F.A. Penington R.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transient expression of full-length APC did not reduce sulindac-induced apoptosis, and APC was pro-apoptotic in the absence of sulindac (Fig. 6A), as previously reported (20Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 23Steigerwald K. Behbehani G.K. Combs K.A. Barton M.C. Groden J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1974487242,"CD147 is a transmembrane protein that plays crucial roles in the development and function of the reproductive, visual, and nervous systems. CD147 also exerts positive and negative actions in T-cells by still obscure mechanisms. In this study, we have analyzed the expression, localization, and function of CD147 during T-cell receptor signaling responses. We show here that CD147 is an integral component of the T-cell immune synapse and that its overexpression leads to the inhibition of NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) activity induced by Vav1, a Rac1 exchange factor. This inhibitory activity is mediated by the CD147 intracellular tail and is totally independent of its extracellular or transmembrane regions. The molecular dissection of the influence of CD147 on the Vav1 pathway indicates that its inhibitory action takes place downstream of Vav1 and Rac1 but upstream of the serine/threonine kinases JNK and Pak1. The interference of CD147 with these pathways is highly specific because the overexpression of CD147 does not affect the activity of other GDP/GTP exchange factors or the stimulation of the ERK cascade. Finally, we show that the CD147 knockdown in Jurkat cells promotes higher levels of NF-AT stimulation and Pak1 phosphorylation upon T-cell receptor cross-linking. Instead, the lack of CD147 does not affect other signaling cascades that participate in the same cellular response. Taken together, these results indicate that CD147, via the selective inhibition of specific downstream elements of the Vav1/Rac1 route, contributes to the negative regulation of T-cell responses.

The interaction of cells with the extracellular environment requires the use of surface molecules that sense nutritional, hormonal, mitogenic, cell-derived, and substrate-originated signals to induce appropriate cellular responses. Because of this, the elucidation of these human proteome components is crucial for understanding the signaling basis of cell responses and for elucidating and treating human pathologies. CD147, also frequently referred to as Basigin and Emmprin (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer), is one of the transmembrane proteins that has been subjected to intense scrutiny during recent times. CD147 is a glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the Ig superfamily. Its structure contains an extracellular domain with one or two Ig-like domains depending on the CD147 isoform, a transmembrane region, and a 39-amino acid-long cytoplasmic tail (1Muramatsu T.

Furthermore, based on its high expression levels, it has been proposed that its expression status can be used as a prognostic factor in different tumors (1Muramatsu T. Miyauchi T. Histol.

In Drosophila, CD147 has been shown to be important for proper synaptic formation in neuromuscular junctions and for neuron-glia interactions in the optic lamina (27Curtin K.D. Wyman R.J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Glia. 2007; 55: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Besse F. Mertel S. Kittel R.J. Wichmann C. Rasse T.M. Sigrist S.J. Ephrussi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that CD147 was discovered very early in rats as a T-cell-expressed surface marker (29Fossum S. Mallett S. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), there is still a paucity of data regarding the role of CD147 in T-lymphocytes. To date, the experimental data available indicate that this transmembrane protein exerts both positive and negative roles in T-cell biology. In the former case, it has been shown that CD147 favors cyclophilin-mediated chemotaxis and, as in the case of nonhematopoietic tumor cells, the induction of the expression of MMPs by stromal cells in contact with CD147-positive tumoral T-cells (7Gwinn W.M. Damsker J.M. Falahati R. Okwumabua I. Kelly-Welch A. Keegan A.D. Vanpouille C. Lee J.J. Dent L.A. Leitenberg D. Bukrinsky M.I. Constant S.L. J.

Iwasaki H. Kikuchi M. J. Pathol. 2004; 202: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), an observation that suggests a positive role in the progression and/or maintenance of the tumoral state by this transmembrane protein. By contrast, it has been reported that CD147 plays negative roles in the TCR-dependent proliferation of T-cells (31Staffler G. Szekeres A. Schutz G.J. Saemann M.D. Prager E. Zeyda M. Drbal K. Zlabinger G.J. Stulnig T.M. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Koch C. Staffler G. Huttinger R. Hilgert I. Prager E. Cerny J. Steinlein P. Majdic O. Horejsi V. Stockinger H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Studies carried out using CD147-/- cells have also shown that the absence of this protein leads to hyperproliferation of T-cells during mixed lymphocyte reactions (25Igakura T. Kadomatsu K. Taguchi O. Muramatsu H. Kaname T. Miyauchi T. Yamamura K. Arimura K. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that CD147 receptor cross-linking also contributes to diminished responses by T-cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (13Pistol G. Matache C. Calugaru A. Stavaru C. Tanaseanu S. Ionescu R. Dumitrache S. Stefanescu M. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2007; 11: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to a developmental block of thymocytes (33Renno T. Wilson A.

Another issue that still remains obscure is the signal transduction pathway by which CD147 induces its biological effects. CD147 has many extracellular and transmembrane ligands such as cyclophilins, integrins, Shrew1, CD98, and members of the monocarboxylate transporter family (5Jiang J.L. Tang J. Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2007; 59: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yurchenko V. Constant S. Bukrinsky M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Schreiner A. Ruonala M.

Functions for the soluble, MMP-cleaved extracellular region of CD147 have been also proposed (37Egawa N. Koshikawa N. Tomari T. Nabeshima K. Isobe T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37576-37585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At the intracellular level, it has been demonstrated that CD147 promotes, depending in the experimental context, the phosphorylation and/or enzyme activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (38Tang Y.

It also promotes the ERK-dependent down-modulation of the apoptotic Bim1 protein (42Yang J.M. O'Neill P. Jin W. Foty R. Medina D.J. Xu Z. Lomas M. Arndt G.M. Tang Y. Nakada M. Yan L. Hait W.N. J.

To this end, we focused on the possible effects of CD147 in the stimulation of NF-AT, a transcriptional factor that controls the expression of many cytokines and interleukins involved in T-cell proliferation and T-cell-dependent immune responses (43Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Macian F. Nat. Rev. 2005; 5: 472-484Google Scholar). The activation of this route is highly complex, requiring the stimulation of the TCR, the activation of downstream protein-tyrosine kinases, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1, a hematopoietic-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor that promotes the stimulation of the GTPase Rac1 (43Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Macian F. Nat.

Suen K.L. Carrasco D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 297-308PubMed Google Scholar). Vav1 promotes NF-AT stimulation by allowing the normal phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 which, in turn, favors the Ca2+-dependent activation of the calcineurin phosphatase and the diacylglycerol-dependent stimulation of RasGRP1, a Ras-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (47Zugaza J.L.

Calcineurin promotes the dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NF-AT molecules, a step that favors the translocation of the transcriptional factor to the nucleus (43Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Macian F. Nat.

RasGRP1, via stimulation of the Ras pathway, allows the activation of AP1 family factors that cooperate with NF-AT in the transcriptional activation of a subset of its target genes (43Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Macian F. Nat. Rev. 2005; 5: 472-484Google Scholar). Using this functional readout, we report here that CD147 contributes to the inhibition of the NF-AT activity triggered by Vav1 through signals emanating from the CD147 intracellular tail. Furthermore, we demonstrate using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches that CD147 interferes with the activation of a specific subset of Vav1 and Rac1 downstream elements. In contrast, CD147 does not have any effect in the upstream activation of the Vav1/Rac1 route or in other signaling cascades downstream of the TCR.

Together with hydroxylamine trapping experiments and kinetic as well as mutagenesis data, the structures of these formyl-CoA transferase complexes provide new information on the Class III CoA-transferase family and prompt redefinition of the catalytic steps and the modified reaction mechanism of formyl-CoA transferase proposed here. CoA-transferases catalyze reversible transfer reactions of coenzyme A carriers from CoA-thioesters to free acids. Most members of the enzyme class are grouped into the well characterized Class I and II CoA-transferases, but recently a third class of enzymes was identified, differing in sequence and three-dimensional structure from the other CoA-transferases (1Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Members of this third class are mostly from bacteria, but putative genes have been identified in Archaea and Eukarya as well. Class III enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of oxalate, carnitine, toluene, and bile acid and also Stickland fermentation. The first Class III CoA-transferase identified was formyl-CoA transferase from Oxalobacter formigenes (1Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Formyl-Coenzyme A transferase is the first of two enzymes involved in oxalate degradation in the gut-dwelling bacterium O. formigenes (3Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Formyl-CoA transferase catalyzes the transfer of a CoA moiety between formyl-CoA and oxalate and thereby activates oxalate in the form of oxalyl-CoA (4Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3537-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oxalyl-CoA is then decarboxylated by the second enzyme of the pathway, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, which regenerates formyl-CoA (6Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Berthold C.L. Moussatche P. Richards N.G. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41645-41654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oxalate catabolism has a central role in O. formigenes, where oxalate serves as vital source of energy as well as carbon (3Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Cornick N.A. Allison M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3011-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of formyl-CoA transferase revealed an interesting new fold composed of two subunits linked together in an interlocked dimer like two rings of a chain (2Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Later, this fold proved to be characteristic for the Class III family as the crystal structures of the formyl-CoA transferase ortholog in Escherichia coli coded by the yfdW gene (9Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Valencia C. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34582-34586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the close homolog γ-butyrobetaine-CoA:carnitine CoA transferase (10Stenmark P. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13996-14003Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Rangarajan E.S. Li Y. Iannuzzi P. Cygler M. Matte A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5728-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were determined. The Class I CoA-transferases, including mostly enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, have a well established mechanism described in Fig. 2 (top). The formation of covalent intermediates involving a glutamate residue of the enzyme results in a classical ping-pong mechanism with exchanging substrate/product glutamyl-acyl anhydrides and γ-glutamyl-CoA thioesters (12Solomon F. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1079-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Selmer T. Buckel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20772-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester was first identified in a Class I transferase in 1968 by electrophoresis and chromatography studies with labeled borohydride (12Solomon F. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1079-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently trapped in a crystallographic study, giving the first structural proof of its existence (14Rangarajan E.S. Li Y. Ajamian E. Iannuzzi P. Kernaghan S.D. Fraser M.E. Cygler M. Matte A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42919-42928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The smaller group of Class II CoA-transferases catalyzes a partial reaction in the citrate and citramalate lyase complexes. These reactions do not include covalent enzyme intermediates, and the transfer of a dephospho-CoA, which is covalently bound to an acyl carrier protein in the enzyme complex, is carried out through a ternary complex where a mixed anhydride is formed between the two acids during the transition state (Fig. 2, bottom) (15Dimroth P. Eggerer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Buckel W. Bobi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During initial studies of the Class III CoA-transferases, steady state kinetics showed that the reaction is not consistent with a ping-pong mechanism as in the Class I CoA-transferases. The mechanism was instead interpreted to proceed through a ternary complex, where both formyl-CoA and oxalate need to be bound to the enzyme before catalysis (17Dickert S. Pierik A.J. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3874-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Leutwein C. Heider J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of an aspartyl-oxalyl mixed anhydride led to the suggestion that the reaction was initiated in the ternary complex with both substrates by the formation of an aspartyl-formyl anhydride and CoA-S-. The CoA-S- was then kept bound in the active site as a spectator while oxalate replaced formate, before attacking the aspartyl-oxalyl anhydride yielding oxalyl-CoA (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We show here from a freeze-trapped crystal structure that the enzyme-β-aspartyl-CoA thioester intermediate is also formed during catalysis by formyl-CoA transferase, a finding leading to reassessment of the catalytic mechanism of Class III CoA-transferases. We also complement the mechanistic investigation with the crystal structure of a trapped aspartyl-formyl anhydride similar to the previously characterized aspartyl-oxalyl anhydride complex (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and two mutant protein structures, where one contains the complex with β-aspartyl-CoA and oxalate. Central to the catalyzed reaction is a glycine-rich loop that adopts two different conformations controlling the accessibility of the active site. Mutations in the loop seriously affect the activity, proving its importance during catalysis. A modified mechanism in concordance with all information obtained is proposed, where catalysis includes formation of both the aspartyl-formyl and -oxalyl anhydrides and the β-aspartyl-CoA thioester and where the carboxylate product remains bound to the enzyme until release of the acceptor thioester. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Production—The Q17A, G259A, and G260A mutant variants were prepared by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the formyl-CoA transferase gene (20Sidhu H. Allison M. Peck A.B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1997; 35: 350-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the pET-9a vector (Novagen) with the following primers: 5′-Q17A, 5′-GCT TGA CTT TAC CCA CGT CGC GGC AGG TCC TGC CTG TAC ACA GAT GAT GGG; 3′-Q17A, 3′-CCC ATC ATC TGT GTA CAG GCA GGA CCT GCC GCG ACG TGG GTA AAG TCA AGC; 5′-G259A, 5′-GGT GCG GGC GGC CAG CCA GGC TGG; 3′-G259A, 3′-GCC CGC ACC TGC GTT ACC ACC ACG TGG; 5′-G260A, 5′-GGC GCG GGC CAG CCA GGC TGG ATG CTG; 3′-G260A, 3′-GCC CGC GCC ACC TGC GTT ACC ACC ACG. PCR primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Core of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. Recombinant formyl-CoA transferase and mutant proteins were produced and purified following the procedure previously described (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In short, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the plasmids, and the genes were expressed. Purification was then carried out sequentially by four steps of chromatography: DEAE anion exchange, Blue-Sepharose fast flow affinity, Sephadex G-250 size exclusion, and QHP anion exchange. The final purified enzymes were stored at -80 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, with 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) with Pierce Coomassie Plus reagent based on a standard curve constructed with known amounts of bovine serum albumin. Enzyme Kinetic and Inhibition Studies—Formyl-CoA transferase activity was assayed by monitoring the formation of oxalyl-CoA by an HPLC 2The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidr.m.s.root mean square. point assay developed by Jonnson (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Formyl-CoA and oxalyl-CoA were prepared by previously described methods (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, ∼80 ng of enzyme, and appropriate amounts of formyl-CoA and oxalate were prepared in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of formyl-CoA and quenched by the addition of 30% acetic acid. The formation of oxalyl-CoA was measured by separating the CoA-derivatives by reverse-phase chromatography, monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm, and integrating the area under the oxalyl-CoA peak. The effects of contaminating CoA were controlled by first determining the inhibitory effect of CoA against varied concentrations of formyl-CoA. Kinetic constants Vmax, Ki(CoA), and Km(formyl-CoA) were then used to fit initial velocity plots of varied oxalate concentration at constant formyl-CoA concentrations to determine the apparent Km(oxalate) and the Ki(app) for formyl-CoA assuming a sequential kinetic mechanism. high pressure liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid root mean square. The inhibition of formyl-CoA transferase by chloride ions was determined at different oxalate concentrations at saturating concentration of formyl-CoA (21.4 μm) and 10 μm CoA and KCl concentrations of 5, 15, and 30 mm. Hydroxylamine and Sodium Borohydride Trapping Experiments—The experiments were carried out in a reaction volume of 500 μl, containing 6.2 μg of recombinant wild-type formyl-CoA transferase in 60 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, and 77 mm oxalate. The reaction was started by the addition of 173 μm formyl-CoA and was allowed to run for 10 s before treatment with 15 mm hydroxylamine at pH 7 for 30 s at 293 K. Small molecules were immediately removed from the reaction solution by size exclusion chromatography (5 ml of G-25), after which the residual specific activity of formyl-CoA transferase was assayed using the normal HPLC point assay. The trapping experiment was repeated in the absence of oxalate with protein incubated for 30 s at 303 K with varied concentrations of formyl-CoA (0.14-188 μm). As before, the reaction mixture was separated by gel filtration chromatography 30 s after the addition of hydroxylamine. Residual activities of the protein treated only with NH2OH or with oxalate and then NH2OH were also assayed. Borohydride trapping experiments were carried out as above with the exception that the reaction was trapped with the addition of NaBH4 (1 m NaBH4 in 1 m NaOH) to a final concentration of 33 mm, immediately followed by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m HCl. The reaction mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min prior to gel filtration. Crystallization and Freeze Trapping—Formyl-CoA transferase was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using conditions previously optimized for the wild type enzyme (2Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 2 μl of the protein solution containing 7.5 mg/ml formyl-CoA transferase in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2, and 10% glycerol was mixed with 2 μl of precipitant solution and set up to equilibrate against 1 ml of well solution at 293 K. A precipitant solution of 21-25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.2-7.5, and 0.5 m MgCl2 resulted in ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2-mm single crystals that grow to full size within 48 h. The freeze-trapping experiments were performed by transferring the crystals to a drop containing a modified well solution (30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.5 m MgCl2, 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.2) mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 20 mm formyl-CoA or oxalyl-CoA in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after the desired reaction times. The crystals, diffracting to 2.0 Å resolution, belong to space group I4 with an asymmetric unit containing two 47-kDa formyl-CoA transferase monomers, comprising the biological dimer. Crystals where the aspartyl-formyl anhydride complex was trapped were obtained by a new crystallization condition devoid of chloride ions. An optimized well solution of 1.35 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.2-7.5, was used when setting up the crystallization experiments using the same protein solution and mixing conditions as above. The crystals belong to the same space group and were isomorphous with the previous ones. In order to form the anhydride complex, 2-3 μl of a formyl-CoA solution was slowly added to the crystals in the drop, and crystals were then transferred to an ethylene glycol cryosolution (1 m sodium citrate, 75 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, and 25% ethylene glycol) after ∼10 min. The formyl-CoA solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of 20 mm formyl-CoA in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and well solution. Crystals of the G260A and Q17A mutant variants of formyl-CoA transferase were obtained using the same conditions as for the aspartyl-formyl anhydride complex. Crystals of the G260A mutant protein were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen after transfer through silicon oil, whereas crystals of Q17A were used for complex formation. For the oxalate complex, the drops containing the Q17A mutant protein crystals were supplemented with formyl-CoA as for the wild type aspartyl-formyl anhydride complex, followed by the addition of 1 μl of 40 mm potassium oxalate mixed into the well solution. For this complex, the ethylene glycol cryosolution was supplemented with 40 mm potassium oxalate. Crystals of the Q17A mutant protein belong to the space group I4 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 153.6 Å and c = 98.1 Å, whereas the G260A mutant protein crystallized in space group P43212 with cell dimensions of a = b = 97.3 Å and c = 193.4 Å. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Data were collected at beamlines ID14 eh1 and ID23 eh2 at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (Grenoble, France) and at beamline I911-2 at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. All images were integrated with MOSFLM (22Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsl.

Open table in a new tab Mass Spectrometric Analysis—A sample of formyl-CoA transferase incubated with formyl-CoA in the absence of oxalate was prepared according to an experiment by Lloyd and Shoolingin-Jordan (30Lloyd A.J. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2455-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A 125-μl reaction mixture containing 0.153 mm formyl-CoA transferase in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2, with 10% glycerol and 0.596 mm formyl-CoA was incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then immediately desalted at 277 K into 1 mm HCl using a pre-packed NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein elution of 1 ml was mixed with an equal volume of 98% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid. Data were immediately acquired in positive mode on a QTOF ULTIMA API instrument (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with the standard Z-spray source with a capillary voltage of 1.5 kV. The instrument was calibrated between 300 and 1400 m/z with myoglobin prior to the run. The sample was introduced with a metal-coated borosilicate glass capillary needle (Proxeon Biosystems A/S, Odense, Denmark). Data were collected over a mass range between 300 and 2500 m/z and with a scan time of 1 s for about 5 min. The spectra were combined and deconvoluted to zero charged ions with MaxEnt 1 in the Masslynx software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Wild-type Formyl-CoA Transferase Activity—By first determining the inhibitory effects of free CoA (Table 2), a ubiquitous contaminant resulting from the hydrolysis of formyl-CoA, we were able to improve the kinetic parameters for formyl-CoA transferase and mutant variants. The values obtained for formyl-CoA transferase by this method were similar to previously reported values (18Jonsson S. Ricagno S. Lindqvist Y. Richards N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36003-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and reflect the relatively high Ki(CoA) of 16.7 ± 0.7 mm.TABLE 2Summary of the CoA inhibition constants and patterns for wild-type formyl-CoA transferase and mutant variantsWild typeQ17AG259AG260ACoASHCompetitiveMixed typeMixed typeMixed typeKi(c) (μM)16.7 ± 0.716.0 ± 0.66.0 ± 1.055 ± 19Ki(u) (μM)100 ± 14460 ± 129290 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Enzyme-β-aspartyl-CoA Thioester Complexes—Crystallographic freeze-trapping experiments were performed in order to gain more information about the catalytic steps and the intermediates of CoA transfer in formyl-CoA transferase. Crystals, produced with a precipitant mixture of polyethylene glycol and magnesium chloride, were soaked with formyl-CoA for 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively, and with oxalyl-CoA for 2, 4, and 10 min, respectively. Inspection of the crystal structures from different soaking times revealed that all formyl-CoA-soaked crystals contained the same intermediate, and all oxalyl-CoA-soaked crystals contained the same intermediate, with no difference over time. The best data set of each, formyl-CoA-soaked for 2 min and oxalyl-CoA-soaked for 5 min, were used for further analysis. Close inspection of the freeze-trapped formyl-CoA and oxalyl-CoA intermediates shows that the formyl as well as the oxalyl moieties are cleaved off by the enzyme, and a covalent bond is formed between the carboxyl group of Asp-169 and the thiol group of the CoA carrier. The resulting intermediates from the formyl-CoA and oxalyl-CoA soaks are thus highly similar, and the dimeric structures superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.28 Å over 851 Cα atoms. An intriguing feature is that in both complexes, the two subunits of the dimer adopt different active site conformations with the pantetheine arm of the CoA molecule bound in different orientations (Fig. 3). Several residues show different conformations in the two subunits of the dimer. Tyr-139 is centrally positioned in the active site and moves with the side chain hydroxyl group shifted ∼3 Å, in order to give space for the two different orientations of the pantetheine moiety. Lys-137 is positioned on the same side of the CoA molecule and shows a shift of 4.5 Å at the side chain amino group. Residues Arg-38 and His-15 also adopt different side chain conformations in order to adapt to the two CoA conformations. Finally, Gln-17 takes on two different rotamer conformations, with a position behind Asp-169 in subunit A and above the thioester bond in subunit B. As was observed already for the apoenzyme (2Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the side chain conformation of Trp-48 is flipped 90° between the two monomers, and the glycine loop (258GGGGQ261) then assumes the open and closed conformations in subunits A and B, respectively (Fig. 3A). Neither formate nor oxalate was detected in the active site. However, strong remaining spherical electron densities were interpreted as bound chloride ions due to the high concentration of chloride present in the crystallization. Refinement of these ions resulted in B-factors that were similar to the surrounding region. Interestingly, subunit A contains one chloride ion, which is bound behind the active site residue Asp-169, at a position occupied by residue Gln-17 in the other subunit, and subunit B has two chloride ions bound, one on each side of the pantetheine arm of CoA, where one chloride ion is interacting with the closed glycine loop and the other with the main chain amides of Gln-17 and Ala-18 (Fig. 3). In both complexes, Val-16 is positioned in the disallowed or generously allowed part of the Ramachandran plot in both monomers, which was also observed in the complex of formyl-CoA transferase with bound CoA reported earlier (2Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inspection of the structures reveals that Val-16 adopts a strained conformation in order to fit the CoA moiety. In the β-aspartyl-CoA thioester complex, Glu-140 is in the disfavored part of the Ramachandran plot in subunit B, which can be explained by the structure adopted by the adjacent residue Tyr-139, enforced by the different conformation of the CoA moiety in that subunit. The B-factors show a clear difference in the region of the small domain comprising the two loops 230-247 and 282-347 between the two subunits (Fig. 1). In subunit B, this region is much more flexible, and in the β-aspartyl-CoA thioester complex obtained from formyl-CoA, residues 286-316 have no interpretable electron density and are modeled with zero occupancy. Inspection of the crystal packing reveals that the corresponding region of subunit A forms crystal contacts with the adjacent molecule, whereas this region in subunit B is freely exposed to solvent.

https://openalex.org/W2056431229,"Helicase B (RhlB) is one of the five DEAD box RNA-dependent ATPases found in Escherichia coli. Unique among these enzymes, RhlB requires an interaction with the partner protein RNase E for appreciable ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. To explore the basis for this activating effect, we have generated a di-cistronic vector that overexpresses a complex comprising RhlB and its recognition site within RNase E, corresponding to residues 696–762. Complex formation has been characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry, revealing an avid, enthalpy-favored interaction between the helicase and RNase E-(696–762) with an equilibrium binding constant (Ka) of at least 1 × 108 m-1. We studied ATPase activity of mutants with substitutions within the ATP binding pocket of RhlB and on the putative interaction surface that mediates recognition of RNase E. For comparisons, corresponding mutations were prepared in two other E. coli DEAD box ATPases, RhlE and SrmB. Strikingly, substitutions at a phenylalanine near the Q-motif found in DEAD box proteins boosts the ATPase activity of RhlB in the absence of RNA, but completely inhibits it in its presence. The data support the proposal that the protein-protein and RNA-binding surfaces both communicate allosterically with the ATPase catalytic center. We conjecture that this communication may govern the mechanical power and efficiency of the helicases, and is tuned in individual helicases in accordance with cellular function.

We conjecture that this communication may govern the mechanical power and efficiency of the helicases, and is tuned in individual helicases in accordance with cellular function. RNA helicases are a diverse set of proteins found in all three kingdoms of life that possess the ability to unwind short stretches of RNA duplexes in reactions that require the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (1Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). They are the largest group of enzymes in eukaryotic RNA metabolism and are involved in virtually all aspects of cellular RNA manipulation including transcription, splicing, RNA nuclear export, and ribosome biogenesis (2Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1427-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 3Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The DEAD box helicases are grouped in helicase superfamily 2, whose members contain nine conserved motifs, including the Walker B motif DEAD from which they take their common name (Fig. 1). Escherichia coli contains five genes encoding for DEAD box proteins; csdA (formerly called deaD), dbpA, rhlB, rhlE, and srmB (4Iost I. Dreyfus M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The gene products have a common core of 350–400 amino acids, consisting of two domains that have the same fold found in the DNA-recombination protein RecA. Flanking this two-domain core are variable regions that are thought to be responsible for the differing properties and functions of the five helicases (4Iost I. Dreyfus M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). DEAD box helicases can unwind short RNA duplexes that are no more than two helical turns in length (∼22 bp), and some helicases can displace avidly bound proteins from RNA (1Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 5Jankowsky E. Fairman M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A role of DEAD box RNA helicases as nonspecific RNA unfolding enzymes has been described (6Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Nature. 2007; 449: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yang and Jankowsky (7Yang Q. Jankowsky E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have elegantly shown that DEAD box helicases use a single strand RNA region to facilitate loading onto duplex RNA where only a few base pairs are disrupted in an ATP-dependent manner, leading to destabilization of the remainder of the duplex and its spontaneous disassembly. Duplex unwinding by the RNA helicases differs from that of DNA or viral helicases, which in contrast act as highly processive translocases that may peel off many hundreds of complementary RNA and DNA strands in their paths (5Jankowsky E. Fairman M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Drosophila DEAD box helicase Vasa in complex with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue and single-stranded RNA lends support to the proposed mechanism of duplex unwinding by the DEAD box family (8Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This complex structure shows that ATP binding promotes relative movement of the two RecA-like domains to induce a closed form of the helicase. The adoption of the closed conformation organizes the catalytic site and so enables hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate group of the ATP. The marked bending of the single-stranded RNA is suggestive of a mechanism that could physically disrupt a few RNA basepairs in a duplex (5Jankowsky E. Fairman M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). RNA helicases are often part of large macromolecular assemblies, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that their ATPase and/or RNA helicase activities can be modulated by the interactions that are formed within these complexes (3Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Alcazar-Roman A.R. Tran E.J. Guo S. Wente S.R. Nat.

Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). One such example is the exon-junction complex, in which the ATPase activity of the DEAD box helicase component (eIF4AIII) is impeded by interaction with RNA and partner regulatory proteins (13Andersen C.B. Ballut L. Johansen J.S. Chamieh H. Nielsen K.H. Oliveira C.L. Pedersen J.S. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. Andersen G.R. Science. 2006; 313: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Bono F.

Turning to examples of bacterial helicase complexes, the E. coli DEAD box ATPase RhlB forms part of the multiprotein assembly known as the RNA degradosome. This large complex also comprises the endoribonuclease, RNase E, the exoribonuclease, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and the glycolytic enzyme, enolase. The co-localization of these enzymes in the degradosome allows cooperation of their activities (15Braun F. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The presence of RhlB in the degradosome has been shown to facilitate RNA degradation by RNase E (17Khemici V. Poljak L. Toesca I. Carpousis A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6913-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and polynucleotide phosphorylase (18Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Khemici V. Toesca I. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Carpousis A.J. Mol.

This facilitation is presumably due to the removal of secondary structure from the substrate RNA (20Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). RhlB interacts with the non-catalytic C-terminal “scaffold” domain of RNase E, which has also been shown to be required for polynucleotide phosphorylase and enolase binding (21Vanzo N.F. Li Y.S. Py B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is predicted to be predominantly unstructured, with some small regions of propensity for secondary structure being restricted to specific sites of recognition (22Callaghan A.J. Aurikko J.P. Ilag L.L. Gunter Grossmann J. Chandran V. Kuhnel K. Poljak L. Carpousis A.J. Robinson C.V. Symmons M.F. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The site of interaction on RNase E for RhlB has been identified to lie between residues 698 and 762 (23Chandran V. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Leroy A. Miguel R.N. Fernandez-Recio J. Parkinson J. Burns C. Carpousis A.J. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This engages the C-terminal RecA-like domain of the helicase (24Liou G.G. Chang H.Y. Lin C.S. Lin-Chao S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41157-41162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the binding surface has been proposed to encompass residues 368 to 397, which are not part of a conserved helicase signature motif (23Chandran V. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Leroy A. Miguel R.N. Fernandez-Recio J. Parkinson J. Burns C. Carpousis A.J. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). From a homology model of RhlB based on the Drosophila Vasa structure this binding site is at a comparatively large distance of around 20 Å from the ATP binding pocket (Fig. 1). Consequently, the binding of RNase E must have an indirect effect on the ATPase activity of RhlB. Predictive methods have identified an exposed coil between residues 377 and 383 (Fig. 1) as a putative binding site (23Chandran V. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Leroy A. Miguel R.N. Fernandez-Recio J. Parkinson J. Burns C. Carpousis A.J. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This site is similar to the surface used in the eIF4AIII DEAD box helicase, with its partner proteins in the exon junction complex (13Andersen C.B. Ballut L. Johansen J.S. Chamieh H. Nielsen K.H. Oliveira C.L. Pedersen J.S. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. Andersen G.R. Science. 2006; 313: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Bono F. Ebert J. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Cell. 2006; 126: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). RhlB is the only E. coli DEAD box protein that requires a protein partner to stimulate its ATPase activity (10Carpousis A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 25Bizebard T. Ferlenghi I. Iost I. Dreyfus M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Turner A.M. Love C.F. Alexander R.W. Jones P.G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The stimulating effect of RNase E on RhlB does not require the RNA-binding sites of the ribonuclease that flank the helicase interaction site (18Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that the boost of ATPase activity is not caused indirectly by increased recruitment of RNA. Indeed, we observe that the RNase E/RhlB interaction actually decreases the RNA affinity of the helicase. 4J. A. R. Worrall and B. F. Luisi, unpublished results.4J. A. R. Worrall and B. F. Luisi, unpublished results. Instead, the activation is likely to involve induced conformational changes in the RhlB, but the nature of these changes is not presently clear. Chandran et al. (23Chandran V. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Leroy A. Miguel R.N. Fernandez-Recio J. Parkinson J. Burns C. Carpousis A.J. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have identified a distinctive sequence difference in one of the nine conserved motifs that may account for the activation of RhlB. The terminal amino acid of motif V is an Asp in all E. coli DEAD box proteins but is replaced in RhlB with a His (Fig. 1). Notably, residues in the predicted binding region for RNase E are co-conserved together with the motif V His residue, suggesting a link between RNase E binding on the one hand and the activation of ATPase activity on the other (23Chandran V. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Leroy A. Miguel R.N. Fernandez-Recio J. Parkinson J. Burns C. Carpousis A.J. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This link is explored as part of the present work. Our results confirm that there is communication between the ATPase catalytic site and the putative RNase E binding site; however, they also indicate that the activating effect of RNase E binding on ATPase activity cannot be ascribed to a few surface and active-site residues. Instead, the communication requires a constellation of amino acids that collectively affect the active site pocket. In the course of designing an accommodating cavity in the ATP binding pocket, we inadvertently discovered that substitution of residue Phe-10 near the adenine ring boosted ATPase activity tremendously. However, no activity could be detected in the presence of RNA, indicating that RNA binding has locked the enzyme into an inactive state. We discuss the implications for understanding how the enzyme might transduce energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. RhlB Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Expression systems for three E. coli RNA helicases, RhlB, RhlE, and SrmB, were provided by A. J. Carpousis, CNRS Toulouse, France. The recombinant helicase genes are inserted within the multiple cloning site of a Novagen pET11a (Ampr) vector under the control of the T7 promoter. Mutations in each of the recombinant genes were created using a procedure based on the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit (27Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers used to introduce the respective mutations in the RNA helicases are listed in Table 1. All clones were sequenced to corroborate that the intended mutations were successfully introduced. Site-directed variants of RhlB were also constructed in the di-cistronic pRneRhlB vector (see below) using the mutagenic primers reported in Table 1. Expression and purification was the same as outlined above for the wild-type complex.TABLE 1Mutagenic primer pairs used to generate the various mutations in the recombinant RNA helicases In lower case and underlined are the nucleotides that are changed from the original sequence to generate the respective helicase mutation.MutationMutagenic primer pairsRhlB F10A5′–CAGAACAGAAGgcTTCCGACTTCGCCC–3′5′–GGGCGAAGTCGGAAgcCTTCTGTTCTG–3′ F10M5′–CAGAACAGAAGaTgTCCGACTTCGCCC–3′5′–GGGCGAAGTCGGAcAtCTTCTGTTCTG–3′ H320D5′–GCCGCGCGTGGTTTGUgATATTCCGGCAGTGACG–3′5′–GCGTCACTGCCGGAATATcCAAACCACGCGCGG–3′ S381A5′–GGTCACTCAATTCCGGTAgcCAAATACAATCCGGACG–3′5′–CGTCCGGATTGTATTTGgcTACCGGAATTGAGTGACC–3′ Y383A5′–CCGGTAAGCAAAgcCAATCCGGACGCATTG–3′5′–CAATGCGTCCGGATTGgcTTTGCTTACCGG–3′RhlE D310H5′–CGCTGCGCGCGGCCTGcATATTGAAGAGCTGC–3′5′–GCAGCTCTTGAATATgCAGGCCGCGCGCAGCG–3′SrmB D313H5′–GCCGCGCGCGGTATCcACATTCCTGACGTCAG–3′5′–CTGACGTCAGGAATGTgGATACCGCGCGCGGC–3′ Open table in a new tab Recombinant Expression and Purification of RNA Helicases and Variants—Wild-type (WT) 5The abbreviations used are:WTwild typeADP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateITCisothermal titration calorimetryNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. and site-directed variants of RhlB, RhlE, and SrmB were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and isolated and purified as previously described (22Callaghan A.J.

A final purification step was introduced to the published procedure involving S200 size exclusion chromatography. wild type 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate isothermal titration calorimetry nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Construction and Expression of the RNase E-(696–762)/RhlB Co-expression Vector—The Novagen pRSF-Duet-1 (Kanr) di-cistronic vector was used to construct a co-expression system for the complex formed between RhlB and residues 696–762 of RNase E. The vector consists of two multiple cloning sites each under the control of a T7 promoter. Primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were designed with restriction enzymes sites added for facile cloning of the products into the multiple cloning sites of the pRSF vector. The rhlB gene was amplified form the pET11a vector and ligated in the upstream NdeI and downstream XhoI sites in the second pRSF multiple cloning site. DNA encoding for amino acid residues 696–762 of RNase E was amplified from the full-length RNase E in a pET15b vector. The product was cloned in the upstream BamHI and downstream SalI sites of the first pRSF multiple cloning site creating a His6 tag at the N terminus. Several clones were evaluated by restriction digests and sequencing in both multiple cloning sites to corroborate the correct insertion of the amplified genes into the vector. The final vector was named pRneRhlB. A C-terminal truncation of RhlB was constructed in the pRneRhlB vector. The codon (CTC) for amino acid 398 (Leu) in RhlB was replaced by a stop codon (TAA) using the QuikChange strategy. The final clone was designated pRneRhlBΔ1–397. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pRneRhlB or pRneRhlBΔ1–397 and single transformants were transferred to 50 ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg liter-1 kan and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Two-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of 2× YT medium and 50 μg liter-1 kan were inoculated with 5 ml of overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.5–0.6 was reached. At this point expression of the recombinant genes was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h the cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm imidazole, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet) and passed three times through an Emulsiflex-05 cell disruptor (Avestin). The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 4 °C) and loaded to a Ni-NTA Hitrap column (GE Healthcare). Extensive washing with lysis buffer was followed by a gradient elution with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm imidazole (buffer B). Two peaks eluted at 20 and 40% buffer B and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The first peak contained RhlB and the second peak was enriched with RhlB and the His6-tagged RNase E-(696–762). Fractions from the second peak were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mm NaCl (buffer C) and loaded to an SP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer C. A linear gradient (0–100% buffer C containing 1 m NaCl) was applied and a major peak eluted at ∼350 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled, concentrated in 30-kDa cut-off Centricon units (Vivascience), and loaded to an S200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). A major peak eluting at a column volume corresponding to a species with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa was obtained. Analysis of this peak by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis revealed it to contain the complex between RhlB and RNase E-(696–762). Construction and Purification of RNase E-(696–762) Peptide—A plasmid with the DNA sequence for overexpression of RNase E residues 696–762 was created. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment of RNase E-(696–762) was ligated into the upstream BamHI and downstream SalI sites in the first multiple cloning site of the pRSF-Duet-1 vector. Overexpression in 2× YT medium supplemented with 50 μg liter-1 yielded a protein product with an N-terminal His6 tag that eluted from a Ni-NTA column as a broad peak. Fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed a major band running at ∼18 kDa. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to an S200 size exclusion column. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Protein samples for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 24 h at 4 °C. After dialysis samples were concentrated using either 30- or 5-kDa cut-off Centricon units (Vivascience) and concentrations were determined from UV spectroscopy using extinction coefficients (ϵ) at 280 nm of 36,120 m-1 cm-1 for RhlB and variants, and 1,490 m-1 cm-1 for RNase E-(696–762). RNase E-(696–762) solutions of 300 μm were placed into the syringe and titrated into the sample cell containing 20 μm WT RhlB or a site-directed variant with stirring at 310 rpm during the experiment. All titration experiments were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C on a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter with an injection volume of 2 μl for the first and 5 μl for all subsequent titration points, 60-s initial equilibrium delay and 270-s pause between injections. Binding isotherms were analyzed with Microcal Origin 7.0. In each case the first data point was discarded and the baseline adjusted manually. The integrated data were corrected for the heat of dilution of RNase E-(696–762) into the buffer and binding isotherms were analyzed with 1:1 and 2:1 binding models using the software package of the manufacturer (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Nanospray Mass Spectrometry—The “apo”-RhlB (in the absence of the RNase E peptide) and the co-expressed complex, after size exclusion chromatography, were prepared to concentrations between 5 and 20 μm and buffer exchanged into 250 mm ammonium acetate (Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns, Bio-Rad). All spectra were acquired on a Q-ToF 2 modified for high mass operation and equipped with a Z-spray nanoflow source (Waters, Manchester, UK) (29Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The following experimental parameters were used: capillary voltage 1.7 kV, cone voltage 80–120 V, cone gas 100 liter h-1, collision cell voltage up to 200 V, ion transfer stage pressure 4.0 × 10-3 to 2.0 × 10-2 mbar, argon collision gas at a collision cell pressure of 2–7 μbar. External calibration was achieved by using a 33 mg ml-1 aqueous solution of cesium iodide (Sigma). Calibration, acquisition, and processing were carried out using MassLynx software (Waters, Manchester, UK). ATPase Assays—ATPase activity of RNA helicases was monitored spectrophotometrically on a Shimadzu BioSpec-1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 ± 0.1 °C using the Molecular Probes EnzCheck Phosphate Assay kit (Invitrogen). The assay is based on a method originally described by Webb (30Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released by hydrolysis of ATP, the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside is converted by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) to ribose-1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine. This enzymatic conversion is accompanied by a shift in the maximum absorbance from 330 nm for the substrate to 360 nm for the product. Assays were performed in 1-ml volumes in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 400 μm MgCl2. Bakers' yeast RNA (Sigma), when included, was at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. Reaction components were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature before the reaction was started by the addition of the desired helicase or helicase-RNase E complex to a final concentration of 2.4 μm. Reactions were monitored for 300 s with initial rates calculated from the rate curve over the first 30 s converted into the amount of phosphate released/min/mol of protein from a Pi standard curve. Reported rates are an average of two or three independent experiments. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Three E. coli DEAD Box Proteins and the Co-expression of an RNase E·RhlB Complex—Site-directed variants of three E. coli RNA DEAD Box helicases, RhlB, RhlE, and SrmB were constructed (Table 1). The final expression constructs produced proteins that were highly overexpressed in E. coli, were entirely soluble, and could be purified to >95% as judged from SDS-PAGE. From previous studies it was found that RhlB forms a complex with RNase E (19Khemici V. Toesca I. Poljak L. Vanzo N.F. Carpousis A.J. Mol.

To aid in investigating the properties of this complex, a di-cistronic expression vector was constructed encoding WT RhlB or its site-directed variants and an N-terminal His6-tagged 67-amino acid peptide of RNase E corresponding to residues 696–762. Elution from a Ni-NTA column followed by S200 size exclusion chromatography revealed the RNase E peptide to remain bound to RhlB, indicating that the interaction is avid (Fig. 2). The normalized intensities of the bands on a denaturing gel suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry, corrected for dye uptake in proportion to the molecular mass. It is noted that the Coomassie-stained band for the RNase E peptide runs at twice the apparent molecular mass (∼18 kDa) than the predicted 9163 Da, which includes the 67 amino acids corresponding to RNase E residues 696–762 and 13 additional amino acids coming from the plasmid of which six are the N-terminal His tag. Non-dissociative mass spectrometry analysis provides a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a molecular mass of the RNase E peptide of 9189 Da (Fig. 2). The binding of one RNase E to one RhlB is in accord with earlier results using the R-domain construct of RNase E (residues 628–843), which includes the two putative RNA binding domains flanking the RhlB binding site (Fig. 2) (22Callaghan A.J.

To test this, the S381A and Y383A mutants of RhlB were overexpressed and purified. An expression plasmid to overexpress N-terminal His6-tagged RNase E, residues 696–762, was also constructed.

https://openalex.org/W2055384495,"In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell cycle initiation is prompted during G1 phase by Cln3/cyclin-dependent protein kinase-mediated transcriptional activation of G1-specific genes. A recent screening performed to reveal novel interactors of SCB-binding factor (SBF) and MCB-binding factor (MBF) identified, in addition to the SBF-specific repressor Whi5 and the MBF-specific corepressor Nrm1, a pair of homologous proteins, Msa1 and Msa2 (encoded by YOR066w and YKR077w), as interactors of SBF and MBF, respectively. MSA1 is expressed periodically during the cell cycle with peak mRNA levels occurring at the late M/early G1 phase and peak protein levels occurring in early G1. Msa1 associates with SBF- and MBF-regulated target promoters consistent with a role in G1-specific transcriptional regulation. Msa1 affects cell cycle initiation by advancing the timing of transcription of G1-specific genes. Msa1 binds to SBF- and MBF-regulated promoters and binding is maximal during the G1 phase. Binding depends upon the cognate transcription factor. Msa1 overexpression advances the timing of SBF-dependent transcription and budding, whereas depletion delays both indicators of cell cycle initiation. Similar effects on MBF-regulated transcription are observed. Based upon these results, we conclude that Msa1 acts to advance the timing of G1-specific transcription and cell cycle initiation.

Regulation of cell division is the means by which multicellular organisms ensure proper growth and differentiation and unicellular organisms achieve fidelity in duplication of genetic and cellular components in future generations. The primary mechanisms utilized by cells to control cell cycle progression are periodic transcription and proteolysis. Although there are distinctions between the metazoan cell cycle and that of budding yeast, recent work in our laboratory strongly suggests that the molecular mechanisms utilized to regulate periodic transcription during the cell cycle, specifically during cell cycle initiation, are highly conserved (1de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J. Wittenberg C. Cell. 2004; 117: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).

Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar), argued that its function would be conserved in yeast, as well as metazoan species. Like the E2F1/DP transcription factor complex in metazoans, two heterodimeric transcription factor complexes, known as SBF and MBF, are responsible for transcribing genes specific to the G1 phase of the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 5Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These complexes are comprised of a shared component, Swi6 and the DNA-binding component, Swi4 or Mbp1, respectively, that recognize specific DNA sequence elements, known as SCBs and MCBs, within the promoters of G1-specific genes. Although it had been established that Cln3/CDK was the critical determinant of the timing of cell cycle initiation in the budding yeast, until recently no CDK-regulated target that was functionally analogous to pRb in the regulation of G1 transcription had been identified (6Dirick L. Bohm T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2780-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Tyers M.

Recent work showing that Whi5 has an analogous function to pRb in the Cln3/CDK-mediated repression of G1-specific transcription in budding yeast has addressed this apparent inconsistency (1de Bruin R.A.

To date, over 110 pRb binding partners have been identified (10Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although pRb is associated with other functions besides cell cycle regulation, many of which have no obvious analogy in yeast, such as apoptosis and cellular differentiation (11Pan H. Yin C. Dyson N.J. Harlow E. Yamasaki L. Dyke Van T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), several pRb-related molecular pathways pertaining to cell cycle regulation are conserved in yeast as well. For example, in metazoans, commitment of cells to transition through the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle is known as the “restriction point” and involves phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of pRb by cyclin D-Cdk4/Cdk6 to allow transcriptional activation by E2F1/DP, the pRb target transcription factor during G1 (reviewed in Refs. 4Reed S.I. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar, 12Coqueret O. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, and 13Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Similarly, in yeast, commitment to transition from G1 to S phase, known as “Start,” requires that Whi5 be inactivated by Cln3/CDK phosphorylation so that it no longer represses transcription via SBF, its target transcription factor complex, thus allowing transcription of G1-specific genes (1de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J. Wittenberg C. Cell. 2004; 117: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9Costanzo M. Nishikawa J.L. Tang X.

Also, recent studies suggest that analogous chromatin remodeling complexes in mammals and yeast are linked to G1-specific transcriptional regulation. Specifically, both human BRG1 and hBRM chromatin remodeling complexes and their yeast homologs Swi/Snf have been shown to be involved in the recruitment and activation of their respective G1-specific transcription factors (E2F1 and SBF, respectively) (14Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 15Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 16Yu Y. Eriksson P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2350-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies in human showed a direct correlation between the pattern of histone acetylation and deacetylation and E2F1 transcriptional activation, suggesting that these histone modification complexes may regulate the accessibility of G1-specific transcription factors to their target promoters. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the high level of conservation between species in the regulatory mechanisms that exist to control entry into the cell cycle. Understanding both the parallels and the distinctions that exist across species is critical to unraveling how abnormalities in these pathways deregulate the cell cycle and lead to human diseases including congenital malformations and cancer. Although the discovery of the parallels between Whi5 and Rb function has broadened our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control G1 transcription in yeast, much still remains to be learned about G1-specific transcriptional regulation. In an effort to broaden our understanding of G1-mediated transcriptional regulation in budding yeast, we have used multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to screen interactors of known SBF and MBF components to identify novel regulators of these G1-specific transcription factor complexes (1de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J. Wittenberg C. Cell. 2004; 117: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This screen led to the identification of Whi5, an inhibitor of SBF-mediated transcription that is antagonized by Cln3/CDK, and Nrm1, an MBF-specific transcriptional corepressor required for the timely repression of MBF-regulated transcription during exit from the G1 phase. In addition, two homologous proteins, Msa1 and Msa2, were identified. Further analysis of Msa1 revealed that it is expressed periodically during the cell cycle, displaying peak mRNA levels at late M/early G1 and peak protein levels at early G1, similar to Cln3. Msa1 interacts with both SBF and MBF at their target promoters. Furthermore, association of Msa1 with promoters is regulated during the cell cycle, with peak binding occurring during G1. Msa1 promotes G1-specific transcription and cell cycle initiation. Taken together, this study suggests that Msa1 is a novel regulator of G1-specific transcription.

To identify novel interactors, we utilized cln1Δ cln2Δ strains carrying a GAL1-regulated allele of CLN3 as the only G1 cyclin and one of the components of SBF or MBF, either Swi6, Swi4, or Mbp1, TAP-tagged at the endogenous locus. The cells were arrested in the G1 phase by depletion of CLN3 expression in the absence of galactose or released from arrest by induction of CLN3 expression in the presence of galactose, at which time they were allowed to progress to maximal levels of transcription for analysis. All TAP-tagged proteins were checked by cell size analysis and Western blot to ensure proper function and expression of these proteins. Once purified, protein complexes were digested, and associated proteins were identified using MudPIT analysis as described by McDonald and Yates (19McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Disease Markers. 2002; 18: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Yeast Cell Extract Preparation—The cells growing in log phase were collected by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of cold H2O. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA), 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin/aprotonin (1 μg/ml). To lyse cells, the samples were vortexed with glass beads for four cycles of 40 s with 3-min rest intervals at 4 °C between cycles. To collect extracts, the samples were centrifuged twice at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—0.5–1 mg of yeast protein extract was precleared with 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Sigma):lysis buffer slurry for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were spun down for 15 min at maximum speed. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 2.5–5 μg of appropriate primary antibody (α-HA (12CA5), α-Myc) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The samples were spun at maximum speed for 15 min. The supernatant was again collected and incubated with 25 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry for 2–4 h at 4 °C. the samples were spun down briefly to remove supernatant. The remaining beads were washed three times with 1 ml of modified buffer solution (lysis buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm NaCl concentration, with phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described previously). 20 μl of 4× sample buffer was added to each sample in preparation for Western blot. Cell Synchronization—For mating pheromone synchronization at G1, the cells were grown in YEPD to log phase. α factor was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h to synchronize. In addition to mating pheromone synchronization, G1 cells were also obtained for synchronization studies by isolating small G1 cell populations by centrifugal elutriation as described (20de Bruin R.A.

Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The QuantiTech SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used to prepare samples for analysis by RT-PCR. The reactions were then run on the Chromo-4 qPCRI system (MJ Research) using standard RT-PCR conditions. The obtained data were subsequently analyzed using MJ Opticon Monitor Analysis Software 3.0 (MJ Research). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as previously described by Flick et al. (21Flick K.M. Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M. Zhu Q. Chang H.C. Wittenberg C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cell Size Analysis—Actively growing cell cultures were diluted and permitted to grow for three to four generations until they reached log phase. Once cells reached log phase, at an approximate A260 of 0.4–0.7, 100 μl of culture were collected and subjected to sonication for 30 s at maximum power using a Sonicator 3000 Misonix Inc. sonicator. The samples were then diluted in 10 ml of Isoton® II Diluent and immediately subjected to cell size analysis using a Coulter Z2 Particle Cell Analyzer (Beckman-Coulter). For each analysis, the cell size of ∼5–30 × 103 was resolved and their distribution determined using Z2 AccuComp software (Beckman-Coulter). Identification and Characterization of Msa1 and Msa2—In an effort to further our understanding of G1-specific transcriptional regulation, we sought to identify novel components of SBF and MBF. To screen for novel components of these G1-specific transcription factors, Swi4, Mbp1, and Swi6 were tagged with a carboxyl-terminal TAP epitope at their endogenous locus in a cln1Δcln2Δcln3Δ background containing a GAL1-regulated CLN3 as its only source of G1 cyclin. TAP purifications of associated protein complexes were performed in cells that were arrested in early G1, prior to transcriptional initiation, and in cells in late G1 phase at the peak of G1 transcription, as described previously by de Bruin et al. (1de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J. Wittenberg C. Cell. 2004; 117: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Analyses of protein complexes obtained from these purifications were achieved using MudPIT to perform mass spectrophometry-based identification of individual components. Along with known interactors of SBF and MBF, several novel proteins were also identified, including Whi5 and Nrm1, which function as negative regulators of SBF and MBF, respectively (1de Bruin R.A.

McDonald W.H. Wohlschlegel J. Yates J. Russell III, P. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 483-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Among the novel interactors, two, encoded by the open reading frames YOR066w and YKR077w, were identified by MudPIT as interactors of MBF and SBF components, respectively. Because we later found that Msa1 interacts with SBF (shown below) and Msa2 interacts with MBF (data not shown), we have named the genes encoding these proteins MSA1 and MSA2, respectively, for “MBF and SBF associated.” Msa1 was identified as a novel interactor of MBF components with a high degree of confidence based on sequence coverage and spectral quality (Fig. 1). Specifically, Msa1 was found to interact with Mbp1, demonstrating 4.3 and 14.1% sequence coverage in arrested and released cells, respectively, as well as Swi6, showing 10.5% coverage in released cells (Fig. 1A). Msa2 was identified during our MudPIT analysis as an interactor of Swi4 (Fig. 1A). It was also recently reported to associate with Swi6 based upon genome-wide protein-protein interaction analysis (22Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N.

Msa2, which is related to Msa1, sharing 28% amino acid identity and 43% similarity (Fig. 1B), awaits further investigation. Here we report the analysis of the role of Msa1 in the regulation of G1-specific transcription. Expression of Msa1 Is Regulated during the Cell Cycle—Identifying Msa1 as a novel component of MBF implicated it in the regulation of cell cycle initiation events during G1. This led to the prediction that Msa1, similar to other regulators of G1-specific transcription, including Whi5 and Cln3 (1de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J. Wittenberg C. Cell. 2004; 117: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1955-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), would accumulate periodically during the cell cycle. In fact, the MSA1 transcript was shown to accumulate during the early G1 phase (23Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar) and has more recently been assigned to the Yox1/Mcm1 target cluster, which is expressed during the M/G1 phase (24Wu W.S. Li W.H. Chen B.S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To look at accumulation of the Msa1 protein during the cell cycle, we synchronized cells during the G1 phase with mating pheromone and then released them into the cell cycle. The samples were taken every 15 min and subjected to both Western blot analysis to evaluate protein levels and analysis of budding index to establish the cell cycle position and degree of synchrony. Our results demonstrate that the Msa1 protein accumulates periodically during the cell cycle and achieves peak abundance between 0 and 15 min after release from pheromone arrest, followed by a rapid decrease after 30 min (Fig. 2). This pattern is reinitiated at 75 min after release as cells enter a new cell cycle. The highest level of accumulation of Msa1 occurs during G1, prior to budding, and decreases rapidly as cells enter into the S phase consistent with the pattern of gene expression. These studies reveal a cell cycle expression pattern for Msa1 that is similar to that observed for other regulators of G1-specific transcription and is consistent with a role for Msa1 in regulation of transcriptional activation at the time of cell cycle initiation. Msa1 Interacts with both SBF and MBF Components—To confirm the interactions revealed by MudPIT analysis, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of Msa1 with individual components of the SBF and MBF transcription factors. Msa1 was epitope-tagged at its genomic locus along with either Swi4, Mbp1, or Swi6. Whole cell lysates were collected from these strains, and protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using antibody specific for the epitope on Msa1 or the G1 transcription factor components, as indicated (Fig. 3). Analysis of the constituents of these protein complexes by Western blot revealed that Msa1 co-precipitated with all of the G1 transcription factor components. Although it was not apparent from the MudPIT analysis of G1 transcription factor complexes, which revealed an interaction only with MBF, this analysis demonstrates that Msa1 interacts with SBF and MBF. This in not an entirely surprising result because, considering its qualitative nature, the MudPIT technique is an insufficient basis upon which to exclude an interaction between proteins. Msa1 Associates with SBF- and MBF-regulated Promoters—We have shown that Msa1 interacts with both SBF and MBF transcription factors. Furthermore, we observed that its periodic expression is similar to some of the established regulators of G1-specific transcriptional activation. We therefore postulated that Msa1 is involved in the regulation of SBF- and/or MBF-regulated gene expression. If so, then we expect Msa1 to be present at SBF- and MBF-regulated promoters. To analyze whether Msa1 is recruited to SCB and MCB promoter elements, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of Myc-tagged Msa1 along with Swi4 and Mbp1, the DNA-binding components for SBF and MBF, respectively, for comparison. Our results demonstrate that Msa1 associates with both MBF-regulated (RNR1 and CDC21) and SBF-regulated G1-specific promoters (CLN2 and SVS1) (Fig. 4). Furthermore, inactivation of Swi4 strongly reduces Msa1 binding to SBF target promoters, whereas inactivation of Mbp1 reduces binding to MBF target promoters, without appreciable effects on binding of the other transcription factor to its target promoters. We conclude that Msa1 binds to both SBF and MBF target promoters. Binding of Msa1 to Promoters Is Regulated during the Cell Cycle—Our finding that Msa1 binds to G1-specific promoter elements suggests that this protein functions at promoters to regulate transcription during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether changes in binding status occurred during the cell cycle and whether binding was affected by the absence of SBF. To monitor periodic changes in binding status of Msa1 at promoters, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of Myc-tagged Msa1 on cells that had been synchronized at G1 by pheromone arrest and released to allow progression through the cell cycle. Binding of Msa1 to both SBF- and MBF-dependent promoters was observed to fluctuate during the cell cycle (Fig. 5A). The level of binding was maximal during early G1 prior to maximum budding, after which Msa1 rapidly dissociated from the promoter as cells entered the S phase. We then determined whether association of Msa1 with promoter elements was dependent on G1-specific transcription factors. Binding was analyzed in swi4Δ strains to determine whether Msa1 association with"

Membrane potential was monitored under the whole cell current clamp mode. NE hyperpolarized the cell membrane, an effect that was abolished by tolbutamide. The effect of NE on KATP channels was investigated in parallel using outside-out single channel recording. This revealed that NE enhanced the open activities of the KATP channels ∼2-fold without changing the single channel conductance, demonstrating that NE-induced hyperpolarization was mediated by activation of the KATP channels. The NE effect was abolished in cells preincubated with pertussis toxin, indicating coupling to heterotrimeric Gi/Go proteins. To identify the G proteins involved, antisera raised against α and β subunits (anti-Gαcommon, anti-Gβ, anti-Gαi1/2/3, and anti-Gαo) were used. Anti-Gαcommon totally blocked the effects of NE on membrane potential and KATP channels. Individually, anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo only partially inhibited the action of NE on KATP channels. However, the combination of both completely eliminated the action. Antibodies against Gβ had no effects. To confirm these results and to further identify the G protein subunits involved, the blocking effects of peptides containing the sequence of 11 amino acids at the C termini of the α subunits were used. The data obtained were similar to those derived from the antibody work with the additional information that Gαi3 and Gαo1 were not involved.

In conclusion, both Gi and Go proteins are required for the full effect of norepinephrine to activate the KATP channel. Insulin secretion is inhibited by α2-adrenergic receptor activation (1Ullrich S. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4111-4115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sharp G.W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2-adrenergic receptors at the plasma membrane are linked to pertussis toxin (PTX) 2The abbreviations used are:PTXpertussis toxinNEnorepinephrineATPiintracellular free ATPSURsulfonylurea receptor.2The abbreviations used are:PTXpertussis toxinNEnorepinephrineATPiintracellular free ATPSURsulfonylurea receptor.-sensitive Gi and Go proteins. Upon interacting with the α2-adrenergic receptors, catecholamines (i.e. epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE)), two important physiological inhibitors of insulin secretion, activate Gi and/or Go proteins and inhibit the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules (2Sharp G.W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four mechanisms have been suggested to account for their inhibitory effect: 1) activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) and repolarization of the β-cells; 2) inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels; 3) decreased activity of adenylyl cyclase; and 4) inhibition of exocytosis at a “distal” site in stimulus-secretion coupling, which is beyond the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and beyond the potentiating actions of cAMP and diacyglycerol (2Sharp G.W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that the “distal” inhibitory effect is the most dominant, the relative contribution of each of these four mechanisms to the overall inhibition of insulin release is not clear. pertussis toxin norepinephrine intracellular free ATP sulfonylurea receptor. pertussis toxin norepinephrine intracellular free ATP sulfonylurea receptor. Considering the effects of catecholamines on the membrane potential in the insulin-secreting cells, it is clear that catecholamines can repolarize the cell membrane in a PTX-sensitive manner. However, the explanations for this phenomenon are mixed. Abel et al. (3Abel K.B. Lehr S. Ullrich S. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that adrenaline-induced hyperpolarization was due to activation of KATP channels but that the effect was insufficient to cause the sustained inhibition of insulin secretion in INS-1 cells associated with it (i.e. the distal effect is dominant). Schermerhorn and Sharp (4Schermerhorn T. Sharp G.W.G. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also found that NE acted on the KATP channel and produced different effects on [Ca2+]i in oscillating and nonoscillating HIT-T15 cells. However, Rorsman et al. (5Rorsman P. Bokvist K. Ammala C. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Wahlander K. Nature. 1991; 349: 77-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that epinephrine suppressed mouse β-cell electrical activity by a G protein-dependent mechanism, which culminated in the activation of a sulfonylurea-insensitive low conductance K+ channel distinct from the KATP channel. Further evidence for the existence of this G protein-regulated low conductance K+ channel comes from studies with SUR1 knock-out mice that do not have functional KATP channels. Islet cells from these mice are hyperpolarized by epinephrine in a PTX-sensitive manner, and the hyperpolarization is due to activation of a low conductance K+ channel (6Sieg A. Su J. Munoz A. Buchenau M. Nakazaki M. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Ullrich S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E463-E471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and catecholamine control of the KATP channel and the low conductance channel in β-cells of different origins and conditions (e.g. knockouts) remain to be defined. However, although it is established that the action of catecholamines is coupled to the activation of Gi and Go proteins, information about the exact identities of these G proteins and the corresponding subunits is not available. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of NE on the membrane potential and on the KATP channels in INS 832/13 cells, and we identified the G proteins involved. For this, we used a combination of whole cell configuration and outside-out single channel recording to monitor the membrane potential and single KATP currents in parallel. In order to clarify which G proteins and subunits are responsible for the actions of NE, we used antisera raised against various G protein α and β subunits, anti-Gαcommon, anti-Gβ, anti-Gαi1/2/3, and anti-Gαo. We also used small peptides specific for the C termini of the α subunits that specifically block G protein interactions with receptors. The antisera or peptides were diffused into the cells separately and in combination, and their effects on the INS 832/13 cells were determined. NE hyperpolarized the cell membrane via enhancing the open activities of the KATP channels in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the action of NE was mediated by Gαi and Gαo subunits, the effects of the two types of subunits were not redundant. Applying one of their corresponding antibodies or peptides only partially inhibited the action of NE. The effect of NE was fully blocked only by the combination of antibodies against Gαi1/2/3 and Gαo and by the blocking peptides for Gαi1/2 and Gαo2 but not the peptides for Gi3 and Gαo1. The data show that activation of KATP channels by NE contributes to the NE-induced inhibition of insulin release in the INS 832/13 cells and that the action requires both Gαi1/2 and Gαo2 proteins. Cell Culture—INS 832/13 cells (a kind gift by Dr. C. B. Newgard) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells (passage numbers 60–66) were divided once a week by treatment with trypsin, and the medium was changed twice between divisions. The measurements were performed 1–2 days after cell division. Electrophysiology and Solutions—Both whole cell current clamp mode and outside-out single channel recording were applied. Whole cell recordings were performed using fire-polished electrodes, pulled from borosilicate glass and showing an open resistance of 2–5 megaohms. Signals were amplified and acquired by a PULSE 8.75-controlled EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Electronics). Data were filtered through a four-pole low pass Bessel filter at 2 kHz, and the sampling rate was 10 kHz. For single channel recording, data were further digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Capacitative transients and series resistance were compensated, using the circuitry incorporated in the amplifier. The cells were continuously superfused with standard extracellular solution (solution A) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and glucose with adjusted concentrations. For the perforated whole cell configuration, the pipette solution (solution B) was composed of 10 mm KCl, 76 mm K2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3) and amphotericin B (200 μg/ml). For the standard whole cell configuration, the patch pipette was filled with solution C containing 145 mm potassium glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP-Mg, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.3 mm cAMP, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3). The membrane potential was measured under perforated or standard whole cell configurations, and during the recording periods the cells were bathed in solution A supplemented with 16.7 mm glucose. The outside-out patch was established after the formation of standard whole cell configuration and was continuously bathed in solution A supplemented with 5 mm tetraethylammonium and 2.8 mm glucose. The pipette solution specific for the single channel recording (solution D) was composed of 140 mm KCl, 8 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP-Mg, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.3 mm cAMP, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3). NE and tolbutamide were freshly prepared in stock solutions before experiments and were added into solution A at final concentrations of 5 and 300 μm, respectively. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). The antibodies used in this study were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies were added to the pipette solution with adjusted concentrations and were applied intracellularly by dialysis. In order to reach equilibrium of the antibodies between the pipette tip and the cytosol, monitoring the membrane potential as well as establishing the outside-out membrane patch were performed 2–5 min after the cell membrane was ruptured. Experiments using the peptides analogous to the C termini of Gαi1/2, Gαi3, Gαo1, Gαo2, and a randomized peptide were performed exactly as those using the antibodies. The analysis program of single channel recording was written in our laboratory based on the software of Igor Pro version 5.03 (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The maximum number of functional channels (N) in the patch was estimated by observing the number of peaks detected on the histogram distribution of amplitude. As an index of channel activity, NPo (the maximum number of channels in the patch times the open probability) was calculated as follows, NPo=∑n=oNntnT where T represents the total recording time, n is the number of channels open, and tn is the recording time during which n channels are open. Therefore, NPo can be calculated without making assumptions about the total number of channels in a patch or the open probability of a single channel. In order to control the variations in NPo among patches, the NPo values were generally expressed in normalized form relative to the NPo under pretest conditions. The NPo was evaluated at 0 mV. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Significance tests were performed using Student's test. Effects of NE on the Membrane Potential of INS 832/13 Cells—The perforated whole cell configuration was applied to investigate the effect of NE on the membrane potential in intact INS 832/13 cells. The cells were continuously superfused with solution A containing 16.7 mm glucose, and the voltages were monitored by using pipette solution B. In Fig. 1A, the membrane potential was depolarized by high glucose to ∼–40 mV with continuous bursts of action potentials to ∼20 mV, which were triggered by rapid Ca2+ influx. When challenged with NE (5 μm) in contact with the extracellular membrane surface, the cell was markedly hyperpolarized to ∼–60 mV and was redepolarized to ∼–40 mV upon the removal of NE, showing that the effect of NE had a rapid onset and was rapidly reversible. The apparent delay in onset of the action of NE (Fig. 1A) and tolbutamide (Fig. 1B) was caused by the perifusion system and a lag period before NE and tolbutamide reach the cells. The sensitivity of NE-induced hyperpolarization to the classic KATP channel inhibitor, tolbutamide, was tested. Tolbutamide (300 μm) reversed the NE-induced fall in membrane potential (Fig. 1B). Similarly, when tolbutamide was added first, NE had no effect on membrane potential (not shown). NE was not capable of hyperpolarizing the cells that were precultured with PTX (150 ng/ml) for 24 h (Fig. 1C), indicating the involvement of Gi and/or Go proteins in the regulation of the membrane potential by NE. Data presented in Fig. 1, A–C, respectively, are typical of three sets of experiments. As summarized in Fig. 1D, on average, 5 μm NE hyperpolarized the membrane potential from –36 ± 1.5 mV to –55 ± 2.1 mV (n = 14, p < 0.01), and tolbutamide counteracted this hyperpolarization by restoring the membrane potential from –57 ± 3.2 to –31 ± 1.8 mV (n = 10, p < 0.01). In the cells pretreated with PTX, the membrane potentials before and after the challenge with NE were –43 ± 4.0 and –45 ± 3.7 mV (n = 5, p > 0.05). Similarly, PTX treatment blocked the effect of NE to decrease the frequency of Ca2+-triggered action potentials. Analysis of the data in Fig. 1 showed that the frequency of the action potentials was 20.6 ± 5.5/min prior to NE treatment, 17.7 ± 4.2/min during NE treatment (p > 0.05, n = 5) and 16.8 ± 4.3/min after the washout of NE. These data indicate that NE hyperpolarized the cell membrane via its effect on the KATP channels. To this point, the observations were obtained in the relatively intact cell and could not elucidate whether the change of membrane potential was made by the direct interaction between the KATP channels and the Gi/o proteins or by indirect interaction with other cytosolic messengers. To address this, the same experimental procedures were repeated, except that the standard whole cell configuration was employed and the patch pipette was filled with solution C containing 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.3 mm cAMP. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cell membrane was again reversibly hyperpolarized by 5 μm NE. When ATP was omitted from the pipette solution, the cell was hyperpolarized, and, as expected, NE was not capable of inducing any further fall of membrane potential (Fig. 2B). The effects of NE on the membrane potential recorded under the standard whole cell configuration in the presence and absence of ATPi are summarized in Fig. 2C. In the presence of 2 mm ATP in the pipette solution C, the membrane potentials were –41 ± 3.5 mV (control), –58 ± 3.1 mV (with NE), and –42 ± 4.7 mV (wash out). These values are similar to those obtained with the perforated whole cell configuration. The effect of NE on membrane potential was significantly different from both the pre-NE and post-NE values (n = 5, p < 0.01). When ATPi was omitted, the membrane potentials were not significantly changed by NE (n = 5, p > 0.05), remaining at ∼–60 mV before, during, and after NE treatment.FIGURE 2Effect of NE on the membrane potential in the absence and presence of ATP. The representative traces in A and B were obtained under the standard whole cell current clamp configuration. In Fig. 2A, the cell membrane was reversibly hyperpolarized by NE (5 μm) from ∼–40 to ∼–60 mV with 2 mm Mg-ATP in the pipette solution. In Fig. 2B, NE lacked the ability to further hyperpolarize the cell when ATP was omitted from the pipette solution.

All single channel recordings presented in this paper were derived exclusively from currents passing through KATP channels in outside-out patches and with the membrane potential clamped at 0 mV. The Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channels and the Ca2+-activated K+ channels were eliminated by keeping the [Ca2+]i low, <10–9 m, and by applying 5 mm tetraethylammonium extracellularly (7Petersen O.H. Findlay I. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1054-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the number of operational KATP channels per membrane patch is often unknown, NPo was introduced to estimate the channel activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3A shows the effect of NE (5 μm) on single KATP channels in an outside-out membrane patch. The pipette solution D was in direct contact with the cytosolic side of the membrane patch, and the outside of the patch was continuously superfused with solution A. The single channel currents were monitored before, during, and after NE treatment. In Fig. 3A, NE-induced enhancement of the open activity of KATP channels was clearly visualized, and this effect was completely reversible, since the channel activity decreased to the control level upon removal of NE (Fig. 3E). The values of NPo determined under test conditions were normalized to the control value, which was displayed as 100%. As summarized in Fig. 3E, on average, 5 μm NE increased the value of NPo from 100% in the control situation to 209 ± 17% and returned back to 106 ± 11% of the pretest value upon removal of NE (0.1 mm ATPi was present, n = 12, p < 0.01). When ATP was excluded from the pipette solution, the channels exhibited robust open activity, and the channel activity could not be further increased by the application of NE (Fig. 3B), which is similar to the situation shown in Fig. 2B. The results shown in Fig. 3, A and B, are typical of two sets of experiments under different conditions of ATPi. On average, when ATPi was omitted, the mean value of NPo was 103 ± 3.4% in the presence of NE (n = 7, p > 0.05). When tolbutamide was present, the subsequent addition of NE had no effect on K+ channel activity (not shown). These data are consistent with the observations shown in Fig. 2 that the NE-induced modification of electrical properties in INS 832/13 cells cannot be detected in the absence of ATPi. The current frequency distribution for the channels studied under control and NE-treated conditions in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP is shown in Fig. 3C and in the absence of ATP in the pipette in Fig. 3D. There is no evidence for the presence of more than one channel in the cell under either of these conditions. In order to investigate whether NE also influences the conductance of single KATP channels, single KATP currents were recorded in the presence and absence of 5 μm NE over the range of –40 to +60 mV. The mean values of single current amplitudes were plotted versus the corresponding clamped voltages (Fig. 3F). The current-voltage relationship was nearly linear at negative potentials but showed a slight inward rectification at membrane potentials higher than 10 mV, as previously described in RINm5F cells by Findlay (8Findlay I. J. Physiol. 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two I-V curves obtained under control and test conditions were overlapping. The slope conductance fitted between –40 and 20 mV was ∼20 picosiemens in control and 19.2 picosiemens in the presence of NE, indicating that application of NE did not induce any significant modification of single channel current amplitude.

Effects of Antibodies against Common Gα Subunits on the NE-induced Electrical Changes—To identify the G protein subunits involved in NE-mediated hyperpolarization and activation of the KATP channels, antibodies raised against various G protein subunits were tested. Anti-Gαcommon (2 μg/ml) was added to the pipette solutions C and D, for the voltage measurement and outside-out single channel recordings, respectively. Once the standard whole cell configuration was established, 2–5 min was allowed for the antibodies to reach equilibrium between the pipette tip and the cytosol. The results in Fig. 4A clearly show that upon application of anti-Gαcommon, the membrane voltage remained at ∼–40 mV during the whole perfusion process, without exhibiting hyperpolarization in the presence of NE. As summarized in Fig. 4C, anti-Gαcommon significantly counteracted the effect of NE on the membrane potential. The membrane potential was –42 ± 4.3 mV in control, –41 ± 3.7 mV in the presence of NE, and –42 ± 4.3 mV upon removal of NE (n = 15, p < 0.01). In order to exclude possible nonspecific effects of anti-Gαcommon, the experiments were controlled by replacing anti-Gαcommon with IgG and by measuring the response of the membrane potential to NE. As shown in Fig. 4C, NE induced its anticipated effect on membrane potential, and the results were analogous to those shown in Fig. 2C. The effect of anti-Gαcommon on the NE-induced activation of KATP channels was investigated by adding anti-Gαcommon (2 μg/ml) to pipette solution D. 5 μm NE failed to induce a visible change of channel activity (Fig. 4B). As summarized in Fig. 4D, with anti-Gαcommon in the pipette solution D, the normalized NPo was almost unchanged from 100% in control to 103 ± 3.3% in the presence of 5 μm NE and 99 ± 4.8% with the removal of NE (n = 18, p > 0.05). However, the NE effects remained in a series of control experiments using IgG. NPo was increased by NE from 100% to 221 ± 12% and back to the precontrol level of 98 ± 2.7% when NE was washed out (n = 6, p < 0.01). Effects of Antibodies against Specific Subunits of Gαi and Gαo on the NE-induced Electrical Changes—From the results presented above, we predicted that at least one of these two types of subunits, Gαi and Gαo, should be able to mimic, to some extent, the effects of anti-Gαcommon on the electrical properties in INS 832/13 cells. To test this, monoclonal antibodies raised specifically against Gαi1/2/3 and Gαo were applied. Adding anti-Gαi1/2/3 or anti-Gαo (2 μg/ml for each) to the cytosolic side of the patches did not fully block NE (5 μm) to increase KATP channel activity. As can be seen in the summary in Fig. 5A, in the presence of individual anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo, NE still increased the normalized NPo values from 100% to 156 ± 7.8% and to 148 ± 5.1%, respectively for anti-Gαi1/2/3 (n = 17, p < 0.05) and anti-Gαo (n = 19, p < 0.01), respectively. After removal of NE, both NPo values determined in the presence of Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo individually returned to the precontrol levels. Because anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo only partially attenuated the effects of NE (by ∼44 and ∼52%, respectively), the effect of these antisera in combination was examined. In the patches treated with Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo simultaneously, the normalized NPo, in the presence of NE, was 101 ± 6.1% (n = 15, p < 0.01). This represents a complete inhibition of the effects of NE on KATP channel activity by anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo when applied together. In considering why individual anti-Gα1/2/3 and anti-Gαo only partially block the action of NE, several possibilities exist. First, Gαi1/2/3 and Gαo are redundant, and both have the same targeting sites on the KATP channel. In this case, the partial inhibition observed could be due to an insufficient amount of antibodies applied. Second, the effects of Gαi1/2/3 and Gαo on the KATP channels might not be redundant, so that both independently impair the closure of KATP channels by targeting different sites. In this case, each alone would not fully block the effect of NE. Third, the inhibitory effect observed from one of the two types of antibodies, either anti-Gαi1/2/3 or anti-Gαo, could be artifactual, due to cross-reaction between the two antibodies (unlikely, since both antibodies were affinity-purified). To answer the questions of redundancy and cross-reactivity, the experiments were repeated, except that the concentrations of the individual anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo were modified either by increasing 2-fold (4 μg/ml) or by lowering 10-fold (0.2 μg/ml). Comparing the summary data in Fig. 5B with that present in Fig. 5A, increasing the amount of antibody did not change the outcome from that seen with the initial concentration of 2 μg/ml. At higher concentrations of anti-Gαi1/2/3 or anti-Gαo (4 μg/ml for each) the NPo values in the presence of NE were 151 ± 4% (n = 13, p < 0.01) and 152 ± 6% (n = 14, p < 0.01), respectively (similar to the results in Fig. 5A). Full inhibition was only achieved by combining both antibodies (NPo = 108 ± 4%, n = 15, p < 0.01). Thus, the effects of individual Gαi1/2/3 and Gαo are not redundant. The possibility of cross-reaction was minimized by decreasing the concentrations of anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo to 0.2 μg/ml for each (one-tenth of the original amount of antibody). Under these conditions, when any possible cross-reaction should be much reduced or eliminated, the effects of anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo were still clearly observed (see Fig. 5C). Anti-Gαi1/2/3 and anti-Gαo attenuated the effects of NE on NPo by ∼34% (NPo = 164 ± 4%, n = 11, p < 0.01) and ∼28% (NPo = 172 ± 7%, n = 9, p < 0.01), respectively. When applied together, the effect of the two antibodies was greater than either one alone and resulted in 51% inhibition (NPo = 149 ± 5%, n = 11, p < 0.01). Next, both anti-Gαi1/2/3 (2 μg/ml) and anti-Gαo (2 μg/ml) were applied simultaneously to counteract NE-induced hyperpolarization under the standard whole cell configuration. As summarized in Fig. 5D, the mean values of the membrane potentials were –43 ± 3.7 mV, –45 ± 4.2 mV, and –43 ± 5.1 mV, before, during, and after NE treatment, respectively (n = 15, p > 0.05), data that are consistent with the observations from the single channel experiments presented earlier. Control experiments (shown in Fig. 5, A–D) were performed with mouse and goat IgG, separately or combined as appropriate. Effects of Gβ on NE-induced Electrical Activities—To evaluate the contribution of Gβ subunits to the effects of NE, polyclonal antibodies raised against Gβ subunits (anti-Gβ) were added to the pipette solution C or D, with respect to voltage measurement and outside-out single channel recording. In the presence of anti-Gβ, the example traces corresponding to the effects of NE on the membrane potentials and on the KATP channels are presented in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. In contrast to the effects of anti-Gαcommon, anti-Gαi1/2/3, and anti-Gαo, NE-mediated regulation of the membrane potential and the KATP channels was not changed by anti-Gβ. As summarized, in the presence of anti-Gβ, NE reduced membrane potential from –45 ± 3.2 to –58 ± 4.7 mV (n = 9, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6C) and increased NPo from 100% to 212 ± 12% (n = 14, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6D), similar to the control experiments. In addition to concluding that the βγ subunit has no role in the activation of the KATP channels, these results also exclude an effect of NE on K+ channels of the Kir3 family in these cells, which are activated by βγ (11Clapham D.E.

HemAT-Bs discriminates its physiological effector (O2) from other gas molecules (CO and NO), although all of them bind to a heme. To monitor the conformational changes in the protein moiety upon binding of different ligands, we have investigated ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra of the ligand-free and O2-, CO-, and NO-bound forms of full-length HemAT-Bs and several mutants (Y70F, H86A, T95A, and Y133F) and found that Tyr70 in the heme distal side and Tyr133 and Trp132 from the G-helix in the heme proximal side undergo environmental changes upon ligand binding. In addition, the UVRR results confirmed our previous model, which suggested that Thr95 forms a hydrogen bond with heme-bound O2, but Tyr70 does not. It is deduced from this study that hydrogen bonds between Thr95 and heme-bound O2 and between His86 and heme 6-propionate communicate the heme structural changes to the protein moiety upon O2 binding but not upon CO and NO binding. Accordingly, the present UVRR results suggest that O2 binding to heme causes displacement of the G-helix, which would be important for transduction of the conformational changes from the sensor domain to the signaling domain.

HemAT consists of two domains, the sensor and signaling domains, connected by a linker region. The sensor domain has globin folds and contains a heme that acts as the O2 binding site, whereas the signaling domain interacts with a histidine kinase protein (CheA), a component of the CheA/CheY two-component signal transduction system that regulates the rotation direction of the flagellar motor (18Szurmant H.

The x-ray crystallographic analysis of HemAT has been completed only for the reduced ligand-free and oxidized CN-bound forms of the truncated sensor domain, which stays as a homodimer (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A displays the crystallographic structure of one subunit of the CN-bound form of the truncated sensor domain of Bacillus subtilis HemAT (HemAT-Bs). The CN ion and His123 are the heme axial ligands in the distal and proximal sides, respectively. The CN ligand forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr70 (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The truncated sensor domain of HemAT-Bs contains one Trp and five Tyr residues; Trp132 and Tyr133 are contained in the G-helix in the proximal side of heme, but Tyr70 is present in the distal side, whereas Tyr13, Tyr49, and Tyr148 are located far from the heme (Fig. 1A). These aromatic residues will be used as probes to monitor the protein conformational changes upon ligand binding in this ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) study. One of the important issues concerning the structural biology of gas sensor proteins is clarifying structural changes of the heme and the nearby residues (Tyr70, His86, and Thr95) (Fig. 1A) upon binding of the signaling molecule. The structural changes in the active site upon binding of different ligands have been studied with different techniques (15Aono S. Kato T. Matsuki M. Nakajima H. Ohta T. Uchida T. Kitagawa T. J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7763-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For instance, by using visible excited RR spectroscopy in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, it is proposed that His86 forms a hydrogen bond with a heme 6-propionate upon binding of O2 to the heme (23Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Ohta T. Uchida T. Kubo M. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8301-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The formation of this hydrogen bond induces conformational changes of the protein by which Thr95 is moved to a position suitable to form a hydrogen bond with the heme-coordinated O2, whereas Tyr70 does not form a hydrogen bond with the heme-bound O2 (22Ohta T. Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Aono S. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 15000-15001Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Ohta T. Uchida T. Kubo M. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8301-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, Zhang et al. (16Zhang W. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2801-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Tyr70 (Y70F, Y70L, and Y70W) of the truncated sensor domain of HemAT-Bs brought about larger dissociation constants for O2 than the wild type (WT) and thus proposed that Tyr70 would form a hydrogen bond to the heme-bound O2 in the WT form. These contradictory results demand directly probing the environmental change of Tyr70 upon binding of O2 because this might be substantially related to the discrimination of ligands to be signaled. Another important issue is concerned with the structural changes in the protein moiety of the G-helix. The recent time-resolved RR study suggested that Tyr133 in the G-helix (Fig. 1A) forms a hydrogen bond with the proximal axial ligand (His123) upon CO binding (25Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Mizutani Y. Aono S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is based on the 2-cm-1 downshift of the iron–histidine-stretching (νFe–His) band in the time-resolved RR spectra of WT hundreds of picoseconds after photodissociation of CO, whereas such a frequency shift was not observed for the Y133F mutant. Furthermore, G- and H-helices of different subunits of a homodimer form an antiparallel four-helix bundle (Fig. 1B) and exhibit appreciable displacement upon CN binding (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although this displacement is small, it is perceptible and may be related to the signal transduction (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is unknown whether such conformational changes occur upon binding of the effector molecule, O2. To monitor the conformational changes in the protein moiety upon binding of O2, CO, and NO to a heme, we applied UVRR spectroscopy to WT and several mutants (Y70F, H86A, T95A, and Y133F) of the full-length HemAT-Bs for the first time. The vibrational spectra of the aromatic side chains such as Tyr and Trp residues can be selectively obtained by choosing an appropriate excitation wavelength in the 220–250-nm region, and the spectra provide structural information about their conformations, local environments, and hydrogen bonding interactions (26Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems, Advances in Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 27Austin J.C. Jordan T. Spiro T.G. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Part A, Advances in Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1993: 55-127Google Scholar). Such kinds of UVRR-specific information have proven to be essential to understanding the structural mechanisms of a variety of heme proteins, including hemoglobin (28Rodgers K.R. Su C. Subramaniam S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), myoglobin (29Gao Y. El-Mashtoly S.F. Pal B. Hayashi T. Harada K. Kitagawa T. J. Biol.

Soc. 2007; 129: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, UVRR spectra of HemAT-Bs are expected to probe directly the structural and/or environmental changes of Tyr70 and Tyr133. Furthermore, UVRR spectroscopy will provide some information on the G-helix motion through side chain vibrations of Trp and Tyr residues because HemAT-Bs contains Trp132 as well as Tyr133 in the G-helix. Finally, we examined the effect of removal of the hydrogen bond between His86 and heme 6-propionate and between Thr95 and heme-bound O2 on the protein conformational changes. As discussed below, the UVRR data will reveal specific features regarding the protein structural changes upon binding of different ligands. Sample Preparation—In this study, we used the full-length HemAT-Bs with a His6 tag at the C terminus, which was expressed with an E. coli BL21(DE3) cell system under the control of the T7 promoter in the pET-24(+) vector (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the expression of HemAT-Bs, the E. coli cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 4 h in Terrific Broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and then the cultivation was continued at 22 °C for 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and were stored at -80 °C until used. The cells were thawed and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 15 mm glycine and 1 m NaCl) and then were broken by sonication. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). After the column was washed with Buffer A and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), the adsorbed proteins were eluted by 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm imidazole. The fractions containing HemAT-Bs were combined and loaded on a HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, and then HemAT-Bs was eluted by increasing the concentration of NaCl in the buffer. For Raman measurements, the concentration of protein was adjusted to 80 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). As an internal intensity standard to generate UVRR difference spectra, 400 mm sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) was contained in the solution for the excitation at 229 nm. In addition, Trp Raman bands were used as a secondary internal standard to normalize the UVRR spectra of different Tyr mutants. The oxidized HemAT-Bs was prepared by adding an excess amount of potassium ferricyanide to the purified protein, and afterward potassium ferricyanide was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. A 5-fold excess of sodium dithionite was added into degassed oxidized HemAT-Bs solution to reduce it. To prepare CO-, NO-, and O2-bound HemAT-Bs, the reduced HemAT-Bs solution was exposed to CO, NO, and O2 gas, respectively. Ultraviolet Resonance Raman Measurements—UVRR measurements were performed using instrumentation described previously in detail (32Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 229-nm excitation light was generated by an intracavity frequency doubling of the 457.9-nm line of an argon ion laser (Coherent, Innova, 300 FReD). The second harmonic in the laser output was separated from the fundamental with a Pellin-Broca prism and focused into a sample solution. An ∼100-μl aliquot of the protein solution was incorporated into a spinning cell with a stirring function (32Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the inside of which was replaced with the corresponding gas. Raman-scattered light at a right angle was collected with a UV microscope objective lens, dispersed with a 126-cm single monochromator (Spex 1269) equipped with a 3600-groove/mm holographic grating, and detected by an intensified charge-coupled detector (Princeton Instruments, ICCD-1024MG-E/1). We adopted spectral resolutions of 7.8 cm-1 for spectra. The laser power at the sample point was very low (0.3 milliwatts) to avoid photodissociation of the ligand from the heme. The protein sample was replaced with a fresh one every 10 min, and the total exposure time to get one spectrum was ∼1 h. The integrity of the sample after exposure to UV laser light was carefully confirmed by comparing the visible absorption spectra obtained before and after the UVRR measurements. If some spectral changes were recognized, the Raman spectrum was discarded. Raman shifts were calibrated with cyclohexane, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and toluene. UVRR Spectral Changes of the Sensor Domain and Full-length Proteins of HemAT-Bs upon O2 Binding—Fig. 2 depicts the 229-nm excited raw UVRR spectrum of the O2-bound form of full-length WT HemAT-Bs (spectrum a) and the difference spectra, O2 - ligand-free, for full-length (spectrum b) and truncated sensor domain proteins (spectrum c). The raw spectrum of full-length WT (spectrum a) is dominated by the bands arising from one Trp (Trp132) residue and six Tyr residues (Tyr13, Tyr49, Tyr70, Tyr133, Tyr148, and Tyr184), which are labeled with W and Y, respectively, followed by their mode numbers (26Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems, Advances in Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1986: 113-175Google Scholar). The difference spectra were calculated so that the band of ClO4- (934 cm-1), which was present at the same concentration in all the samples as an internal intensity standard, could become zero. The presence of negative peaks in the difference spectra means that Raman intensities of the Trp and Tyr bands are reduced by oxygen binding. The frequency of the W17 band (∼875 cm-1) is known to serve as a marker of hydrogen bonding of the Trp indole ring (33Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The W17 band of WT (spectrum a) is observed at 876 cm-1. This frequency corresponds to a moderate strength of hydrogen bonding (33Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the CN-bound form of the truncated sensor domain in the homodimer suggests that Trp132 does not form a hydrogen bond with any nearby residues (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The W3 mode of Trp, which is known to be sensitive to the absolute value of torsion angle |χ2,1| about the Cβ –C3 bond connecting the indole ring to the peptide main chain (35Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1989; 20: 667-671Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar), is observed at 1554 cm-1 for the full-length WT, which corresponds to a |χ2,1| angle of 102°. The x-ray structure of the truncated sensor domain indicated that Trp132 in each monomer of the cyanide-bound form has χ2,1 values of 111 and 127° (21Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These values are larger than that predicted from the W3 frequency. The W17 and W3 vibrations of the truncated sensor domain are also observed at frequencies similar to those of the full-length protein (data not shown). These observations suggest that the hydrogen bonding interaction and side chain conformation of Trp132 might be slightly different between the O2- and CN-bound forms. Because of the importance of an effector molecule, O2, for HemAT-Bs, next we focused on the UVRR spectral changes upon binding of O2 to the heme. We noted that the absorption spectrum of the O2-bound form showed no significant change after exposure to UV light, indicating that the O2-bound form was not oxidized under our experimental conditions. The O2 - ligand-free difference spectra (Fig. 2, spectra b and c) yielded negative peaks at 758 (W18), 876 (W17), 1011 (W16), 1174 (Y9a), 1358 (W7), 1554 (W3), and 1617 (Y8a) cm-1, indicating the decrease in the intensities of the Trp and Tyr bands in the O2-bound form. These results suggest that Trp132 and some Tyr residues experience environmental changes upon O2 binding. Intensity comparison between spectra b and c indicates that the intensity change of Y8a is larger for the full-length protein than for the truncated sensor domain (see also supplemental Fig. S1). Because this difference spectrum (Fig. 2, spectrum b) reflects the spectral changes of Tyr residues upon O2 binding and the truncated sensor domain (residues 10–178) does not contain Tyr184, which is located in the linker region (residues 176–195) between the sensor and signaling domains, the change in the Y8a band (spectrum b) is partially assigned to Tyr184. This suggests that an environmental change of Tyr184 takes place, in fact, upon binding of O2 to the heme. However, the overall similarity between spectra b and c means that the structural changes of Trp and Tyr residues in the sensor domain upon O2 binding are hardly affected by the presence of the linker region. UVRR Spectral Changes of HemAT-Bs upon Binding of Different Ligands—Fig. 3 compares the UVRR spectral differences among the O2-bound (spectrum b), CO-bound (spectrum c), and NO-bound (spectrum d) forms of the full-length WT, for which the 229-nm excited raw UVRR spectrum of the O2-bound form is presented again by spectrum a for reference. For clarification, spectra b–d in Fig. 3 are represented by the differences, ligand-bound - ligand-free reduced forms. Although CO and NO are not effector molecules for HemAT-Bs, we have monitored the spectral changes for Trp and Tyr residues of WT upon CO (Fig. 3, spectrum c) or NO (spectrum d) binding to elucidate whether or not the protein moiety can discriminate between different ligands. The difference spectrum c (CO - ligand-free) displays negative features for Trp and Tyr bands similar to those observed upon O2 binding (spectrum b), but the features of the W18 and W16 modes are slightly different between CO and O2 binding. In addition, spectrum c reveals stronger negative peaks for the Y9a (1174 cm-1), Y8b (1598 cm-1), and Y8a (1617 cm-1) bands than those in spectrum b, implying that the Raman intensity of some Tyr residues is more reduced in the CO than O2 form. Furthermore, the difference spectrum d (NO - ligand-free) in Fig. 3 yields negative features for the Trp and Tyr bands similar to those observed upon O2 binding (spectrum b). However, the features for the W3 and Y8a modes appear different between NO and O2. For instance, the W3 feature is stronger than Y8a in spectrum b, but it is reversed in spectrum d. Thus, the UVRR difference spectra indicate that the Raman bands of Trp and Tyr residues change in different ways upon binding of different ligand species (O2, CO, or NO). This suggests that the protein structural changes, including those of Trp132 and some Tyr residues, are specific to a ligand species. Spectral Changes of Tyr Residues Induced by O2 Binding—The 229-nm excited UVRR spectra of Tyr mutants are shown in Fig. 4, where the raw spectra of the O2 form of Y133F (spectrum a) and of Y70F (spectrum b) of full-length HemAT-Bs are displayed, whereas the difference spectra, O2 - ligand-free, are also represented for Y133F (spectrum c) and Y70F (spectrum d). The Trp and Tyr Raman bands in spectra a and b are located at frequencies similar to those of WT (Fig. 3, spectrum a). As shown in Fig. 4, spectrum c, the W18, W16, W7, and W3 bands of the Y133F mutant exhibit prominent negative features, implying the intensity decreases of the Trp bands in the O2-bound form are similar between WT (Fig. 3, spectrum b) and Y133F (Fig. 4, spectrum c). However, the intensities of the difference peaks of Y9a and Y8a are weaker for Y133F (Fig. 4, spectrum c) than for WT (Fig. 3, spectrum b). On the other hand, all Tyr negative peaks are abolished by mutation of Tyr70 (Fig. 4, spectrum d). These results are clearly seen in the double difference spectra (spectra e and f in supplemental Fig. S2), demonstrating similarity between the spectra of WT and Y133F and some dissimilarity between the spectra of WT and Y70F with regard to Tyr bands. This would mean that binding of O2 to heme induces conformational changes of the protein in both the distal (Tyr70) and proximal (Tyr133) sides of heme, but the former is much larger than the latter. Spectral Changes of Tyr Residues Induced by CO Binding—Fig. 5 depicts the raw UVRR spectrum of the CO form of full-length WT excited at 229 nm (spectrum a) and the difference spectra, CO - ligand-free, for WT (spectrum b), Y70F (spectrum c), and Y133F (spectrum d). Spectrum b reveals negative peaks for Y9a, Y7a, Y8b, and Y8a bands, indicating that some Tyr residues undergo spectral changes upon CO binding. These negative peaks in the WT spectrum (spectrum b) became weaker in Y70F (spectrum c) and Y133F spectra (spectrum d), indicating the contribution from both Tyr70 and Tyr133 to the difference spectrum of WT. The contribution from Tyr70 appears larger than that from Tyr133 as shown by the double difference spectra (spectra e and f in supplemental Fig. S3). The larger contribution from Tyr70 than from Tyr133, in addition to the absence of Trp negative peaks, except for the W3 mode, distinguishes between the CO- and O2-bound forms. These results also mean that Tyr70 and Tyr133, in addition to Trp132 in the sensor region, undergo spectral changes upon CO binding that are different from those seen for O2 binding. Effects of Mutations of Thr95 and His86 on the O2-induced Spectral Changes—Yoshimura et al. (23Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Ohta T. Uchida T. Kubo M. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8301-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) proposed that a hydrogen bond is formed between His86 and heme 6-propionate only when O2 is bound to the heme in HemAT-Bs. The formation of this hydrogen bond induces a conformational change of the CE loop and E-helix by which Thr95 is moved to a position suitable to form a hydrogen bond with the heme-bound O2. The conformational changes around the heme upon O2 binding would be propagated to the protein moiety within the sensor domain and afterward to the signaling domain. If this is the case, these hydrogen bonds must control the conformational changes in the protein moiety. To examine this idea, we performed UVRR measurements of H86A and T95A mutants, in which a hydrogen bond between His86 and heme 6-propionate or between Thr95 and heme-bound O2 would be absent, respectively. Fig. 6 displays the raw UVRR spectra of the O2-bound form of T95A (spectrum a) and H86A (spectrum b) and the difference spectra, O2 - ligand-free, for T95A (spectrum c) and H86A (spectrum d). The raw spectra of T95A and H86A are quite similar to those of WT (Fig. 3, spectrum a), implying that mutations of Thr95 and His86 incorporate no significant effect on the Raman frequencies of Trp and Tyr residues. The difference spectrum of T95A (Fig. 6, spectrum c) is different from that of WT (Fig. 3, spectrum b) regarding the negative features at W18, W17, W16, W7, W3, and Y8a; the difference peak intensities are much weaker in the T95A spectrum than in WT (see also suppleme"

In the present study, we identified Drosophila proteoglycan galactosyltransferase II (dβ3GalTII), determined its substrate specificity, and performed its functional analysis by using RNA interference (RNAi) mutant flies. The enzyme transferred a galactose to Galβ1,4Xyl-pMph, confirming that it is the Drosophila ortholog of human proteoglycan galactosyltransferase II. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that dβ3GalTII is expressed in various tissues and throughout development. The dβ3GalTII RNAi mutant flies showed decreased amounts of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. A genetic interaction of dβ3GalTII with Drosophila β1,4-galactoslyltransferase 7 (dβ4GalT7) or with six genes that encode enzymes contributing to the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans indicated that dβ3GalTII is involved in heparan sulfate synthesis for wing and eye development. Moreover, dβ3GalTII knock-down caused a decrease in extracellular Wingless in the wing imaginal disc of the third instar larvae.

J. 2004; 21: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and applied this system to two types of glycosyltransferases, namely, dβ4GalT7 and Drosophila protein O-mannosyltransferases, and two transporters, that is, the Drosophila PAPS-transporters slalom (sll) and dPAPST2 (34Takemae H.

We then generated inducible dβ3GalTII RNAi flies by using the GAL4-UAS system and subsequently performed the functional analysis. Materials—UDP-Gal, p-nitrophenyl-α-xylopyranoside (Xylα-pNph), Xylβ-pNph, p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-1-thio-β-glucosaminide (GlcNAcβ-S-pNph), p-nitrophenyl-α-glucopyranoside (Glcα-pNph), Glcβ-pNph, p-nitrophenyl-α-galactopyranoside (Galα-pNph), Galβ-pNph, p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-α-galactosaminide (GalNAcα-pNph), and GalNAcβ-pNph were purchased from Sigma; GlcNAcα-pNph and GlcNAcβ-pNph were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); Galβ1–4Xylβ1-p-methoxyphenyl (Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph) was provided by Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan); and uridine diphosphate-[14C]galactose (UDP-[14C]Gal) (325 mCi/mmol) was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Vector Construction, Expression, and Purification of dβ3GalTII Proteins—The putative catalytic domain of candidate dβ3GalTII (amino acids 39 to 382) (AAF59065, CG8734) (22Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R.

A DNA fragment (∼1.0 kb) was amplified by two-step PCR. The first PCR used the above mentioned cloned dβ3GalTII cDNA as a template, the forward primer 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGCAGAATCCCCCACCTGGA-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTACGCTACTAAGCTGTCGCA-3′. The second PCR used the first PCR product as a template, the forward primer 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′. The amplified fragment was recombined with the pDONR™201 vector (Invitrogen). The insert was then transferred between the attR1 and attR2 sites of pVL1393-FLAG (34Takemae H. Ueda R. Okubo R. Nakato H. Izumi S. Saigo K. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to yield pVL1393-FLAG-dβ3GalTII. pVL1393-FLAG-dβ3GalTII was co-transfected with Baculo-Gold™ viral DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) into Sf21 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were incubated for 3 days at 27 °C to produce recombinant viruses. The Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 72 h to yield conditioned media containing recombinant dβ3GalTII proteins fused with the FLAG peptide. An 8-ml aliquot of the culture medium was mixed with 100 μl of Anti-FLAG M1 Affinity gel (Sigma). The protein/gel mixture was washed twice with 50 mm TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and eluted with 100 μlof 100 μg/ml FLAG Peptide in 10 mm TBS (Sigma). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the concentration of the purified enzyme, the enzyme purified above was subjected to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis. The separated protein was transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was probed with the anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and stained with Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of a positive band obtained using Western blotting was measured by a densitometer to determine the amount of the purified enzyme, using the FLAG-BAP control protein (Sigma). For the Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody 3G10, the protein extract (see the subsection “sample preparation”) was subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated protein was transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with TBST. The blocked membrane was treated with 20 milliunits of heparitinase I (Seikagaku) for 1 h at 37°C and washed with TBST. After heparitinase treatment, the membrane was first probed with the monoclonal antibody 3G10 (1:2000, Seikagaku) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20000, GE Healthcare). The blots were visualized with the ECL plus Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assay for Galactosyltransferase Activity—To determine the galactosyltransferase activity, Xylα-pNph, Xylβ-pNph, Glc-NAcα-pNph, GlcNAcβ-pNph, GlcNAcβ-S-pNph, Glcα-pNph, Glcβ-pNph, Galα-pNph, Galβ-pNph, GalNAcα-pNph, GalNAcβ-pNph, and Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph were used as the acceptor substrates. Using 10 nmol of each acceptor, the β1,3GalT was performed at 25 °C for 2 h in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 14 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 11 mm MnCl2, 1 mm UDP-[14 C]Gal (325 mCi/mmol), 250 μm UDP-Gal, and 0.57 pmol of purified dβ1,3GalTII. The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 μlof ice-cold water. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the supernatant was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 column (Millipore) equilibrated with water. The unreacted UDP-Gal was washed out with water, and the products were eluted with methanol. The eluates were dried with an N2 evaporator and dissolved in 30 μl of methanol. Subsequently, 10 μl of the product was applied to an high pressure thin layer chromatography plate (MERCK, Germany) and developed in a chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10) mixture. The bands of the reaction products incorporating radioactivity were detected with a BAS2000 Imaging Analyzer system (FujiFilm Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Fly Stocks—All stocks were raised at room temperature (23 to 25 °C), using a standard medium. A9-GAL4, MS096-GAL4, hedgehog (hh)-GAL4, engrailed (en)-GAL4, scalloped (sd)-GAL4, patched (ptc)-GAL4, apterous (ap)-GAL4, and Actin5C (Act5C)-GAL4 were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, and GMR-GAL4 was obtained from Dr. M. Yamaguchi (Kyoto Institute of Technology). The descriptions of these GAL4 lines are referred to as FlyBase. All fly lines except for the wild type have w (white) background mutations (hereafter, we have not described w in the genotype). Sample Preparation for Western Blotting by the Monoclonal Antibody 3G10—Twenty to 30 third instar larvae were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/mg each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. The extract was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the debris. The concentration of protein was assayed by the Bradford method. dβ3GalTII, dβ4GalT7, ttv, sotv, dOXT, dHs3st-B, dHS6ST, and papss RNAi Flies—RNAi fly lines were obtained as described in previous reports (34Takemae H.

The cDNA fragments of dβ3GalTII (nucleotide positions 26–549 of the coding sequence), dβ4GalT7 (nucleotide positions 1–506 and 14–495 of the coding sequence for the N2 and R2 lines, respectively), ttv (nucleotide positions 25–524 of the coding sequence), sotv (nucleotide positions 21–521 of the coding sequence), dOXT (nucleotide positions 1052–1551 of the coding sequence of NM_139448), dHs3st-B (nucleotide positions 568–1067 of the coding sequence), dHS6ST (nucleotide positions 1–499 of the coding sequence), and papss (nucleotide positions 139–638 of the coding sequence of NM_168824) were amplified by PCR, using a cDNA library derived from D. melanogaster or each expression sequence tag clone. Each PCR fragment was inserted as an inverted repeat (IR) sequence into the pSC1 vector. The IR-containing fragments were then subcloned into the transformation vector pUAST, and these vectors were introduced into Drosophila embryos of the w1118 mutant stock that were used as hosts to construct UAS-IR fly lines according to the procedure reported by Spradling (42Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Each line was mated with the appropriate driver fly lines, and the F1 progeny were raised at 28 °C to observe the phenotypes. Quantitative Analysis of the dβ3GaTII, sotv, dOXT, dHs3st-B, or dHS6ST Transcripts in Knockdown Flies by Realtime PCR—To measure the knockdown efficiency, we cross Act5C-GAL4 flies with UAS-IR flies of each gene. Total RNA was extracted from the third instar larvae of each F1 progeny by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript II first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using qPCR Mastermix QuickGoldStar (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The gene-specific primer pairs and TaqMan probes that were used for each gene are as follows. For the quantification of dβ3GalTII, the forward primer 5′-GGCACGATCCCAGATTCG-3′, the reverse primer 5′-GTGCAGCACCATGTGATAGGA-3′, and the probe 5′-CACCTCCTACGCACCGCGCA-3′ were used. For the quantification of sotv, the forward primer 5′-GCCTGACCTATGGGCTACTAGTCA-3′, the reverse primer 5′-GCTGCTGGAGAGATCCCAAAGCA-3′, and the probe 5′-ACCCGCGCAGAGCGCCA-3′ were used. For the quantification of dOXT, the forward primer 5′-GCGGATTCTATGCCATGAAC-3′, the reverse primer 5′-GGTGGCCGCCAGTTGA-3′, and the probe 5′-ATACGAGACCGGAATAGCCAAGTTCACCG-3′ were used. For the quantification of dHs3st-B, the forward primer 5′-GCTTCAATGCCTGCCTCCT-3′, the reverse primer 5′-GCCAGTAGATTGCGTAAGTTGCT-3′, and the probe 5′-CCAGCATCAGTCGCAGTCTGCAGC-3′ were used. For the quantification of dβ3GalTII, the forward primer 5′-GGAATTCAACTGGGACAGCAA-3′, the reverse primer 5′-GGTAATATTTGGTTTCGAGTTCAATG-3′, and the probe 5′-TGGAGGATGGGCTCAGCACGG-3′ were used. For the quantification of the ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32), the forward primer 5′-GCAAGCCCAAGGGTATCGA-3′, the reverse primer 5′-CGATGTTGGGCATCAGATACTG-3′, and the probe 5′-AACAGAGTGCGTCGCCGCTTCA-3′ were used. The probes were labeled with a reporter dye FAM and quencher dye TAMRA at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Relative amounts of the dβ3GalTII, sotv, dOXT, dHs3st-B, or dHS6ST transcripts were normalized to those of the RpL32 transcripts in the same cDNA. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Adult flies were separated in new food vials and allowed to age for several days. The preparation was subjected to triethylamine anesthesia prior to mounting on stubs covered with carbon tapes and viewed under a JEOL 5600LL scanning electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) under low vacuum (30 Pa) conditions. Histochemistry—Third instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Wing imaginal discs were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0) for 15 min and rinsed three times with PBT (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100). After blocking with 10% goat serum in PBT, the samples were stained with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were used in the following dilutions: mouse anti-Wg antibody 4D4 at 1:1000 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); rabbit anti-pMad (PS1) at 1:2000 (43Persson U. Izumi H.

Development. 2004; 131: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Statistical Analysis—t test were used for analysis of the data of Western blotting. Tukey tests were used for analysis of the eye data. All statistical analysis was performed using the public domain R program. Characterization of the Galactosyltransferase Activity of dβ3GalTII—We prepared recombinant candidate dβ3GalTII (CG8734), which has been reported to be the Drosophila homolog of SQV-2 (24Bulik D.A.

Olson S.K. Esko J.D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), to identify proteoglycan galactosyltransferase II activity. The soluble form was prepared by replacing the N-terminal region, including the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (amino acids 1 to 38) with an Igκ signal sequence and FLAG peptide sequence. The secreted enzyme was purified using the anti-FLAG M1 gel and quantitated by Western blotting analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody. The purified enzyme was used for galactosyltransferase assay with various acceptor substrates (Table 1). dβ3GalTII showed stronger activity toward Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph than Galβ-pNph, only slight activity toward -α-Gal, and no activity toward -β-Xyl, -β-GlcNAc, -β-Glc, and -β-GalNAc. These results demonstrated that dβ3GalTII was the Drosophila ortholog of hβ3GalTII in view of their activities.TABLE 1Acceptor substrate specificity of purified recombinant dβ3GalTIIAcceptor substrateEnzyme activitynmol/nmol·protein/minXylα—pNphNDaND, not detected.Xylβ—pNphNDGlcNAcα—pNphNDGlcNAcβ—pNphNDGlcNAcβ-S-pNphNDGlcα—pNphNDGlcβ—pNphNDGalα—pNph0.42Galβ—pNph1.4Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph5.5GalNAcα—pNphNDGalNAcβ—pNphNDa ND, not detected.

However, it was not investigated how this important oncogene is regulated. We show that MSP promotes invasion of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 but not MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western analysis indicated the expression of RON message and protein, respectively, in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. RON expression correlated with Sp1 expression. Initial analysis of a 1.2-kb and 400-bp RON promoter in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells suggested the presence of all the necessary regulatory elements within 400 bp from the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 400-bp RON promoter revealed that the overlapping Sp1 sites at–94 (Sp1-3/4) and Sp1 site at –113 (Sp1-5) are essential for RON gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Sp1 binding to these sites is required for RON promoter activity. Ectopic Sp1 expression in Sp1 null SL2 cells confirmed the involvement of these Sp1 sites in the regulation of oncogenic RON tyrosine kinase. Treatment of MDA MB 231 cells with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding, or siRNA knock-down of Sp1 blocked RON gene expression and MSP-mediated invasion of MDA MB 231 cells.

Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) 2The abbreviations used are:MSPmacrophage-stimulating proteinRTreverse transcriptionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayILinterleukinsiRNAsmall interfering RNARONrecepteur d'origine nantais.2The abbreviations used are:MSPmacrophage-stimulating proteinRTreverse transcriptionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayILinterleukinsiRNAsmall interfering RNARONrecepteur d'origine nantais. is the only known ligand for RON (recepteur d'origine nantais). MSP is an 80 kDa heterodimer consisting of a 53 kDa α chain and a 30-kDa β chain linked by a disulfide bond. The β chain of MSP binds to RON. MSP belongs to the plasminogen-prothrombin gene family (1Wang M.H. Yao H.P. Zhou Y.Q. Acta Pharmacologica Sinica. 2006; 27: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Camp E.R. Liu W. Fan F. Yang A. Somcio R. Ellis L.M. Ann. Surgical Oncol. 2005; 12: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). MSP gene knock-out in mice is not lethal, indicating that MSP is not required for embryonic development and growth (3Bezerra J.A. Carrick T.L. Degen J.L. Witte D. Degen F.S.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Besides macrophages, MSP is expressed in a variety of epithelial cells. RON is initially synthesized as a single chain precursor, 170-kDa pro-RON, which is subsequently cleaved into 40-kDa α chain and 150-kDa β chain. The α chain is completely extracellular, whereas the β chain traverses the cell membrane and contains the intracellular tyrosine kinase (1Wang M.H. Yao H.P. Zhou Y.Q. Acta Pharmacologica Sinica. 2006; 27: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal of RON regulates its kinase activity (4Yokoyama N. Ischenko I. Hayman M.J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8893-8900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RON forms either homodimers or heterodimers with other receptors such as c-Met and epidermal growth factor receptor (5Maggiora P. Lorenzato A. Fracchioli S. Costa B. Castagnaro M. Arisio R.

In addition to macrophages, RON is also expressed in multiple epithelial cells both malignant and nonmalignant. Homozygous deletion of RON was embryonically lethal. However, RON heterozygous mice mature normally except for an inappropriate inflammatory response (8Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D.P. Degen J.L. Friezner Degen S.J. J. Clin.

Investig. 2001; 108: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The RON protein is regulated through c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase binding to phosphorylated RON leading to endocytosis and the subsequent degradation of RON (10Penengo L. Rubin C. Yarden Y. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Abnormal expression of RON was reported in various cancers of epithelial origin. However, fibroblasts do not express RON. RON is moderately expressed in normal colorectal mucosa but significantly elevated in a majority of primary human colorectal adenocarcinoma samples (11Zhou Y.Q. He C. Chen Y.Q. Wang D. Wang M.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). RON protein accumulation was reported to induce autophosphorylation of RON tyrosine kinase receptor and transduces signals that regulate tumorigenic activities of colon cancer cells (12Chen Y.Q. Zhou Y.Q. Angeloni D. Kurtz A.L. Quiang X.Z. Wang M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, RON overexpression was reported in a majority of the cell lines examined. In addition, these cell lines expressed high levels of MSP ligand (13Willett C.G. Wang M.H. Emanuel R. Graham S.A. Smith D.I. Shridhar V. Sugarbaker D.J. Sunday M.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The combination of RON overexpression and activation by MSP leads to increased invasion and resistance to apoptosis. These tumors supported by either autocrine or paracrine effects may acquire a survival advantage because of increased activation of the RON receptor by the local secretion of MSP.Altered RON expression was noticed in bladder and ovarian cancers. RON expression was positively associated with tumor size, stage, and grade in bladder carcinomas (14Cheng H.L. Liu H.S. Lin Y.J. Chen H.H. Hsu P.Y. Chang T.Y. Ho C.L. Tzai T.S. Chow N.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The majority of ovarian carcinoma samples showed up-regulation in RON expression with a mix of cytoplasmic and membrane staining (5Maggiora P. Lorenzato A. Fracchioli S. Costa B. Castagnaro M. Arisio R. Katasaros D. Massobrio M. Comoglio P.M. Flavio Di Renzo M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Co-expression of MSP with RON was observed in ovarian carcinomas, providing a selective growth advantage and subsequent tumor progression. RON overexpression and not mutations is associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (15Lin H.S. Berry G.J. Fee Jr., W.E. Terris D.J. Sun Z. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2004; 130: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Normal breast cells and benign lesions (adenomas and papillomas) express relatively low levels of RON. However, RON is highly expressed in tumor specimens (1Wang M.H. Yao H.P. Zhou Y.Q. Acta Pharmacologica Sinica. 2006; 27: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further, increased RON expression correlated to phosphorylation status and invasive activity. RON expression was an independent predictor of distant relapse in node negative breast cancer (16Lee W.Y.

Altered RON expression in cancer cells also involved generation of RON variants through mRNA splicing, alternative initiation, and protein truncation (11Zhou Y.Q. He C. Chen Y.Q. Wang D. Wang M.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Wang M.H. Kurtz A.L. Chen Y.Q. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the six RON variants reported, the 55-kDa short form of RON generated through alternative initiation appears to contribute to tumor progression through modulation of E-cadherin expression (18Bardella C. Costa B. Maggiora P. Patane S. Olivero M. Renzani G.N. De Bortoli M. Comoglio P.M. De Renzo M.F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5154-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The RON splicing variants are generated through a complex mechanism that is critical to post-transcriptional regulation of RON expression and activation.The promoter for RON gene was partially characterized (19Del Gatto F. Gilbert E. Ronsin C. Beathnach R. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1995; 1263: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Like many tyrosine kinase receptor gene promoters, RON promoter also lacks a distinct TATA box or CCAAT sequences. However, it contains several GC boxes and consensus sequences for seven Sp1-binding sites as well as four retinoblastoma control elements. RON promoter also contains three IL-6 response and two AP-2 elements. Hence, the RON gene promoter contains several important and interesting regulatory elements. The results presented in this manuscript show that MSP stimulates the invasion of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells, which is correlated to the expression of MSP receptor, RON tyrosine kinase. However, it was not clearly defined how this important oncogene is regulated. It was previously suggested that multiple regulatory elements are needed for full RON promoter activity and gene expression. We now demonstrate that all other regulatory elements are dispensable except the overlapping Sp1 sites at –94 bp and another Sp1 site at –113 bp for RON promoter activity and RON gene expression in breast cancer cells. The requirement of these specific Sp1 sites for RON promoter activity was also confirmed in Sp1 null SL2 cells, where ectopic Sp1 expression stimulated the activity of the wild type RON promoter severalfold in comparison with these specific mutants. In addition, treatment of MDA MB 231 cells with mithramycin A, which inhibits Sp1 binding to target promoters or siRNA-mediated Sp1 knock-down, blocked RON gene expression and MSP-induced invasion of MDA MB 231 cells. Consequently, the results presented in this manuscript demonstrate a correlation between Sp1 and RON tyrosine kinase expression and RON kinase-associated invasion of carcinoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Breast cancer cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), amino acids, antibiotics, pyruvate, and vitamins (Invitrogen). All of the cell lines were cultured in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Drosophila Schneider cells (SL2) were obtained from Dr. Linda De Graffenreid. SL2 cells were grown at 28 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen).Invasion Assay—The invasive behavior of breast cancer cells was analyzed in a trans-well Boyden chamber (Costar, Bethesda, MD) using a polycarbonate filter (8-μm pores) and a 0.1% gelatin matrix in the upper chamber. Briefly, 3 × 104 cells/well were plated in Matrigel invasion upper chambers in 0.3 ml of serum-free medium. The lower chambers contained 0.7 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum medium. The cells were treated with 1 or 2.5 ng of MSP. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C the cells on the top surface of the chamber were gently removed with cotton swabs. The migrant cells on the undersurface of the membrane were fixed in 70% methanol and stained with crystal violet. Images of migrant cells were captured by a photomicroscope (Nikon Eclipse-TE 2000-U, Japan). To assess the effect of mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding MDA MB 231 cells were treated with 300 nm mithramycin A for 24 h, trypsinized, and plated for Matrigel invasion assay. To determine the effect of siRNA Sp1 knock-down on MSP mediated invasion, MDA MB 231 cells were transfected with 100 nm scrambled siRNA or Sp1 siRNA. 48 h following siRNA transfection cells were trypsinized and plated for Matrigel invasion assay.Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of cell lysates from MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western analysis was performed as described previously (20Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32620-32625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human RON, Sp1, and actin polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To analyze the effect of mithramycin A MDA MB 231 cells were treated for 24 h with varying concentrations of mithramycin A (100, 200, and 300 nm) prior to Western analysis. To determine the effect of siRNA Sp1 knock-down on RON expression, MDA MB 231 cells were transfected with 100 nm scrambled or Sp1 siRNA, and Western analysis was performed 48 h following transfection. To verify whether similar levels of Sp1 were expressed in the ectopic Sp1-transfected SL2 cells, Western analysis using Sp1 and actin antibodies was performed on the total cell lysates from control pGl3, wild type, and mutant RON promoter-luciferase construct-transfected SL2 cells.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR analysis was then performed to determine RON expression using the cDNA as templates. Primers for actin were used as a control to determine the RON expression levels. RT-PCR analysis allows a rough estimate of the differences in RON expression in the cell lines tested. A total of 30 cycles of amplification was performed. For the studies involving mithramycin A MDA MB 231 cells were treated for 24 h with varying concentrations of mithramycin A (100, 200, and 300 nm) before RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis. Primers for RON generate a 246-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-AGC CCA CGC TCA GTG TCT AT-3′; and antisense primers, 5′-GGG CAC TAG GAT CAT CTG TCA-3′. Primers for actin generate a 621-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG-3′; and antisense primers, 5′-AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT-3′.Construction of 1.2-kb and 400-bp Wild Type/Mutant RON Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Constructs—The 1.2-kb RON promoter-CAT reporter vector was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Breathnach. This 1.2-kb RON promoter region was subcloned into pGL3 basic luciferase reporter plasmid. The 400-bp RON promoter fragment was generated by digesting the 1.2-kb RON promoter with Kpn1 and Sac1 enzymes. The gene cleaned fragment was then amplified by PCR using primers with an integrated Kpn1 and Sac1 sites and inserted into pGL3 basic vector. The Sp1 site-specific mutation constructs of the RON promoter were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) based on the 400-bp RON promoter-luciferase reporter construct as a template. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Luciferase Assay—Breast cancer cells or SL2 insect cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 25 × 104cells/well the day before transfection. The wild type or mutant RON-Luc constructs (1 μg) or control null vector without the RON promoter insert (pGL3) were transiently transfected into MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). To determine the ectopic Sp1 effects on wild type/mutant RON promoter, SL2 cells were transiently transfected with the RON promoter-luciferase reporter constructs along with pPac empty vector or pPac-Sp1 using cellfectin (Invitrogen) as a reagent. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured (Luciferase Assay System; Promega). Control vector values were deducted from pPac-Sp1 and expressed as relative units following normalization to protein levels. To evaluate the effect of ectopic Sp1 on –400-bp RON promoter in Sp1 null MCF-7 cells, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with the RON promoter-luciferase reporter along with cytomegalovirus empty vector or varying concentrations of CMV-Sp1.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The wild type or mutant oligonucleotides corresponding to the specific Sp1 sites on the RON promoter were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP, and EMSAs were performed as described previously (21Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Wherever Sp1 antibody was used, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of Sp1 antibody (anti-rabbit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. To determine the effect of mithramycin A on Sp1 binding to the RON promoter, oligonucleotide probes were preincubated for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of 300 nm mithramycin A before adding to the nuclear extracts.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (20Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32620-32625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RON promoter primers were used to carry out PCR on DNA isolated from chromatin immunoprecipitation using control IgG or Sp1 antibodies. The optimal reaction conditions for PCR were determined for each primer pair. The parameters included denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min and annealing at 64 °C for 1 min followed by elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by 2.5% agarose/ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The following primers were used for PCR to generate a 293-bp fragment covering the Sp1-binding sites on the RON promoter: forward, 5′-CTC CAA GGG CCG GAA GAG TCG GAT GG-3′; and reverse, 5′-TTA AGC AGC GGT CCC GAC AGC CCC AA-3′.RESULTSMSP Promotes Invasion of Breast Cancer Cells—To determine whether MSP stimulates the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells, we have carried out in vitro Matrigel assay using MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells. Matrigel invasion assay is a reliable test to evaluate cancer cell invasiveness. This assay elegantly reflects the actual ability of cancer cells to invade and metastasize in vivo in response to activation of the RON receptor. We treated the cells with 1 or 2.5 ng of MSP, and 24 h later we stained the migrant cells with crystal violet and photographed the cells (Fig. 1a). MSP induced the invasion through Matrigel of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells but not MCF-7 cells.Expression of RON in Invasive Breast Cancer Cells—To determine whether RON expression is the contributing factor for the invasive phenotype of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 but not MCF-7 cells in the presence of MSP, we have determined RON expression levels in these cell lines. We have carried out Western analysis on equal amounts of total cell lysates from MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells using rabbit anti-human RON and actin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1b). RON antibody recognizes 170-kDa pro-RON and intracellular 150-kDa β-chain of mature RON receptor. RON expression was detected in the invasive MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells but not in the MSP-stimulated noninvasive MCF-7 cells. Because it has been well documented that Sp1 transcription factor plays a critical role in the regulation of genes that are devoid of distinct TATA box and are GC rich, we have analyzed Sp1 protein expression levels in these cells. RON expression correlated with Sp1 protein expression levels in these cells. We have carried out RT-PCR analysis to determine whether RON message levels reflect RON protein expression. Total RNA from MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA. We have performed PCR analysis using RON and actin primers (Fig. 1c). RON message was detected in invasive MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells but not in MSP-stimulated noninvasive MCF-7 cells. RT-PCR analysis allows a rough estimate of the differences in RON expression in the cell lines tested. The actin message levels were shown as a control.RON Promoter Activity in the Invasive Breast Cancer Cells—To determine whether the elevated RON expression levels in the invasive breast cancer cells were due to increased RON transcription, we have analyzed RON promoter activities using –1.2-kb full-length and –400-bp deletion construct in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells. The RON promoter construct was described previously (19Del Gatto F. Gilbert E. Ronsin C. Beathnach R. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1995; 1263: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have now cloned this full-length RON promoter as well as –400-bp RON deletion fragment into pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 2a). The RON promoter lacks a distinct TATA box or CCAAT sequences. However, it contains several GC boxes and consensus sequences for seven Sp1-binding sites as well as four retinoblastoma control elements. In addition, RON promoter also contains three IL-6 response elements and two AP-2 elements. Sp1 has been reported to initiate transcription from promoters that are devoid of distinct TATA box. Because six of seven Sp1 sites are located within the –400-bp RON promoter, we have analyzed the activities of –1.2-kb full-length as well as –400-bp RON promoter deletion fragment. Both the –1.2-kb and –400-bp RON promoter constructs showed similar activities in the MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells, suggesting that all of the necessary regulatory elements are present in the –400-bp region of the RON promoter (Fig. 2b). The pGL3 control vector without RON promoter sequences was not active, thus suggesting the contribution of RON promoter elements in the regulation of RON gene expression. Because MCF-7 cells lack Sp1 and RON expression, we have analyzed whether ectopic Sp1 can stimulate RON promoter activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2b). A Sp1 dose-dependent increase in RON promoter activity was observed, suggesting the requirement of Sp1 for RON gene expression.FIGURE 2RON promoter activity in breast cancer cells. a, schematic depicting putative transcription factor-binding sites. b, breast cancer cells are transiently transfected with either pGL3 control vector or –1.2-kb and –400-bp RON promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, and luciferase activity was measured after 48 h following normalization to protein levels. To determine the effect of ectopic Sp1 on RON promoter activity, MCF-7 cells were transfected with varying concentrations of Sp1 cDNA along with –400-bp RON-promoter luciferase reporter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Sp1 Mutations on RON Promoter Activities in Invasive Breast Cancer Cells—The –400-bp RON promoter contains three individual Sp1 sites (Sp1-2 at –34 bp, Sp1-5 at –113 bp, and Sp1-6 at –152 bp), two overlapping Sp1 sites (Sp1-3,4 at –92 bp) upstream of the transcription start site and one Sp1 site downstream of the transcription start site (Sp1-1 at +86 bp) and an AP-2 element (–107 bp). Previous reports established the importance of the Sp1 transcription factor in the initiation of transcription from promoters that are devoid of distinct TATA box. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have generated site-specific Sp1 mutant RON promoter constructs to identify which elements are critical for the regulation of RON promoter activity. Wild type and mutant primer sequences to generate the promoter reporter plasmids were shown in Table 1. We have analyzed the activities of the –400-bp wild type (Fig. 3, second column) and Sp1 site-specific mutant RON promoter constructs in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells (Fig. 3). Mutations at Sp1-2 (–34 bp; fourth column) and Sp1-6 (–152 bp; seventh column) sites did not show significant change in promoter activity. However, mutation at Sp1-5 (–113 bp; sixth column) showed a dramatic reduction in the RON promoter activity followed by mutations at the overlapping Sp1 sites, Sp1-3,4 (–92 bp; fifth column). The triple mutation at Sp1-3,4, and Sp1-5 (–92 bp and –113 bp; eighth column) completely abolished the RON promoter activity with activities comparable with that of the pGL3 control vector without the RON promoter insert (first column). In contrast, mutation at the downstream of transcription start site at Sp1-1 (+86 bp; third column) increased RON promoter activity. Mutation of the AP-2 element with native Sp1-binding sites did not alter RON promoter activity (data not shown). These experiments were repeated several times, and the results are very consistent.TABLE 1Primer sequences used to generate site mutation constructs of the RON promoterSitesPositionsSequencesSp1-1+865′-CACAGGAACCTGGGGCGGGGGTCCGCTATCTCTGGG-3′aWild type primer sequences.5′-CACAGGAACCTGAAACGGGGGTCCGCTATCTCTGGG-3′bMutated primer sequences.Sp1-2-345′-GTACAGCGGCGGCTGGGGCGGCAGGTGAGGCGGCTG-3′aWild type primer sequences.5′-GTACAGCGGCGGCTGAAACGGCAGGTGAGGCGGCTG-3′bMutated primer sequences.Sp1-3,4-925′-CCCGACCCGCCCGCCTCAGCCCGGC-3′aWild type primer sequences.5′-GGGCTGGGCAAACGGAGTCGGGCCG-3′bMutated primer sequences.Sp1-5-1135′-GAGTCGGGCCGTGGGGGCGGGGCCGCGAGGAAGGC-3′aWild type primer sequences.5′-GAGTCGGGCCGTGGGGGCAAAGCCGCGAGGAAGGC-3′bMutated primer sequences.Sp1-6-1525′-GCCCAGGCCCTCCGCCCATCCGACTCTTCCGGCCC-3′aWild type primer sequences.5′-GCCCAGGCCCTCCGAAAATCCGACTCTTCCGGCCC-3′bMutated primer sequences.Sp1-3,4 and Sp1-5-92 and -113Using Sp1-3,4 mutant as the template, Sp1-5 mutation was introduced to generate Sp1-3,4 and 5 mutanta Wild type primer sequences.b Mutated primer sequences.

The Sp1-3,4 as well as Sp1-5 wild type and mutant oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to RON promoters that were used in the gel shift analysis are shown in Table 2. These oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]ATP, and EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 4a). Binding of some minor high mobility complexes and one major low mobility complex was detected to the Sp1-3,4 and Sp1-5 oligonucleotides (lanes 1 and 5). To identify whether the major low mobility complex contained Sp1, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of Sp1 antibody prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The migration of major low mobility complex was shifted by the Sp1 antibody in MDA MB 231 nuclear extracts, confirming that the prote"

They function by modulating the expression of many genes, including those of the gene 200 cluster (4Deschamps S. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Wang H. Lengyel P. Roe B.A. Genomics. 2003; 82: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mice, this cluster consists of at least 10 genes that encode the p200 family proteins. The human counterpart of the cluster consists apparently of four genes (MNDA, IFI16, AIM2, and IFIX) that encode the Hin200 family proteins (5Ludlow L.E. Johnstone R.W. Clarke C.J. Exp.

It functions primarily by binding numerous sequence-specific transcription factors and transcription modulators, including pRb and p53, and inhibiting their activity generally, but not exclusively, by binding them and inhibiting their sequence-specific binding to DNA (8Min W.

Moreover, the expression of p204 in different tissues can be promoted by distinct cytokines, promoters, and tissue-specific transcription factors. Depending on the cell type and stage of differentiation, p204 can be nucleolar, nucleoplasmic, and/or cytoplasmic. In performing its various functions, p204 binds and affects the activities of numerous proteins. These include, among others, UBF, the factor involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis (19Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the pocket proteins (pRb, p107, and p130) (19Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P.

In this complex, p204 acts as a transcriptional coactivator (17Luan Y. Yu X.P. Xu K. Ding B. Yu J. Huang Y. Yang N. Lengyel P. Di Cesare P.E. Liu C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16860-16870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p204 was also reported to be required for the replication of cytomegalovirus (21Rolle S. De Andrea M. Gioia D. Lembo D. Hertel L. Landolfo S. Gariglio M. Virology. 2001; 286: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among 10 adult mouse tissues tested, the level of p204 was highest in cardiac myocytes (12Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the course of differentiation of the myocytes from embryonal stem cells, the bulk of p204 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (12Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B.

These facts prompted us to search for cytoplasmic proteins in the cardiac myocytes to which p204 binds. Here we report that cytoplasmic H and K-Ras proteins (which are encoded by the H- and K-ras genes) were bound by p204 and that p204 inhibited the various activities of these multifunctional proteins. Particular mutants of the ras genes (designated as ras oncogenes) play a causal role in more than a quarter of human cancers (22Shih C. Weinberg R.A.

They are GTP-binding proteins, which, when acted upon by specific factors, cycle between an activated and an inactivated form, RasGTP and RasGDP, respectively (27Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Ras proteins can be localized on the inner cell membrane or in the Golgi or endosomal compartments (28Willumsen B.M.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). They are coupling growth factor receptors to downstream signaling pathways regulating transcription, translation, cell growth, proliferation, cell shape, apoptosis, senescence, and malignant transformation (26Weinberg, R.

There are numerous downstream mediator proteins of Ras signaling. These are designated as Ras effectors. They bind to the effector domain of RasGTP (34Herrmann C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These effectors initiate numerous signaling pathways (35Repasky G.A. Chenette E.J. Der C.J.

Here, we report that p204 bound to H-RasGTP and K-Ras-GTP and inhibited their cleavage by RasGAP and also the binding to H-RasGTP of the effectors Raf, PI3K, and RAL-GDS as well as the activation by phosphorylation of some downstream targets (e.g. MEK, Akt, and p38MAPK). Oncogenic Ras expression triggered the phosphorylation and translocation of p204 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This was blocked by inhibiting PI3K activity. p204 inhibited the anchorage-independent proliferation of cells expressing Ras oncoprotein and also blocked the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the enhancement of cell migration through a membrane by Ras oncoprotein. As described by others, Ras oncoprotein or wild-type Ras-GTP increased the expression of the Egr-1 transcription factor (42McMahon S.B. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that ectopic Ras oncoprotein or wild-type Ras-GTP increased the level of p204, together with that of Egr-1, in consequence of the boost of the transcription of p204 by Egr-1. Moreover, the activation of expression of a single copy of the K-ras oncogene (43Tuveson D.A. Shaw A.T. Willis N.A. Silver D.P. Jackson E.L. Chang S. Mercer K.L. Grochow R. Hock H. Crowley D.

Thus, p204 might also serve as a negative feedback inhibitor of Ras activity. pBI-H-RasG12V and pBI-p204 were generated by inserting the appropriate H-RasG12V PCR product or 204 PCR product into the PstI/SalI sites or MuII/NheI sites, respectively, of the pBI plasmid (BD Clontech). The ecdysone-inducible plasmid pIND204 was constructed as described (19Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). pCGN-H-RasQ61L (44Shao H.

The pGL-Egr-1 reporter construct was generated by inserting a PCR product extending from nucleotide -6927 to -6474 in the Ifi204 gene 5′-flanking region from the BAC225 clone (4Deschamps S. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Wang H. Lengyel P. Roe B.A. Genomics. 2003; 82: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) between the KpnI and BglII sites of the pGL vector (Promega).

This plasmid encoded a mutant p204 in which Ser at position 179 was replaced by Ala. A plasmid encoding the MBP-p204 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3)pLysS codon plus (kindly provided by D. Soll). MBP-p204 was purified using amylose beads (New England Biolabs). Its purity was verified by 4-20% PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining according to the New England Biolabs manual.

A stable cell line with a low level of constitutive H-Ras expression was generated by transfection of the pIRESpuro3-H-RasQ61L plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 into an AKR-2B line in which p204 was inducible by ecdysone or ponasterone A (19Liu C.J.

Lysate aliquots with 500 μg of total protein per 0.5 ml were incubated with protein G beads with conjugated anti-H-Ras (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-p204 antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed and boiled in SDS loading buffer, and the eluate was subjected to 4-20% SDS-PAGE for Western blotting, using antibodies against H-Ras, K-Ras, or p204. Similar procedures were used in the coimmunoprecipitation experiments in Fig. 2, C and D, which involved different cell lines from that used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2B. Cells of the MEF3T3-Tet-off-p204 line were plated in 20 10-cm dishes and, for inducing p204, were incubated first with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Then the doxycycline was removed, and the cultures were incubated for a further 48 h. The cultures were lysed in MLB lysis buffer, and aliquots from the lysate were incubated with GTPγS or GDP at 30 °C for 30 min. Ras protein was pulled down, using protein A beads conjugated with anti-p204 and, as a positive control, beads to which GST-Raf-1 RBD was conjugated. For Fig. 3, pcDNA3-204 or pcDNA3-204 segment expression plasmids were generated by inserting 204 cDNA or its various segments (prepared by PCR) between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector. The plasmids were expressed in a reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 10-μl aliquots from each 35S-labeled segment were added to 0.5-ml aliquots containing 500 μg of protein from a lysate of cultured HEK293 cells that had been transfected with the expression plasmid pCGN-HA-H-RasQ61L and preincubated with GTPγS. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The labeled p204 or its various segments bound to HA-H-RasQ61L-GTPγS were pulled down with protein G/A beads loaded with anti-HA antibodies and assayed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Fig. 4, the effects of MBP-p204, and, as a control, MBP, on RasGAP activity were assayed in vitro, using the RasGAP assay (50Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S.

Purified GST-H-Ras, His-RasGAP, MBP-p204, and MBP were used (see Fig. S2).

Raf-1—MBP and MBP-p204 fusion protein were purified using amylose beads (New England Biolabs) and were quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay (see Fig. S2). NIH3T3 cells were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% FCS for 48 h, and, if so indicated, the level of RasGTP was increased in them by adding 100 ng/ml EGF to the medium for the last 10 min. MBP-p204, MBP, or neither was incubated with GST-Raf-1 RBD (Upstate Biotechnology) immobilized on agarose beads at 4 °C for 30 min and then added to the lysates of the NIH3T3 cells and further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed and eluted with boiling SDS loading buffer, and the H-Ras eluted was assayed by Western blotting, following the Upstate Biotechnology protocol. PI3K—HEK293 cells were transfected with pIRES-H-RasQ61L or with pcDNA3P110α-HA and pCMV6-P85α-FLAG, using Lipofectamine 2000, and incubated in DMEM, 10% FCS medium in 10% CO2 for 48 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in MLB buffer. Total protein levels were assayed and adjusted to 500 μg of protein/0.5 ml of lysate. If so indicated, 400 nmol of MBP or 400 of nmol MBP-204 were incubated with 0.5 ml of lysate of cells expressing H-RasQ61L at 4 °C for 30 min and were then supplemented with 0.5 ml of a lysate from cells expressing P110α-HA and P85α-FLAG and incubated with protein G beads loaded with anti-HA antibodies or mouse IgG control at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed and eluted with boiling SDS loading buffer. 30-μl samples were analyzed by Western blotting, using anti-H-Ras antibodies. RalGDS—A culture of HEK293 cells was infected with retrovirus-packaged pBabepro-Myc-RalGDS. A second culture of HEK293 cells was transfected with pCGN-HA-H-RasQ61L. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared. The lysate from the culture transfected with pCGN-HA-H-RasQ61L was incubated, as indicated, without or with MBP or MBP204.

https://openalex.org/W2035328904,"Cancer cells contain an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy), which is a prevalent form of genetic instability in human cancers. Abnormal amplification of centrosomes and defects of spindle assembly checkpoint are the major causes of chromosome instability in cancer cells. Here we present biochemical evidence to suggest a role of ECRG2, a novel tumor suppressor gene, in maintaining chromosome stability. ECRG2 localized to centrosomes during interphase and kinetochores during mitosis. Further analysis revealed that ECRG2 participates in centrosome amplification in a p53-dependent manner. Depletion of ECRG2 not only destabilized p53, down-regulated p21, and increased the cyclin E/CDK2 activity, thus initiating centrosome amplification, but also abolished the ability of p53 localize to centrosomes. Overexpression of ECRG2 restored the p53-dependent suppression of centrosome duplication. Furthermore, ECRG2-depleted cells show severely disrupted spindle phenotype but fail to maintain the mitotic arrest due to minimal BUBR1 protein levels. Taken together, our results indicate that ECRG2 is important for ensuring centrosome duplication, spindle assembly checkpoint, and accurate chromosome segregation, and its depletion may contribute to chromosome instability and aneuploidy in human cancers.

A critical component of normal cell division is the accurate distribution of chromosomes and other cellular components during mitosis (1Chi Y.H. Jeang K.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Abnormal cell division and chromosome content are hallmarks of cancer (2Jefford C.E. Irminger-Finger I. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 59: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanisms, by which cells acquire chromosome changes, have not been fully identified, but alterations of centrosomes, the mitotic spindle apparatus, and the spindle assembly checkpoint appear to play important roles (3Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In normal cell division, centrosomes undergo one round of duplication in a manner analogous to the replication of chromosomal DNA during S phase (4Srsen V. Merdes A.

During mitosis, centrosomes direct the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles that ensure equal segregation of chromosomes between daughter cells (5Bettencourt-Dias M. Glover D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Therefore, at any given time point, a homeostasis of centrosomes must be maintained (6Winey M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R449-R452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of more than two centrosomes increases the frequency of mitotic defect and unbalanced chromosome segregation (7Mattison C.P. Winey M. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2006; 42: 111-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Indeed, centrosome amplification is frequently observed in cancer cells (8Koutsami M.K. Tsantoulis P.K. Kouloukoussa M.

The spindle assembly checkpoint delays anaphase onset when any kinetochores in the cell is not properly bound with the spindle microtubules or when kinetochores are not under tension normally produced by bipolar attachment (19Reddy S.K.

Mutations in any of these genes or changes of protein kinase activity result in failure to arrest the cell cycle at G2/M, and cells exit mitosis prematurely (27Schmidt M. Budirahardja Y. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of the mitotic checkpoint machinery may cause aneuploidy. Despite extensive studies on the order of kinetochore association of the checkpoint proteins, not much is known about the regulation and function of each checkpoint protein at kinetochores. Here we report that ECRG2 depletion triggered accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes, abnormalities of the mitotic spindle, and marked chromosome changes. This was associated with disregulated of checkpoint genes p53 and p21 as well as cyclin E/CDK2. Furthermore, ECRG2-depleted cells exit from mitotic arrest in the presence of spindle damage due to low levels of BUBR1. Together our data suggest that ECRG2 contributes to chromosome stability via regulating centrosome amplification and spindle assembly checkpoint. spindle assembly checkpoint ECRG2 knockdown cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2 siRNA ECRG2 knockdown cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA ECRG2 Tet-on inducible cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA small interfering RNA untranslated region bovine serum albumin green fluorescent protein 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. spindle assembly checkpoint ECRG2 knockdown cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2 siRNA ECRG2 knockdown cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA ECRG2 Tet-on inducible cells infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA small interfering RNA untranslated region bovine serum albumin green fluorescent protein 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Generation of ECRG2 Antibody—We generated anti-ECRG2 monoclonal antibodies by using the C-terminal of ECRG2 peptide (KSNGRVQFLHDGSC) as immunogen (28Huang G. Wang D. Guo L. Zhao N. Li Y. Lu S.H. Hybridoma. 2005; 24: 86-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 217-258 encoding portions of human ECRG2 were amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), then cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) as BamHI/NotI restriction fragments. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C then purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-ECRG2 monoclonal antibody was generated following procedures described previously (28Huang G. Wang D. Guo L. Zhao N. Li Y. Lu S.H. Hybridoma. 2005; 24: 86-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were immunized with glutathione S-transferase-ECRG2. Splenocytes from mice with positive immune responses were isolated, fused with myeloma cells, and the resulting hybridomas screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reactivity against recombinant ECRG2. One positive hybridoma, 4E8, was expanded and used for all subsequent experiments. siRNA Constructs—The human ECRG2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids were created by inserting two sets of siRNA oligonucleotides (5′-AAAGTAATGGAAGAGTTCAGTTT-3′ and 5′-AATGATATTCTCATCATCATCTT-3′, targeting open reading frames and 3′-UTR of ECRG2 mRNA, respectively) into the pSUPER.Retro.puro vectors (Oligoengine), generating the pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2 siRNA and pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA plasmids using BglII and HindIII restriction enzyme sites, respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Generation of Retrovirus—The packaging cell line GP2-293T (Clontech) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm minimal essential medium and sodium pyruvate. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 15 μg of pSUPER.Retro.Puro-ECRG2 siRNA, pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA plasmid, or pSUPER.Retro.puro vector. The medium was replaced 12 h post-transfection. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Infection of Target Cells and Establishment of Stable Knockdown Cells (ECRG2KD and ECRG23′UTR-KD)—HCT 116 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm minimal essential medium, and sodium pyruvate. The p53-null HCT 116 and p21-null HCT 116 cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute). The stable ECRG2 knockdown cells were generated by infection of the HCT 116 or p53/p21-null cells with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2 siRNA (ECRG2KD), pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA (ECRG23′UTR-KD), or the empty pSUPER.Retro. puro retrovirus. Briefly, the day before infection, 1 × 105 cells were plated in a 60-mm dish. The next day, virus supernatant was added with Polybrene (5 μg/ml final concentration), and the cells were incubated overnight. The next day, the medium was replaced and the incubation continued until analysis. Colonies showing resistance to puromycin (5 μg/ml) were clonally isolated, and immunoblotting assay was used to screen for the suppression of ECRG2 expression. Generation of Inducible ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on Cell Clones—We used a doxcycline-inducible expression system to obtain conditional expression of the ECRG2 in HCT 116 cells as described previously. Briefly, we subcloned ECRG2 cDNA into pTRE-2hyg vector. This construct was transfected into HCT 116 cells stably expressing the reverse tetracycline transactivation using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and clones were selected based on absence of expression under basal conditions and strong induction by doxcycline. The positive clones were then infected with pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR siRNA retrovirus to knockdown endogenous ECRG2 protein (ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on) as described above. Pulse-Chase Experiment—ECRG2 plasmid was transiently transfected into HCT 116 cells and incubated with methionine-free medium for 4 h. The cells were then pulse-labeled with fresh medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per ml for 5 min and chased for 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. After each chase period the supernatants were harvested and the cells were lysed. Both the supernatants and cell lysates were incubated with antibodies against ECRG2 or normal IgG (control) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed extensively with immunoprecipitation buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Mitotic Spread—Exponentially growing ECRG2KD or control cells were treated with colcemid (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for 2 h. Mitotic cells were collected and resuspended in 75 mm KCl and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Cells then were fixed in methanol:acetic acid (3:1) three times for a total of 30 min. Fixed cells were dropped on a glass slide and mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Immunofluorescence—HCT 116 vector control or ECRG2KD cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked in 2% BSA. Alternatively, cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using 1% CHAPS in PHEM buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm Na3VO4) for 60 s at room temperature, fixed at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked in 2% BSA. Cells were incubated in 2% BSA for 1 h with primary antibodies against ECRG2 (4E8), α-tubulin, γ-tubulin (Sigma), MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUB3, BUBR1, and CREST (Santa Cruz), washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in 2% BSA for 1 h with 488 or 594 Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), and washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were mounted with Prolong Gold containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were viewed with a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope with a ×60/1.40NA plan apo or ×100/1.3NA plan fluor oil immersion objective. Images were captured with a Roper Coolsnap HQ CCD camera and processed with Metamorph 5.0 and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting Analysis—Adherent cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and resuspended into cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble cell debris. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation), and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the following primary antibodies: anti-ECRG2 monoclonal antibody (4E8), MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUB3, BUBR1 monoclonal antibodies, and rabbit anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody (Santa Cruz), phospho-H3 (Ser10) antibody and cyclin B monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-p27 and anti-human CREST (BD Pharmingen). Secondary antibodies, Alkapanel phosphatase-conjugated Affini-Pure goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG-Alkapanel phosphatase antibody (Sigma), were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then processed for chemiluminescence detection using the CDP-Star reagent (Roche). Immunoprecipitation-Western Blot Assay—Cells were lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate), centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the insoluble debris was discarded. Cell lysate (200-500 μg of protein) was incubated with antibodies against ECRG2 or p53, or normal IgG (control) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed extensively with immunoprecipitation buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by anti-ECRG2 or p53 antibody. Synchronization and Kinase Assay—Synchronized populations were generated by treating the vector control or ECRG2KD cells with thymidine-double block, and then releasing them into nocodazole. The cells were harvested at various times after nocodazole treatment, and processed for CDC2 kinase assay. ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on cell lysates were used for CDK2 kinase assay. Briefly, for isolation of CDC2 or CDK2 complexes, immunoprecipitation assay were performed by incubating 500 μg of total proteins from cell lysates described above or ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on cell lysates with rabbit polyclonal anti-CDC2 or anti-CDK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C, respectively. The immunocomplexes binding to Protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and used directly in a kinase activity assay with histone-1 (H1) as a substrate. The kinase reaction mixture contained 1 μg of H1, 30 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase assay was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding sample buffer. Purification of ECRG2-associated Proteins—ECRG2 cDNA expression plasmid was transfected into 293T cells. At 2 days after transfection, cells (∼2 × 108) were treated with 30 μm MG132 for 4 h, lysed in a total of 10 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and insoluble debris was discarded. The lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min, and then incubated with a 40-μl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose beads and ECRG2 antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with SNNTE buffer (5% sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Proteins copurified with ECRG2 were excised from the gel and subjected to protease digestion and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—ECRG23′UTR-KD or ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with combinations of 5 μg of His6-ubiquitin expression plasmid and 5 μg of p53 expression plasmid. Adding or removing doxcycline induced or silenced ECRG2. Cells were lysed in buffer A (6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 4 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with buffer A (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and bound proteins were eluted with buffer C (200 mm imidazole, 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS). The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of conjugated p53 by DO-1 antibody. Expression and Localization of ECRG2—The expression of ECRG2 protein was analyzed in different cell lines using 4E8 monoclonal anti-ECRG2 antibody. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1a, ECRG2 was expressed in HCT 116, HeLa, and HFF cells but absent in esophageal cancer cells (NEC and EC109). Although the first 18 residues of the ECRG2 protein are a signal peptide to mediate targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion, pulse-chase experiments showed that ECRG2 was transferred to both intracellular and extracellular cells (supplemental Fig. S1, b and c). Subcellular localizations of endogenous ECRG2 in growing HCT 116, HeLa, and HFF cells were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In interphase cells, ECRG2 localized to centrosomes. ECRG2 was readily detected at both unduplicated (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2a, upper panel) and duplicated centrosomes (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. S2a, middle panel). During mitosis, ECRG2 accumulated around kinetochores (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2a, lower panel). Further analysis confirmed that the C-terminal GFP tag ECRG2 localized to centrosomes (supplemental Fig. S2b). The deletion mutants study showed that 18-55 was a centrosome binding domain (Fig. 1C). ECRG2 Knockdown Causes Chromosome Instability—When ECRG2 was partially down-regulated by transient RNA interference, we observed an increase in aneuploid cells (data not shown), suggesting a potential role of ECRG2 in chromosomal instability. To investigate this, we established cell lines with severe ECRG2 knockdown (>95% depletion) in HCT 116 cells by using the pSUPER.Retro virus infection approach (ECRG2KD, Fig. 2A). We chose the HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cell line because it has a normal centrosome duplication and mitotic checkpoint and is amenable to gene targeting. We performed chromosome counts on metaphase spreads to test the importance of ECRG2 on chromosome instability. As shown in Fig. 2, B-D, the ECRG2KD cells displayed a significant increase in the frequency (97%) of aneuploid metaphases (more than or less than 46 chromosomes) relative to vector control cells, which have a relatively stable karyotype (46 chromosomes). The chromosome morphology strongly suggests chromosome instability in cells with severely down-regulated ECRG2. Loss of ECRG2 Induces the Formation of Supernumerary Centrosomes—To test directly whether the centrosomally localized ECRG2 participates in the regulation of centrosome amplification, we examined the status of the centrosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy in ECRG2KD cells. Cells were fixed and stained for γ-tubulin or centrin after shutoff of ECRG2. Cells with multiple centrosomes were observed both in interphase and in mitosis (Figs. 3A and Fig. 5A). After 24 h of repression, the cells began to accumulate supernumerary centrosomes, suggesting that the centrosome amplification is an early effect of ECRG2 down-regulation (Fig. 3B). The percentage of ECRG2KD cells with aberrant centrosome numbers increased with time. By 96 h, 53% of the cells had more than two centrosomes and cells with up to eight γ-tublin or centrin spots could be observed (Fig. 3C). Among the cells with more than two centrosomes, about 28% have three or five centrosomes, and 72% have four or six centrosomes, suggesting that the centrosome amplification may also be caused by unbalanced mitotic division.FIGURE 5Multipolar spindle formations in ECRG2KD cells. A, representatives of normal spindle in control and multiple polar spindles in ECRG2KD cells. Centrosomes were stained with anti-γ-tublin (red), mitotic spindle with anti-α-tublin (green), and DNA with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Scale bar, 5 μm.

Then the expression of endogenous ECRG2 was down-regulated by siRNA targeted at the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of ECRG2 mRNA (ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on). Expression of the exogenous ECRG2 was not affected by the 3′-ECRG2 siRNA because the exogenous pTet-TRE-ECRG2 contains no 3′-UTR (Fig. 4A). We found the infection of pSUPER.Retro.puro-ECRG2-3′UTR depleted by more than 95% endogenous ECRG2 protein. Adding doxcycline significantly restored exogenous ECRG2 protein (Figs. 4A and 7A, top panel). As shown in Fig. 4B, targeting ECRG2 3′-UTR alone increased the percentage of cells with centrosome amplification. However, when turned on the expression of ECRG2 by adding doxcycline in these cells significantly reduced centrosome amplification. And centrosome amplification increased again when turning off the expression of ECRG2 by removing the doxcycline. These data further support the role of ECRG2 in centrosome amplification and ruled out the off-target effect of ECRG2 RNA interference on centrosome amplification.FIGURE 7ECRG2 depletion does affect the transactivation function of p53 in HCT 116 cells. A, the cell lysates prepared from ECRG23′UTR-KD-Tet-on cells as described in the legend to Fig. 4 were subjected to immunoblot analysis using 4E8 anti-ECRG2 (top panel), anti-p53 (DO-1) (second panel), anti-p21 (third panel), anti-cyclin E (fourth panel), and anti-β-actin (loading control, bottom panel) antibodies. B, cyclin E-associated CDK2 kinase activity. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins in protein A-Sepharose beads were used for kinase activity analysis with histone H1 as a substrate. C, depletion of ECRG2 promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation. The level of p53 ubiquitination was determined by Ni-NTA purification and p53 Western blot.

https://openalex.org/W2048483905,"In an effort to identify novel components of the PHO regulon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have isolated and characterized suppressors of the Pho– phenotype associated with deletion of the Pho4 transcriptional activator. Here we report that either a defective form of the Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase or deletion of the End3 component of the endocytic pathway restores growth of the pho4Δ mutant in the presence of limiting inorganic phosphate (Pi). The spa1-1 suppressor allele of RSP5 encodes a phenylalanine-to-valine replacement at position 748 (F748V) within the catalytic HECT domain of Rsp5. Consistent with suppression due to impaired ubiquitin ligase activity, the heat-sensitive growth defect of the spa1-1 mutant is suppressed either by overexpression of ubiquitin or by osmotic stabilization. Western blot analyses revealed that the cellular levels of the Pho87 and Pho91 low affinity Pi are markedly increased in the spa1-1 mutant, yet Pho84 high affinity Pi transporter levels are unaffected. Furthermore, Pho87 and Pho91 are ubiquitinated in vivo in an Rsp5-dependent manner, and the Pho+ phenotype of the spa1-1 suppressor is dependent upon Pho87 and Pho91. We conclude that turnover of the low affinity Pi transporters is initiated by Rsp5-mediated ubiquitination followed by internalization and degradation by the endocytic pathway. In an effort to identify novel components of the PHO regulon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have isolated and characterized suppressors of the Pho– phenotype associated with deletion of the Pho4 transcriptional activator.

The spa1-1 suppressor allele of RSP5 encodes a phenylalanine-to-valine replacement at position 748 (F748V) within the catalytic HECT domain of Rsp5. Consistent with suppression due to impaired ubiquitin ligase activity, the heat-sensitive growth defect of the spa1-1 mutant is suppressed either by overexpression of ubiquitin or by osmotic stabilization. Western blot analyses revealed that the cellular levels of the Pho87 and Pho91 low affinity Pi are markedly increased in the spa1-1 mutant, yet Pho84 high affinity Pi transporter levels are unaffected. Furthermore, Pho87 and Pho91 are ubiquitinated in vivo in an Rsp5-dependent manner, and the Pho+ phenotype of the spa1-1 suppressor is dependent upon Pho87 and Pho91. We conclude that turnover of the low affinity Pi transporters is initiated by Rsp5-mediated ubiquitination followed by internalization and degradation by the endocytic pathway. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has evolved an elaborate system to sense, acquire, and store inorganic phosphate (Pi) in response to its availability in the extracellular environment (for review, see Refs. 1Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and 2Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The PHO system consists of (i) the Pho3, Pho5, Pho11, and Pho12 acid phosphatases that are localized to the periplasmic space, (ii) the Pho8 and Pho13 alkaline phosphatases that are localized to the vacuole and periplasm, respectively, (iii) the high affinity plasma membrane Pi transporters Pho84 and Pho89, which are regulated in response to Pi availability, and the low affinity, constitutively expressed Pi transporters Pho87, Pho90, and Pho91, (iv) Git1, a transporter that scavenges glycerophosphoinositol derived from secreted phosphatidylinositol, thereby replenishing inositol, Pi, and glycerol (3Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and (v) the PHM proteins that are involved in the synthesis and breakdown of polyphosphate, a storage form of Pi in the vacuole (for review, see Ref. 4Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riche D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The PHO regulon is responsible for scavenging Pi and has been most extensively studied with regard to regulation of PHO5 expression. The Pho84 transporter and the Pho80–Pho85 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase are negative regulators of PHO5 transcription, whereas the Pho81 inhibitor of Pho80–Pho85 and the Pho4 transcriptional activator are positive regulators. In the presence of high external concentrations of Pi, Pho85 phosphorylates Pho4, resulting in Pho4 nuclear export via the Msn5 exportin and cytoplasmic retention such that PHO5 is repressed (5Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Conversely, when Pi concentrations are low, Pho81 inhibits Pho85 activity. Pho4 remains unphosphorylated and has high affinity for the Pse1 importin, resulting in its nuclear retention where the Pho2–Pho4 complex induces PHO5 transcription (5Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The high affinity transporter genes, PHO84 and PHO89, are also components of the PHO regulon and are controlled in a manner similar to PHO5. In contrast, expression of the low affinity transporter genes, PHO87, PHO90, and PHO91, are independent of Pho4. Although the downstream events in the PHO signal transduction pathway have been well characterized, the upstream components that sense Pi concentrations and transduce that information are not well understood. Indeed, the direct sensor of Pi has not been identified. Recently, it was proposed that the PHO regulon is controlled by two different regulatory signals, one sensing internal Pi concentrations by an unidentified protein, the other sensing external Pi concentrations by the low affinity Pi transporters (6Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to pho2Δ, pho4Δ, or pho81Δ mutants that fail to activate PHO genes in response to Pi depletion, pho87Δ, pho90Δ, or pho91Δ deletion mutations result in constitutive derepression of PHO genes (6Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Auesukaree C. Homma T. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pho87Δ, pho90Δ, and pho91Δ are hypostatic to pho2Δ, pho4Δ, and pho81Δ (6Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results place the low affinity Pi transporters in the PHO signal transduction pathway, upstream of Pho2, Pho4, and Pho81. As such, Pho87, Pho90, and Pho91 appear to function not only as Pi transporters but as signal transducers that link the extracellular environment with the regulation of PHO gene expression (6Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the protein kinase A signal transduction pathway is required for degradation of Pho84 (8Mouillon J.M. Persson B.L. Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although there are no reports describing turnover of the low affinity Pi transporters. A number of cell surface proteins, including transporters, permeases, and signaling receptors, are known to be down-regulated by ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis. In these cases the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the plasma membrane protein is tagged with ubiquitin, internalized by endocytosis, and directed to the yeast vacuole or mammalian lysosome for degradation (for review, see Refs. 9Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 10Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

This ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway is distinct from the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (11Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As examples of the ubiquitin-endosome pathway, the yeast Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved in turnover of the Gap1 general amino acid permease (12Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C.

Biochem. 2000; 39: 4518-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis appears to be a general mechanism to respond to changes in nutrient availability. In an effort to identify proteins that regulate phosphate metabolism, we sought suppressors that would bypass the Pho4 requirement for cell growth in limiting Pi medium. We anticipated finding (i) proteins that act downstream of Pho4 either to repress Pho4-regulated genes or to mediate Pho4 activation and (ii) factors that affect Pi uptake independent of Pho4. Suppressors of the former class, which includes components of the RNA polymerase II mediator complex were found and will be described elsewhere. Here we describe suppressors of the latter class that includes the Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the End3 component of the endocytic pathway. Our results identify the low affinity phosphate transporters Pho87 and Pho91 as novel targets of the Rsp5 endocytic pathway and define an important role for these proteins in sensing Pi availability.

Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Plasmids pM1847 [rsp5-1 CEN URA3] and pM1848 [rsp5-CA CEN URA3] encode the Rsp5 L733S and C777A replacements, respectively, and were derived from pN1688 by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pM1739 [CUP1p-UBI4 2μ TRP1] was derived from pM1738 [CUP1p-myc-UBI4 2μ TRP1] by deleting the Myc tag, pM1761 [CUP1p-UBI4 2μ LEU2] was derived from pM1739 by a TRP1 to LEU2 marker swap (25Cross F.R.

Where indicated, –Leu medium was supplemented with 0.05 mm CuSO4, and SC medium was supplemented with 1 m sorbitol. yeast extract/peptone/dextrose synthetic complete wild type ubiquitin. Allelism Test—The RSP5 locus was tagged with the URA3 marker as follows. Plasmid pM1707 (RSP5::URA3) was linearized at the SalI restriction site within RSP5 and introduced into strain YMH624, selecting for Ura+ transformants. Integration at the RSP5 locus was confirmed by PCR analysis. The resulting strain, YMH690 (MATa ura3 trp1 pho4Δ::TRP1 RSP5::URA3), was crossed with YMH655 (MATα ura3 trp1 pho4Δ::TRP1 spa1-1), and a diploid strain was sporulated and dissected. All phenotypes segregated 2:2 (n = 5 four-spore tetrads) and all Ura+ (RSP5::URA3) segregants were Pho–, Tsm+, and Slg+, whereas all Ura– segregants were Pho+, Tsm–, and Slg-. Thus, the spa1-1 suppressor segregates opposite RSP5. Combined with complementation of spa1-1 by RSP5, these results confirm that spa1-1 is allelic to RSP5. Isolation of spa1-1 by Gap-repair—The spa1-1 allele was cloned from strain YMH655 by gap-repair (22Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The RSP5-URA3-CEN plasmid pN1688 was digested with BstEII, creating a gap in the RSP5 open reading frame, and introduced into YMH655 (spa1-1). Ura+ transformants were selected and screened for retention of the Pho+ and Tsm– suppressor phenotypes. Plasmid DNA was retrieved, screened by restriction analysis for recovery of gapped DNA, and reintroduced into YMH655. Whereas undigested pN1688 complemented YMH655, restoring the Pho– and Tsm+ phenotypes, transformants derived from the gap-repaired plasmid (pN1704), retained the Pho+ and Tsm– suppressor phenotypes. Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analyses—Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (28Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 A600 units of yeast cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in 100 μl of 1.85 m NaOH plus 7% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (Sorvall Biofuge) for 5 min. The pellet was rinsed in 0.5 ml of 1 m Tris base without resuspension, dissolved in 100 μ l of 2 × sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol), and dissociated by heating for 10 min at 37 °C. Protein samples corresponding to 0.1–0.2 A600 units were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (29Krishnamurthy S. He X. Reyes-Reyes M. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Pho87-3xHA and Pho91-3xHA were assayed by incubation using a 1:3000 dilution of anti-HA antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Control anti-Ess1 antibody (a gift from S. Hanes) was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Immunoprecipitated Pho87-3HA and Pho91-3HA proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and assayed by Western blot using 1:3000 dilution of anti-ubiquitin antibody (Sigma). Control anti-Rpa1 antibody (a gift from S. Brill) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation of Membrane Proteins—Proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated as described previously (30Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 A600 unit of cells was lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice with 40 μl of 1.85 m NaOH plus 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 40 μ1 of 50% trichloroacetic acid, collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Samples were resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × sample buffer (without 2-mercaptoethanol or bromphenol blue) plus 20 μ l of 1 m Tris base followed by heating for 10 min at 37 °C. TNET buffer (0.6 ml, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) was added, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of anti-HA antibody (Sigma) plus 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with TNET buffer, and proteins were eluted in 30 μ l of 2 × sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at room temperature. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-ubiquitin (1:50) and anti-HA (1:50) antibodies. Isolation of pho4Δ Suppressors—To identify genes that bypass the Pho4 activator requirement, we isolated suppressors of the Pho– phenotype associated with a pho4Δ deletion in strain EY131. One Pho+ revertant (YMH655) also exhibited a pronounced Tsm– phenotype at 37 °C (Fig. 1). YMH655 was backcrossed to a pho4Δ mutant of opposite mating type (YMH613), and the resulting diploid strain was Pho– and Tsm+, indicating that the revertant phenotypes are due to a recessive mutation(s). After sporulation and dissection, the Pho+:Pho– and Tsm+:Tsm– phenotypes segregated 2:2 among all four-spore progeny (n = 12), and the Pho+/Tsm– and Pho–/Tsm+ phenotypes co-segregated. Thus, YMH655 harbors a recessive, single-gene suppressor of pho4Δ that confers a pleiotropic Tsm– phenotype. We designated this suppressor mutation spa1-1 for suppressor of phosphate auxotrophy. The spa1-1 Suppressor Is Allelic to RSP5—The Tsm– phenotype associated with the spa1-1 suppressor was used to clone the wild type gene. A YCp50 genomic library (31Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) was introduced into strain YMH655, and transformants were selected on –Ura medium at 37 °C. A single Tsm+ Pho– transformant was recovered from 23,500 transformants. Plasmid DNA was isolated, amplified, and reintroduced into YMH655, confirming plasmid dependence of the Tsm+ and Pho– phenotypes. DNA sequence analysis from either end of the vector insert identified a 15-kilobase fragment of chromosome V encompassing five open reading frames, including RSP5, which encodes an essential ubiquitin E3 ligases that has been implicated in diverse biological processes in S. cerevisiae. Plasmid DNA (pN1688) carrying RSP5 and none of the flanking open reading frames fully complemented spa1-1 (data not shown). Genetic linkage analysis confirmed that spa1-1 is allelic to RSP5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Characterization of the spa1-1 Suppressor Mutation—Rsp5 is a member of the Nedd4 class of E3 ubiquitin ligases (for review, see Refs. 11Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Kee Y. Huibregtse J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, and 33Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The structure of Rsp5 includes a C2 domain, implicated in membrane association, two WW domains that mediate enzyme-substrate recognition, and a catalytic HECT domain that includes the active site cysteine. To address how the spa1-1 allele of RSP5 suppresses pho4Δ, we isolated and sequenced the spa1-1 allele. The spa1-1 allele was cloned from strain YMH655 by gap-repair. DNA sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame from plasmid pN1704 identified a single base pair substitution encoding a phenylalanine-to-valine replacement at position 748 (F748V), located within the HECT domain of the Rsp5 C terminus (Fig. 2A). The HECT domain alone is sufficient for E3 ligase catalytic activity (24Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the human E6AP HECT domain is available, revealing a larger N-terminal lobe and a smaller C-terminal lobe (34Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Phe-748 is located within the smaller C-terminal lobe, in the same hydrophobic environment as the catalytically impaired L733S replacement encoded by the rsp5-1 allele (24Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The smaller C-terminal lobe also includes the active site cysteine residue (Cys-777) that is essential for E3 ligase activity and cell viability (35Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 36Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To test whether loss of Rsp5 E3 ligase activity is responsible for suppression of pho4Δ, plasmid-borne rsp5 alleles encoding the L733S and C777A replacements were introduced into the spa1-1 mutant and scored for complementation of the Tsm– phenotype. In contrast to the wild type RSP5 plasmid, neither of the catalytically defective rsp5 plasmids complemented the Tsm– phenotype of spa1-1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, diminished Rsp5 E3 ligase activity compensates for the Pho– phenotype associated with loss of the Pho4 transcriptional activator. Suppression of spa1-1 by Overexpression of Ubiquitin or by Osmotic Stabilization—The growth phenotypes of several rsp5 ubiquitin ligase-defective alleles are suppressed by elevated expression of UBI4, the gene encoding ubiquitin (37Yashiroda H. Oguchi T. Yasuda Y. Toh E.A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the spa1-1 suppressor affects a ubiquitin-mediated process, then the Tsm– phenotype of spa1-1 might be suppressed by UBI4 overexpression. To test this possibility, we introduced plasmid DNA (pM1761) carrying the UBI4 gene under control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter (CUP1p-UBI4) into wild type, pho4Δ, and pho4Δ spa1-1 strains. The LEU2 vector pRS425 was included as a control. Transformants were streaked on –Leu medium and –Leu plus 0.05 mm CuSO4 and incubated at 37 °C. The Tsm– phenotype of the spa1-1 mutant was weakly suppressed by CUP1p-UBI4 in the absence of copper and markedly suppressed in the presence of copper, whereas no effect of CUP1p-UBI4 was observed in the wild type or pho4Δ strains (Fig. 3A). Weak suppression in the absence of copper is presumably a consequence of leaky expression of UBI4 from the CUP1p promoter (38Thiele D.J. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of ubiquitin effectively compensates for diminished Rsp5 E3 ligase activity. The Tsm– phenotype of ligase-defective rsp5 mutants is also suppressed by osmotic stabilization in the presence of 1 m sorbitol (39Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Tsm– phenotype of the spa1-1 suppressor is likewise suppressed by 1 m sorbitol (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that loss of Rsp5 E3 ligase activity bypasses the normal Pho4 requirement for growth in low phosphate medium. We conclude that Rsp5-mediated protein ubiquitination plays a negative role in regulating the response to Pi availability. The Endocytic Pathway Regulates Phosphate Metabolism—The End3-Pan1-Sla1 complex is essential for the internalization step of endocytosis (40Tang H.Y. Xu J. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and End3 has been implicated in Rsp5-mediated endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of plasma membrane proteins (20Medintz I. Jiang H. Michels C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34454-34462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Kaminska J. Gajewska B. Hopper A.K. Zoladek T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6946-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test whether the endosomal pathway is involved in phosphate metabolism, we asked whether an end3Δ deletion would suppress pho4Δ in a manner similar to the spa1-1 suppressor. We deleted the END3 gene in the WT, pho4Δ, and pho4Δ spa1-1 backgrounds and scored the resulting strains for growth in the presence of high and low concentrations of Pi. Consistent with earlier results (40Tang H.Y. Xu J. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the end3Δ deletion was lethal at 30 °C but viable at 24 °C, albeit exhibiting a slow-growth (Slg–) phenotype in the presence of 1 mm Pi. Accordingly, all growth phenotypes were scored at 24 °C. Results are shown in Fig. 4. First, the Pho– phenotype of the pho4Δ mutant is suppressed by end3Δ (cf. sectors 3 and 4 on 25 μm Pi). Presumably, end3Δ suppression of pho4Δ is even more pronounced than it appears due to the Slg– phenotype associated with end3Δ even in the presence of high Pi at 24 °C (cf. sectors 2, 4, and 6 with sectors 1, 3, and 5 on 1 mm Pi). Second, suppression of pho4Δ by spa1-1 and end3Δ are not additive, as the pho4Δ spa1-1 end3Δ triple mutant exhibited the same growth"

In this study, we first identified GCN5 acetyltransferase as a B23-interacting protein by mass spectrometry, which was then confirmed by <i>in vivo</i> co-immunoprecipitation. An <i>in vitro</i> assay demonstrated that B23 bound the PCAF-N domain of GCN5 and inhibited GCN5-mediated acetylation of both free and mononucleosomal histones, probably through interfering with GCN5 and masking histones from being acetylated. Mitotic B23 exhibited higher inhibitory activity on GCN5-mediated histone acetylation than interphase B23. Immunodepletion experiments of mitotic extracts revealed that phosphorylation of B23 at Thr<sup>199</sup> enhanced the inhibition of GCN5-mediated histone acetylation. Moreover, luciferase reporter and microarray analyses suggested that B23 attenuated GCN5-mediated transactivation <i>in vivo</i>. Taken together, our studies suggest a molecular mechanism of B23 in the mitotic inhibition of GCN5-mediated histone acetylation and transactivation."

Paradoxically, mammalian embryonic livers store glycogen successfully in the absence of GK. Here we address how mammalian embryonic livers, but not adult livers or hepatoma cells, manage to accumulate glycogen in the absence of this enzyme. Hexokinase type I or II (HKI, HKII) substitutes for GK in hepatomas and in embryonic livers. We engineered FTO2B cells, a hepatoma cell line in which GK is not expressed, to unveil the modifications required to allow them to accumulate glycogen. In the light of these results, we then examined glycogen metabolism in embryonic liver. Glycogen accumulation in FTO2B cells can be triggered through elevated expression of HKI or either of the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits, namely PTG or GL. Between these two strategies to activate glycogen deposition in the absence of GK, embryonic livers choose to express massive levels of HKI and HKII. We conclude that although the GK/liver glycogen synthase tandem is ideally suited to store glycogen in liver when blood glucose is high, the substitution of HKI for GK in embryonic livers allows the HKI/liver glycogen synthase tandem to make glycogen independently of the glucose concentration in blood, although it requires huge levels of HK. Moreover, the physiological consequence of the HK isoform switch is that the embryonic liver safeguards its glycogen deposits, required as the main source of energy at birth, from maternal starvation.

Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) of the hexokinase family (ATP:d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) and catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. GK has a high S0.5 for glucose, ∼5–8 mm. This S0.5 is increased in vivo because of the inhibitory effect of GK regulatory protein (2Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc.

In contrast, hexokinase isoforms type I and II (HKI, HKII) have an S0.5 for glucose in the range 50–100 μm (7Cardenas M.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and are more abundant in brain and muscle, respectively. Furthermore, Glc-6-P at physiological concentrations is a potent inhibitor of these two HK isoforms but not of GK (1Cardenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, GK and the two HKs differ in their subcellular localization in the presence of glucose; whereas the former is cytosolic, HKI and HKII remain attached to the outer membrane of mitochondria (8Wilson J.E.

Two isoforms of glycogen synthase (GS) (EC 2.4.1.11) are present in mammals. The muscle isoform (MGS) is most abundant in this tissue but can be found in a variety of organs. In contrast, the liver isoform (LGS) is restricted to hepatocytes. Both isoenzymes are regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and are active when in a hypophosphorylated state. The mechanism of GS dephosphorylation, which leads to the covalent activation of GS, involves the targeting of protein phosphatase 1 to glycogen by the adaptor proteins PTG (protein targeting to glycogen) (9Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and GL (10Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Glc-6-P, which is a powerful activator of GS, enhances the dephosphorylation of this enzyme, probably by inducing a conformational change that converts GS into a better substrate for protein phosphatase 1 (11Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). GK produces Glc-6-P in adult liver, thereby exerting a strong positive control on hepatic glycogen deposition (12Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In re-fed rats, hepatic Glc-6-P levels must reach a threshold concentration before LGS is activated (13Fernandez-Novell J.M. Roca A. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Guinovart J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The key role of GK in hepatic glycogen deposition is most apparent when GK gene dosage is altered in vivo. It has been shown that an increase in the GK levels in livers of healthy animals leads to augmented hepatic glycogen deposition and a subsequent reduction in glycemia (14Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the contrary, ablation of GK in liver leads to reduced hepatic glycogen stores and hyperglycemia (15Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice lacking GK regulatory protein show decreased glycogen accumulation (6Farrelly D. Brown K.S. Tieman A. Ren J. Lira S.A. Hagan D. Gregg R. Mookhtiar K.A. Hariharan N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14511-14516Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in mouse models of diabetes mellitus in which glycogen deposition is impaired, transgenic overexpression of GK in liver enhances glycogen synthesis and normalizes blood glucose levels (16Ferre T. Pujol A. Riu E. Bosch F. Valera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7225-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Hariharan N. Farrelly D. Hagan D. Hillyer D. Arbeeny C. Sabrah T. Treloar A. Brown K. Kalinowski S. Mookhtiar K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 11-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of GK in hepatocytes from Zucker diabetic fatty rats restores hepatic glycogen metabolism (18Seoane J. Barbera A. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31833-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of brain HKI in these hepatocytes does not increase glycogen accumulation. A similar scenario is observed in FTO2B cells (19Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcia-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a rat hepatoma cell line (20Zvibel I. Fiorino A.S. Brill S. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that lacks GK but expresses HKI (21Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This cell line does not therefore accumulate glycogen, although it presents an elevated rate of glycolysis, the hallmark of hepatoma cells. This increased rate has been related to the greater HK activity of these cells compared with normal hepatocytes (22Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Schamhart D.H. van de Poll K.W. van Wijk R. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 1051-1055PubMed Google Scholar). Either GK or MGS expression triggers glycogen deposition in FTO2B cells (19Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcia-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of HK on promoting hepatic glycogen synthesis has been interpreted in terms of channeling or compartmentalization of Glc-6-P (19Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcia-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Gomis R.R. Favre C. Garcia-Rocha M. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9740-9746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mammalian embryonic livers accumulate glycogen despite the absence of GK expression. During development, rat liver expresses HKI and HKII (25Postic C. Leturque A. Printz R.L. Maulard P. Loizeau M. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar). It is when pups are weaned that the first solid carbohydrate-rich ingestion triggers an insulin peak, which stimulates the insulin-dependent promoter of GK in liver (26Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Here we address the occurrence of hepatic glycogen synthesis in the absence of GK. We show that the GK/LGS tandem expressed in adult liver provides the optimal conditions for synthesizing glycogen in this organ when blood glucose concentration is elevated. However, the substitution of HKI for GK in hepatoma and embryonic liver forms the unusual tandem HKI/LGS. The HK-for-GK switch serves to guarantee their capacity to exploit glucose at any concentration of the sugar. Furthermore, the embryonic liver, by expressing huge amounts of HK, is also able to accumulate glycogen, which is safeguarded from changes in the mother's blood glucose. Animals—OF1 pregnant mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used for the metabolic studies. The day at which a vaginal plug was detected was considered embryonic day 0. The experiments were performed in accordance with the European Council Directive and the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

In the metabolic studies, FTO2B cells infected with AdCMV-GFP were used as control. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The cDNA of HxkII, an ancestral HK from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was courtesy of F. Moreno (Universidad de Oviedo). The coding region of HxkII was cloned in-frame in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) between EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. pEGFP/PTG and pEGFP/GL were kindly provided by J. C. Ferrer (Universitat de Barcelona). Cells were transfected at 90% of confluence by electroporation. Briefly, for each plate, cells were detached, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended to a final volume of 800 μl in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without antibiotics but with 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene) and 100 μg of the desired plasmid construction. Samples were transferred to a Gene Pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad) with an electrode gap of 0.4 cm and electroporated in a Gene Pulser II device (Bio-Rad) at 200 V and 950 microfarads. Cells were then diluted in an appropriate volume of DMEM and plated. FTO2B Cell Culture Conditions and Treatment with Recombinant Adenoviruses—FTO2B rat hepatoma cells were cultured in 100-mm diameter plates. They were kept in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were treated for 2 h with an appropriate amount of adenovirus, previously titered either by Glc-6-P or HK activity determinations. Infection media were then replaced with DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. Media were then replaced by DMEM without glucose, and another incubation of 14–16 h was carried out. Cells were then incubated in DMEM with 10 or 25 mm glucose, as indicated, for 4 h at 37 °C. Metabolite Determinations—To measure glycogen content, cell monolayers from 100-mm diameter plates were scraped using 200 μl of 30% (v/v) KOH, and the extract was then boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. Glycogen was measured in the cleared supernatants as described in Ref. 28Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar. To determine the intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P, at the end of incubations cell culture plates were flash-frozen in liquid N2 without rinsing with PBS to prevent Glc-6-P consumption. Cell monolayers from 100-mm diameter plates were scraped with 200 μl of perchloric acid, and the extract was sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pH of the cleared supernatants was adjusted to neutrality, and Glc-6-P quantification was performed by a spectrophotometric assay (29Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar). A fraction of these perchloric extracts was assayed for nucleotide concentration by high pressure liquid chromatography. Briefly, 20 μl of the sample was injected in a reverse-phase column (Excel 120 ODS b, 3 μm, 20 × 0.46) with a pressure of 1900 p.s.i and eluted with a gradient of 0.1 m KH2PO4 + 0.5 mm tetrabutylammonium, pH 6.4, and 30% methanol at a constant flow of 0.6 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected with a Waters 2996 PDA detector set at λ = 260 nm. Enzyme Activity Assays—Frozen cell monolayers from 100-mm diameter plates were scraped using 300 μl of homogenization buffer, which consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. Thawing plus Polytron disruption caused cell bursting. Fresh tissue samples (100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer. Protein concentration was measured following the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad assay reagent. Glucose phosphorylating activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the supernatant fraction of cell or tissue extracts centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min using 0, 0.5, or 100 mm glucose to differentiate between hexokinases of low (GK) and high (HKI and HxkII) affinity for glucose. Activity was measured at 30 °C with the Glc-6-P dehydrogenase coupled assay, as described previously (31Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity measured at 0 mm glucose was used to set the base line. HK activity is expressed as milliunits/mg of protein, where 1 milliunit is the amount of enzyme phosphorylating 1 nmol of glucose/min at 37 °C. M0.5 of GS for Glc-6-P was measured in glucose-depleted FTO2B cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either LGS or MGS. Cell monolayers were homogenized as described above in homogenization buffer without Tween 20. GS activity in these homogenates was measured at a constant UDP-glucose concentration (0.2 mm) but with several increasing Glc-6-P concentrations ranging from 0 to 7.1 mm, as described in Ref. 32Bosch F. Ciudad C.J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 151: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. RNA Purification and Retrotranscription—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue as follows. First, 100 mg of the sample tissue was homogenated in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, 0.2 ml of chloroform was added to the supernatant, and it was then centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate it into two phases. Total RNA was then precipitated by adding 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol to the aqueous phase. After an incubation of 10 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The desiccated pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of RNase-free water. Total RNA from tissue was repurified at this step with RNeasy minicolumns (RNeasy total RNA isolation kit, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Also total RNA isolation from plate-cultured cells was started at this step using RNeasy columns. Up to 5 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed for 50 min at 42 °C in a 15-ml reaction volume using 200 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR, Invitrogen) in the presence of 50 ng of random hexamers. Quantitative Real-time PCR—PCR tests were performed following the standard real-time PCR protocol of the ABI Prism 7700 Detection System together with the appropriate readymade TaqMan primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems) at the Genomic Unit core facility of the Serveis Cientificotècnics-Universitat de Barcelona. Each sample was analyzed in three replica wells with 30 ng of first-strand cDNA in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The temperature profile consisted of 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Data were analyzed with the 2ΔΔCt method using 18 S rRNA as endogenous control. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to the nitrocellulose was performed at 150 V (constant) at room temperature using a Bio-Rad miniature transfer apparatus, as described previously (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The blot was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit antibody against LGS (34Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. de la Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J.

It was then washed and incubated for 1 h with an anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde diluted 4% in PBS. Coverslips with the cell monolayer were rinsed three times with PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min, and blocked with the previous mixture supplemented with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 10 min. Primary mouse IgM antibody raised against glycogen (kindly provided by O. Baba, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) was diluted in PBS/bovine serum albumin (3%, 1:20) and applied to the cells for 45 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed several times with PBS and subjected to incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:200 in PBS/bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were washed, air-dried, and mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol mounting medium. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica SPII spectral microscope and 63× (numerical aperture of 1.3, oil) Leitz Plan-Apo objective. The light source was an argon/krypton laser (75 milliwatts). Glycogen Accumulation in Embryonic Liver and Hepatoma Cells—Mouse livers from E16 had active glycogen metabolism because they accumulated Glc-6-P (0.61 ± 0.07 nmol of Glc-6-P/mg of tissue) and showed glycogen levels (13.7 ± 2.5 mg of Glc/g of tissue) comparable with those in adult livers of animals fed ad libitum (0.47 ± 0.07 nmol of Glc-6-P/mg of tissue and 12.6 ± 1.7 mg of Glc/g of tissue). However, as reported for rats (25Postic C. Leturque A. Printz R.L. Maulard P. Loizeau M. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar), these embryos did not express GK (Fig. 1). Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed that LGS, but not MGS, is the isoform expressed in embryonic liver (Fig. 1). Similarly, FTO2B cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, express LGS and lack GK (Fig. 1). Instead, this cell line expresses HKI (21Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, unlike embryonic liver, FTO2B cells do not accumulate glycogen even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose in the culture medium (Fig. 2A) (19Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcia-Rocha M.

We first overexpressed rat HKI or rat GK by infecting FTO2B cells with recombinant adenoviruses at the same multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). After incubation with 10 mm glucose, we measured glycogen concentrations. As reported previously (36O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), cells expressing GK but not HKI accumulated glycogen (Fig. 2A). Because increased AMP levels activate LGS (37Carabaza A. Ricart M.D. Mor A. Guinovart J.J. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2724-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carabaza A. Guinovart J.J. Ciudad C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we tested whether the distinct cellular localization of HKI and GK exerts a differential effect on AMP pool and hence on LGS activation. For this purpose, we determined ATP, ADP, and AMP levels in adenovirus-infected FTO2B cells incubated with glucose. An increase in the AMP levels of both HKI- and GK-expressing cells was detected with respect to controls (Fig. 2B), whereas the other nucleotides remained unchanged. However, because these two isoenzymes raised AMP concentration to the same extent, this increase cannot account for the differences in glycogen deposition observed between HKI- and GK-expressing cells. Because GK is soluble but HKI is bound to mitochondria, we next tested the hypothesis that HKI mitochondrial localization affects the capacity of this enzyme to trigger glycogen synthesis. To this end, we treated FTO2B cells with clotrimazole, a compound that releases HKI from the mitochondria (39Penso J. Beitner R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 342: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although incubation with 20 μm clotrimazole enriched the cytosolic fraction of FTO2B cell extracts (Fig. 2C), we did not detect glycogen accumulation (data not shown). This observation suggests that the binding of HKI to mitochondria is not the cause of impaired glycogen synthesis. We next addressed whether the kinetic features of HKI and GK were responsible for the differences in glycogen deposition. To explore this, we used HxkII, an ancestral hexokinase from S. cerevisiae with mixed kinetic features. Like HKI, this enzyme shows affinity for glucose in the submillimolar range, but like GK, it is not inhibited by Glc-6-P (40Gancedo J.M. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4443-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rodriguez A. de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the capacity of HKI, GK, and HxkII to trigger glycogen synthesis in FTO2B cells upon incubation with glucose. We expressed rat GK in these cells at levels similar to those found in liver and then adjusted the expression of yeast HxkII to achieve similar levels of HK activity (when measured in vitro) (Fig. 3A). Both GK and HxkII expression increased basal HK activity 3-fold and effectively raised both Glc-6-P and glycogen pools (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, cells overexpressing HKI activity 7-fold over endogenous basal HK activity did not increase their Glc-6-P or glycogen levels. These results indicate that the affinity of HKI for glucose i"

However, the molecular mechanism for its function is largely unknown. Here we show that Hes6 is a component of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) complex in the nuclei and that Hes6 inhibits cell proliferation through induction of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. We further show that Hes6 directly interacts with CREB-binding protein (CBP), one of the key components of PML-NB, via its basic domain. This association is critical for p21 induction through multiple mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling and p53 acetylation. Taken together, these results suggest that the Hes6-CBP complex in PML-NB may influence the proliferation of cells via p53-dependent and -independent pathways.

They execute their function by forming heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed E2A proteins with their HLH domain (2Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 3Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation is subsequently mediated by binding to DNA through their basic domain and/or by recruiting co-activators that contain histone acetyltransferase activity (3Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The Id family molecules that lack the basic motif play the role of negative regulators by interfering with the interaction between bHLH transcription factors and E2A proteins (5Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of repressors for bHLH transcription factors consists of the Hes subfamily members, which are vertebrate homologues of Drosophila Enhancer of Split (E/S) genes (6Fisher A. Caudy M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Hes proteins contain the conserved WRPW tetrapeptide at the C terminus that interacts with co-repressors such as Groucho to execute transcriptional repression. This domain is also involved in the control of protein stability (7Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Kang S.A. Seol J.H. Kim J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although most Hes family members are downstream of the Delta-Notch signaling and mediate the inhibition of differentiation, Hes6 is known to promote the neuronal differentiation (9Gratton M.O. Torban E. Jasmin S.B. Theriault F.M. German M.S. Stifani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6922-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Koyano-Nakagawa N. Kim J. Anderson D. Kintner C. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 4203-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such unique property of Hes6 has been proposed to be imparted by the suppression of transcriptional repressor activity of other Hes family proteins such as Hes1 (9Gratton M.O. Torban E. Jasmin S.B.

Mammalian nucleus is a highly organized organelle that is functionally compartmentalized into chromatin territories and nuclear compartments called the nuclear bodies (NBs). Therefore, subnuclear localization of the transcription factors can provide a clue for the role and molecular mechanism of their functions (12Handwerger K.E. Gall J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). A promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) is a large protein complex containing transcriptional machineries such as PML, RNA polymerase II, CBP, SUMO, Daxx, retinoblastoma protein, and p53 (14Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). PML-NB is believed to be involved in the variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (15Lin H.K. Bergmann S. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5693-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The first indication that PML-NB is involved in cell growth and differentiation was obtained from the observation that the fusion of PML protein and retinoic acid receptor as the result of chromosomal translocation causes acute promyelocytic leukemia (16Pandolfi P.P. Grignani F. Alcalay M. Mencarelli A. Biondi A. Lo-Coco F. Grignani F. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar, 17de The H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A. Cell. 1991; 66: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). PML is one of the major constituents of PML-NB, and the loss of PML gene disrupts PML-NB formation. Although the precise function is still unknown, PML-NB has been proposed to be the site of the following: 1) excess nuclear protein storage, 2) post-translational modification and degradation of proteins, and 3) specific nuclear events such as transcriptional regulation (18Ching R.W. Dellaire G. Eskiw C.H. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One of the key molecules that mediate the function of PML-NB is the tumor suppressor gene p53 (19Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), a transcription factor that regulates DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis (20Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). The cellular functions of p53 are accomplished, at least in part, by transcriptional activation of down-stream genes such as p21 and BH3-only proteins such as Puma and Noxa (20Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). The activity of p53 in the PML-NB is regulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation (21Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 22Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 23Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), and co-factors for p53 activation are often observed in the PML-NB complex. For instance, p53 acetylation is mediated by another PML-NB molecule, CBP (24Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). PML protein itself also interacts directly with p53 and functions as a co-factor. Consistently, the activity of p53 is greatly impaired in the PML-null primary cells (19Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Hes6 is associated with PML-NB and modifies the cell cycle by up-regulating p21 expression. This function of Hes6 appears to be mediated by a direct interaction with CBP, which acetylates p53 and histones associated with the p21 promoter. Our results suggest a novel role of Hes6 as a regulator of the cell cycle. It is well established that cellular differentiation is linked to activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21Cip1 (25Gill R.M. Slack R. Kiess M. Hamel P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Ghiani C.A. Eisen A.M. Yuan X. DePinho R.A. McBain C.J. Gallo V.

We thus propose that the differentiation effect of Hes6, as for example seen during neural development, is at least in part mediated by its function in cell cycle regulation. Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa and αT3-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) was cultured as described previously (28Abbondanzo S.J. Gadi I. Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 803-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For serum starvation, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids and Antibodies—Hes6 and its mutants were cloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) and pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). Human p21 promoter-luciferase vector containing 2.3 kb of the 5′ region of the p21 gene was donated by Dr. H. Lieberman (Columbia University); 0.3-kb p21 promoter region was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pREP4-luciferase vector in which CAT cDNA fragment of pREP4-CAT vector (Invitrogen) was replaced with luciferase gene. By site-directed mutagenesis, E-box consensus sequences on the 0.3-kb p21 promoter were substituted by the sequence GAATCC. Human FLAG-CBP was kindly provided by Dr. S. Baek (Seoul National University, Korea). pFLAG-VN173 and pHA-VC155 vectors encoding N-terminal residues 1-172 (VN173) and C-terminal residues 155-238 (VC155) were provided by Dr. C.-D. Hu (Purdue University, IN) (29Liu H. Deng X. Shyu Y.J. Li J.J. Taparowsky E.J. Hu C.D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1058-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CBP was subcloned into pFLAG-VN173 by PCR amplification with primers containing HindIII/NotI sites as follows: 5′-AAG CTT ATG GCC GAG AAC TTG CTG GAC G-3′ and 5′-GCG GCC GCC AAA CCC TCC ACA AAC TTT TC-3′. Hes6 was amplified with 5′-GAA TTC GCA TGG CTC CGT CCC AGG CGC-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG CCC AAG GCC TCC ACA CAC TCT G-3′ and cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pHA-VC155. To produce the polyclonal antibody against mouse Hes6, a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-fused Hes6 without bHLH domain was utilized as the antigen. Specificity of the antibody was evaluated by the expression of Hes6 in the cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Antibodies against p21, p27, PML, CBP, Myc, and HA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FLAG and β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-acetylated histone H3 and anti-acetylated p53 (Lys-373/382) were purchased from Upstate. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation and Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips to 70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty four hours after transfection, BrdUrd (10 μm) was applied to the media for 2 h, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. Following denaturation with 2 n HCl for 20 min, cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:500) was applied for 1 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probe) for 30 min. Similar procedure was used for labeling of other proteins except for the denaturation step (PML and p53, 1:500; anti-HA and CBP, 1:1000). Stained cells were observed via fluorescent or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM). Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from the cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, purified total RNAs (2 μg) were reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) primer. An aliquot of RT products was subjected to PCR amplification with specific primers for the target genes. The PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. The relative ratio of PCR products was normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control.TABLE 1Primers for reverse transcription-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assaysPrimersSequenceProductPrimersSequenceProductbpbpHuman Hes65′-AGCTCCTGAACCATCTGCTCG-3′217Mouse p215′-AATCCTGGTGATGTCCGACC-3′4615′-GCCTGACTCAGTTCAGCCTCA-3′5′-TTGCAGAAGACCAATCTGCG-3′Human p21 Cip15′-GTGAGCGATGGAACTTCGACTT-3′330Mouse p275′-TATGGAAGAAGCGAGTCAGC-3′3355′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATC-3′5′-GCGAAGAAGAATCTTCTGCAG-3′Human p275′-AGTACGAGTGGCAAGAGGTGG-3′389Mouse p535′-GGAAATTTGTATCCCGAGTATCTG-3′1835′-TCGAGCTGTTTACGTTTGACG-3′5′-GTCTTCCAGTGTGATGATGGTAA-3′Human p535′-TGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTC-3′375E-box5′-CGAAGTCAGTTCCTTGTGGA-3′2935′-TCCGTCCCAGTAGATTACCA-3′5′-ACATCCCGACTCTCGTCAC-3′GAPDHaGAPDH is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACAT-3′339Proximal p53-binding site5′-CCCGAGGTCAGCTGCGTTAG-3′2655′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′5′-GTGATGTGTCTATCCGCTCCC-3′Mouse Hes65′-CTGCGAGGCCGGGCGCGCGA-3′444Distal p53-binding site5′-ATCAGGAACATGTCCCAAC-3′2435′-TCACCAAGGCCTCCACACAC-3′5′-AGAATCTGACTCCCAGCAC-3′a GAPDH is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). After quantification of total protein by BCA assay (Pierce), cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody. Blots were then washed with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, extracts from transfected cell or the whole brain (E17.5) lysates were prepared in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-agarose beads and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C, followed by 2 h of incubation with protein G-agarose. The antibody-conjugated beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in gel loading buffer. After running the SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, immunoreactive bands were visualized by Amersham Biosciences ECL reagents. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Hes6-transfected cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS containing protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Bioscience), suspended in harvest buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol), incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g. Cells were then washed sequentially with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The DNA in the lysate was sheared to 300-1000 bp in size using a digital sonifier (Branson, model 450). Supernatants were collected and diluted with buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), followed by immunoclearing with 2 μl of preimmune serum and single-stranded DNA-protein G-Sepharose (Upstate) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 6 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, 40 μl of single-stranded DNA-containing protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated for another 2 h. The beads were washed sequentially for 10 min with TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed twice with TE buffer and eluted three times with 200 μl of 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde-induced cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation with glycogen as carrier. For PCR, an aliquot of DNA precipitate was used with 25-35 cycles of amplification with primers (Table 1). Hes6 Localizes to PML-NB—YFP-tagged Hes6 expression vector was transfected into HeLa cells, and subcellular localization of YFP::Hes6 fusion protein was examined. YFP::Hes6 signal was predominantly observed as speckles in the nucleus. Speckle-like localization of YFP::Hes6 was also observed in other cell types such as pituitary cell line α-T3 (Fig. 1B), COS7, and human embryonic kidney cell HEK293 (supplemental Fig. S2). Such localization pattern is not likely to be due to nonspecific aggregation of YFP::Hes6 given that the speckle pattern generated by the fusion protein was reiterated by the HA-tagged Hes6 (Fig. 1C). Because the morphology and distribution of Hes6 speckles resembled those of PML-NB, we tested if these Hes6 speckles co-localized with the major PML-NB protein, PML. Immunofluorescence labeling of PML revealed that YFP::Hes6 signals extensively overlapped with PML immunoreactivity (IR) (Fig. 1, D-I). High magnification observation showed that both PML-IR and YFP::Hes6 signals were co-localized in the same speckles (about 80% of the total speckles), whereas a few speckles exhibited either PML-IR (Fig. 1, G and H, arrows) or YFP::Hes6 signal (Fig. 1, G and H, arrowhead, both about 10%). We next determined the domain of Hes6 critical for localization in the PML-NB. Hes family proteins contain conserved WRPW tetrapeptide motif (7Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Paroush Z. Finley Jr., R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Hes genes also contain the orange domain that is known to stabilize the protein-protein interaction (32Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the deletion of these domains modifies the subcellular localization. The orange domain deleted Hes6 (ΔOrg) exhibited speckle-like signals that were still co-localized with PML immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, J-L). The deletion of WRPW domain (ΔWRPW), on the other hand, resulted in diffuse distribution in the nuclear as well as in the cytoplasmic compartments, albeit weakly in the latter (Fig. 1, M-O). These results show that WRPW domain is essential for the localization of Hes6 in the PML-NBs. Hes6 Attenuates the Cell Proliferation—PML-NBs are involved in many cellular events, including the control of cell cycle via modification of tumor suppressors such as retinoblastoma protein and p53 (33Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore first examined the possible involvement of Hes6 in the regulation of the cell cycle. To assess the proliferation rate, we determined the rate of BrdUrd incorporation following overexpression of the wild-type or mutant Hes6. Approximately 40% of the cells were BrdUrd-labeled after a 2-h incubation of actively growing HeLa cells. In contrast, a substantially smaller proportion of cells was labeled in the cell populations expressing wild-type (WT) Hes6 or ΔOrg, indicating that the cell proliferation is suppressed by the Hes6 or ΔOrg expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, ΔWRPW failed to show such an anti-proliferating activity, suggesting that the localization of Hes6 in PML-NB is a prerequisite for the growth inhibition. Consistent with these observations, we also found that embryonic fibroblasts derived from Hes6-/- mouse (MEFs) (10Koyano-Nakagawa N. Kim J. Anderson D. Kintner C. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 4203-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proliferated substantially faster than WT MEFs and that a significantly higher level of BrdUrd labeling was obtained in Hes6-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 2C). These results collectively suggest that Hes6 is involved in the control of cell proliferation. Hes6 Enhances p21 Expression—We next tested whether Hes6 controls the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts on G1-S phase to block cell cycle progression. Following the expression of exogenous Hes6, we found that the p21 mRNA level increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the mRNA level of neither p27 nor endogenous Hes6 was altered (Fig. 3A). Consistently, expression of Hes6 selectively enhanced p21 protein levels but not p27 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, ΔWRPW only marginally altered the p21 protein level indicating again that localization of Hes6 to PML-NB is required for regulation of p21. To further evaluate the contribution of Hes6 to p21 gene expression, we examined the p21 induction in Hes6-/- MEF. Following serum starvation, Hes6 mRNA expression was induced in WT MEF (Fig. 3C). Similarly, p21 and p27 mRNA induction was also observed. However, in Hes6-/- MEF, although the p27 induction was the same as seen in WT MEF, the induction of p21 was selectively abrogated, indicating the highly specific nature of the inductive effect of Hes6 on p21. Next, we assessed the effect of Hes6 on p21 promoter activity using a reporter assay. Overexpression of Hes6 significantly enhanced luciferase activity from reporter plasmids with either 2.3- or 0.3-kb proximal promoter regions of the p21 gene, suggesting that Hes6 regulates p21 through cis-elements within the 0.3-kb proximal region (Fig. 3, D and E). It is known that several proteins of bHLH family are involved in the induction of p21 transcription via three E-box (CANNTG) elements found immediately 5′ to the core promoter (34Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 35Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). To test whether E-box sequences are necessary to mediate induction of p21 by Hes6, we assayed the activities of 0.3-kb p21 promoter reporters containing mutant versions of the E-boxes (Fig. 3F and supplemental Fig. S3). Whereas WT p21 promoter activity increased by ∼4-fold in response to Hes6 expression, E-box mutation of p21 promoter abrogated the Hes6-induced transcriptional induction. Mutation of E-box also reduced the basal luciferase activity in the absence of Hes6. Considering that HeLa cells do not express Hes6 (data not shown), this result suggests that endogenous factors other than Hes6 in HeLa cells may contribute to the basal p21 activity. Anti-proliferating Effect of Hes6 Is Partially Mediated by p53—Considering that p53 is a component of PML-NB and an upstream regulator of p21, we questioned if p53 is involved in the anti-proliferating activity of Hes6. First, we found that p53 was enriched in the Hes6+ speckles following YFP::Hes6 overexpression (Fig. 4A). ΔOrg and ΔWRPW showed consistent effect on p53 localization with their own tendency to localize to PML-NB; p53 was found in PML-NB in ΔOrg+ cells but not in ΔWRPW+ cells. We further assessed whether overexpression of Hes6 altered the expression level of p53, and we found that neither the mRNA nor the protein level was modified by Hes6 overexpression (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, serum starvation led to an increase in the p53 mRNA level to a similar extent in both Hes6+/+ and Hes6-/- MEFs (data not shown), suggesting that Hes6 does not contribute to the transcriptional induction of p53. Interestingly, however, we found that acetylation of p53 was increased by Hes6 overexpression. Upon immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for Lys-373/Lys-382 acetylated p53 and subsequent immunoblotting with DO-1, which recognizes N terminus of p53, it was shown that acetylation of p53 was increased by 2.5-fold by Hes6 which ΔWRPW failed to do (Fig. 4C). Finally, we examined whether Hes6 requires the presence of p53 for suppressing cell proliferation (Fig. 4D). Although ∼90% reduction of BrdUrd incorporation was seen as the results of ectopic Hes6 expression in p53+/+ MEFs, the effect of Hes6 overexpression was substantially mitigated in p53-/- MEFs showing only 50% reduction. This indicates that anti-proliferating activity of Hes6 is mediated by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Hes6 Synergizes with the p53 Activity on p21 Promoter—Given that the function of Hes6 is modulated by p53, we asked whether Hes6 could in turn modify p53 activity using p21 promoter assays (Fig. 5). Overexpression of p53 alone enhanced luciferase activity from the 2.3-kb p21 promoter construct with the maximum of 10-fold induction, whereas Hes6 overexpression alone enhanced luciferase activity by 4-fold. Importantly, co-expression of Hes6 and p53 synergistically augmented the induction of luciferase activity up to 30-fold (Fig. 5A). However, the synergistic effect with p53 was not observed with the 0.3-kb p21 promoter that lacks the p53-binding sites (Fig. 5B). These observations are consistent with at least two distinct mechanisms that are involved in the anti-proliferating effect of Hes6, one of which is mediated by 0.3-kb p21 promoter region independently of p53 and the other mediated by 2.3-0.3-kb promoter region in a p53-dependent manner. Hes6 Interacts with CBP—It has been demonstrated previously that PML-NB contains CBP. CBP is known to be an important co-activator of the cell cycle control (36Iyer N.G. Ozdag H. Caldas C.
