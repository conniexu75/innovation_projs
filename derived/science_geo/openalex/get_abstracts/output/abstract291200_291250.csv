https://openalex.org/W1988975535,High-quality crystals of the organic molecular semiconductors tetracene and pentacene were used to prepare metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures exhibiting hole and electron mobilities exceeding 10 4 square centimeters per volt per second. The carrier concentration in the channel region of these ambipolar field-effect devices was controlled by the applied gate voltage. Well-defined Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations and quantized Hall plateaus were observed for two-dimensional carrier densities in the range of 10 11 per square centimeter. Fractional quantum Hall states were observed in tetracene crystals at temperatures as high as ∼2 kelvin.
https://openalex.org/W2030309170,Analysis of soils from burned and unburned chaparral indicates that high nitrate concentrations following fire are due to the addition of ammonium and organic nitrogen in the ash. Inhibition of mineralization in unburned chaparral results in low nitrate concentrations. Fluctuations in the amount of soil nitrate in unburned chaparral are the direct result of foliar leaching.

https://openalex.org/W2006961999,"Lake Kivu, an African rift lake, contains about 50 cubic kilometers of methane (at standard temperature and pressure) in its deep water. Data resulting from two recent expeditions to the lake and a reevaluation of earlier data suggest that most of the methane was formed by bacteria from abiogenetic carbon dioxide and hydrogen, rather than being of volcanic origin or having formed from decomposing organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W2089702674,"Seeds of the genus Mucuna display both a remarkable immunity to attack by seed-eating insects and an unusually high concentration of free L-dopa. When seed powders or pure L-dopa were incorporated into artificial diets and fed to southern armyworm larvae, mortality increased, and abnormal pupae and adults resulted. At higher concentrations L-dopa acted as a feeding repellent."

These data suggest that the material in the lunar interior at a depth of 1000 to 1100 kilometers is more dissipative for seismic shear waves than the lithosphere above, and possibly exists in a partially molten state akin to the earth's asthenosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2056650286,"Aircraft-borne multifrequency passive microwave observations of eight marine oil spills revealed that, in all cases, over 90 percent of the oil was confined in a compact region comprising less than 10 percent of the area of the visible slick. These measurements show that microwave radiometry offers a means for measuring the distribution of oil in sea-surface slicks; for locating the thick regions; and for measuring their volumes on an all-weather, day or night, and real-time basis."
https://openalex.org/W2094741826,"Dietary alpha-tocopherol and cannibalism together induce the giant, campanulate morphotype. Campanulates, unlike the two smaller female morphotypes, do not respond to alpha-tocopherol by forming male-producing offspring. Campanulate production probably is very significant ecologically, allowing a rapid, adaptive response to increased prey size and a rapid reproductive rate uninter-rupted by sexuality and consequent dormancy."

A critical review of the data used, however, suggests that Sager and Koppers have underestimated the effects that errors and data"

The sand disappears from the diverticulum when the animal reaches the length of 30 millimeters."
https://openalex.org/W2102160653,"The diffusion and transport mechanisms generated by the pack ice dynamics of the Beaufort Sea, combined with the slow rate of biodegradation of oil under Arctic conditions, would combine to diffuse an oil spill over the sea and eventually deposit the oil on the ice surface, where it would lower the natural albedo over a large area."

https://openalex.org/W1604918924,"A wave of chatter about water and therefore possible life on Mars swept a paper at Science into headline news a week before its scheduled publication. The paper, on page 2330 of this issue, features high-resolution pictures of muddy-looking gullies on the sides of martian craters, suggesting the prospect of liquid water on, or at least near, the surface of the planet. But a number of skeptical planetary scientists are already coming up with alternative explanations for the rivulet-ridden piles of debris that exclude stores of liquid water and therefore readily accessible life."

https://openalex.org/W1601762764,"The search for geologic features indicative of past or present water is central to Mars exploration programs. As Tanaka explains in his Perspective, such features have tended to be associated with very old (> 1 billion years) regions. However, a study by Malin and Edgett indicates that the youngest geologic features on Mars show signs of fluid discharge and runoff. If the results hold up, then some very unusual event must have occurred in the recent past on Mars."

But at the same time they are also worrying that there may not be a suitable successor to the government-built spacecraft, which is scheduled to operate until 2006, at which time the government plans to turn the reins over to private industry."

https://openalex.org/W1928319535,"Relativistic outflows or ""jets"" are collimated streams of high-energy electrons that emit synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths and have bulk velocities that are a substantial fraction of the speed of light. They trace the outflow of enormous amounts of energy and matter from a central supermassive black hole in distant radio galaxies. As Fender explains in this Perspective, much smaller, more local sources may also produce such jets. Data presented by Paredes et al. point toward association of one such source, a relatively faint x-ray binary, with a gamma-ray source. This and similar pairs may contribute substantially to the production of high-energy particles and photons within our galaxy."

The report highlights the need to better prepare traveling researchers to safeguard secrets and resist such temptations, say the two lawmakers who requested the report and officials at the Department of Energy, which employs the scientists."
