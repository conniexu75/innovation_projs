https://openalex.org/W4210665241,"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021 1 and has multiple mutations in its spike protein 2 . Here we show that the spike protein of Omicron has a higher affinity for ACE2 compared with Delta, and a marked change in its antigenicity increases Omicron’s evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralization. Importantly, the antiviral drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung cells and gut cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication. Omicron spike protein was less efficiently cleaved compared with Delta. The differences in replication were mapped to the entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron pseudotyped virus to specific cell types effectively correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2 , and deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent than Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways 3 demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with greater dependency on cell entry through the endocytic pathway. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta spike. The less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2 is associated with a shift in cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for altered pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4210308999,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with progressively increased transmissibility between humans is a threat to global public health. The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 also evades immunity from natural infection or vaccines1, but it is unclear whether its exceptional transmissibility is due to immune evasion or intrinsic virological properties. Here we compared the replication competence and cellular tropism of the wild-type virus and the D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants in ex vivo explant cultures of human bronchi and lungs. We also evaluated the dependence on TMPRSS2 and cathepsins for infection. We show that Omicron replicates faster than all other SARS-CoV-2 variants studied in the bronchi but less efficiently in the lung parenchyma. All variants of concern have similar cellular tropism compared to the wild type. Omicron is more dependent on cathepsins than the other variants of concern tested, suggesting that the Omicron variant enters cells through a different route compared with the other variants. The lower replication competence of Omicron in the human lungs may explain the reduced severity of Omicron that is now being reported in epidemiological studies, although determinants of severity are multifactorial. These findings provide important biological correlates to previous epidemiological observations."
https://openalex.org/W4210493562,"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has multiple spike protein mutations 1,2 that contribute to viral escape from antibody neutralization 3–6 and reduce vaccine protection from infection 7,8 . The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. Here we assessed the ability of T cells to react to Omicron spike protein in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, or unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients ( n = 70). Between 70% and 80% of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar for Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. In patients who were hospitalized with Omicron infections ( n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those in patients hospitalized in previous waves dominated by the ancestral, Beta or Delta variants ( n = 49). Thus, despite extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies of Omicron, the majority of T cell responses induced by vaccination or infection cross-recognize the variant. It remains to be determined whether well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron contributes to protection from severe COVID-19 and is linked to early clinical observations from South Africa and elsewhere 9–12 ."
https://openalex.org/W4220908383,"The emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent global health concern1. In this study, our statistical modelling suggests that Omicron has spread more rapidly than the Delta variant in several countries including South Africa. Cell culture experiments showed Omicron to be less fusogenic than Delta and than an ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. Although the spike (S) protein of Delta is efficiently cleaved into two subunits, which facilitates cell-cell fusion2,3, the Omicron S protein was less efficiently cleaved compared to the S proteins of Delta and ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in a hamster model, Omicron showed decreased lung infectivity and was less pathogenic compared to Delta and ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Our multiscale investigations reveal the virological characteristics of Omicron, including rapid growth in the human population, lower fusogenicity and attenuated pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W4210272290,"The highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been shown to evade a substantial fraction of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by current vaccines that encode the WA1/2020 spike protein1. Cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, probably contribute to protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection2-6. Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein. Individuals who received the Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable spike-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, which showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and the Omicron variants, including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were 82-84% of the WA1/2020 spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data provide immunological context for the observation that current vaccines still show robust protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantially reduced neutralizing antibody responses7,8."

https://openalex.org/W4210706440,"Implementing precision medicine hinges on the integration of omics data, such as proteomics, into the clinical decision-making process, but the quantity and diversity of biomedical data, and the spread of clinically relevant knowledge across multiple biomedical databases and publications, pose a challenge to data integration. Here we present the Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG), an open-source platform currently comprising close to 20 million nodes and 220 million relationships that represent relevant experimental data, public databases and literature. The graph structure provides a flexible data model that is easily extendable to new nodes and relationships as new databases become available. The CKG incorporates statistical and machine learning algorithms that accelerate the analysis and interpretation of typical proteomics workflows. Using a set of proof-of-concept biomarker studies, we show how the CKG might augment and enrich proteomics data and help inform clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4225589624,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and osteoporosis are two common diseases that may develop as a cause-and-effect relationship since the incidence of osteoporotic fractures is significantly increased in DM patients. However, the pathophysiology of diabetic osteoporosis is yet to be clearly understood. Iron overload has been reported to lead to bone loss and closely related to osteoporosis. In this study, we hypothesized that high glucose and high fat (HGHF) may induce osteoblastic ferroptosis for the pathogenesis of diabetic osteoporosis and explored the possible molecular mechanisms behind. Using the diabetic rat model established by HGHF feeding with a subsequent intraperitoneal injection of a single low dose of streptozocin, we found that the serum ferritin level (a biomarker for body iron store) was significantly elevated in HGHF-fed rats and the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 (inhibitory marker proteins for ferroptosis) was markedly attenuated in the bone tissue of the rats with diabetic bone loss as compared to the normal rats. In an osteoblast cell model, treatment of pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells with high glucose and palmitic acid (HGPA) not only suppressed osteoblast differentiation and mineralization but also triggered ferroptosis-related osteoblastic cell death. m6 A-seq revealed that m6 A methylation on ASK1 was 80.9-fold higher in HGPA-treated cells. The expression of p-ASK1 and p-p38 was also significantly elevated in the HGPA-treated cells. Knockout of METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), one of the major m6 A methyltransferases, in MC3T3-E1 cells not only abrogated HGPA-induced activation of ASK1-p38 signaling pathway but also attenuated the level of ferroptosis. Therefore, HGHF-induced ferroptosis in osteoblasts may be the main cause of osteoporosis in DM via activation of METTL3/ASK1-p38 signaling pathway, and inhibition of ferroptosis in osteoblasts may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetic osteoporosis."

https://openalex.org/W4226077951,"Motor systems must continuously adapt their output to maintain a desired trajectory. While the spinal circuits underlying rhythmic locomotion are well described, little is known about how the network modulates its output strength. A major challenge has been the difficulty of recording from spinal neurons during behavior. Here, we use voltage imaging to map the membrane potential of large populations of glutamatergic neurons throughout the spinal cord of the larval zebrafish during fictive swimming in a virtual environment. We characterized a previously undescribed subpopulation of tonic-spiking ventral V3 neurons whose spike rate correlated with swimming strength and bout length. Optogenetic activation of V3 neurons led to stronger swimming and longer bouts but did not affect tail beat frequency. Genetic ablation of V3 neurons led to reduced locomotor adaptation. The power of voltage imaging allowed us to identify V3 neurons as a critical driver of locomotor adaptation in zebrafish."

https://openalex.org/W4210738474,"PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional small molecules that can simultaneously recruit target proteins and E3 ligases to form a ternary complex, promoting target protein ubiquitination and degradation via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). PROTACs have gained increasing attention in recent years due to certain advantages over traditional therapeutic modalities and enabling targeting of previously ""undruggable"" proteins. To better understand the mechanism of PROTAC-induced Target Protein Degradation (TPD), several computational approaches have recently been developed to study and predict ternary complex formation. However, mounting evidence suggests that ubiquitination can also be a rate-limiting step in PROTAC-induced TPD. Here, we propose a structure-based computational approach to predict target protein ubiquitination induced by cereblon (CRBN)-based PROTACs by leveraging available structural information of the CRL4A ligase complex (CRBN/DDB1/CUL4A/Rbx1/NEDD8/E2/Ub). We generated ternary complex ensembles with Rosetta, modeled multiple CRL4A ligase complex conformations, and predicted ubiquitination efficiency by separating the ternary ensemble into productive and unproductive complexes based on the proximity of the ubiquitin to accessible lysines on the target protein. We validated our CRL4A ligase complex models with published ternary complex structures and additionally employed our modeling workflow to predict ubiquitination efficiencies and sites of a series of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) after treatment with TL12-186, a pan-kinase PROTAC. Our predictions are consistent with CDK ubiquitination and site-directed mutagenesis of specific CDK lysine residues as measured using a NanoBRET ubiquitination assay in HEK293 cells. This work structurally links PROTAC-induced ternary formation and ubiquitination, representing an important step toward prediction of target ""degradability."""
https://openalex.org/W4210255593,"High-definition vision in humans and nonhuman primates is initiated by cone photoreceptors located within a specialized region of the retina called the fovea. Foveal cone death is the ultimate cause of central blindness in numerous retinal dystrophies, including macular degenerative diseases. 3D retinal organoids (ROs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold tremendous promise to model and treat such diseases. To achieve this goal, RO cones should elicit robust and intrinsic light-evoked electrical responses (i.e., phototransduction) akin to adult foveal cones, which has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show strong, graded, repetitive, and wavelength-specific light-evoked responses from RO cones. The photoresponses and membrane physiology of a significant fraction of these lab-generated cones are comparable with those of intact ex vivo primate fovea. These results greatly increase confidence in ROs as potential sources of functional human cones for cell replacement therapies, drug testing, and in vitro models of retinal dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W4210451509,"G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) is poorly characterized but nevertheless has been revealed to have diverse roles in areas including lower gut inflammation and pain. The development of novel reagents and tools will greatly enhance analysis of GPR35 functions in health and disease. Here, we used mass spectrometry, mutagenesis, and [32P] orthophosphate labeling to identify that all five hydroxy-amino acids in the C-terminal tail of human GPR35a became phosphorylated in response to agonist occupancy of the receptor and that, apart from Ser294, each of these contributed to interactions with arretin-3, which inhibits further G protein-coupled receptor signaling. We found that Ser303 was key to such interactions; the serine corresponding to human GPR35a residue 303 also played a dominant role in arrestin-3 interactions for both mouse and rat GPR35. We also demonstrated that fully phospho-site-deficient mutants of human GPR35a and mouse GPR35 failed to interact effectively with arrestin-3, and the human phospho-deficient variant was not internalized from the surface of cells in response to agonist treatment. Even in cells stably expressing species orthologues of GPR35, a substantial proportion of the expressed protein(s) was determined to be immature. Finally, phospho-site-specific antisera targeting the region encompassing Ser303 in human (Ser301 in mouse) GPR35a identified only the mature forms of GPR35 and provided effective sensors of the activation status of the receptors both in immunoblotting and immunocytochemical studies. Such antisera may be useful tools to evaluate target engagement in drug discovery and target validation programs."

https://openalex.org/W4210405090,"Abstract The RNA binding protein LIN28 directly modulates the stability and translation of target mRNAs independently of Let-7; however, the key downstream targets of LIN28 in this process are largely unknown. Here, we revealed that Hippo signaling effector YAP1 functioned as a key downstream regulator of LIN28 to modulate the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties and tumor progressions in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). LIN28 was overexpressed in BC tissues and cell lines, and significantly correlated with poorer overall survivals in patients. Ectopic LIN28 expression enhanced, while knockdown of LIN28A inhibited the CSC-like properties, cell growth and invasive phenotypes of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated LIN28 overexpression significantly induced the expressions of YAP1 downstream genes, while reduced the transcripts of YAP1 upstream kinases, such as MST1/2 and LATS1/2, and knockdown of LIN28A exhibited the opposite effects. Furthermore, constitutive activation of YAP1 in LIN28 knockdown TNBC cells could rescue the cell growth and invasive phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, instead of the dependence of Let-7, LIN28 recruited RNA binding protein MSI2 in a manner dependent on the LIN28 CSD domain and MSI2 RRM domain, to directly induce the mRNA decay of YAP1 upstream kinases, leading to the inhibition of Hippo pathway and activation of YAP1, which eventually gave rise to increased CSC populations, enhanced tumor cell growth and invasive phenotypes. Accordingly, co-upregulations of LIN28 and MSI2 in TNBC tissues were strongly associated with YAP1 protein level and tumor malignance. Taken together, our findings unravel a novel LIN28/MSI2-YAP1 regulatory axis to induce the CSC-like properties, tumor growth and metastasis, independently of Let-7, which may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a subset of TNBC with LIN28 overexpression."

https://openalex.org/W4210444779,"The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that is aberrantly activated in cancer and facilitates metastasis to distant organs, requires coordinated transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. The tumor-suppressive RNA binding protein, hnRNP-E1, regulates splicing and translation of EMT-associated transcripts and it is thought that it plays a major role in the control of epithelial cell plasticity during cancer progression. We have utilized yeast 2 hybrid screening to identify novel hnRNP-E1 interactors that play a role in regulating hnRNP-E1; this approach led to the identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ARIH1. Here, we demonstrate that hnRNP-E1 protein stability is increased upon ARIH1 silencing, whereas, overexpression of ARIH1 leads to a reduction in hnRNP-E1. Reduced ubiquitination of hnRNP-E1 detected in ARIH1 knockdown (KD) cells compared to control suggests a role for ARIH1 in hnRNP-E1 degradation. The identification of hnRNP-E1 as a candidate substrate of ARIH1 led to the characterization of a novel function for this ubiquitin ligase in EMT induction and cancer progression. We demonstrate a delayed induction of EMT and reduced invasion in mammary epithelial cells silenced for ARIH1. Conversely, ARIH1 overexpression promoted EMT induction and invasion. ARIH1 silencing in breast cancer cells significantly attenuated cancer cell stemness in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Finally, we utilized miniTurboID proximity labeling to identify novel ARIH1 interactors that may contribute to ARIH1's function in EMT induction and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4210660549,"Apple tree diseases have perplexed orchard farmers for several years. At present, numerous studies have investigated deep learning for fruit and vegetable crop disease detection. Because of the complexity and variety of apple leaf veins and the difficulty in judging similar diseases, a new target detection model of apple leaf diseases DF-Tiny-YOLO, based on deep learning, is proposed to realize faster and more effective automatic detection of apple leaf diseases. Four common apple leaf diseases, including 1,404 images, were selected for data modeling and method evaluation, and made three main improvements. Feature reuse was combined with the DenseNet densely connected network and further realized to reduce the disappearance of the deep gradient, thus strengthening feature propagation and improving detection accuracy. We introduced Resize and Re-organization (Reorg) and conducted convolution kernel compression to reduce the calculation parameters of the model, improve the operating detection speed, and allow feature stacking to achieve feature fusion. The network terminal uses convolution kernels of 1 × 1, 1 × 1, and 3 × 3, in turn, to realize the dimensionality reduction of features and increase network depth without increasing computational complexity, thus further improving the detection accuracy. The results showed that the mean average precision (mAP) and average intersection over union (IoU) of the DF-Tiny-YOLO model were 99.99% and 90.88%, respectively, and the detection speed reached 280 FPS. Compared with the Tiny-YOLO and YOLOv2 network models, the new method proposed in this paper significantly improves the detection performance. It can also detect apple leaf diseases quickly and effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4210440489,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has severely affected human lives around the world as well as the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against COVID-19 are urgently needed. Here, we screened a library containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds to identify drugs that could target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is indispensable for viral protein maturation and regard as an important therapeutic target. We identified antimalarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ), which is approved for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and malaria prophylaxis, as a top candidate to inhibit Mpro protease activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with TFQ revealed that TFQ noncovalently bound to and reshaped the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro by altering the loop region (residues 139-144) near the catalytic Cys145, which could block the catalysis of its peptide substrates. We also found that TFQ inhibited human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Furthermore, one TFQ derivative, compound 7, showed a better therapeutic index than TFQ on TMPRSS2 and may therefore inhibit the infectibility of SARS-CoV-2, including that of several mutant variants. These results suggest new potential strategies to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 and rising variants."

https://openalex.org/W4210428414,"Treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutation-selective third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as osimertinib has achieved remarkable success in the clinic. However, the immediate challenge is the emergence of acquired resistance, limiting the long-term remission of patients. This study suggests a novel strategy to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib and other third-generation EGFR-TKIs through directly targeting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We found that osimertinib, when combined with Mcl-1 inhibition or Bax activation, synergistically decreased the survival of different osimertinib-resistant cell lines, enhanced the induction of intrinsic apoptosis, and inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumor in vivo. Interestingly, the triple-combination of osimertinib with Mcl-1 inhibition and Bax activation exhibited the most potent activity in decreasing the survival and inducing apoptosis of osimertinib-resistant cells and in suppressing the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumors. These effects were associated with increased activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway evidenced by augmented mitochondrial cytochrome C and Smac release. Hence, this study convincingly demonstrates a novel strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib and other 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs by targeting activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through Mcl-1 inhibition, Bax activation or both, warranting further clinical validation of this strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4226040600,"Dysregulated chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and may be a result of impaired resolution. Thus, restoring levels of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) to promote the resolution of inflammation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for patients with atherosclerosis, in addition to standard clinical care. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the SPM lipids, lipoxin A4 (LXA4 ) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4 ), on neutrophils isolated from patients with atherosclerosis compared with healthy controls. Patients displayed altered endogenous SPM production, and we demonstrated that lipoxin treatment in whole blood from atherosclerosis patients attenuates neutrophil oxidative burst, a key contributor to atherosclerotic development. We found the opposite effect in neutrophils from healthy controls, indicating a potential mechanism whereby lipoxins aid the endogenous neutrophil function in health but reduce its excessive activation in disease. We also demonstrated that lipoxins attenuated upregulation of the high-affinity conformation of the CD11b/CD18 integrin, which plays a central role in clot activation and atherosclerosis. Finally, LXB4 enhanced lymphatic transmigration of human neutrophils isolated from patients with atherosclerosis. This finding is noteworthy, as impaired lymphatic function is now recognized as an important contributor to atherosclerosis. Although both lipoxins modulated neutrophil function, LXB4 displayed more potent effects than LXA4 in humans. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of lipoxins in atherosclerotic disease and demonstrates that the effect of these SPMs may be specifically tailored to the need of the individual."
https://openalex.org/W4210302904,"Mitochondrial dysfunction induces a strong adaptive retrograde signaling response; however, many of the downstream effectors of this response remain to be discovered. Here, we studied the shared transcriptional responses to three different mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors in human primary skin fibroblasts using QuantSeq 3'-RNA-sequencing. We found that genes involved in the mevalonate pathway were concurrently downregulated, irrespective of the respiratory chain complex affected. Targeted metabolomics demonstrated that impaired mitochondrial respiration at any of the three affected complexes also had functional consequences on the mevalonate pathway, reducing levels of cholesterol precursor metabolites. A deeper study of complex I inhibition showed a reduced activity of endoplasmic reticulum-bound sterol-sensing enzymes through impaired processing of the transcription factor Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 2 and accelerated degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol-sensors squalene epoxidase and HMG-CoA reductase. These adaptations of mevalonate pathway activity affected neither total intracellular cholesterol levels nor the cellular free (nonesterified) cholesterol pool. Finally, measurement of intracellular cholesterol using the fluorescent cholesterol binding dye filipin revealed that complex I inhibition elevated cholesterol on intracellular compartments. Taken together, our study shows that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction elevates intracellular free cholesterol levels and therefore attenuates the expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes, which lowers endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, disrupting the metabolic output of the mevalonate pathway. We conclude that intracellular disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis may alter systemic cholesterol management in diseases associated with declining mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W4210489304,"N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V or MGAT5) catalyzes the formation of an N-glycan β1,6-GlcNAc branch on selective target proteins in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in cancer malignancy and autoimmune disease etiology. Several three-dimensional structures of GnT-V were recently solved, and the recognition mechanism of the oligosaccharide substrate was clarified. However, it is still unclear how GnT-V selectively acts on glycoprotein substrates. In this study, we focused on an uncharacterized domain at the N-terminal side of the luminal region (N domain) of GnT-V, which was previously identified in a crystal structure, and aimed to reveal its role in GnT-V action. Using lectin blotting and fluorescence assisted cell sorting analysis, we found that a GnT-VΔN mutant lacking the N domain showed impaired biosynthetic activity in cells, indicating that the N domain is required for efficient glycosylation. To clarify this mechanism, we measured the in vitro activity of purified GnT-VΔN toward various kinds of substrates (oligosaccharide, glycohexapeptide, and glycoprotein) using HPLC and a UDP-Glo assay. Surprisingly, GnT-VΔN showed substantially reduced activity toward the glycoprotein substrates, whereas it almost fully maintained its activity toward the oligosaccharides and the glycopeptide substrates. Finally, docking models of GnT-V with substrate glycoproteins suggested that the N domain could interact with the substrate polypeptide directly. Our findings suggest that the N domain of GnT-V plays a critical role in the recognition of glycoprotein substrates, providing new insights into the mechanism of substrate-selective biosynthesis of N-glycans."

https://openalex.org/W4210706399,"Introduction Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with higher morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in adults. Likewise, antimicrobial resistance has increased in recent decades in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the bacterial isolates, their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia among adult patients in Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods This institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2021. Sociodemographic, clinical, and other relevant data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. A total of 312 sputum specimens were collected using sputum cups and inoculated into blood agar, chocolate agar, mannitol salt agar, and MacConkey agar plates, which were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The bacterial isolates were identified based on Gram staining, colony characteristics, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Inducible clindamycin resistance among the S . aureus isolates was detected by the D-test. Data were entered using EPI data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. P-value ≤ 0.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. Results Of 312 cases, 39.4% (n = 123; 95% CI: 34.1%–44.9%) were found to have culture-confirmed pneumonia. The most common isolates were K . pneumoniae (31.0%, n = 39), S . pneumoniae (26.2%, n = 33), and S . aureus (20.6%, n = 26). The gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to chloramphenicol (100%) and clindamycin (96.6%). Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to gentamicin (87.5%), azithromycin (87.1%), ciprofloxacin (86.6%), and ceftriaxone (79.0%) but highly resistant to ampicillin (100%), followed by tetracycline (87.1%), doxycycline (86.4%), co-trimoxazole (80.6%), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (79.0%). Overall, 72.2% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant to K . pneumoniae (94.9%, n = 37), E . coli (93.8%, n = 15), and S . pneumoniae (72.7%, n = 24). Only, 7.7% of S . aureus isolates showed inducible clindamycin resistance. Aging (AOR: 3.248, 95% CI: 1.001–10.545, p = 0.050), a history of pneumonia (AOR: 7.004, 95% CI: 3.591–13.658, p = 0.001), alcohol use (AOR: 6.614, 95% CI: 3.399–12.872, p &lt; 0.001), and overcrowded living conditions (AOR: 4.348, 95% CI: 1.964–9.624, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with culture-positive sputum. Conclusion and recommendations This study found a high prevalence of bacteria-caused community-acquired pneumonia among adults and low susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracyclines, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Therefore, culture-based bacterial identification and local antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed regularly. Additionally, new insights into vaccine coverage against highly multi-drug resistant bacteria, particularly K . pneumoniae , are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4226185018,"Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes plays a role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, given the association between oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress, our study investigated the role of NRF2-mediated SIRT3 activation in ER stress. SIRT3, a sirtuin, was predicted as the target of NRF2 based on bioinformatic analyses and animal experiments. Nrf2 abrogation diminished mitochondrial DNA content in hepatocytes with Ppargc1α and Cpt1a inhibition, whereas its overexpression enhanced oxygen consumption. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays indicated that NRF2 induced SIRT3 through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) sites comprising the -641 to -631 bp and -419 to -409 bp regions. In tunicamycin-induced ER stress conditions and liver injury animal models following ER stress, NRF2 levels were highly correlated with SIRT3. Nrf2 deficiency enhanced the tunicamycin-mediated induction of CHOP, which was attenuated by Sirt3 overexpression. Further, Sirt3 delivery to hepatocytes in Nrf2 knockout mice prevented tunicamycin from increasing mortality by decreasing ER stress. SIRT3 was upregulated in livers of patients with nonalcoholic liver diseases, whereas lower SIRT3 expression coincided with more severe disease conditions. Taken together, our findings indicated that NRF2-mediated SIRT3 induction protects hepatocytes from ER stress-induced injury, which may contribute to the inhibition of liver disease progression."

Results are presented using frequency, percentage, chi-square, crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.The overall level of adverse events in prehospital setting was 44.2%. Having history of at least one chronic medical illness, [AOR3.2 (95%; CI; 1.11-9.53)]; distance traveled to reach destination facility, [AOR 0.11(95%; CI; 0.02-0.54)]; failure to recognize and administer oxygen to the patient in need of oxygen, [AOR 15.0(95%; CI; 4.0-55.7)]; absent or malfunctioned suctioning device, [AOR 4.0(95%; CI; 1.2-13.0)]; patients handling mishaps, [AOR 12.7(95%; CI; 2.9-56.8)] were the factors associated with adverse events in prehospital transport of COVID-19 patients.There were a significant proportion of adverse events in prehospital care among COVID-19 patients. Most of the adverse events were preventable. There is an urgent need to strengthen prehospital emergency care in Ethiopia by equipping the ambulances with essential and properly functioning equipment and trained manpower. Awareness creation and training of transport staff in identifying potential hazards, at-risk patients, adequate documentation, and patient handling during transport could help to prevent or minimize adverse events in prehospital care."
https://openalex.org/W4210277392,"Active Queue Management (AQM) is recommended by Internet Engineering Task Force to mitigate the bufferbloat phenomenon in the Internet. In this paper, we show the results of comprehensive measurements carried out in our university network, in which a device with an AQM algorithm, designed and programmed for this purpose, was running. The implemented AQM algorithm was based on the dropping function, i.e. arriving packets were dropped randomly, with the probability being a function of the queue length. Several different dropping function forms, proposed in the networking literature, were used, in addition to the classic FIFO queue (no AQM). The experiment lasted over a month, during which the state of the network was measured and recorded several thousand times. This made the results independent of the natural fluctuations of the users' behavior and the network load. Conclusions on the general performance improvement offered by the implemented AQM, as well as the differences in the performance between particular forms of the dropping function, were reached. Some of these conclusions differ from those drawn previously from simulations. This underlines the need for carrying measurements of new AQMs in real, operating networks, with complex, natural traffic."
https://openalex.org/W4210296933,"During Escherichia coli cell division, an intracellular complex of cell division proteins known as the Z-ring assembles at midcell during early division and serves as the site of constriction. While the predominant protein in the Z-ring is the widely conserved tubulin homolog FtsZ, the actin homolog FtsA tethers the Z-ring scaffold to the cytoplasmic membrane by binding to FtsZ. While FtsZ is known to function as a dynamic, polymerized GTPase, the assembly state of its partner, FtsA, and the role of ATP are still unclear. We report that a substitution mutation in the FtsA ATP-binding site impairs ATP hydrolysis, phospholipid vesicle remodeling in vitro, and Z-ring assembly in vivo. We demonstrate by transmission electron microscopy and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer that a truncated FtsA variant, FtsA(ΔMTS) lacking a C-terminal membrane targeting sequence, self assembles into ATP-dependent filaments. These filaments coassemble with FtsZ polymers but are destabilized by unassembled FtsZ. These findings suggest a model wherein ATP binding drives FtsA polymerization and membrane remodeling at the lipid surface, and FtsA polymerization is coregulated with FtsZ polymerization. We conclude that the coordinated assembly of FtsZ and FtsA polymers may serve as a key checkpoint in division that triggers cell wall synthesis and division progression."
https://openalex.org/W4210504730,"As high-conductance calcium- and voltage-dependent potassium channels, BK channels consist of pore-forming, voltage-, and Ca2+-sensing α and auxiliary subunits. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing auxiliary γ subunits potently modulate the voltage dependence of BK channel activation. Despite their dominant size in whole protein masses, the function of the LRR domain in BK channel γ subunits is unknown. We here investigated the function of these LRR domains in BK channel modulation by the auxiliary γ1-3 (LRRC26, LRRC52, and LRRC55) subunits. Using cell surface protein immunoprecipitation, we validated the predicted extracellular localization of the LRR domains. We then refined the structural models of mature proteins on the membrane via molecular dynamic simulations. By replacement of the LRR domain with extracellular regions or domains of non-LRR proteins, we found that the LRR domain is nonessential for the maximal channel-gating modulatory effect but is necessary for the all-or-none phenomenon of BK channel modulation by the γ1 subunit. Mutational and enzymatic blockade of N-glycosylation in the γ1-3 subunits resulted in a reduction or loss of BK channel modulation by γ subunits. Finally, by analyzing their expression in whole cells and on the plasma membrane, we found that blockade of N-glycosylation drastically reduced total expression of the γ2 subunit and the cell surface expression of the γ1 and γ3 subunits. We conclude that the LRR domains play key roles in the regulation of the expression, cell surface trafficking, and channel-modulation functions of the BK channel γ subunits."

https://openalex.org/W4210400497,"Microbial infections have been linked to the onset and severity of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we used a genetic screen for genes involved in protection from infection-associated neurodegeneration and identified the gene mtm-10. We then validated the role of the encoded myotubularin-related protein, MTM-10, in protecting the dendrites of Caenorhabditis elegans from degeneration mediated by oxidative stress or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Further experiments indicated that mtm-10 is expressed in the AWC neurons of C. elegans, where it functions in a cell-autonomous manner to protect the dendrite degeneration caused by pathogen infection. We also confirm that the changes observed in the dendrites of the animals were not because of premature death or overall sickness. Finally, our studies indicated that mtm-10 functions in AWC neurons to preserve chemosensation after pathogen infection. These results reveal an essential role for myotubularin-related protein 10 in the protection of dendrite morphology and function against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress or infection."

https://openalex.org/W4210375636,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate the expression of large cohorts of RNA species to produce programmatic changes in cellular phenotypes. To describe the function of RBPs within a cell, it is key to identify their mRNA-binding partners. This is often done by crosslinking nucleic acids to RBPs, followed by chemical release of the nucleic acid fragments for analysis. However, this methodology is lengthy, which involves complex processing with attendant sample losses, thus large amounts of starting materials and prone to artifacts. To evaluate potential alternative technologies, we tested ""exclusion-based"" purification of immunoprecipitates (IFAST or SLIDE) and report here that these methods can efficiently, rapidly, and specifically isolate RBP-RNA complexes. The analysis requires less than 1% of the starting material required for techniques that include crosslinking. Depending on the antibody used, 50% to 100% starting protein can be retrieved, facilitating the assay of endogenous levels of RBPs; the isolated ribonucleoproteins are subsequently analyzed using standard techniques, to provide a comprehensive portrait of RBP complexes. Using exclusion-based techniques, we show that the mRNA-binding partners for RBP IGF2BP1 in cultured mammary epithelial cells are enriched in mRNAs important for detoxifying superoxides (specifically glutathione peroxidase [GPX]-1 and GPX-2) and mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins. We show that these interactions are functionally significant, as loss of function of IGF2BP1 leads to destabilization of GPX mRNAs and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption. We speculate that this underlies a consistent requirement for IGF2BP1 for the expression of clonogenic activity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W4210402038,"Many anesthetics, including Propofol, have been reported to induce elevation of intracellular calcium, and we were interested to investigate the possible contribution of calcium elevation to the mechanism of the newly approved remimazolam actions. Remimazolam is an intravenous anesthetic first approved in Japan in July 2020, and is thought to exert its anesthetic actions via γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A ) receptors; however, the precise mechanisms of how remimazolam elevates intracellular calcium levels remains unclear. We examined the remimazolam-induced elevation of intracellular calcium using SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, COS-7 cells, HEK293 cells, HeLa cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) loaded with fluorescent dyes for live imaging. We confirmed that high concentrations of remimazolam (greater than 300 μM) elevated intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner in these cells tested. This phenomenon was not influenced by elimination of extracellular calcium. The calcium elevation was abolished when intracellular or intraendoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium was depleted by BAPTA-AM or thapsigargin, respectively, suggesting that calcium was mobilized from the ER. Inhibitors of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)-mediated signals, including U-73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor and xestospongin C, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP 3 R) antagonist, significantly suppressed remimazolam-induced calcium elevation, whereas dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor antagonist, did not influence remimazolam-induced calcium elevation. Meanwhile, live imaging of ER during remimazolam stimulation using ER-tracker showed no morphological changes. These results suggest that high doses of remimazolam increased intracellular calcium concentration in a dose-dependent manner in each cell tested, which was predicted to be caused by calcium mobilization from the ER. In addition, our studies using various inhibitors revealed that this calcium elevation might be mediated by the GPCRs-IP 3 pathway. However, further studies are required to identify which type of GPCRs is involved."
https://openalex.org/W4210688217,"The aim of this study was to uncover the molecular mechanism through which fungicide resistance develops in Podosphaera xanthii, a fungi that causes powdery mildew in hull-less pumpkin. Treatments of inoculated P. xanthii were carried out on leaves of hull-less pumpkin and subsequently treated with kinds of triazole fungicide for seven generations. Resistant strains of P. xanthii thus obtained were evaluated for their resistance levels. The resistance levels of the fungi to four fungicides of were high except that of the propiconazole-resistant strain, which showed moderate resistance. The F7 generations of five resistant strains thus obtained were cultured continuously for five generations without fungicide induction, and their resistance level were found to be relatively stable. The DNA of the sensitive strain and the five kinds of resistant strains were extracted by the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) method and its internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified by using ITS1/ITS4 primer and specific primer F/R and they were sequenced respectively. The DNA sequence comparison of resistant and sensitive strains showed that the base pairs of tebuconazole-resistant strains and flusilazole-resistant strains were mutated, with mutation rates of 4.8% and 1.6%, respectively. The base pairs of the other three resistant strains did not change."
https://openalex.org/W4210697239,"The dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is a key regulator of axon regeneration and degeneration in response to neuronal injury; however, regulatory mechanisms of the DLK function via its interacting proteins are largely unknown. To better understand the molecular mechanism of DLK function, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening analysis and identified FK506-binding protein-like (FKBPL, also known as WAF-1/CIP1 stabilizing protein 39) as a DLK-binding protein. FKBPL binds to the kinase domain of DLK and inhibits its kinase activity. In addition, FKBPL induces DLK protein degradation through ubiquitin-dependent pathways. We further assessed other members in the FKBP protein family and found that FK506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8) also induced DLK degradation. We identified the lysine 271 residue in the kinase domain as a major site of DLK ubiquitination and SUMO3 conjugation and was thus responsible for regulating FKBP8-mediated proteasomal degradation that was inhibited by the substitution of the lysine 271 to arginine. FKBP8-mediated degradation of DLK is mediated by autophagy pathway because knockdown of Atg5 inhibited DLK destabilization. We show that in vivo overexpression of FKBP8 delayed the progression of axon degeneration and suppressed neuronal death after axotomy in sciatic and optic nerves. Taken together, this study identified FKBPL and FKBP8 as novel DLK-interacting proteins that regulate DLK stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal protein degradation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4210503664,"Translation of HAC1 mRNA in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is derepressed when RNase Ire1 removes its intron via nonconventional cytosolic splicing in response to accumulation of unfolded proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The spliced HAC1 mRNA is translated into a transcription factor that changes the cellular gene expression patterns to increase the protein folding capacity of cells. Previously, we showed that a segment of the intronic sequence interacts with the 5'-UTR of the unspliced mRNA, resulting in repression of HAC1 translation at the initiation stage. However, the exact mechanism of translational derepression is not clear. Here, we show that at least 11-base-pairing interactions between the 5'-UTR and intron (UI) are sufficient to repress HAC1 translation. We also show that overexpression of the helicase eukaryotic initiation factor 4A derepressed translation of an unspliced HAC1 mRNA containing only 11-bp interactions between the 5'-UTR and intronic sequences. In addition, our genetic screen identifies that single mutations in the UI interaction site could derepress translation of the unspliced HAC1 mRNA. Furthermore, we show that the addition of 24 RNA bases between the mRNA 5'-cap and the UI interaction site derepressed translation of the unspliced HAC1 mRNA. Together, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for why the cap-proximal UI-RNA duplex inhibits the recruitment of translating ribosomes to HAC1 mRNA, thus keeping mRNA translationally repressed."
https://openalex.org/W4210689573,"Rapid screening and diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 in the emergency department is important for controlling infections. When polymerase chain reaction tests cannot be rapidly performed, rapid antigen testing is often used, albeit with insufficient sensitivity. Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of combining rapid antigen and antibody test results. This was a retrospective review of patients who visited our emergency department between February and May 2021 and underwent rapid antigen, immunoglobulin G antibody, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests. The study included 1,070 patients, of whom 56 (5.2%) tested positive on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of rapid antigen testing were 73.7%, 100.0%, and 0.87, respectively. The combined rapid antigen and antibody test result had improved diagnostic accuracy, with 91.2% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity, and an area under the curve of 0.95.

https://openalex.org/W4210775742,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease associated with worse clinical presentation. However, the current investigation practices in Ethiopia have limitations to demonstrate the scope of the clinical burden. Hence, this study was aimed at assessing the glycemic status and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of persons with T2DM using HbA1c and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP).This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 adults with T2DM from September to November 2019. Demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle data were collected through a face-to-face interview. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records whereas anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed using the WHO protocols. Glycemic status was determined using HbA1c and CHD risk assessed using an atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). Gaussian variables were expressed using mean and standard deviation (SD), Log-normal variables using geometric mean and 95% CI and non- Gaussian variables using median and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were summarized using absolute frequencies and percentages. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with glycemic control with a statistical significance set at 5%.A total of 195 male and 226 female subjects were involved in this study. The results demonstrated that 77% (324) had HbA1c value ≥7% and 87.2% (367) had high atherogenic risk for CHD. Besides, 57% and 67.9% of persons with T2DM had metabolic syndrome according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult treatment panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria, respectively. About 36.8% had one or more comorbidities. Having healthy eating behavior [AOR 1.95; CI 1.11-3.43] and taking metformin [AOR 4.88; CI 1.91-12.44] were associated with better glycemic outcomes.High AIP level concomitant with poor glycemic control indicates increased risk for coronary heart disease among persons with T2DM in Northern Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4210553324,"Hydroxynitrile lyase from Linum usitatissimum (LuHNL) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of cyanogenic glycosides to release hydrogen cyanide upon tissue damage. This enzyme strictly conserves the substrate- and NAD(H)-binding domains of Zn2+-containing alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); however, there is no evidence suggesting that LuHNL possesses ADH activity. Herein, we determined the ligand-free 3D structure of LuHNL and its complex with acetone cyanohydrin and (R)-2-butanone cyanohydrin using X-ray crystallography. These structures reveal that an A-form NAD+ is tightly but not covalently bound to each subunit of LuHNL. The restricted movement of the NAD+ molecule is due to the ""sandwich structure"" on the adenine moiety of NAD+. Moreover, the structures and mutagenesis analysis reveal a novel reaction mechanism for cyanohydrin decomposition involving the cyano-zinc complex and hydrogen-bonded interaction of the hydroxyl group of cyanohydrin with Glu323/Thr65 and H2O/Lys162 of LuHNL. The deprotonated Lys162 and protonated Glu323 residues are presumably stabilized by a partially desolvated microenvironment. In summary, the substrate binding geometry of LuHNL provides insights into the differences in activities of LuHNL and ADH, and identifying this novel reaction mechanism is an important contribution to the study of hydroxynitrile lyases."

Inter- and intra-observer agreement regarding the assessment of 3D bifurcation types were 0.88 and 0.94, respectively. The assessment times of 3D-OCT bifurcation type with OCT and OFDI were within about 30 seconds. 3D-OCT bifurcation types showed the greatest correlation with the distal bifurcation angle assessed by 3D-QCA among the three bifurcation angles (distal bifurcation angle, proximal bifurcation angle and main vessel angle), and the optimal cut-off distal bifurcation angle to predict a perpendicular type bifurcation, as determined by ROC analysis, was 51.0° (AUC 0.773, sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.67). Based on this cut-off value for the distal bifurcation angle (51°), the diagnostic accuracy for perpendicular type bifurcation in cases with a BA ≥ 51° (n = 34) was 70.6% (24/34) and that of the parallel type bifurcation in cases of BA < 51° (n = 26) was 76.9% (20/26).Performing 3D-OCT for assessment of coronary artery bifurcation type is feasible and simple, and can be done in a short time with high reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W4210501882,"In this paper, a Markovian model is constructed to test a flexible manufacturing cell’s (FMC) performance. The considered FMC includes a conveyer belt, robot, and n machines. The conveyer belt delivers the working part to the robot, and the robot picks it up and loads it onto the machines. The movement of a working part from one step to the next depends on the availability of the tool in the next step (i.e., conveyer belt, robot, and machine). Any machine is assumed to potentially fail during the processing time as a result of high loading stresses. First, a Markovian model is constructed for single-machine and double-machine FMCs. Then, a generalized FMC with an n-machine is constructed. The introduced model is illustrated with two numerical examples for both the single- and triple-machine. The Markov chain model can be used to estimate the FMC performance measures (i.e., overall utilization of machines and production rate). It is used to analyze the response of these measures under varying parameters (i.e., conveyor belt delivery rate, robot loading rate, processing rate of a machine, failure rate of a machine, and down machines’ repairing rate). Moreover, an economic model based on the Markov chain model is introduced to analyze the FMC’s net profit under these varying parameters."

https://openalex.org/W4210530666,"Elevated serum urate is the most important causal risk factor for developing gout. However, in longitudinal cohort studies, a small proportion of people with normal urate levels develop gout and the majority of those with high urate levels do not. These observations may be due to subsequent variations in serum urate over time. Our analysis examined whether single or repeat testing of serum urate more accurately predicts incident gout over time. Individual participant data from three publicly-available cohorts were included. Data from paired serum urate measures 3-5 years apart, followed by an assessment of gout incidence 5-6 years from the second urate measure were used to calculate the predictive ability of four measures of serum urate on incident gout: the first measure, the second measure, the average of the two measures, and the highest of the two measures. Participants with prevalent gout prior to the second measure were excluded. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statistics were computed to compare the four measures. A total of 16,017 participants were included across the three cohorts, with a mean follow-up from the first serum urate test of 9.3 years (range 8.9-10.1 years). Overall, there was a small increase in the mean serum urate between the first and second measures (322 μmol/L (5.42 mg/dL) vs. 340 μmol/L (5.71 mg/dL), P<0.001) which were a mean of 3.5 years apart, but the first and second measures were highly correlated (r = 0.81, P<0.001). No differences were observed in the predictive ability of incident gout between the four measures of serum urate measurement with ROC curve AUC statistics ranging between 0.81 (95% confidence intervals: 0.78-0.84) and 0.84 (95% confidence intervals: 0.81-0.87). These data show that repeat serum urate testing is not superior to a single measure of serum urate for prediction of incident gout over approximately one decade."
