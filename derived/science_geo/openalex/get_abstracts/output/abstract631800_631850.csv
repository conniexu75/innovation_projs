https://openalex.org/W2936551248,"Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies can cause severe cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, impeding their therapeutic application. Here we generated a new anti-CD19 CAR molecule (CD19-BBz(86)) derived from the CD19-BBz prototype bearing co-stimulatory 4-1BB and CD3ζ domains. We found that CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells produced lower levels of cytokines, expressed higher levels of antiapoptotic molecules and proliferated more slowly than the prototype CD19-BBz CAR T cells, although they retained potent cytolytic activity. We performed a phase 1 trial of CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cell therapy in patients with B cell lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02842138 ). Complete remission occurred in 6 of 11 patients (54.5%) who each received a dose of 2 × 108-4 × 108 CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells. Notably, no neurological toxicity or CRS (greater than grade 1) occurred in any of the 25 patients treated. No significant elevation in serum cytokine levels after CAR T cell infusion was detected in the patients treated, including in those who achieved complete remission. CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells persistently proliferated and differentiated into memory cells in vivo. Thus, therapy with the new CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells produces a potent and durable antilymphoma response without causing neurotoxicity or severe CRS, representing a safe and potent anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2940999002,"Naturally occurring and psychedelic drug–occasioned experiences interpreted as personal encounters with God are well described but have not been systematically compared. In this study, five groups of individuals participated in an online survey with detailed questions characterizing the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes attributed to their single most memorable God encounter experience (n = 809 Non-Drug, 1184 psilocybin, 1251 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 435 ayahuasca, and 606 N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. The Non-Drug Group was most likely to choose ""God"" as the best descriptor of that which was encountered while the psychedelic groups were most likely to choose ""Ultimate Reality."" Although there were some other differences between non-drug and the combined psychedelic group, as well as between the four psychedelic groups, the similarities among these groups were most striking. Most participants reported vivid memories of the encounter experience, which frequently involved communication with something having the attributes of being conscious, benevolent, intelligent, sacred, eternal, and all-knowing. The encounter experience fulfilled a priori criteria for being a complete mystical experience in approximately half of the participants. More than two-thirds of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. These experiences were rated as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant lifetime experiences, with moderate to strong persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to these experiences. Among the four groups of psychedelic users, the psilocybin and LSD groups were most similar and the ayahuasca group tended to have the highest rates of endorsing positive features and enduring consequences of the experience. Future exploration of predisposing factors and phenomenological and neural correlates of such experiences may provide new insights into religious and spiritual beliefs that have been integral to shaping human culture since time immemorial."
https://openalex.org/W2939112498,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a highly conserved and essential cellular process in eukaryotic cells, but its dynamic and vital nature makes it challenging to study using classical genetics tools. In contrast, although small molecules can acutely and reversibly perturb CME, the few chemical CME inhibitors that have been applied to plants are either ineffective or show undesirable side effects. Here, we identify the previously described endosidin9 (ES9) as an inhibitor of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) function in both Arabidopsis and human cells through affinity-based target isolation, in vitro binding studies and X-ray crystallography. Moreover, we present a chemically improved ES9 analog, ES9-17, which lacks the undesirable side effects of ES9 while retaining the ability to target CHC. ES9 and ES9-17 have expanded the chemical toolbox used to probe CHC function, and present chemical scaffolds for further design of more specific and potent CHC inhibitors across different systems. Affinity-based target isolation and X-ray crystallography enabled identification of the non-protonophore ES9-17 as an inhibitor of the clathrin heavy chain in plants, enabling disruption of endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2941062192,"Introduction: 
Frozen shoulder is a common, fibro-proliferative disease characterised by the insidious onset of pain and progressively restricted range of shoulder movement.

Despite the prevalence of this disease, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of this debilitating disease. Previous studies have identified increased myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation, immune cell influx and dysregulated cytokine production. We hypothesised that subpopulations within the fibroblast compartment may take on an activated phenotype, thus initiating the inflammatory processes observed in frozen shoulder. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the presence and possible pathogenic role of known stromal activation proteins in Frozen shoulder,

Methods: 
Shoulder capsule samples were collected from 10 patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder and 10 patients undergoing shoulder stabilisation surgery. Fibroblast activation marker expression (CD248, CD146, VCAM and PDPN, FAP) was quantified using immunohistochemistry. Control and diseased fibroblasts were cultured for in vitro studies from capsule biopsies from instability and frozen shoulder surgeries, respectively. The inflammatory profile and effects of IL-1β upon diseased and control fibroblasts was assessed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and qPCR.

Results: 
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of fibroblast activation markers CD248, CD146, VCAM and PDPN in the frozen shoulder group compared with control (p < 0.05). Fibroblasts cultured from diseased capsule produced elevated levels of inflammatory protein (IL-6, IL-8 & CCL-20) in comparison to control fibroblasts. Exposing control fibroblasts to an inflammatory stimuli, (IL-1s) significantly increased stromal activation marker transcript and protein expression (CD248, PDPN and VCAM).

Conclusions: 
These results show that fibroblasts have an activated phenotype in frozen shoulder and this is associated with inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Furthermore, it supports the hypothesis that activated fibroblasts may be involved in regulating the inflammatory and fibrotic processes involved in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2941691446,"Introduction The concept of continuum of care has gained attention as measures to improve maternal, newborn, and child health. However, little is known about the factors associated with the coverage level of continuum of care in Lao PDR. Therefore, this study was conducted 1) to investigate the coverage level of continuum of care and 2) to identify barriers and promoting factors that are associated with mothers’ continuation in receiving services in rural Lao PDR. Methods A community-based, cross sectional study was conducted in a rural district in Khammouane Province, Lao PDR, using a structured questionnaire. The outcome to the express continuum of care was assessed by the modified composite coverage index (CCI) that reflects ten maternal and child health services. Results In total, 263 mothers were included in the final analyses. Only 6.8% of mothers continued to receive all MNCH services. Five factors were shown to have statistically significant associations with modified CCI score: higher educational attainment (B = 0.070, p<0.001), being a farmer (B = -0.078, p = 0.003), receiving the first antenatal care within the first trimester (B = 0.109, p<0.001), longer distance from district hospital (B = -0.012, p<0.001), and discussion with husband or family members (B = 0.057, p = 0.022). Conclusions In this study, we introduced the modified CCI to better explain the utilization of preventive maternal and child health services along with the continuum of care. By utilizing the modified CCI, we identified five factors as determinants of continuum of care. Furthermore, new and modifiable promoting factors were identified for continuum of care: receiving the first antenatal care within the first trimester and family and male involvement. Such demand side actions should be encouraged to improve the continuity of MNCH service use."

https://openalex.org/W2941841852,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been a notable etiological agent of acute respiratory infection in humans, but it was not discovered until 2001, because HMPV replicates only in a limited number of cell lines and the cytopathic effect (CPE) is often mild. To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPVGFP). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains. In addition, unique A2b clade HMPV strains with a 180-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (HMPV A2b180nt-dup strains) have recently been detected. In this study, we re-evaluated and compared the cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains, including the novel HMPV A2b180nt-dup strains, and six recombinant HMPVGFP strains, including the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b180nt-dup strain, MG0256-EGFP. Our data demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells generally showed the highest infectivity with any clinical isolates and recombinant HMPVGFP strains. Other human-derived cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) showed certain levels of infectivity with HMPV, but these were significantly lower than those of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene. Thus, these variations in suboptimal cell lines are likely intrinsic to particular HMPV strains."
https://openalex.org/W2951622872,"Late bilinguals often report less emotional involvement in their second language, a phenomenon called reduced emotional resonance in L2. The present study measured pupil dilation in response to high- versus low-arousing words (e.g., riot vs. swamp) in German-English and Finnish-English late bilinguals, both in their first and in their second language. A third sample of English monolingual speakers (tested only in English) served as a control group. To improve on previous research, we controlled for lexical confounds such as length, frequency, emotional valence, and abstractness–both within and across languages. Results showed no appreciable differences in post-trial word recognition judgements (98% recognition on average), but reliably stronger pupillary effects of the arousal manipulation when stimuli were presented in participants’ first rather than second language. This supports the notion of reduced emotional resonance in L2. Our findings are unlikely to be due to differences in stimulus-specific control variables or to potential word-recognition difficulties in participants’ second language. Linguistic relatedness between first and second language (German-English vs. Finnish-English) was also not found to have a modulating influence."

The aim of this study was to detect genomic CNV regions (CNVR) in Valle del Belice dairy sheep population and to identify those affecting milk production traits. The GO analysis identified possible candidate genes and pathways related to the selected traits. We identified CNVs in 416 individuals genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip array. The CNV association using a correlation-trend test model was examined with the Golden Helix SVS 8.7.0 tool. Significant CNVs were detected when their adjusted p-value was <0.01 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. We identified 7,208 CNVs, which gave 365 CNVRs after aggregating overlapping CNVs. Thirty-one CNVRs were significantly associated with one or more traits included in the analysis. All CNVRs, except those on OAR19, overlapped with quantitative trait loci (QTL), even if they were not directly related to the traits of interest. A total of 222 genes were annotated within the significantly associated CNVRs, most of which played important roles in biological processes related to milk production and health-related traits. Identification of the genes in the CNVRs associated with the studied traits will provide the basis for further investigation of their role in the metabolic pathways related to milk production and health traits."
https://openalex.org/W2941676638,"Introduction Measurement of ventilatory efficiency, defined as minute ventilation per unit carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2), by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has been proposed as a screen for hyperventilation syndrome (HVS). However, increased VE/VCO2 may be associated with other disorders which need to be distinguished from HVS. A more specific marker of HVS by CPET would be clinically useful. We hypothesized ventilatory control during exercise is abnormal in patients with HVS. Methods Patients who underwent CPET from years 2015 through 2017 were retrospectively identified and formed the study group. HVS was defined as dyspnea with respiratory alkalosis (pH >7.45) at peak exercise with absence of acute or chronic respiratory, heart or psychiatric disease. Healthy patients were selected as controls. For comparison the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used. Data are summarized as mean ± SD or median (IQR); p<0.05 was considered significant. Results Twenty-nine patients with HVS were identified and 29 control subjects were selected. At rest, end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) was 27 mmHg (25–30) for HVS patients vs. 30 mmHg (28–32); in controls (p = 0.05). At peak exercise PETCO2 was also significantly lower (27 ± 4 mmHg vs. 35 ± 4 mmHg; p<0.01) and VE/VCO2 higher ((38 (35–43) vs. 31 (27–34); p<0.01)) in patients with HVS. In contrast to controls, there were minimal changes of PETCO2 (0.50 ± 5.26 mmHg vs. 6.2 ± 4.6 mmHg; p<0.01) and VE/VCO2 ((0.17 (-4.24–6.02) vs. -6.6 (-11.4-(-2.8)); p<0.01)) during exercise in patients with HVS. The absence of VE/VCO2 and PETCO2 change during exercise was specific for HVS (83% and 93%, respectively). Conclusion Absence of VE/VCO2 and PETCO2 change during exercise may identify patients with HVS."
https://openalex.org/W2942445581,"A potted soil experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) residue on the growth and photosynthesis of seedlings of a local cucumber variety (Xia Feng No.1). When the residue of bensulfuron-methyl in soil exceeded 50μg kg-1, it significantly inhibited the growth of cucumber, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity of cucumber. BSM treatment caused significant decreases in the biomass, chlorophyll content, net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, photosystem II (PSII) maximum quantum yield, actual quantum yield, photochemical quenching coefficient, and electron transport rate in cucumber seedlings, but increased the minimal fluorescence yield and dark respiration rate. Moreover, comparisons of the patterns of absorbed light energy partitioning revealed that the fractions of excess and thermally dissipated energy increased with rising concentrations of the BSM residue, but the fraction of PSII photochemistry declined. The BSM residues caused reversible destruction in the PSII reaction centers and decreased the proportion of available excitation energy used in PSII photochemistry. The results suggested that rice or wheat fields sprayed with BSM will not be suitable for planting cucumbers in succession or rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2941010818,"Magnetotactic bacteria biomineralize intracellular magnetic nanocrystals surrounded by a lipid bilayer called magnetosomes. Due to their unique characteristics, magnetite magnetosomes are promising tools in Biomedicine. However, the uptake, persistence, and accumulation of magnetosomes within mammalian cells have not been well studied. Here, the endocytic pathway of magnetite magnetosomes and their effects on human cervix epithelial (HeLa) cells were studied by electron microscopy and high spatial resolution nano-analysis techniques. Transmission electron microscopy of HeLa cells after incubation with purified magnetosomes showed the presence of magnetic nanoparticles inside or outside endosomes within the cell, which suggests different modes of internalization, and that these structures persisted beyond 120 h after internalization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectra of internalized magnetosome crystals showed no structural or chemical changes in these structures. Although crystal morphology was preserved, iron oxide crystalline particles of approximately 5 nm near internalized magnetosomes suggests that minor degradation of the original mineral structures might occur. Cytotoxicity and microscopy analysis showed that magnetosomes did not result in any apparent effect on HeLa cells viability or morphology. Based on our results, magnetosomes have significant biocompatibility with mammalian cells and thus have great potential in medical, biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2942134439,"Natural genetic variation can determine the outcome of an infection, and often reflects the co-evolutionary battle between hosts and pathogens. We previously found that a natural variant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from Hawaii (HW) has increased resistance against natural microsporidian pathogens in the Nematocida genus, when compared to the standard laboratory strain of N2. In particular, HW animals can clear infection, while N2 animals cannot. In addition, HW animals have lower levels of initial colonization of Nematocida inside intestinal cells, compared to N2. Here we investigate how this natural variation in resistance relates to autophagy. We found that there is much better targeting of autophagy-related machinery to parasites under conditions where they are cleared. In particular, ubiquitin targeting to Nematocida cells correlates very well with their subsequent clearance in terms of timing, host strain and age, as well as species of Nematocida. Furthermore, clearance correlates with targeting of the LGG-2/LC3 autophagy protein to parasite cells, with HW animals having much more efficient targeting of LGG-2 to parasite cells than N2 animals. Surprisingly, however, we found that LGG-2 is not required to clear infection. Instead, we found that LGG-2/LC3 regulates Nematocida colonization inside intestinal cells. Interestingly, LGG-2/LC3 regulates intracellular colonization only in the HW strain, and not in N2. Altogether these results demonstrate that there is natural genetic variation in an LGG-2-dependent process that regulates microsporidia colonization inside intestinal cells, although not microsporidia clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2941502739,"Background Procalcitonin is a biomarker that supports clinical decision-making on when to initiate and discontinue antibiotic therapy. Several cost (-effectiveness) analyses have been conducted on Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship, but none mainly based on US originated data. Objective To compare effectiveness and costs of a Procalcitonin-algorithm versus standard care to guide antibiotic prescription for patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of suspected sepsis or lower respiratory tract infection in the US. Methods A previously published health economic decision model was used to compare the costs and effects of Procalcitonin-guided care. The analysis considered the societal and hospital perspective with a time horizon covering the length of hospital stay. The main outcomes were total costs per patient, including treatment costs and productivity losses, the number of patients with antibiotic resistance or C.difficile infections, and costs per antibiotic day avoided. Results Procalcitonin -guided care for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis and lower respiratory tract infection is associated with a reduction in antibiotic days, a shorter length of stay on the regular ward and the intensive care unit, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and fewer patients at risk for antibiotic resistant or C.difficile infection. Total costs in the Procalcitonin-group compared to standard care were reduced by 26.0% in sepsis and 17.7% in lower respiratory tract infection (total incremental costs of −$11,311 per patient and −$2,867 per patient respectively). Conclusions Using a Procalcitonin-algorithm to guide antibiotic use in sepsis and hospitalised lower respiratory tract infection patients is expected to generate cost-savings to the hospital and lower rates of antibiotic resistance and C.difficile infections."

To this end, we estimate the effect of host countries' institutions on greenfield FDI, using a gravity equation for a dataset that covers 182 countries during 2003-2012. Our findings confirm that compliance to rule of law, lack of corruption, political stability and democracy could boost new FDI links through the extensive margin. Our results could not rule out the ""oil curse"", meaning that oil producers attract fewer new greenfield projects than similar countries without oil. Unlike other studies, we show that the impact of institutions is not necessarily undermined by the presence of natural resources."
https://openalex.org/W2942024763,"Obesity is connected to the activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in both adipocytes and macrophages located in adipose tissues. The nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a central molecule involved in inflammatory pathways linked to the pathology of different complex metabolic disorders. Investigating the gene expression data in the adipose tissue would potentially unravel disease relevant gene interactions. The present study is aimed at creating a signature molecular network and at prioritizing the potential biomarkers interacting with NF-κB family of proteins in obesity using system biology approaches. The dataset GSE88837 associated with obesity was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical analysis represented the differential expression of a total of 2650 genes in adipose tissues (p = <0.05). Using concepts like correlation, semantic similarity, and theoretical graph parameters we narrowed down genes to a network of 23 genes strongly connected with NF-κB family with higher significance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 21 of 23 target genes of NF-κB were found to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Interestingly, GEM and PPP1R13L were predicted as novel genes which may act as potential target or biomarkers of obesity as they occur with other 21 target genes with known obesity relationship. Our study concludes that NF-κB and prioritized target genes regulate the inflammation in adipose tissues through several molecular signaling pathways like NF-κB, PI3K-Akt, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, angiogenesis and cytokine pathways. This integrated system biology approaches can be applied for elucidating functional protein interaction networks of NF-κB protein family in different complex diseases. Our integrative and network-based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2940573450,"Background Aging changes the aorta in length, tortuosity and diameter. This is relevant in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and in the long term follow up. Methods and results Two groups of hundred patients < 65 years and hundred patients ≥ 65 years, with no vascular diseases were made. Thin cut CT scans were analyzed with 3Mensio Vascular software and the following measurements were collected; tortuosity index, curvature ratio, maximum tortuosity in degrees and the level of vertebrae of the maximum tortuosity. The descending thoracic aorta (DTA) was analyzed and was divided into four zones of equal length. Subjects were divided into three groups based on their maximum tortuosity value: low (< 30°), moderate (30° – 60°) and high (> 60°). A linear regression model was built to test the effect of age and gender on tortuosity. Tortuosity was more pronounced in the ≥ 65 compared to the < 65 group (tortuosity index: 1.05 vs. 1.14, respectively; p < 0.001), curvature ratio (1.00 vs. 1.01; p < 0.001), maximum tortuosity (22.24 vs. 27.26; p < 0.001), and group of angulation (low vs. low; p < 0.001). Additionally, the location of maximum tortuosity was further distal for the ≥ 65 group (level of vertebrae; 5.00 vs. 5.00; p < 0.001), and zone of maximum tortuosity (4A vs. 4A; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between male and female subjects. Conclusion Normal DTA tortuosity increases with age. This is important to understand natural aging and for TEVAR planning and follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2942009271,"Background Medical crowdfunding is a growing phenomenon, and newspapers are publishing on the topic. This research analyzed how illness-related crowdfunding and crowdfunding campaigns have recently been represented in newspapers that are popular in the United States and Canada. Methods A sample of 336 articles about medical crowdfunding published during the two year time period from October 7, 2015 to October 6, 2017 was produced using a Factiva search of the English language newspapers with the largest Canadian and United States readership. A coding frame was developed for and applied to the sample to analyze content. Results Articles portrayed crowdfunding campaigns positively (43.75%) and neutrally (47.92%), but rarely negatively (4.76%). Articles mostly mentioned the crowdfunding phenomenon with a neutral characterization (93.75%). Few (8.63%) articles mentioned ethical issues with the phenomenon of crowdfunding. Ailments most commonly precipitating the need for a campaign included cancer (49.11%) and rare disease (as stated by the article, 36.01%). Most articles (83.04%) note where donations and contributions can be made, and 59.23% included a hyperlink to an online crowdfunding campaign website. Some articles (26.49%) mentioned a specific monetary goal for the fundraising campaign. Of the 70 (20.83%) articles that indicated the treatment sought may be inefficacious, was unproven, was experimental or lacked regulatory approval, 56 (80.00%) noted where contributions can be made and 36 (51.43%) hyperlinked directly to an online crowdfunding campaign. Conclusions Crowdfunding campaigns are portrayed positively much more often than negatively, many articles promote campaigns for unproven therapies, and links directly to crowdfunding campaign webpages are present in most articles. Overall, crowdfunding is often either implicitly or explicitly endorsed."
https://openalex.org/W2941109108,"For patients, the social and emotional repercussions of stroke include shame, personality changes, and upheavals experienced by the couple (i.e. patient and main family caregiver). These impacts on the couple ‘patient/family caregiver’ are scarcely documented. Focusing on the perceptions of the patients and the family caregivers living at home, two years after a stroke occurrence, the aims of the study were to analyse the concordance of attitudes towards the emotional and social repercussions of stroke and to determine the profiles of the differing dyads. Two researchers conducted separate face-to-face structured interviews with stroke survivors and their family caregivers. Eleven items, identified through a content analysis of interviews and after a qualitative process of generating questionnaire items, assessed the commonly experienced impact of stroke on the family, the social repercussions of stroke, and its emotional effects on the stroke survivors. The kappa concordance coefficient was used to determine the response convergence between patients and family caregivers. Four items, selected by a panel of experts, were included in logistic regressions (i.e., demographic characteristics and patients’ impaired functions) to identify the differing dyadic profiles. Family caregivers’ and patients’ attitudes towards the social repercussions of stroke were similar. Patients with motor deficiencies tended to underestimate the upheaval brought to their couple by stroke, whereas caregivers of language-impaired patients tended to underestimate their feelings of shame and demeaning. Communication disturbances, but also residual physical disabilities in stroke survivors, may affect the understanding of each other’s attitudes within dyads. In order to avoid dysfunctional relationships between family caregivers and patients, healthcare professionals need to pay special attention to this issue, especially in cases of aphasia and motor deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2938876200,"Subjective decisions play a vital role in human behavior because, while often grounded in fact, they are inherently based on personal beliefs that can vary broadly within and between individuals. While these properties set subjective decisions apart from many other sensorimotor processes and are of wide sociological impact, their single-neuronal basis in humans is unknown. Here we find cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) that reflect variations in the subjective decisions of humans when performing opinion-based tasks. These neurons changed their activities gradually as the participants transitioned between choice options but also reflected their unique point of conversion at equipoise. Focal disruption of the dlPFC, by contrast, diminished gradation between opposing decisions but had little effect on sensory perceptual choices or their motor report. These findings suggest that the human dlPFC plays an important role in subjective decisions and propose a mechanism for mediating their variation during opinion formation."
https://openalex.org/W2940571250,"A decade long study was conducted to investigate the ecological, biological, and temporal conditions that affect concentrations of Vibrio spp. bacteria in a well-studied lagoonal estuary. Water samples collected from the Neuse River Estuary in eastern North Carolina from 2004–2014 (with additional follow-up samples from Fall of 2018) were analyzed to determine Vibrio spp. concentrations, as well as the concentrations of inorganic and organic nutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, phytoplankton biomass, and a wide range of other physio-chemical estuarine parameters. A significant increase in Vibrio spp. was observed to occur in the estuary over the examined period. Strikingly, over this long duration study period, this statistically significant increase in total culturable Vibrio spp. concentrations does not appear to be correlated with changes in salinity, temperature, or dissolved oxygen, the three most commonly cited influential factors that predict estuarine Vibrio spp. abundance. Furthermore, shorter term (~3 years) data on specific Vibrio species (V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus)show that while Vibrio spp. are increasing overall as a genus, the numbers of some key potentially pathogenic species are decreasing as a part of the total population, further supporting the concept that quantification of the entire genus is not a worthwhile use of resources toward predicting levels of specific potentially pathogenic species of public health concern. The significant increase in this concentration of Vibrio spp. in the studied estuary appears to be related to nitrogen and carbon in the system, indicating a continued need for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2941446639,"Purpose Tear secretion is critical for maintenance of healthy ocular surface and vision. Most of normal subjects and dry eye patients feel worsening of ocular dryness in the afternoon, however, diurnal variation of tear meniscus volume has not been directly measured because there was no appropriate method. We used a simple, non-invasive technique, tear strip meniscometry (SM) by self-examination. Previous investigations indicated the values of SM correlated strongly with those of the Schirmer test, tests of tear break up time, and tear meniscus height measurement by anterior optical coherence tomography. The purpose of this study was to capture diurnal variation of aqueous availability at the tear meniscus by measuring wetted length using SM through self-examination. Methods Thirty-six medical personnel (mean age; 35.7 years) participated and SM self-examination was performed using a mirror seven times a day. The strip is applied for 5 seconds to the lateral side of the lower lid tear meniscus without touching the ocular surface. Results The measured SM value was the highest upon awakening (4.44 ± 3.14 mm) and gradually decreased in the evening; 3.81 ± 3.12 at 9:00, 3.31 ± 2.72* at 12:00, 2.89 ± 1.88* at 15:00, 2.92 ± 1.87* at 18:00, 2.78 ± 1.85* at 21:00, and 2.89 ± 1.75* at bedtime with statistical significance compared to the value upon awakening (*P < 0.05, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test). Proportion of number of subjects with low SM value (< 4 mm) to total number of subjects was 52.8% upon awakening and 83.3% at 21:00, and gradually increased toward evening. Conclusion Our results could identify diurnal variation of tear meniscus volume in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2941609518,"Landscapes composed of agricultural land mixed with forest are desirable since they provide a wide range of diversified ecosystem services, unlike specialized agricultural landscapes, but that creates a trade-off between these land uses since wildlife usually feed on crops and reduce yields. In Nordic countries, where human population density is low and game hunting can be a viable economic alternative, mixed landscape systems are particularly interesting. To evaluate the economic sustainability of such systems we need to quantify wildlife damage to crops. One important species, being popular among Swedish hunters and therefore economically valuable, is fallow deer (Dama dama). Our objective was to evaluate the economic sustainability of mixed landscape systems including cultivated fields and commercial hunting of fallow deer. We studied the effects of excluding fallow deer by using 86 exclosures and adjacent plots in winter wheat and oat fields in south-west Sweden. We analyzed yield losses and interactions between spatial and temporal grazing patterns, anthropogenic landscape features, and topological characteristics of the landscape. We found that animals avoided exposed spots, irrespective of distance from human activity. We also found a seasonal grazing pattern related to the different growing periods of winter wheat (more grazed, emerging in autumn) and spring oat (less grazed, emerging in spring). We then compared the costs of crop damage against the commercial value of fallow deer hunting. The damage amounted to 375 ±196 € ha-1 for wheat and 152 ±138 € ha-1 for oat, corresponding to a total cost per animal of 82.7 ±81.0 €, while each animal had an estimated market value of approximately 100 €. Therefore the value of fallow deer presence compensated for the associated cost of crop damage. Profit could be further improved in this case by adopting additional management strategies. In general our study confirmed the economic feasibility of this particular mixed land management."
https://openalex.org/W2942441722,"The plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum exhibits strong, periodic flow of cytoplasm through the veins of its network. In the special case of mesoplasmodia, a newly described starvation-induced, shape-constant morphotype, this periodic endoplasm streaming is the basis of locomotion. Furthermore, we presume that cytoplasm flow is also involved in signal transmission and signal processing. Mesoplasmodia motility resembles amoeboid locomotion. In contrast to other amoebae, however, mesoplasmodia move without extending pseudopods and retain a coherent, fan-shaped morphology throughout their steady locomotion. Attaining sizes of up to 2 mm2, mesoplasmodia are also much bigger than other amoebae. We characterize this particular type of locomotion and identify patterns of movement. By using the analogy between pulsatile fluid flow through a network of elastic tubes and electrical circuits, we build a lumped model that explains observed fluid flow patterns. Essentially, the mesoplasmodium acts as a low-pass filter, permitting only low-frequency oscillations to propagate from back to front. This frequency selection serves to optimize flow and reduces power dissipation. Furthermore, we introduce a distributed element into the lumped model to explain cell polarization during the onset of chemotaxis: Biochemical cues (internal or external) lead to a local softening of the actin cortex, which in turn causes an increased flow of cytoplasm into that area and, thus, a net forward movement. We conclude that the internal actin-enclosed vein network gives the slime mold a high measure of control over fluid transport, especially by softening or hardening, which in turn leads to polarization and net movement."
https://openalex.org/W2940825498,"The significance of flu prediction is that the appropriate preventive and control measures can be taken by relevant departments after assessing predicted data; thus, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. In this paper, three flu prediction models, based on twitter and US Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) data, are proposed (models 1-3) to verify the factors that affect the spread of the flu. In this work, an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of Support Vector Regression (IPSO-SVR) was proposed. The IPSO-SVR was trained by the independent and dependent variables of the three models (models 1-3) as input and output. The trained IPSO-SVR method was used to predict the regional unweighted percentage ILI (%ILI) events in the US. The prediction results of each model are analyzed and compared. The results show that the IPSO-SVR method (model 3) demonstrates excellent performance in real-time prediction of ILIs, and further highlights the benefits of using real-time twitter data, thus providing an effective means for the prevention and control of flu."
https://openalex.org/W2940482037,"Background In Nepal, since 2004, 19,388 people living with HIV (PLHIV) have been enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The aim of this study was to measure mortality rate and to identify predictors of mortality in adult (≥15 years) PLHIV who initiated ART between 2004 and 2013 in five large ART centers of Nepal. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 3,799 (60.5% male) adult PLHIV uses secondary data collected from standard ART registers. Time from ART initiation (baseline) to death or censoring (loss to follow-up or December 31, 2013) was assessed. Mortality rates per 100 person-years were calculated. Kaplan-Meier models were used to estimate the probability of mortality over time. Predictors of mortality were determined using Cox-regression models. Results The overall mortality rate was 6.98 (95% CI: 6.46–7.54) per 100 person-years, 4.11 (95% CI: 3.53–4.79) in females and 9.14 (95% CI: 8.36–9.99) in males. Mortality rates were higher in early months after ART initiation, particularly in the first three months. Baseline predictors of mortality were ART center, male gender (adjusted HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69–2.57), residence outside the ART district (AHR = 1.45, 95% CI:1.19–1.76), World Health Organization clinical stage III (AHR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13–2.46) and IV (AHR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.45–3.36), bedridden <50% time in the last month (AHR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.52–2.41), bedridden >50% time in the last month (AHR = 3.82, 95% CI: 2.95–4.94), lower bodyweight/kg (AHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03–1.05), CD4 count <150 cell/mm3 (AHR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.05–4.34) and treatment not switched to second-line regimen (AHR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.35–6.90). Conclusions Mortality rates were higher soon after ART initiation, particularly in males and gradually decreased over time. Poor baseline clinical characteristics were significantly associated with higher mortality. Increased ART coverage with decentralization of sites to lower levels including community dispensing, differentiated and improved service delivery and initiation of ART at a less advanced disease stage may reduce early mortality."

We recruited 153 women for a cross-sectional study (112 HIV-uninfected and 41 HIV-infected) who sought health services. Anal and cervical scrapings and cervico-vaginal self-collection samples were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction methods were used for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A syphilis test was also performed. Risk factors for STIs were identified by multivariate analysis. The overall prevalence of STIs was 30.4% (34/112) in HIV-uninfected women and 24.4% (10/41) in HIV-infected women. Anogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection was the most prevalent in both groups of women (20.5% vs 19.5%). There was significant agreement for each STI between self-collected and clinician-collected samples: 91.7%, kappa 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.85 for Chlamydia trachomatis; 99.2%, kappa 0.85, 95% CI 0.57–1.00 for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 97.7%, kappa 0.39, 95% CI -0.16–0.94 for Trichomonas vaginalis; and 94.7%, kappa 0.51, 95% CI 0.20–0.82 for Mycoplasma genitalium. Women with human papillomavirus had coinfection or multiple infections with other STIs. Risk factors for STIs were being ≤ 25 years old, being employed or a student, reporting a history of STI and having a positive HPV test. A high prevalence of STIs in women in the Tapajós region was found. Cervico-vaginal self-collection is a useful tool for STI screening and can be used in prevention control programs in low-resource settings, such as in northern Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2941341944,"Pear psylla, Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang & Li) are present as two seasonal morphotypes in pear orchards where they, suck phloem sap, defoliate pear trees, and cause fruit russet. Despite the importance of natural enemies in psyllid control, the interactions between predators and the two seasonal morphotypes of psyllids remain poorly documented. Here we determined the predation efficiencies of the Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) on the two psyllid morphotypes. Predation of H. axyridis on both morphotypes conformed to a Type II functional response: the proportion of consumed psyllids decreased with increasing prey densities. Predation efficiency of H. axyridis against the winterforms increased with temperature when measured from 8 to 25°C. Predation rate on the summerforms was significantly higher than that of the winterforms. This was linked to smaller body size, higher soluble protein level, thinner cuticle, and lower chitin content of summerform psyllids compared to winterform psyllids. Predation capacities of H. axyridis on both morphotypes indicated its potential as a biocontrol agent in psyllids management. Predation efficiency was higher on summerforms, likely due to the difference in body size, exoskeleton fragility, and nutritional value between the two morphotypes. Due to the Type II functional response of H. axyridis to both morphotypes of pear psylla, application of H. axyridis in pear orchards under suitable temperatures could be taken into consideration for suppression of C. chinensis, although further experiments conducted in field conditions are needed to validate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2942159799,"Purpose The aim of this study was to assess knowledge regarding cataract and associated factors among adults in Gondar town Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 836 adults age ≥18years, using multi-stage systematic random sampling technique, in Gondar town Northwest Ethiopia from April 15-May 7, 2017. Data were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaires through face to face interview. The collected data was entered to Epi info version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Binary logistic regression was used to identify associated factors. Those variables with p-value <0.05 and confidence interval ≠ 1 in multivariable logistic regression were considered as statistically significant factors for knowledge regarding cataract. Result Among 845 eligible adults, 98.9% (836) of them were fully participated. The median age of participants was 28 years with an interquartile range of 17 years. Of the total participants, 67.2% (562) of them had awareness about cataract [95% CI, 63.8–70.2]. Among 562 participants, 61.7% of them had good knowledge about cataract [95% CI, 57.5–66.00]. It was also found that higher level of education [AOR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.37–5.96], higher family monthly income [AOR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.03–3.57], having previous eye examination [AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.02–2.31] and positive family history of cataract [AOR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.03–3.01] were positively associated with good knowledge. Conclusion Significant portion of the participants had good knowledge about cataract, which was positively associated with higher level of education, higher family monthly income, presence of previous eye examination and positive family history of cataract. However, significant knowledge gap regarding the risk factors and prevention strategies was recognized. Hence, it might be logical to pay special attention in prospering knowledge on how to prevent the occurrence of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2942188047,"Sex-specific mechanisms of the determination of insect body sizes are insufficiently understood. Here we use the common heath moth, Ematurga atomaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) to examine how larval growth trajectories differ between males and females. We monitored the development of 1379 larvae in controlled laboratory conditions. Sexually dimorphic development times during the first four instars were associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the beginning of the fifth (last) instar, when females were on average 15% heavier than males. Similarly, the duration of the last instar was about 13% longer in females. Further, we specifically focussed on the estimates of differential (instantaneous) growth rates of the larvae based on 24h mass increments of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th day in the beginning of the last instar. We calculated ‘allometric’ differential growth rates as the per-day increase in cube-root-transformed mass of the larvae. We found that allometric growth rates were slightly but significantly larger in females than in males. As this measure of growth rate (in contrast to the relative growth rate, based on the ratio of masses recorded at consecutive measurements) did not depend on body size, it allows an unambiguous separation of the effects of sex and size. We conclude that in accordance with an emerging general pattern, larger female body size in E. atomaria is achieved primarily by means of a longer growth period. Furthermore, our study shows that the differential growth rate can also be sexually dimorphic and contribute to SSD. This contribution, however, is lower than that of the development time by an order of magnitude. In addition to development periods and growth rates, other parameters of the non-linear growth curves of insect larvae also need to be considered in the context of SSD determination. In particular, weight loss prior to pupation was shown to be considerably larger in females than in males."
https://openalex.org/W2941289557,"Measuring binding properties of binders (e.g., antibodies) is essential for developing useful experimental reagents, diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals. Display technologies can evaluate a large number of binders in a high-throughput manner, but the immobilization effect and the avidity effect prohibit the precise evaluation of binding properties. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, peptide barcoding, to quantitatively measure the binding properties of multiple binders without immobilization. In the experimental scheme, unique peptide barcodes are fused with each binder, and they represent genotype information. These peptide barcodes are designed to have high detectability for mass spectrometry, leading to low identification bias and a high identification rate. A mixture of different peptide-barcoded nanobodies is reacted with antigen-coated magnetic beads in one pot. Peptide barcodes of functional nanobodies are cleaved on beads by a specific protease, and identified by selected reaction monitoring using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. To demonstrate proof-of-principle for peptide barcoding, we generated peptide-barcoded anti-CD4 nanobody and anti-GFP nanobody, and determined whether we could simultaneously quantify their binding activities. We showed that peptide barcoding did not affect the properties of the nanobodies, and succeeded in measuring the binding activities of these nanobodies in one shot. The results demonstrate the advantages of peptide barcoding, new types of genotype-phenotype linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2942346399,"Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a widely used metric for measuring classification performance. It has important theoretical and academic values to develop AUC maximization algorithms. Traditional methods often apply batch learning algorithm to maximize AUC which is inefficient and unscalable for large-scale applications. Recently some online learning algorithms have been introduced to maximize AUC by going through the data only once. However, these methods sometimes fail to converge to an optimal solution due to the fixed or rapid decay of learning rates. To tackle this problem, we propose an algorithm AdmOAM, Adaptive Moment estimation method for Online AUC Maximization. It applies the estimation of moments of gradients to accelerate the convergence and mitigates the rapid decay of the learning rates. We establish the regret bound of the proposed algorithm and implement extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2940698875,"Gene synthesis services have largely superseded traditional PCR methods for the generation of cDNAs destined for bacterial expression vectors. This, in turn, has increased the application of codon-optimized cDNAs where codons rarely used by Escherchia coli are replaced with common synonymous codons to accelerate translation of the target. A markedly accelerated rate of expression often results in a significant uplift in the levels of target protein but a substantial proportion of the enhanced yield can partition to the insoluble fraction rendering a significant portion of the gains unavailable for native purification. We have assessed several expression attenuation strategies for their utility in the manipulation of the soluble fraction towards higher levels of soluble target recovery from codon optimized systems. Using a set of human small GTPases as a case study, we compare the degeneration of the T7 promoter sequence, the use of alternative translational start codons and the manipulation of synonymous codon usage. Degeneration of both the T7 promoter and the translational start codon merely depressed overall expression and did not increase the percentage of product recovered in native purification of the soluble fraction. However, the selective introduction of rare non-optimal codons back into the codon-optimized sequence resulted in significantly elevated recovery of soluble targets. We propose that slowing the rate of extension during translation using a small number of rare codons allows more time for the co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide. This increases the proportion of the target recovered in the soluble fraction by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Thus, a “de-optimization” of codon-optimized cDNAs, to attenuate or pause the translation process, may prove a useful strategy for improved recombinant protein production."
https://openalex.org/W2941361609,"Functional localizers are particularly prevalent in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies concerning face processing. In this study, we extend the knowledge on face localizers regarding four important aspects: First, activation differences in occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA/FFA) and amygdala are characterized by increased activation while precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex show decreased deactivation to faces versus control stimuli. The face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus is a hybrid area exhibiting increased activation within its inferior and decreased deactivation within its superior part. Second, the employed control stimuli can impact on whether a region is classified in group analyses as face-selective or not. We specifically investigated this for recently described cytoarchitectonic subregions of the fusiform cortex (FG-2/FG-4). Averaged activity across voxels in FG-4 was stronger for faces than objects, houses, or landscapes. In FG-2, averaged activity was only significantly stronger in comparison with landscapes, but small peaks within this area were detected for comparison versus objects and houses. Third, reproducibility of individual peak activations is excellent for right FFA and quite good for right OFA, whereas within all other areas it was too low to provide valid information on time-invariant individual peaks. Finally, the fine-grained spatial activation patterns in right OFA and FFA are both time-invariant within each individual and sufficiently different between individuals to enable identification of individual participants with near-perfect precision (fMRI fingerprinting)."
https://openalex.org/W2942053699,"Following injury to a tendon little is known about potential for pathology to develop in other regional tendons from overloading or altered function. The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression and histopathological changes that occur 1) within the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) after injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and 2) within the flexor tendons (SDFT and DDFT) after injury to the extensor tendons. Merino wethers [Ovis aries] (n = 18) were divided into three equal groups and underwent either partial transection of the SDFT, complete transection of the extensor tendons or were left as non-operated controls. Tendons were harvested and sampled regionally for gene expression (real time PCR) and histologic analysis eight weeks after surgery. Transection of the SDFT resulted in increased expression of collagen III, versican, biglycan, lumican and MMP1 (P<0.026 for all genes) within the DDFT. There was no effect of transecting the extensor tendons on the expression of any gene tested in either the SDFT or the DDFT. The DDFT had elevated histopathology scores induced by transection of the SDFT, eight weeks previously. There were minimal histological differences in either the SDFT or DDFT after transection of the extensor tendons. Transection of the SDFT results in a mild, subclinical tendinopathy within the DDFT with potential implications on treatment and rehabilitation of SDFT injuries. Injury to the extensor tendons has minimal measured effect on the SDFT or DDFT."
https://openalex.org/W2942213721,"Inflammation plays a critical role in initiation of adaptive immunity, pathogen clearance and tissue repair. Interleukin (IL)-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and therefore its production is tightly regulated: its secretion requires the assembly of a macromolecular protein complex, termed the inflammasome. Aberrant activation of the inflammasome has been linked to debilitating human diseases including chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, there is a great interest in understanding how inflammasomes are regulated. Here we show that Dicer, an enzyme necessary for the production of mature micro-RNAs (miRNAs), is required for optimal activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow macrophages. Our data indicate that miRNAs may play an important role in promoting inflammasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W2941134825,"Background Primary appraisals of pain as a potential threat influence pain perception and coping but comparatively less is known about related effects of challenge appraisals or causal effects of primary appraisals on secondary appraisals of perceived pain coping capacities (e.g., pain self-efficacy). Methods To address these gaps, young Chinese women (N = 147) and men (N = 88) were randomly assigned to one of three appraisal conditions prior to engaging in a cold pressor test (CPT): (1) a higher threat appraisal condition featuring task orienting information describing symptoms and consequences of frostbite, (2) a lower threat appraisal condition featuring orienting information about safety of the CPT, or (3) a challenge appraisal condition featuring orienting information describing benefits of persistence despite discomfort for future life satisfaction. Results Compared to peers in the higher threat condition, challenge condition cohorts experienced smaller decreases in task-related self-efficacy, more cognitive coping, and less catastrophizing as well as more overall pain tolerance. A path analysis indicated that self-efficacy changes, cognitive coping and catastrophizing fully mediated links of subjective challenge and threat appraisals with pain tolerance. Conclusions Initial appraisals about the nature of pain influence, not only pain tolerance and coping, but also perceived coping capacities. Perspective Through examining particular theory-based pain appraisal and coping processes, this experiment is the first to identify both perceived coping capacities (pain self-efficacy) and coping responses as factors that explain why appraisals of pain as a challenge or threat have differential effects on pain tolerance."

Prior studies have associated neck circumference and central body adiposity. We explored the association between neck fat volume (NFV) and long-term cardiovascular outcome. The study provides a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing computerized tomography angiography for suspected cerebrovascular accident between January and December 2013. NFV was assessed by three dimensional reconstructions and was adjusted to height to account for differences in body sizes, thus yielding the NFV/height ratio (NHR). Univariate and multivariate analysis were utilized to explore the association between various indices including NHR and all-cause mortality. The analysis included 302 patients. The average age was 61.9±14.3 years, 60.6% of male gender. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease were frequent in 31.5%, 69.9%, and 72.2% of patients, respectively. The median NHR was 492.53cm2 [IQR 393.93–607.82]. Median follow up time was 41.2 months, during which 40 patients (13.2%) died. Multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus indicated an independent association between the upper quartile of NHR and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 2.279; 95% CI = 1.209–4.299; p = .011). NHR is a readily available anthropometric index which significantly correlated with poor long-term outcome.

https://openalex.org/W2942453875,"Purpose Cultural competence is a critical component in health care services. The relationship between health disparities and prejudice and discrimination is well documented. Prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behavior are modifiable through training yet few programs have evidence-based training. No published data has reported on baseline levels of cultural competencies in medical trainees which is necessary for tailoring programs appropriate to the audience. This manuscript fills that gap by reporting on data from three cohorts of first-year Physician Assistant (PA) students (N = 216). We examined students’ baseline levels with special attention to differences in cultural competence constructs across age, gender, and ethnicity. Methods Students completed self-report measures for ethnic identity, ethno-cultural empathy, multicultural orientation, attitudes about diversity, health beliefs attitudes, colorblind racial attitudes, and burnout at the beginning of their first year. They completed the measures online (Qualtrics) during class time, prior to a lecture on cultural competence. Results Data indicate a correlation between cultural competence constructs supporting the validity of the battery of tests as a cohesive unit to measure cultural competence. There were statistically significant differences between age, gender identity, and ethnic groups across cultural competence variables. Conclusions Data provide baseline data that may be used to tailor educational programs. Findings suggest that our measures show promise for future educational research measuring effectiveness of cultural competence training."
https://openalex.org/W2942482600,"Nano-hydroxyapatite is used in oral care products worldwide. But there is little evidence yet whether nano-hydroxyapatite can enter systemic tissues via the oral epithelium. We investigated histologically the ability of two types of nano-hydroxyapatite, SKM-1 and Mi-HAP, to permeate oral epithelium both with and without a stratum corneum, using two types of three-dimensional reconstituted human oral epithelium, SkinEthic HGE and SkinEthic HOE respectively with and without a stratum corneum. Both types of nano-hydroxyapatite formed aggregates in solution, but both aggregates and primary particles were much larger for SKM-1 than for Mi-HAP. Samples of each tissue model were exposed to SKM-1 and Mi-HAP for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 1,000 to 50,000 ppm. After treatment, paraffin sections from the samples were stained with Dahl or Von Kossa stains. We also used OsteoSense 680EX, a fluorescent imaging agent, to test for the presence of HAP in paraffin tissue sections for the first time. Our results for both types of nano-hydroxyapatite showed that the nanoparticles did not penetrate the stratum corneum in SkinEthic HGE samples and penetrated only the outermost layer of cells in SkinEthic HOE samples without stratum corneum, and no permeation into the deeper layers of the epithelium in either tissue model was observed. In the non-cornified model, OsteoSense 680EX staining confirmed the presence of nano-hydroxyapatite particles in both the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix of outermost cells, but not in the deeper layers. Our results suggest that the stratum corneum may act as a barrier to penetration of nano-hydroxyapatite into the oral epithelium. Moreover, since oral epithelial cell turnover is around 5–7 days, superficial cells of the non-keratinized mucosa in which nanoparticles are taken up are likely to be deciduated within that time frame. Our findings suggest that nano-hydroxyapatite is unlikely to enter systemic tissues via intact oral epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2951791772,"There is a vast gulf between the two primary strategies for simulating protein-ligand interactions. Docking methods significantly limit or eliminate protein flexibility to gain great speed at the price of uncontrolled inaccuracy, whereas fully flexible atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are expensive and often suffer from limited sampling. We have developed a flexible docking approach geared especially for highly flexible or poorly resolved targets based on mixed-resolution Monte Carlo (MRMC), which is intended to offer a balance among speed, protein flexibility, and sampling power. The binding region of the protein is treated with a standard atomistic force field, while the remainder of the protein is modeled at the residue level with a Gō model that permits protein flexibility while saving computational cost. Implicit solvation is used. Here we assess three facets of the MRMC approach with implications for other docking studies: (i) the role of receptor flexibility in cross-docking pose prediction; (ii) the use of non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) and (iii) the use of pose-clustering in scoring. We examine 61 co-crystallized ligands of estrogen receptor α, an important cancer target known for its flexibility. We also compare the performance of the MRMC approach with Autodock smina. Adding protein flexibility, not surprisingly, leads to significantly lower total energies and stronger interactions between protein and ligand, but notably we document the important role of backbone flexibility in the improvement. The improved backbone flexibility also leads to improved performance relative to smina. Somewhat unexpectedly, our implementation of NCMC leads to only modestly improved sampling of ligand poses. Overall, the addition of protein flexibility improves the performance of docking, as measured by energy-ranked poses, but we do not find significant improvements based on cluster information or the use of NCMC. We discuss possible improvements for the model including alternative coarse-grained force fields, improvements to the treatment of solvation, and adding additional types of NCMC moves."

The deuterium label of D11-linoleic acid was incorporated into the pheromone compound and its putative acyl precursor (7Z,10Z)-7,10-hexadecadienoate, demonstrating that the pheromone compound is biosynthesized from linoleic acid by chain-shortening and further functional group transformation.

Previous studies have reported that touching/holding soft objects can lead to a decrease of negative attitude toward uncertain events, and it is possible that such physical intervention may also be effective for reducing social pain induced by the group exclusion. This study examines the effects of holding soft objects on social pain. Participants held either a soft or hard cushion while performing the Cyberball task, a virtual ball-tossing game that experimentally controls social exclusion. In addition to the subjective rating of social pain, we measured the contingent negative variation (CNV) of event-related potentials, a variable related to perceivers’ expectations about forthcoming events. Results showed that, contrary to our prediction, holding a soft cushion increased the subjective rating of social pain. Furthermore, holding a soft cushion increased the amplitude of CNV while performing the Cyberball task. These results suggest that holding soft objects increases expectations about uncertain forthcoming events, but it does not reduce negative emotion."
https://openalex.org/W2941569869,"Various factors are considered to be mechanisms of the increase in the sizes of cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease. Vasopressin is one of the causes, and drinking large volumes of water shows an effect of suppressing an increase in cysts. On the other hand, it is known that hydrogen-rich water reduces oxidative stress and has a good effect on kidney injury. We examined whether drinking large volumes of hydrogen-rich water affected the increase in the sizes of cysts. Forty 5-week-old PCK rats were randomly assigned to four groups: C(Control), purified water; W(Water), water with sugar; H(Hydrogen), hydrogen-rich water; WH(Water+Hydrogen), hydrogen-rich water with sugar. They consumed water from 5 to 15 weeks of age. The intake of water in the groups in which sugar was added to the water (W, WH) significantly increased in comparison to C, but there was no significant change in the serum Creatinine concentration. The kidney weight per body weight in W was significantly decreased in comparison to C. The kidney weights in H and WH were significantly increased in comparison to W. There were no significant differences in the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the cysts to the whole area among the groups. This experiment showed that the effect of drinking large volumes of hydrogen-rich water was not significantly different from that of normal water, in terms of preventing an increase in the size of cysts in PCK rats. However, some papers acknowledge the influence of hydrogen water. Significant differences might become obvious if we change aspects such as the administration method or administration period."

In the first series of experiments, five-month-old male mdx mice (n = 34) were treated with 2 different doses (20 and 100 μg/kg) of CLi and in the second series of experiments, five-month-old female mdx (n = 19) and wild-type (n = 24) mice were treated with 20 μg/kg CLi and Velcade (1 mg/kg) for 1-month. All animals were treadmill exercised twice a week to worsen the dystrophic features. In the first series of experiments, our results demonstrated that 20 μg/kg CLi did not significantly increase absolute and specific maximal forces in skeletal muscle from male mdx mice. Moreover, the higher susceptibility to contraction induced skeletal muscle injury was worsened by 100 μg/kg CLi since the force drop following lengthening contractions was increased with this high dose. Furthermore, we found no differences in the mRNA levels of the molecular markers implicated in dystrophic features. Concerning cardiac function, CLi had no effect on left ventricular function since ejection and shortening fractions were unchanged in male mdx mice. Similarly, CLi did not modify the expression of genes implicated in cardiac remodeling. In the second series of experiments, our results demonstrated an improvement in absolute and specific maximal forces by CLi, whereas Velcade only increased specific maximal force in female mdx mice. In addition, exercise tolerance was not improved by CLi. Taken together, our results show that CLi treatment can only improve maximal force production in exercised female mdx mice without affecting either exercice tolerance capacity or cardiac function. In conclusion, selective inhibition of caspase-like activity of proteasome with CLi has no compelling beneficial effect in dystrophic mdx mice."
https://openalex.org/W2940846450,"A vehicle-bridge tuned mass damper (TMD) coupled dynamic analysis and vibration-control model was established to optimize TMD damping effects on a steel-box girder bridge bearing vehicle loads. It was also used to investigate optimization efficiency of different algorithms in TMD design parameters. This model simulated bridges and vehicles with the use of a 7 degrees of freedom curved-beam element model and a 7 degrees of freedom vehicle model, respectively. The TMD system was simulated with the use of multiple rigid-body systems linked with springs and dampers. Road surface condition, as a vibration source, was simulated with the use of a frequency equivalent method based on a power spectrum. A variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm was proposed in line with the initial TMD parameters calculated by Den Hartog formula. Visual software was compiled by Fortran and used for an optimization study of vibration reduction. A three-span, curved, continuous steel-box girder bridge was used as the numerical example. Optimized effects and computational efficiency of vibration reduction under different methods were compared. The comparison included a single variable optimization based on Den Hartog formula, an ergodic search method, an integer programming method, a traditional genetic algorithm, a traditional pattern search algorithm, and a variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm. The results indicate that variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm is more efficient at improving TMD optimal parameter design. Final TMD parameter optimization values obtained by different methods are quite close to each other and tends verify the reliability of the optimization results."
https://openalex.org/W2941070383,"Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder characterized by postural or kinetic tremor. We aimed to evaluate median nerve enlargement in patients with ET using ultrasonography (USG). Thirty-eight hands from 19 patients with ET and 24 hands from 13 controls underwent nerve conduction studies (NCS) and USG at the wrist. Tremor severity was measured using the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS). The median nerve cross sectional area (mCSA) in USG and NCS parameters were compared using ANCOVA. We evaluated the correlation between mCSA and NCS parameters or FTM-TRS scores using linear regression analysis. mCSA was significantly larger (p<0.001) and NCS parameters were different in two groups. Also, mCSA was negatively correlated with part B and C scores of FTM-TRS (p<0.001 and p = 0.039, respectively). In conclusion, median nerve enlargement with the changes of NCS parameters was observed and correlated with the severity of tremor in patients with ET."
https://openalex.org/W2941120124,"Historically, monitoring nematode movement and mortality in response to various potential nematicide treatments usually involved tedious manual microscopic analysis. High-content analysis instrumentation enables rapid and high-throughput collection of experimental data points on large numbers of individual worms simultaneously. The high-throughput platform outlined here should accelerate discovery of unique classes and types of promising lead molecules and sample types to control these plant pests. Also, the ability to automate the data analysis pipeline rather than relying on manual scoring reduces a potential source of data variance. Here we describe a high-throughput process based on high-content imaging. We demonstrate the use of time-lapse image acquisition to measure movement, and viability staining to confirm nematode mortality (versus paralysis) in targeted plant-pathogenic nematodes. We present screening results from a microbial-exudate library generated from approximately 2,300 microbial fermentations that demonstrate the robustness of this high-throughput process. The described methods should be applicable to other relevant nematode parasites with human, crop, or animal hosts."
