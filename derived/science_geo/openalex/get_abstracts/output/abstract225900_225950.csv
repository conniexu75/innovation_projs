Their finding has been confirmed at Reading2 on several occasions with a variety of diets including practical rations, but not at Greenford, where only practical rations were tested."
https://openalex.org/W2067531092,"RECENT advances in the elucidation of the physiological mechanisms of lactation, particularly those mechanisms concerned in the transfer of milk from the mammary glands to the young, have revealed inadequacies and ambiguities in the terminology in common use in relation to lactational physiology. An example of such an ambiguity is the term ‘to suckle’, which is at present being used to denote the activity of the lactating mammal or the young or both. In 1947, one of us1 proposed a scheme, now generally adopted, which classified and defined the major physiological components of the total phenomenon which is called ‘lactation’, and which has done much to clarify terminology in this field. We should now like to put forward additional terms which, if generally accepted, we believe will render the above-mentioned scheme more comprehensive and will largely resolve the ambiguities still in existence."

https://openalex.org/W1995169904,"THE reaction that set in some thirty years ago against the facile assumption that all interspecific differences are adaptive was good but went too far. Several authors insisted that most specific and sub-specific differences were non-adaptive. More recently, Mayr1, while emphasizing the great importance of selection in speciation, considered that not all geographical variation is adaptive and, in particular, that most of the characters involved in polymorphism are completely neutral so far as survival value is concerned. Later2, he reversed this judgment on polymorphism."

https://openalex.org/W1970055166,"IN previous experiments we have found that the injection of cocarboxylase causes, in the alloxandiabetic rat, a diminution of the blood sugar and an increase of the respiratory quotient and of tissue glycogen. Thiamine produces similar effects; however, with severely affected animals it fails to act1,2. The hypothesis was then advanced that, in severe alloxan diabetes, thiamine does not produce any effect because its conversion to cocarboxylase is prevented. We have now obtained some evidence in support of this hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2031822942,"IN 1948, Stone reported that infection by influenza viruses of embryonated hens' eggs after allantoic inoculation1, and of mouse lungs after intranasal instillation2, could be prevented by pretreatment of the exposed cells with the receptor-destroying enzyme of Vibrio choleræ3. It seems worth adding to these observations the finding that death of mice from infection by a neurotropic variant of influenza virus, neuro-WS4, can be similarly prevented by pretreatment of the mice with an intracerebral injection of receptor-destroying enzyme, and that the return of susceptibility to infection, following a single inoculation of receptor-destroying enzyme, runs roughly parallel to the return of inhibitory activity of the brain5 to influenza virus hæmagglutination."
https://openalex.org/W2000321225,"RECENT studies on photoperiodicity have been undertaken in an attempt to hasten the onset of the sexual season of sheep1–4, to extend the lactation period in goats, to accelerate the onset of œstrus in thoroughbred mares and to advance or prolong the egg-production season in pheasants5. Attempts to inhibit the sexual season are of considerable importance in solving certain problems of refractoriness of the gonads in the physiology of reproduction. Yeates3 has shown that the cessation of the sexual season of Suffolk sheep occurs after 14–16 weeks exposure to an increasing plane of artificial light."

https://openalex.org/W2095153711,"As a consequence of the brilliant studies of Stacey and co-workers, reviewed by Webb1, many investigators of the Gram reaction in bacteria are agreed that the Gram complex is a combination of basic dye and pentose nucleoprotein, apparently localized at or in the cell wall. However, as Lison2 has pointed out, the problem of localization in cytochemistry is a difficult one, and it is not altogether certain that the basophilic component of the Gram complex normally occurs at the cell wall."

The observation was due to the nature of the infestation, and Fig. 1 is a photograph of a parasitized adult female toad. The parasites (Strigeid metacercariæ) encyst in all layers of the dermis beneath the lateral sense organs, and the position of these is emphasized by numerous large melanophores close to the cysts, while the rest of the skin remains paler than usual."
