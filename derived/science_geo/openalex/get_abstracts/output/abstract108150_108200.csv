https://openalex.org/W1973680986,"Mutational analysis identified a C-terminal region of 78 amino acids within the cytoplasmic domain of the human 75 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R2) that is required for signal transduction. This region was subsequently shown to mediate the interaction of cytoplasmic factors with TNF-R2. Two of these factors were isolated and molecularly cloned using biochemical purification and the yeast two-hybrid system. TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) and TRAF2 are the first two members of a novel protein family containing a novel C-terminal homology region, the TRAF domain. In addition, TRAF2 contains an N-terminal RING finger motif. TRAF1 and TRAF2 can form homo- and heterotypic dimers. Our analysis indicates that TRAF1 and TRAF2 are associated with the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R2 in a heterodimeric complex in which TRAF2 contacts the receptor directly. TRAF1 interacts with TNF-R2 indirectly through heterodimer formation with TRAF2."
https://openalex.org/W2003028861,"HNF-3 beta, a member of the HNF-3/fork head family of transcription factors, is expressed in the node, notochord, floor plate, and gut in mouse embryos. A null mutation of this gene leads to embryonic lethality. The primary defect of HNF-3 beta -/- embryos is an absence of organized node and notochord formation, which leads to secondary defects in dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube. In contrast, patterning along the anterior-posterior axis was surprisingly little affected. Although HNF-3 beta is required for node and notochord formation, some organizer activity persists in the absence of these structures. HNF-3 beta is not required for the development of definitive endoderm cells, but foregut morphogenesis is severely affected in HNF-3 beta -/- embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2121889667,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. Linkage studies have placed the gene at Xp11.22-p11.23. We have isolated from this interval a novel gene, WASP, which is expressed in lymphocytes, spleen, and thymus. The gene is not expressed in two unrelated WAS patients, one of whom has a single base deletion that produces a frame shift and premature termination of translation. Two additional patients have been identified with point mutations that change the same arginine residue to either a histidine or a leucine. WASP encodes a 501 amino acid proline-rich protein that is likely to be a key regulator of lymphocyte and platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W2021326683,"To determine the contribution of p53 loss to tumor progression, we have induced abnormal proliferation in the brain choroid plexus epithelium of transgenic mice using a SV40 T antigen fragment that perturbs pRB family function but does not affect p53 function. Tumors induced by this mutant develop slowly compared with those induced by wild-type T antigen. Suppressed tumor growth Is directly attributable to p53 function, since rapid tumor development occurs when the T antigen fragment Is expressed in p53-null mice. In p53-heterozygous mice, stochastic loss of the wildtype p53 allele results in the focal emergence of aggressive tumor nodules characteristic of tumor progression. In each case, aggressive tumor development in the absence of p53 function corresponds to a decrease in the level of apoptosis. These results provide in vivo evidence that p53-dependent apoptosis, occurring in response to oncogenic events, is a critical regulator of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000927180,"An efficient system was developed that induced the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into blood cells of erythroid, myeloid, and B cell lineages by coculture with the stromal cell line OP9. This cell line does not express functional macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The presence of M-CSF had inhibitory effects on the differentiation of ES cells to blood cells other than macrophages. Embryoid body formation or addition of exogenous growth factors was not required, and differentiation was highly reproducible even after the selection of ES cells with the antibiotic G418. Combined with the ability to genetically manipulate ES cells, this system will facilitate the study of molecular mechanisms involved in development and differentiation of hematopoietic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2005744880,"Repeated high-frequency trains of stimuli induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region that persists for up to 8 hours in hippocampal slices and for days in intact animals. This long time course has made LTP an attractive model for certain forms of long-term memory in the mammalian brain. A hallmark of long-term memory in the intact animal is a requirement for transcription, and thus whether the late phase of LTP (L-LTP) requires transcription was investigated here. With the use of different inhibitors, it was found in rat hippocampal slices that the induction of L-LTP [produced either by tetanic stimulation or by application of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analog Sp-cAMPS (Sp-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate)] was selectively prevented when transcription was blocked immediately after tetanization or during application of cAMP. As with behavioral memory, this requirement for transcription had a critical time window. Thus, the late phase of LTP in the CA1 region requires transcription during a critical period, perhaps because cAMP-inducible genes must be expressed during this period."
https://openalex.org/W2052521064,"The RAD51 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for genetic recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Here it is demonstrated that RAD51 protein pairs circular viral single-stranded DNA from Ï†X 174 or M13 with its respective homologous linear double-stranded form. The product of synapsis between these DNA partners is further processed by RAD51 to yield nicked circular duplex DNA, which indicates that RAD51 can catalyze strand exchange. The pairing and strand exchange reaction requires adenosine triphosphate, a result consistent with the presence of a DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity in RAD51 protein. Thus, RAD51 is a eukaryotic recombination protein that can catalyze the strand exchange reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2009624062,"HNF-3 beta, a transcription factor of the winged-helix family, is expressed in embryonic and adult endoderm and also in midline cells of the node, notochord, and floor plate in mouse embryos. To define the function of HNF-3 beta, a targeted mutation in the HNF-3 beta locus was generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice lacking HNF-3 beta die by embryonic day (E) 10-11. Mutant embryos examined from E6.5 to E9.5 do not form a distinct node and lack a notochord. In addition, mutant embryos show marked defects in the organization of somites and neural tube that may result from the absence of the notochord. The neural tube of mutant embryos exhibits overt anteroposterior polarity but lacks a floor plate and motor neurons. Endodermal cells are present but fail to form a gut tube in mutant embryos. These studies indicate that HNF-3 beta has an essential role in the development of axial mesoderm in mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2069637592,"A small molecule called PD 153035 inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase with a 5-pM inhibition constant. The inhibitor was specific for the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and inhibited other purified tyrosine kinases only at micromolar or higher concentrations. PD 153035 rapidly suppressed autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor at low nanomolar concentrations in fibroblasts or in human epidermoid carcinoma cells and selectively blocked EGF-mediated cellular processes including mitogenesis, early gene expression, and oncogenic transformation. PD 153035 demonstrates an increase in potency over that of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors of four to five orders of magnitude for inhibition of isolated EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and three to four orders of magnitude for inhibition of cellular phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2027376766,"Phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is a required step in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. We have purified CAK from mammalian cells; the enzyme comprises two major polypeptides of 42 and 37 kDa. Protein sequencing indicates that the 42 kDa subunit is the mammalian homolog of MO15, a protein kinase known to be a component of CAK in amphibians and echinoderms. Cloning of a cDNA encoding the 37 kDa subunit identifies it as a novel cyclin (cyclin H). We have reconstituted CAK in vitro with the MO15 catalytic subunit and cyclin H, demonstrating that MO15 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK7). Like other CDKs, MO15/CDK7 contains a conserved threonine required for full activity; mutation of this residue severely reduces CAK activity. The CAK holoenzyme activates complexes of CDK2 and CDC2 with various cyclins and also phosphorylates CDK2, but not CDC2, in the absence of cyclin. Thus, CAK is a CDK-cyclin complex implicated in the control of multiple cell cycle transitions."

https://openalex.org/W2077147012,"Proteasomes degrade endogenous proteins. Two subunits, LMP-2 and LMP-7, are encoded in a region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that is critical for class I-restricted antigen presentation. Mice with a targeted deletion of the gene encoding LMP-7 have reduced levels of MHC class I cell-surface expression and present the endogenous antigen HY inefficiently; addition of peptides to splenocytes deficient in LMP-7 restores wild-type class I expression levels. This demonstrates the involvement of LMP-7 in the MHC class I presentation pathway and suggests that LMP-7 functions as an integral part of the peptide supply machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2076304484,"A cap-binding protein complex (CBC) present in the nuclei of HeLa cells has been characterized. Purified CBC consists of two previously identified proteins, CBP80 and CBP20. These proteins are shown to cofractionate to apparent homogeneity and to be coimmunoprecipitable with anti-CBP80 antibodies. Analysis of the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo by chemically modified analogs of the cap structure, and of the binding of these analogs to CBC in vitro, suggests a role for the complex in splicing. Extracts immunodepleted of CBC do not efficiently splice an adenoviral pre-mRNA owing to blockage of an early step in splicing complex formation. CBC may therefore play a role in pre-mRNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2036004025,"DNA sequences for the gene encoding mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I in a group of rodents (pocket gophers) and their ectoparasites (chewing lice) provide evidence for cospeciation and reveal different rates of molecular evolution in the hosts and their parasites. The overall rate of nucleotide substitution (both silent and replacement changes) is approximately three times higher in lice, and the rate of synonymous substitution (based on analysis of fourfold degenerate sites) is approximately an order of magnitude greater in lice. The difference in synonymous substitution rate between lice and gophers correlates with a difference of similar magnitude in generation times."
https://openalex.org/W1980243949,"Adhalin, the 50 kDa dystrophn-associated glycoprotein, is deficient in skeletal muscle of patients having severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD). In several North African families, SCARMD has been linked to chromosome 13q, but SCARMD has been excluded from linkage to this locus in other families. We have now cloned human adhalin cDNA and mapped the adhalin gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.33, excluding it from involvement in 13q-linked SCARMD. However, one allelic variant of a polymorphic microsatellite located within intron 6 of the adhalin gene cosegregated perfectly with the disease phenotype in a large family. Furthermore, missense mutations were identified within the adhalin gene that might cause SCARMD in this family. Thus, the adhalin gene is involved in at least one form of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1594075865,"Telomeric DNA of a variety of vertebrates including humans contains the tandem repeat d(TTAGGG)n. We have investigated the structural properties of the human telomeric repeat oligonucleotide models d(T2AG3)4, d(G3T2A)3G3, and d(G3T2AG3) using CD, gel electrophoresis, and chemical probing techniques. The sequences d(G3T2A)3G3 and d(T2AG3)4 assume an antiparallel G quartet structure by intramolecular folding, while the sequence d(G3T2AG3) also adopts an antiparallel G quartet structure but by dimerization of hairpins. In all the above cases, adenines are in the loop. The TTA loops are oriented at the same end of the G tetrad stem in the case of hairpin dimer. Further, the oligonucleotide d(G3T2AG3) forms a higher order structure by the association of two hairpin dimers via stacking of G tetrad planes. Here we show that N-7 of adenine in the hairpin dimer is Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonded. The partial reactivity of loop adenines with DEPC in d(T2AG3)4 suggests that the intramolecular G quartet structure is highly polymorphic and structures with different loop orientations and topologies are formed in solution. Intra- and interloop hydrogen bonding schemes for the TTA loops are proposed to account for the observed diethyl pyrocarbonate reactivities of adenines. Sodium-induced G quartet structures differ from their potassium-induced counterparts not only in stability but also in loop conformation and interactions. Thus, the overall structure and stability of telomeric sequences are modulated by the cation present, loop sequence, and the number of G tracts, which might be important for the telomere function."
https://openalex.org/W2072970918,"Antibody-antigen complexes initiate the inflammatory response and are central to the pathogenesis of tissue injury. The classical model for this immunopathological cascade, the Arthus reaction, was reinvestigated with a murine strain deficient in Fc receptor expression. Despite normal inflammatory responses to other stimuli, the inflammatory response to immune complexes was markedly attenuated. These results suggest that immune complex-triggered inflammation is initiated by cell bound Fc receptors and is then amplified by cellular mediators and activated complement. These results redefine the inflammatory cascade and may offer other approaches for the study and treatment of immunological injury."
https://openalex.org/W1997038017,"The discovery that mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes can cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer has stimulated interest in understanding the mechanism of DNA mismatch repair in eukaryotes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA mismatch repair requires the MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 proteins. Experiments revealed that the yeast MLH1 and PMS1 proteins physically associate, possibly forming a heterodimer, and that MLH1 and PMS1 act in concert to bind a MSH2-heteroduplex complex containing a G-T mismatch. Thus, MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 are likely to form a ternary complex during the initiation of eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair."

The Far1 protein is required for cell cycle arrest and associates with the Cdc28-Cln complex. The kinase activity of Cdc28-Cln was directly inhibited by Far1 both in vivo and in vitro, thus demonstrating that Far1 acts at the final step in the Î±-factor response pathway by inhibiting a G1 cyclin-dependent kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1991221769,"Spindle orientation controls nuclear migration and segregation during mitosis. In yeast, defects in dynein and astral microtubules lead to abnormal spindle orientation and nuclear migration. Dynactin complex is necessary for dynein-mediated vesicle motility in vitro. The major polypeptide of dynactin complex is an actin-related protein in the family Arp1. We have identified in S. cerevisiae a novel actin-related gene, ACT5, in the Arp1 family. An act5 null mutant has defects in spindle orientation and nuclear migration, as does overexpression of Act5p. The phenotype of a double mutant lacking dynein and Act5p is similar to that of single mutants. Therefore, dynactin complex is in the same pathway as dynein and may be necessary for the action of dynein in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1970139633,"Transcription of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain locus is regulated by an intronic enhancer that is flanked on both sides by nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs). These MARs have now been shown to be essential for transcription of a rearranged mu gene in transgenic B lymphocytes, but they were not required in stably transfected tissue culture cells. Normal rates of transcriptional initiation at a variable region promoter and the formation of an extended deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I)--sensitive chromatin domain were dependent on MARs, although DNase I hypersensitivity at the enhancer was detected in the absence of MARs. Thus, transcriptional activation of the mu gene during normal lymphoid development requires a synergistic collaboration between the enhancer and flanking MARs."

A screen based on two- and one-hybrid approaches demonstrates that the product of the DBF4 gene interacts with yeast replication origins in vivo. The Dbf4 protein interacts with and positively regulates the activity of the Cdc7 protein kinase, which is required for entry into S phase in the yeast mitotic cell cycle. The analysis described here suggests a model in which one function of Dbf4 may be to recruit the Cdc7 protein kinase to initiation complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2028290150,"Proteasomes are the proteolytic complex responsible for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted antigen presentation. Interferon gamma treatment increases expression MHC-encoded LMP2 and LMP7 subunits of the proteasome and decreases expression of two proteasome subunits, named X and Y, which alters the proteolytic specificity of proteasomes. Molecular cloning of complementary DNAs encoding X and Y showed that their proteins are proteasomal subunits with high amino acid similarity to LMP7 and LMP2, respectively. Thus, interferon gamma may induce subunit replacements of X and Y by LMP7 and LMP2, respectively, producing proteasomes perhaps more appropriate for the immunological processing of endogenous antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2051219232,"The three-dimensional structure of an unusually active hydrolytic antibody with a phosphonate transition state analog (hapten) bound to the active site has been solved to 2.5 Ã… resolution. The antibody (17E8) catalyzes the hydrolysis of norleucine and methionine phenyl esters and is selective for amino acid esters that have the natural Î±-carbon L configuration. A plot of the pH-dependence of the antibody-catalyzed reaction is bell-shaped with an activity maximum at pH 9.5; experiments on mechanism lend support to the formation of a covalent acyl-antibody intermediate. The structural and kinetic data are complementary and support a hydrolytic mechanism for the antibody that is remarkably similar to that of the serine proteases. The antibody active site contains a Ser-His dyad structure proximal to the phosphorous atom of the bound hapten that resembles two of the three components of the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of serine proteases. The antibody active site also contains a Lys residue to stabilize oxyanion formation, and a hydrophobic binding pocket for specific substrate recognition of norleucine and methionine side chains. The structure identifies active site residues that mediate catalysis and suggests specific mutations that may improve the catalytic efficiency of the antibody. This high resolution structure of a catalytic antibody-hapten complex shows that antibodies can converge on active site structures that have arisen through natural enzyme evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1531066653,"Growth hormone (GH) has recently been shown to activate the GH receptor (GHR)-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. In the present study, regions of the GHR required for JAK2 association with GHR were identified. GH-dependent JAK2 association with GHR was detected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing wild-type GHR (GHR1-638) or GHR truncated at amino acid 454 (GHR1-454) or 380 (GHR1-380). JAK2 did not associate with GHR in cells expressing GHR truncated at amino acid 294 (GHR1-294) or when amino acids 297-311 containing a proline-rich motif were deleted (GHR delta P) or prolines 300, 301, 303, and 305 in the proline-rich motif were mutated to alanines (GHR4P-->A). Cross-linking 125I-human GH to GHR demonstrated that GHR mutants migrated with the appropriate molecular weight, with the exception of GHR4P-->A which migrated as a protein similar in size to GHR1-294. In studies performed in CHO and RIN-5AH cells, the ability of JAK2 to associate with the mutated GHR was found to correlate with GH-dependent activation of JAK2, tyrosyl phosphorylation of GHR (in the case of GHR1-638 and GHR1-454), and the ability of the GHR to copurify with tyrosine kinase activity. In CHO cells expressing mutated GHR, GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of cellular proteins (p121, p97, p42, and p39) was dependent on the ability to activate JAK2. No proteins showed increased tyrosyl phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing GHR1-294, GHR4P-->A, or GHR delta P. Deletion of the C-terminal half (amino acids 455-638) of the GHR ablated GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of p97. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the N-terminal quarter of the cytoplasmic domain of GHR and within this region, the proline-rich motif, is required for association of JAK2 with GHR and GH-dependent activation of JAK2, and that tyrosines in the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR are phosphorylated by JAK2. The finding that a specific interaction with the C-terminal half of GHR appears to be necessary for p97 phosphorylation indicates that while JAK2 activation may be necessary for a full biological response to GH, it appears not to be sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W2155907187,"To explore the role of BDNF during Xenopus visual system development, the expression of BDNF and TrkB, as well as the effect of BDNF during retinal ganglion cell (RGC) development in culture, was examined. BDNF mRNA was found to be expressed in both the developing eye and tectum, peaking at stage . The expression of BDNF coincided with RGC expression of full-length trkB transcripts, suggesting a functional role for BDNF. In culture, BDNF significantly increased the number of RGCs. The ability of BDNF to rescue differentiated RGCs that had projected to the tectum, the time course of the effect, and the lack of mitogenic response indicate that this neurotrophin promotes survival. The expression of BDNF and TrkB and the responsiveness of RGCs to BDNF coincide with retinal axon terminal arborization and patterning. Our results indicate that BDNF is a relevant neurotrophin for Xenopus RGC development and suggest that it plays a role during visual system patterning."

https://openalex.org/W1481011811,"We previously showed that the in vitro transcription of a negatively supercoiled plasmid containing the murine IgA switch region caused the formation of fewer supercoiled conformers of the plasmid due to the presence of a stable RNA.DNA hybrid. Here, we demonstrate that the RNA.DNA hybrid is approximately 140 nucleotides, and it forms regardless of the initial topological state of the transcription template. Transcription of the switch region in a relaxed closed circular plasmid generates positively supercoiled plasmid conformers that revert to their original relaxed state when treated with RNase H. Conformers that have incorporated a stable RNA transcript are also observed when nicked circular and linear plasmids containing the IgA switch sequences are transcribed with 32P-labeled nucleotide triphosphates. Once formed, the RNA.DNA hybrid is stable to both thermal and superhelical stress, tolerating temperatures in excess of 95 degrees C and restraining approximately 12 positive supercoils in the plasmid."

Compared with the la+ controls, laâˆ’ twitcher mice showed a profound reduction in the severity of demyelinating lesions correlated with significantly fewer microglia/macrophages. Most importantly, laâˆ’ twitcher mice showed significantly reduced twitching compared with la+ twitcher mice.

https://openalex.org/W1628335029,"Overexpression of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene (beta-APP) may contribute to the abnormal generation of beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate using a human glial cell line (1321N1) that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increases beta-APP mRNA levels, induces known components of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), and increases protein-DNA binding activity to AP-1 sequences within the beta-APP promoter. A beta-APP promoter-luciferase reporter gene is transcriptionally activated by PMA, as well as by expression of constitutively activated PKC or by expression of c-Jun. Further characterization suggests that the distal but not the proximal AP-1 recognition site binds nuclear proteins regulated by PKC, and that the AP-1 binding activity is likely to be composed of Jun-Jun homodimers rather than Jun-Fos heterodimers. Additional studies demonstrate that a single copy of the distal AP-1 site fused to a heterologous promoter is sufficient to confer a response to PMA. Mutagenesis of this site in the beta-APP promoter renders it unresponsive to c-Jun and attenuates transcriptional activation by PMA. We suggest that cellular mediators that activate PKC, particularly those that induce significant increases in c-Jun, may up-regulate expression of the beta-APP gene and consequently affect production and processing of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1787501266,"A putative morphogen, called differentiation-inducing factor (DIF), is essential for stalk cell differentiation in the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. To investigate the relationship between the signal molecule (DIF) and the concentrations of cytoplasmic calcium ions and proton, we have examined the effects of thapsigargin (Tg) and 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) on cell differentiation of a mutant strain HM44, which is defective in DIF production. Tg is a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase present in endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticula, and raises the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. DMO is a reagent that decreases intracellular pH. When HM44 cells were incubated with Tg or DMO in the absence of DIF, a fraction of the cells was induced to stalk cells. If added together, these reagents induced stalk cell differentiation at high efficiency (70-80%), comparable to that attained with exogenous DIF. In the presence of the reagents, the efficiency was not much affected by lowering cell density, which suggests that the effect (Stalk induction) of these reagents was not exerted through the stimulation of DIF production. Thus, these results indicate that a rise in cytoplasmic calcium and proton concentrations triggers stalk cell differentiation possibly by mimicking the roles of DIF.â€” -Kubohara, Y., Okamoto, K.

https://openalex.org/W1523923451,"Thermotolerance is defined as the capacity of cells, following a cycle of stress and recovery, to survive a second stress which would otherwise be lethal. Whereas this is a well-documented phenomenon, the mechanisms underlying this protective event remain to be elucidated. Protection of protein synthesis appears to be one of the components in the induction of thermotolerance termed thermotolerance. In the present study we show that translational thermotolerance is not the result of an increase in the concentration of cellular transcripts or the stabilization of preexisting messages, nor the preservation of the rate of amino acid uptake, synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA, or protection from degradation of newly synthesized polypeptides. These results suggest that translational thermotolerance is the consequence of stabilization of translational initiation and/or polypeptide chain elongation during heat shock. We found that heat shock protein (hsp)-72, the major inducible form of the hsp-70 family of heat shock proteins, is associated with ribosomal subunits in polysomes of thermotolerant cells during heat shock. We hypothesize that such interaction is responsible for rescuing translational initiation and/or polypeptide chain elongation in thermotolerant cells during a subsequent stress. It is possible that hsp-72 on the ribosome is waiting for the nascent polypeptide to emerge from the ribosome. Such interaction may maintain the growing polypeptide in solution during stress, allowing elongation to continue, and maintaining a constant rate of translation during the stress."
https://openalex.org/W1529813475,"Exposure of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor to agonists causes a rapid desensitization of the receptor-stimulated mobilization of intracellular calcium. Homologous desensitization occurs by uncoupling the G-proteins from the receptor and by ligand induced internalization. The molecular determinants of desensitization of the GRP receptor are not well known. The importance of tyrosine 324 which is located in a highly conserved NPX2-3 Y motif of the GRP receptor was investigated. Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed rat kidney (KNRK) cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either the wild type or the mutant (tyrosine 324 to alanine 324) rat GRP receptor. The wild type and mutant GRP receptors were expressed at a high level in the KNRK cells, 2.0 x 10(6) and 0.5 x 10(6) receptors per cell, respectively. The wild type and mutant GRP receptors bound GRP with the same affinity (Kd = 6-7 nM). KNRK cells expressing the wild type or mutant GRP receptor had similar [Ca2+]i, dose response to GRP. KNRK cells expressing the GRP receptor rapidly internalized bound 125I-GRP at 37 degree C. Internalization was inhibited at 4 degrees C and by 0.45 m sucrose. The internalization of bound 125I-GRP by the mutant GRP receptor was identical to the wild type receptor. Fluorescent microscopy was used to directly observe the GRP receptor expressed on the surface of the KNRK cells and to visualize its ligand induced internalization. There was no difference in the pattern of internalization between the wild type and mutant GRP receptors expressed in KNRK cells. Therefore, the highly conserved tyrosine 324 does not have a role in GRP binding, receptor-G-protein interaction, or initial events of ligand induced receptor internalization. The NPXnY motif is not a general sequestration sequence for seven transmembrane G-protein linked receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1574316151,"The expression of the dihydropyridine (DHP) and ryanodine receptors in skeletal muscle was investigated during development of rat myotubes in culture as well as during embryonic and postnatal development in the rat. Through the use of specific gene probes, antibodies and radioligand binding ([3H]PN 200-110 (DHP) and [3H]ryanodine), we identified a significant difference between the time course of appearance of the DHP receptor and the ryanodine receptor during muscle development. Although the number of DHP receptors dramatically increased at early stages of development (up to day 7 in tissue culture and day 20 postnatal), increase in the ryanodine receptor density occurred comparatively later at day 10 in culture and day 30 postnatal. This process was associated with parallel changes in the expression of the mRNA encoding the alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta subunits of the DHP receptor and the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. The genes encoding the DHP receptor subunits were activated in a temporally distinct transcript appeared and plateaued first, at the onset of myoblast fusion and day 16 embryonic. This was followed closely by an increase in expression of the mRNAs for alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits which coincided with the sharp rise in the DHP receptor density. Ryanodine receptor gene expression was induced well after the DHP receptor gene expression had plateaued. The temporal appearance of the polypeptides comprising the DHP receptor subunits and the ryanodine receptor paralleled the induction of the genes encoding these receptors. These results imply that gene expression is a major mechanism that contributes to the regulation of DHP and ryanodine receptor numbers during muscle development. The temporal differences in the induction of the genes encoding the DHP receptor subunits and the ryanodine receptor suggests that these genes are under the control of distinct endogenous factors. These differences in expression of the DHP receptor and the ryanodine receptor may contribute to the different mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling in immature versus adult skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1598911721,"Calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of a p62 protein which associates with the ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP). We have examined the nature of the calcium signal triggering p62 phosphorylation. EGTA, a specific chelator of calcium, was able to completely block calcium-induced p62 phosphorylation, even after using conditioned medium from calcium-treated keratinocytes. Preventing calcium-induced cell-cell contacts by anti-cadherin antibodies did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. Slight increases in extracellular calcium concentrations (0.15 or 0.30 mM) were already sufficient to induce p62 phosphorylation. Other divalent cations, such as magnesium, zinc, nickel, and cobalt, but not the trivalent cation lanthanum, induced p62 phosphorylation to a similar extent as calcium. There was no close correlation between the ability of the various ions to induce p62 phosphorylation and increase free intracellular calcium. Similarly, treatment of primary keratinocytes with the calcium ionophores A23187 or X537A did not induce p62 phosphorylation, although it increased free intracellular calcium levels. Finally, blockers of potassium uptake, which is induced by calcium, did not inhibit p62 phosphorylation. Thus, in keratinocyte differentiation, calcium is likely to provide the primary signal for p62 tyrosine phosphorylation and may act directly at the cell membrane through a cationic receptor mechanism analogous to that described in other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1510767762,"A portion of kringle IV37 (KIV37) of apolipoprotein (a), (apo(a)), was polymerase chain reaction-cloned from human liver cDNA. The protein product of this clone was expressed in Escherichia coli as a poly histidine fusion protein. Based on recovery of purified fusion apo(a) KIV37 protein expression levels were estimated to be 10 mg/g of E. coli cell paste. Mass spectral analysis showed the molecular mass of fusion apo(a) KIV37 to be 12,260 +/- 1 daltons. Almost all fusion apo(a) KIV37 was expressed as inclusion bodies and had to be refolded. Fusion apo(a) KIV37 was isolated from the inclusion bodies and purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography by eluting with 0.2 M epsilon-aminocaproic acid. The fusion protein was treated with thrombin to yield a homogeneous, functional apo(a) KIV37 domain composed of 92 amino acids having a molecular mass of 10,510 +/- 1 daltons. N-terminal protein sequencing and amino acid analysis have confirmed the sequence and composition of apo(a) KIV37. The molar extinction coefficient, epsilon, for apo(a) KIV37 was determined to be 3.1 x 10(4) M-1 cm-1, and the pI was measured to be 6.7 +/- 0.1. In addition, the dissociation constants, Kd, for a series of 11 lysine analogs have been determined by measuring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of apo(a) KIV37 upon saturable binding with these compounds. Kd values ranged from 4.2 +/- 0.9 microM for trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid to 4.6 +/- 0.4 mM for L-arginine. Apo(a) KIV37 binds to plasmin-treated fibrinogen with an EC50 value of 14 +/- 1.2 microM and prevents the binding of Lp(a) to plasmin-treated fibrinogen with an IC50 value of 16 +/- 6 microM. Lp(a) binds to the plasmin-treated fibrinogen surface with an EC50 value of approximately 1.0 +/- 0.3 nM. These studies demonstrate that apo(a) KIV37 can be expressed at high levels, refolded properly, and used as a fully functional lysine-binding domain. In addition, these results also demonstrate that apo(a) KIV37 provides the major interaction of Lp(a) with fibrinogen. One additional weak binding site in Lp(a) is adequate to describe overall Lp(a) binding to fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W112124512,"Abstract A mutant fibroblast, 2A4b, was isolated from the Chinese hamster lung cell line CCL39 by a previously described selection (Rath, H. M., Doyle, G. A. R., and Silbert, D. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13387-13390) for cells deficient in thrombin-induced signaling. Although the antiporter activation by thrombin in 2A4b is only approximately 60% that in CCL39, the stimulation by serum is not significantly impaired, indicating that the defect in 2A4b lies upstream of the antiporter in the signaling pathway. The addition of thrombin to serum-starved 2A4b cells causes blunted responses both in production of inositol phosphates and in the cytosolic [Ca2+] transient, particularly when no Ca2+ is added to the external medium. The in vitro inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity of 2A4b cytosol plus membrane extracts exceeds that in CCL39. However, immunoblots with antibodies to PLC isozymes show that although the levels of PLC-delta 1, PLC-gamma 1, and PLC-beta 3 are at least as great as those in CCL39, the amount of PLC-beta 1 in 2A4b is markedly deficient (< or = 10%). PLC-beta 1 is found primarily in the nucleus and in non-nuclear membranes of CCL39 and is proportionately low in these subcellular locations of 2A4b. Thrombin activation of phospholipases D and A2 is impaired in 2A4b. We postulate that the deficiency in PLC-beta 1 causes defective targeting of protein kinase C-alpha to specific membrane sites, which may be required for activation of these downstream phospholipases."
https://openalex.org/W2012693881,"We have used streptolysin-O (SO)-permeabilized neutrophils to investigate the signal transduction pathway through which chemoattractants induce actin polymerization. Chemoattractants stimulate phosphorylation of various proteins and lipids but whether these phosphorylations are required for actin polymerization is not known. Addition of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to SO-permeabilized neutrophils induced a doubling of the F-actin. This induction of F-actin, assayed by TRITC-labeled phalloidin binding, did not require the addition of ATP. Neither addition of apyrase to deplete residual ATP nor addition of ADP or UDP to compete with residual endogenous ATP inhibited significantly the GTP gamma S-induced polymerization. Addition of ATP on its own caused no increase in F-actin and did not affect the time course or concentration dependence of GTP gamma S-induced F-actin. Addition of ATP did increase the maximal amount of F-actin induced by GTP gamma S by about 20%. N-Formylnorleucylleucylphenalanine (formyl-peptide) in the presence of GTP, but not in its absence, also stimulated an increase in F-actin in SO-permeabilized cells. The F-actin induced by formyl-peptide plus GTP was inhibited by pertussis toxin. The induction did not require addition of ATP and addition of ADP to compete with residual ATP only slightly decreased the level of actin. However, addition of UDP significantly reduced the response to formyl-peptide plus GTP. Addition of ATP enhanced the increase in F-actin induced by optimal concentrations of GTP with formyl-peptide. ATP also lowered the apparent Km for GTP, but not for N-formyl peptide. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate, did not enhance the actin polymerization. Rather its presence inhibited the response induced by formyl-peptide plus GTP. The data suggest that actin polymerization can be induced by GTP gamma S in an manner that is largely ATP-independent. A role for ATP cannot be ruled out in the induction of actin polymerization by formyl-peptide plus GTP."

https://openalex.org/W1625604824,"We have shown by transient transfection assays that c-Abl increases expression of a c-myc promoter construct although to a lesser extent than v-Abl. c-Abl has been reported to bind to a specific DNA sequence, the EP element, in the hepatitis B virus enhancer. A similar sequence exists in the promoter region of the c-myc gene, and we have identified a potential protein binding site in this region by in vivo footprinting. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that the hepatitis B virus enhancer and c-myc sites yield identical complexes. To determine whether c-Abl activates c-myc transcription by binding directly to the promoter region, several experiments were performed. Mutation of the EP site in the c-myc promoter had no effect on transcriptional activation of c-myc by c-Abl. Next, we demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of c-Abl was not required for the transcriptional activation of c-myc. Finally, by Western blot analysis, we have determined that c-Abl is not present in the gel shift complexes formed by either the hepatitis B virus enhancer or c-myc promoter. We conclude that c-Abl activates c-myc transcription indirectly with no requirement for DNA binding by c-Abl. We also find no evidence for the interaction of c-Abl with the EP sequence of either the hepatitis B virus enhancer or the c-myc promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1533798837,"To determine the effect of the major DNA adduct, the intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link, produced by the antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) on the activity of a helicase known to be essential for DNA replication, we have examined its interaction with the origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) of herpes simplex virus type-1. We found that the helicase activity of the UL9 protein is inhibited only when the adduct is present on the template strand along which the protein translocates. This effect was paralleled by a comparable inhibition of the UL9 protein's DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The inhibitory effect of the lesion can be reduced by the addition of the herpes simplex virus type-1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8. This stimulatory effect is specific for ICP8 and appears to be the result of the functional and physical interaction that is known to exist between the UL9 protein and ICP8, and not due to the preferential interaction of ICP8 with the adduct."
https://openalex.org/W26908013,"An oligonucleotide containing the recognition site for the Escherichia coli lac repressor was inserted at various positions in the 5' flanking region of a human serine tRNA gene, and the consequences of binding lac repressor on in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase III were investigated. lac repressor prebound to operator sites centered at positions -9, -15, -35, and -37 upstream of the mature tRNA coding region completely inhibited transcription by interfering with the formation or stability of transcription complexes. lac repressor also inhibited transcription of tDNA derivatives containing operator sites at -9 and -15 when added following assembly of transcription complexes or during ongoing synthesis, but had no effects on the other tDNA derivatives if added subsequent to complex assembly. lac repressor prebound at position -43 and -46 partially inhibited transcription and redirected initiation to sites farther downstream. These effects required the continued presence of bound repressor protein. Our findings demonstrate that the human RNA polymerase III transcription complex extends at least 35 nucleotides upstream of the coding region and suggest that the spatial constraints imposed by a protein bound this far upstream can alter start site selection. Moreover, the flanking region encompassing the transcription start site remains accessible to DNA-binding proteins following assembly of the initiation complex and throughout multiple rounds of transcription."
