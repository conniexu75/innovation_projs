https://openalex.org/W1976348423,"We investigated the relationship between opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and occurrence of cell death in rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells. Treatment with arachidonic acid or induces PTP opening in situ with similar kinetics, as assessed by the calcein loading-Co(2+) quenching technique (Petronilli, V., Miotto, G., Canton, M., Colonna, R., Bernardi, P., and Di Lisa, F. (1999) Biophys. J. 76, 725-734). Yet depolarization, as assessed from the changes of mitochondrial tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence, is rapid and extensive with arachidonic acid and slow and partial with. Cyclosporin A-inhibitable release of cytochrome c and cell death correlate with the changes of TMRM fluorescence but not with those of calcein fluorescence. Since pore opening must be accompanied by depolarization, we conclude that short PTP openings are detected only by trapped calcein and may have little impact on cell viability, while changes of TMRM distribution require longer PTP openings, which cause release of cytochrome c and may result in cell death. Modulation of the open time appears to be the key element in determining the outcome of stimuli that converge on the PTP."
https://openalex.org/W2018769240,"In Alzheimer's disease and spongiform encephalopathies proteins transform from their native states into fibrils. We find that several amyloid-forming proteins harbor an α-helix in a polypeptide segment that should form a β-strand according to secondary structure predictions. In 1324 nonredundant protein structures, 37 β-strands with ≥7 residues were predicted in segments where the experimentally determined structures show helices. These discordances include the prion protein (helix 2, positions 179–191), the Alzheimer amyloid β-peptide (Aβ, positions 16–23), and lung surfactant protein C (SP-C, positions 12–27). In addition, human coagulation factor XIII (positions 258–266), triacylglycerol lipase from Candida antarctica (positions 256–266), andd-alanyl-d-alanine transpeptidase fromStreptomyces R61 (positions 92–106) contain a discordant helix. These proteins have not been reported to form fibrils but in this study were found to form fibrils in buffered saline at pH 7.4. By replacing valines in the discordant helical part of SP-C with leucines, an α-helix is found experimentally and by secondary structure predictions. This analogue does not form fibrils under conditions where SP-C forms abundant fibrils. Likewise, when Aβ residues 14–23 are removed or changed to a nondiscordant sequence, fibrils are no longer formed. We propose that α-helix/β-strand-discordant stretches are associated with amyloid fibril formation. In Alzheimer's disease and spongiform encephalopathies proteins transform from their native states into fibrils.

Likewise, when Aβ residues 14–23 are removed or changed to a nondiscordant sequence, fibrils are no longer formed. We propose that α-helix/β-strand-discordant stretches are associated with amyloid fibril formation. Amyloid fibrils can be formed from different proteins and are associated with severe diseases like the neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease and the prion diseases Creutzfeld-Jakob in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, as well as other organ-specific and systemic amyloidoses (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The ∼20 proteins that are associated with amyloid diseases have no obvious common properties in amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure, or function (2Sipe J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Despite these differences in native structures, the amyloid fibrils are very similar irrespective from which protein they originate (3Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils are built up from β-strands perpendicular and β-sheets parallel to the fiber axis (4Jiménez J.L. Guijarro J.I. Orlova E. Zurdo J. Dobson C.M. Sunde M. Saibil H.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, amyloid-forming proteins that mainly contain α-helical structures in their native states must undergo α-helix → β-strand conversions before or during fibril formation. Tinctorial and spectroscopic studies indicate that the conversion of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC)1 to its fibrillar scrapie counterpart (PrPSc) is accompanied by reduction in α-helix content and increase in β-sheet structure (5Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) fibril formation associated with Alzheimer's disease also involves α-helix to β-strand conversion (6Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Amyloid diseases mostly occur without known precipitating factors (7Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and no explanation has yet been found to the occurrence ofde novo α → β conversion in amyloid-forming proteins. This conversion may occur in partially denaturing cellular environments (8Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which, however, does not explain why only certain proteins form amyloid. Destabilizing point mutations can cause fibril formation of an otherwise stable protein (9Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), but point mutations related to inherited forms of human prion diseases do not induce PrPSc in vitro and are not generally destabilizing (10Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Aβ-(1–42)-peptide is highly fibrillogenic, whereas peptides lacking residues 14–23 are not (11Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Proteins that give rise to amyloid may harbor polypeptide segments that make them more prone to undergo α → β conversions than nonamyloidogenic proteins. A key question is whether specific helices of these proteins are predisposed to undergo α → β conversions. Lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 35-residue lipopeptide derived from a larger precursor by proteolysis. SP-C isolated from natural sources is composed of an α-helix covering positions 9–34 (12Johansson J. Szyperski T. Curstedt T. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Monomeric α-helical SP-C is thermodynamically unstable, and the peptide irreversibly forms aggregates with β-sheet structure (13Szyperski T. Vandenbussche G. Curstedt T. Ruysschaert J.-M. Wüthrich K. Johansson J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SP-C assembles into amyloid fibrils upon incubation in solution, and fibrils composed of SP-C were isolated from a patient with the disease pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (14Gustafsson M. Thyberg J. Näslund J. Eliasson E. Johansson J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The α-helix of mature SP-C contains a very long continuous stretch of valine residues, which is unusual since valines are well known to be overrepresented in β-strands and underrepresented in helices. Intriguingly, synthetic SP-C peptides are inefficient in helix formation but form insoluble aggregates (15Johansson J. Nilsson G. Strömberg R. Robertson B. Jörnvall H. Curstedt T. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, peptides where the polyvaline segment of SP-C was replaced with a helical part of bacteriorhodopsin or a polyleucine stretch, both with high statistical helical propensities, readily form helices (15Johansson J. Nilsson G. Strömberg R. Robertson B. Jörnvall H. Curstedt T. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Nilsson G. Gustafsson M. Vandenbussche G. Veldhuizen E. Griffiths W.J. Sjövall J. Haagsman H.P. Ruysschaert J.-M. Robertson B. Curstedt T. Johansson J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These features suggest that α-helices for which β-strands are predicted may be prone to undergo α-helix → β-strand transition and amyloid formation (14Gustafsson M. Thyberg J. Näslund J. Eliasson E. Johansson J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here we tested this hypothesis by searching for discrepancies between experimentally determined α-helices and predicted extended (β-strand) structures in 1324 nonredundant entries in the Protein Data Bank. This revealed a striking correlation between α/β discordance and ability to form amyloid fibrils. The May 1999 list of PDB_SELECT (17Hobohm U. Scharf M. Schneider R. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) was initially used to obtain a nonhomologous set of proteins from the Brookhaven data base (18Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26946) Google Scholar). This list consists of 1106 sequences with less than 25% residue identity in pairwise comparisons. During the project a new version of PDB_SELECT was released (November 1999 set), and for completeness, proteins that were nonoverlapping with the May list were added to the data set. Using FASTA (19Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9362) Google Scholar), proteins in the November 1999 set that are not homologous to any of the proteins in the May set (expect value >0.1) were selected. This resulted in an addition of 218 proteins, and the final data set thus consisted of 1324 nonhomologous proteins. The secondary structure elements of the selected proteins were extracted from the Protein Data Bank files by Defined Secondary Structure of Proteins (20Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12173) Google Scholar), as implemented in ICM (version 2.7, Molsoft LLC, San Diego, CA) (21Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). This method defines eight secondary structure classes from hydrogen bond patterns: α-helix (H), 310-helix (G), π-helix (I), extended strand (E), isolated β bridge (B), turn (T), bend (S), and coil (_). Here three classes of secondary structures were used as follows: helix (H, G, and I), strand (E), and loop (B, T, S, and _), since these three classes are employed by the method used for secondary structure prediction. Secondary structures were predicted using PHD (Profile network from HeiDelberg) (22Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar), a system of neural networks with an overall accuracy of about 72% (23Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). In 1978, Chou and Fasman (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) calculated the amino acid distributions in helices, Pα, and β-strands, Pβ, based on a set of 29 proteins. The P values are defined as the frequency of each amino acid residue in α-helices (or β-strands) divided by the average frequency of all residues in α-helices (or β-strands). We recalculated these values using stretches of at least five consecutive residues of helix (H) or β-strand (E) in the Protein Data Bank May data set described above. For this purpose transmembrane proteins were removed, resulting in a set of 1091 proteins. The resulting Pα and Pβ values are given in Table I.Table IPropensity values for α-helices (Pα) and β-strands (Pβ)Amino acidPαPβA1.46 (1.42)0.78 (0.83)C0.75 (0.70)1.26 (1.19)D0.83 (1.01)0.51 (0.54)E1.37 (1.51)0.69 (0.37)F0.97 (1.13)1.49 (1.38)G0.43 (0.57)0.69 (0.75)H0.90 (1.00)1.05 (0.87)I1.07 (1.08)1.65 (1.60)K1.14 (1.16)0.78 (0.74)L1.36 (1.21)1.13 (1.30)M1.25 (1.45)1.10 (1.05)N0.72 (0.67)0.64 (0.89)P0.40 (0.57)0.32 (0.55)Q1.34 (1.11)0.82 (1.10)R1.24 (0.98)0.88 (0.93)S0.76 (0.77)0.88 (0.75)T0.76 (0.83)1.21 (1.19)V0.94 (1.06)1.89 (1.70)W1.05 (1.08)1.39 (1.37)Y0.95 (0.69)1.47 (1.47)The propensity values were calculated according to Ref. 24Chou P.Y.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the poly(Val → Leu)-substituted SP-C analogue (SP-C(Leu)) was synthesized as described (16Nilsson G. Gustafsson M. Vandenbussche G. Veldhuizen E. Griffiths W.J. Sjövall J. Haagsman H.P. Ruysschaert J.-M. Robertson B. Curstedt T. Johansson J. Eur. J.

Frère and Joris, University of Liege, Belgium, and triacylglycerol lipase fromCandida antarctica and human coagulation factor XIII were purchased from Sigma. For fibrillation studies the latter three proteins were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at concentrations of 10–100 μm. SP-C and SP-C(Leu) were dissolved at 100 or 250 μm in chloroform/methanol/0.1m HCl, 32:64:5 (by volume), a solvent mixture in which SP-C retains a structure very similar to that in phospholipid bilayers (25Johansson J. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days; thereafter the solutions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. SP-C and SP-C(Leu) contents in the supernatants at different time points after solubilization were determined by amino acid analysis of triplicate samples. For analyses of fibrils, the pellets were suspended in a small volume of water by low energy sonication for 5 s. Aliquots of 8 μl were placed on electron microscopy grids covered by a carbon-stabilized Formvar film. Excess fluid was withdrawn after 30 s, and after air-drying the grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water. The stained grids were examined and photographed in a Philips CM120TWIN electron microscope operated at 80 kV. A nonredundant set of protein sequences with known three-dimensional structures (1324 proteins, total of 269,058 amino acid residues) was submitted to PHD for secondary structure prediction. 37 of these proteins contained a 7-residue or longer α-helix predicted (reliability index ≥5 on a scale from 1 to 9) to be in β-strand conformation (Fig. 1). This discrepancy will be referred to as α-helix/β-strand discordance. Secondary structure predictions based on α-helix and β-strand propensity values (Table I) gave results in excellent agreement with the PHD results (Fig.2). The number of discordant stretches increases steeply for ≤6-residue segments (Fig. 1), and only proteins with ≥7-residue discordant segments were analyzed further. Fig. 2shows amino acid sequences as well as determined and predicted secondary structures for the 17 proteins with ≥9-residue discordant segments. The 8-residue discordant segment of Aβ is also included in Fig. 2. Moreover, the discordant segments of human and mouse PrP (26Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F. Billeter M.

Donne D.G. Kaneko K. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) found by the initial search. The proteins that contain α/β-discordant segments represent a wide selection of structures (ranging from single helical peptides to large globular proteins with complex α/β architectures), localizations (nuclear, cytosolic, integral and peripheral membrane proteins, as well as extracellular proteins), and species of origin (ranging from virus to human). The set encompasses three previously known amyloidogenic proteins,i.e. the prion protein (13- or 15-residue discordant segment, depending on species, corresponding to helix 2), Aβ (8-residue segment), and SP-C (16-residue segment) (Figs. 1 and 2). No consensus pattern in the primary structures of the discordant segments could be detected. Neither a recently proposed consensus sequence for amyloid-forming proteins (29Kurochkin I.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) nor a binary pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues found in fibrillating peptides by a combinatorial approach (30West M.W.

Amino acid sequences, together with determined and predicted secondary structure elements for all identified ≥9-residue discordant segments, and those of Aβ, mouse, and human PrP. The proteins are grouped after the length of their discordant stretch. The proteins for which amyloid formation has been demonstrated are identified by full names or abbreviations, in addition to the Protein Data Bank codes given for all entries. The bottom row of each case shows the experimentally determined helical segments as blue cylinders in which the amino acid sequences are given. The sequence locations of the helices in the Protein Data Bank entries (upper numbers) and in the full-length proteins (lower numbers) are given. In the cases where only one number is given, the Protein Data Bank entries correspond to the full-length protein. In the middle row, the locations of the β-strands predicted by PHD are visualized by yellow strands, where the reliability index for each residue is shown. The propensity-based predictions, averaged for 6-residue segments and plotted above residue 3 in each segment, are given in thetop row. In these predictions, E denotesextended structures (i.e. β-strands) predicted with high (average >1.0) and e denotes low (average ≤ 1.0) probability. H and h represent predictedhelical structures in an analogous manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Among the proteins with ≥7-residue discordant segments, five are integral membrane proteins or parts thereof (bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome c oxidase, SP-C, Aβ, and parathyroid hormone receptor). The driving forces for α-helix formation in a membrane environment differ from those in aqueous solution (31Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the secondary structure prediction methods used here are based mainly on soluble proteins. However, Aβ, which is derived from a trans- and juxtamembrane region of its precursor protein, and SP-C, which is a transmembrane peptide, form amyloid in vivo. The proteins found cover a broad range of functions and many are enzymes (59% compared with 47% in the starting data set) or other ligand-binding proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). In several cases the discordant helices harbor active site or ligand-interacting residues. For example, the metalloproteases astacin (code 1iab) and adamalysin II (code 3aig) and methane monooxygenase (code 1mty) harbor zinc- or iron-binding residues in their respective helix (32Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stocker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33Gomis-Ruth F.X. Meyer E.F. Kress L.F. Politi V.

Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); in the Arf exchange factor ARNO (code 1pbv) the discordant segment is involved in Arf binding (36Cherfils J. Menetrey J. Mathieu M.

Moews P.C. Hite G.J. Bartolone J.B. Zhao H. Joris B. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6449-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glockshuberet al. (39Glockshuber R. Hornemann S. Billeter M. Riek R. Wider G. Wütrich K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) observed that PrP shows similarities to signal peptidases and that His-177 then is a putative active-site residue. His-177 is located in the N-terminal part of PrP helix 2, now found to be discordant (Fig. 2). Three of the proteins harboring long discordant helices, i.e. transpeptidase from StreptomycesR61, triacylglycerol lipase from C. antarctica, and human coagulation factor XIII, with 15-, 11-, and 9-residue discordant segments were available to us for fibrillation studies. All three proteins were found to form amyloid fibrils in buffer at physiological pH (Fig. 3). Thus, 6/37 proteins with ≥7-residue-long α/β-discordant segments and 4/10 with segments of ≥11 residues have been analyzed, and all form amyloid fibrils. The correlation between α/β discordance and fibril formation suggests that there may be a causal connection, and experiments with two of the discordant proteins support this. First, replacement of all valine residues in the discordant segment of SP-C with leucine yields a peptide, SP-C(Leu), with helical conformation as judged by circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy (16Nilsson G. Gustafsson M. Vandenbussche G. Veldhuizen E. Griffiths W.J. Sjövall J. Haagsman H.P. Ruysschaert J.-M. Robertson B. Curstedt T. Johansson J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SP-C(Leu) is in contrast to the discordant native SP-C predicted to form an α-helical structure, and the time-dependent aggregation of SP-C and SP-C(Leu) shows striking differences (Fig. 4). SP-C starts to precipitate during the first hours of incubation and shows extensive aggregation after 5–10 days, but SP-C(Leu) shows no signs of precipitation during the same period. Consistently, SP-C(Leu) forms no fibrils or only occasional fibrils after 3 days of incubation at 250 μm concentration (data not shown). SP-C, on the other hand, forms abundant fibrils at 100 μm concentration after a few hours (14Gustafsson M. Thyberg J. Näslund J. Eliasson E. Johansson J.

Fig. 2) does not form detectable amyloid fibrils under conditions where Aβ-(1–42) readily forms fibrils (11Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Terenius L. Thyberg J.

Moreover, Aβ-(1–28) with alanine substitutions at positions 16, 17, and 20 does not form fibrils, whereas Aβ-(1–28) forms fibrils that are similar to those formed by Aβ-(1–42) (40Tjernberg L.O.

Intriguingly, these substitutions revert the discordance of Aβ, giving instead a predicted helix between residues 15 and 21 (Fig.5).Figure 5Ala substitutions reverts α/β-discordance of Aβ.

Symbolsas described for Figs. 2 and 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We compared experimentally determined nonredundant protein structures available from Protein Data Bank with secondary structures predicted for the same proteins using PHD and a Chou-Fasman approach. Thereby 37/1324 (2.8%) proteins were found to contain a ≥7-residue α-helix that is predicted to form a β-strand. These proteins include PrP associated with spongiform encephalopathies, Aβ involved in Alzheimer's disease, and lung SP-C that forms amyloid in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Figs. 1 and 2). Lysozyme contains a 5-residue-long discordant helix (positions 30–34; data not shown), and wild-type lysozyme does not form amyloid. However, two naturally occurring human lysozyme variants, with point mutation Ile-56 → Thr or Asp-67 → His, are both unstable and amyloidogenic (9Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated whether the discordant helix of lysozyme contributes to the amyloidogenic nature of the mutants. The remaining proteins known to be associated with amyloid diseases (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2Sipe J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) are either all β proteins or lack experimentally determined three-dimensional structures. Three proteins now found to be α/β-discordant,i.e. human coagulation factor XIII, StreptomycesR61 transpeptidase, and C. antarctica triacylglycerol lipase, were investigated and found to form amyloid fibrils upon incubation in aqueous solution at neutral pH (Fig. 3). We also show that fibril formation and peptide aggregation is practically abolished by converting the α/β-discordant stretch of SP-C to a helix composed of residues that statistically favor helix formation (Fig. 4). Likewise, fibril formation is abolished when the discordant stretch of the Aβ peptide is removed or rendered nondiscordant by replacement of three residues (11Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.

It is clear that there are a number of ways that amyloid fibrils could be formed, and the data presented herein strongly suggest that long stretches of α-helix/β-strand discordance in proteins predict amyloid fibril formation. It appears reasonable that proteins with discordant helices can form intermediates where the helix has unfolded. The high β-strand propensities of these regions indicate that they are less likely to refold into a helical conformation than are regions for which helices are predicted. β-Strands in such species could form β-sheets via protein oligomerization, leading to fibril formation. This has been observed for SP-C; once unfolding of the SP-C helix occurs, refolding is not observed by NMR (13Szyperski T. Vandenbussche G. Curstedt T. Ruysschaert J.-M. Wüthrich K. Johansson J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or mass spectrometry, 2M. Gustafsson, W. J. Griffiths, E. Furusjó, and J. Johansson, manuscript in preparation. but the peptide instead forms β-sheet aggregates and amyloid fibrils (13Szyperski T. Vandenbussche G. Curstedt T. Ruysschaert J.-M. Wüthrich K. Johansson J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,14Gustafsson M. Thyberg J. Näslund J. Eliasson E. Johansson J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Proteins that are not known to form fibrils in vivo can form fibrils under in vitro conditions that favor destabilization, like extremes of pH and presence of organic cosolvents (41Guijarro J.I.

From these studies it has been suggested that amyloid formation is not primarily dependent on the amino acid sequence but could be a generic trait of destabilized polypeptides. The findings presented herein indicate that also under physiological conditions, fibril formation is more common than previously anticipated (Fig. 3). On the other hand, SP-C polyvaline → polyleucine substitution and K16A/L17A/F20A mutations of Aβ-(1–28) practically abolish fibril formation, showing that at least in these cases the fibrillation process is sequence-dependent (40Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The clear-cut difference in aggregation between SP-C and its polyleucine analogue (Fig. 4) contradicts side chain hydrophobicity as a general determinant of fibril formation. Further investigations of the fibril formation of α/β-discordant proteins, and site-directed mutants where the discordant helices have been modulated, may shed more light on general principles that underlie amyloid fibril formation under physiological conditions. Helix 2 of PrP is discordant, whereas helices 1 and 3 of PrP were predicted to be helical both with PHD and Chou-Fasman-based methods (data not shown). Strikingly, in a previous prediction of PrP secondary structure, contradictory results were obtained for the helix 2 region, suggesting that alternative conformations of PrP can coexist (43Huang Z. Gabriel J.-M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the discordant segment of PrP helix 2, the Cys is connected to helix 3 via a disulfide bond, and the Asn is glycosylated. The consequences of these modifications for the α/β-discordance are not known at the present. No posttranslational chemical modifications responsible for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc have been found (44Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In many cases protein aggregation involves structured folding intermediates (45Wetzel R. Cell. 1996; 86: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PrP can exist in multiple conformations, suggesting that PrPC may be intrinsically flexible and prone to structural transitions (46Zhang H. Stockel J. Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3543-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Out of eight point mutations, corresponding to polymorphic sites associated with inherited forms of prion disease, T183A localized in the middle of helix 2 resulted in extensive aggregation at a concentration 160-fold lower than that at which the other mutants were soluble when introduced in recombinant mouse PrP-(121–231) (10Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Likewise, recombinant human PrP-(90–231) D178N mutation (in helix 2) gave rise to aggregation, whereas P102L and E200K mutants were soluble (47Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Amyloid is believed to be associated with, and even responsible for, the pathological changes seen during the course of the corresponding diseases (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 3Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 48Näslund J.

This implies that obstruction of amyloid formation may prevent the occurrence and/or progression of amyloidoses. Attempts have been made to identify compounds that can abrogate fibril formation by interfering with peptide-peptide contacts in fibrils or by inhibiting proteolytic processing that leads to amyloidogenic peptides (49Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that α/β-discordant helices are involved in the fibrillation process for some proteins and that stabilization of these segments in helical conformation could prevent amyloid formation. Such an approach appears worthwhile to explore, as the α/β-discordant segments represent small and specific regions, and their localizations in the disease-associated proteins Aβ and PrP are now identified.

We show that both compounds induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT). At variance from palmitic acid, however, arachidonic acid causes a PT at concentrations that do not cause PT-independent depolarization or respiratory inhibition, suggesting a specific effect on the PT pore. When added to intact MH1C1 cells, arachidonic acid but not palmitic acid caused a mitochondrial PTin situ that was accompanied by cytochrome crelease and rapidly followed by cell death. All these effects of arachidonic acid could be prevented by cyclosporin A but not by the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor α caused phospholipid hydrolysis, induction of the PT, cytochrome c release, and cell death that could be inhibited by both cyclosporin A and aristolochic acid.

The PT is modulated by a variety of effectors of cell death, including reactive oxygen species that are produced early by mitochondria after stimulation of the TNFα receptor (2Schulze-Osthoff K.

Several cytosolic proteins are recruited to the receptor death domain, which in turn leads to the production of a variety of second messengers. As a result, multiple protein-mediated signaling cascades are activated, including caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways, phospholipases, protein kinases, and protein phosphatases (see Ref. 11Wallach D.

Lipid mediators may be involved both in signaling and in the late cellular responses by receptors of the TNFα superfamily, and solid evidence indicates that mitochondria can be the target of lipid mediators of pathophysiological relevance. Ceramide produced by acidic sphingomyelinase is essential for production of GD3 ganglioside, a cell death inducer (12De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R.

TNFα receptor engagement causes caspase-dependent cleavage of cytosolic PLA2, followed by membrane translocation of a 70-kDa active fragment and production of AA (21Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M.

AA can in turn activate the ceramide pathway by stimulating neutral sphingomyelinase (22Jayadev S. Hayter H.L. Andrieu N. Gamard C.J. Liu B. Balu R. Hayakawa M. Ito F. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Prompted by these observations we have investigated the effects of AA in isolated mitochondria and intact cells. We show that AA is a powerful PT inducer that mimics the mitochondrial effects of TNFα in MH1C1 cells and that AA generated by PLA2 activation plays a role in apoptotic signaling through the mitochondrial pathway. Liver mitochondria were prepared by standard centrifugation techniques from albino Wistar rats weighing about 300 g (24Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial volume changes were monitored as the absorbance changes at 540 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda-10 or with an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer (25Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential was calculated based on the equilibrium distribution of rhodamine 123 (26Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), assuming a matrix volume of 1 μl per mg protein−1. Rhodamine 123 uptake was determined under the specified conditions from the fluorescence changes of mitochondrial suspensions containing 0.1 μm rhodamine 123 at the wavelength pair 503–525 nm, with excitation and emission slits set at 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Oxygen consumption was determined polarographically using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. All assays were performed at 25 °C in instruments equipped with thermostatic control and magnetic stirring. Measurement of PLA2 activation was based on the cleavage of bis-BODIPY®-FL-C11-PC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a synthetic phospholipid containing fluorescein that is dequenched upon cleavage of PC. For loading, MH1C1 cells seeded on uncoated 22-mm round glass coverslips were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with a 2% (v/v) suspension of liposomes prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (Sigma), cholesterol (Sigma), and bis-BODIPY®-FL-C11-PC in a molar ratio of 271:74:1.8. After washing twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with vehicle, 50 μmaristolochic acid, or 2 μm CsA and then imaged as described below. Fluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope, equipped with a xenon light source (75 watts) for epifluorescence illumination and with a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments). Filter settings were 480 ± 25 nm excitation and 525 nm long pass emission, and images were collected with an exposure time of 100 ms using a × 40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon). Data were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Sequential digital images were acquired at the times indicated in Fig.6A, and the whole cellular fluorescence of 10 cells in each field was recorded and stored. Control experiments showed that bis-BODIPY®-FL-C11-PC was properly inserted in the bilayer, since no fluorescence increase was elicited by added PLA2 (not shown). The data in Fig. 6A were corrected for background fluorescence and are normalized for comparative purposes. Culture conditions for MH1C1 rat hepatoma cells, staining and imaging with calcein, TMRM, annexin-V, and propidium iodide, and immunodetection of the bc1 complex and cytochrome c were carried out exactly as described in detail in the companion paper (7Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Calcein, bis-BODIPY®-FL-C11-PC, TMRM, and rhodamine 123 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); TNFα, aristolochic acid, and AA were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Läufelfingen, Switzerland); and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available grade. CsA was a generous gift of Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). The experiments of Fig. 1 compare the effects of PA and AA on the volume maintained by energized rat liver mitochondria, measured on the basis of the absorbance changes at 540 nm (25Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were first loaded with a small Ca2+ pulse, followed by EGTA to prevent Ca2+ release via the uniporter (27Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1405-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent addition of increasing concentrations of PA (Fig.1A) or of AA (Fig. 1B) caused the expected (28Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) absorbance decrease that accompanies the PT, which is documented by its inhibition by CsA (traces d in both panels). Importantly, the PT was completely insensitive to aristolochic acid (traces e in both panels), which inhibits PLA2 (29Rosenthal M.D. Vishwanath B.S. Franson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); and AA was a more potent inducer of mitochondrial swelling than PA (compareA and B). We next assessed whether PT induction by PA and AA was due to a direct effect on the PTP or rather to an indirect effect, an issue that has been the subject of some debate (28Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The experiments of Fig. 2 illustrate the concentration dependence of the effects of PA (Fig. 2A) and AA (Fig. 2B) on the membrane potential (closed circles), on uncoupled respiration (closed triangles), 2Note that CsA was added in these measurements to prevent PT-dependent changes of respiration or membrane potential. and on PT-dependent swelling (open circles). From these titrations it is apparent that the PT-inducing effects of PA occurred in the same range of concentrations causing respiratory inhibition and depolarization. This is consistent with the finding that the PT-inducing effects of nonesterified, long chain fatty acids correlate with their effects on the membrane potential (30Schönfeld P. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and are only partly due to a direct effect on the PTP (25Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AA induced a relevant effect on the PTP (70% of maximal) at concentrations (10 μm) that had relatively little effect on respiration and membrane potential (Fig. 2B), suggesting a direct effect of the PTP. We further characterized the mechanism of PT induction by AA by testing its sensitivity to a set of inhibitors. The experiments of Fig.3 demonstrate that PT induction by AA was insensitive to NEM and MBM, which are able to block the effects of reagents acting through pyridine nucleotides and thiol oxidation (32Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar,33Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inducing effects of AA could be fully blocked by sphingosine, which inhibits PTP induction by a variety of fatty acids (34Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and by PGO, an arginine reagent that is able to prevent PTP opening by the protonophore FCCP (35Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The PTP is affected by a very large number of individual effectors (36Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite recent progress in understanding the basis for its modulationin vitro, it remains extremely difficult to predict whether a given set of conditions can promote the PT in situ (see Refs. 1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar and 37Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar for reviews). We therefore tested whether AA and PA were able to cause a PT in situ. The experiments of Fig.4A document that the addition of AA caused a time-dependent decrease of mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence (closed squares) due to a PT, as shown by the inhibitory effects of CsA (closed circles). On the other hand, aristolochic acid was without effect (open squares), suggesting that AA is acting on mitochondria directly. As could be predicted on the basis of its effects in isolated mitochondria, Fig.4B shows that PA caused a very small decrease of TMRM fluorescence (closed squares) that was sensitive to CsA (closed circles) but not to aristolochic acid (open squares). It is noteworthy that PA had much smaller effects than AA even at a concentration of 0.6 mm (results not shown). We next assessed whether PT opening by AA was causally related to cell death. In MH1C1 cells AA-induced PT was followed by release of cytochrome c, as assessed with the in situ double labeling technique, which is described in detail in the companion paper (7Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A), and by cell death, as documented by the appearance of a large number of cells positive for surface phosphatidylserine with annexin V staining (Fig.5B). Both events were largely inhibited by CsA (Fig. 5), whereas neither cytochrome c release nor cell commitment to apoptosis by AA was affected by aristolochic acid (results not shown). On the other hand, in good agreement with the results obtained in isolated mitochondria and in situ, PA had a very small effect on cytochrome c release and cell survival (Fig.5). TNFα inhibits respiration and increases the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, an early event in the apoptotic cascade (2Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that could be due to cytochrome c release following a mitochondrial PT (15Pastorino J.G.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 2111-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since TNFα causes activation of cytosolic PLA2 (21Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the PT could be triggered by TNFα-dependent production of AA. The experiments depicted in Fig.6A show that the addition of TNFα initiated the cleavage of the synthetic phospholipid bis-BODIPY® FL C11-PC (closed squares). Consistent with a role of PLA2 upstream of mitochondria, probe cleavage was prevented by aristolochic acid (open squares) but not by CsA (closed circles), whereas PTP opening was completely prevented by both aristolochic acid and CsA (Fig. 6B). In our model system treatment with TNFα was followed by cytochromec release (Fig. 7A) and by the appearance of annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 7B), and both events were inhibited by CsA and aristolochic acid (Fig.7). In this paper we have shown that AA is an effective inducer of the PT in isolated mitochondria and intact cells. At variance from the case of PA, low concentrations of AA affect the PTP directly rather than through a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Since PT induction by TNFα is inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitor aristolochic acid, which does not inhibit the PTP per se, we suggest that AA released by PLA2 may participate in early apoptotic signaling to mitochondria in the TNFα pathway. Fatty acids exert prominent effects on mitochondrial energy coupling. Besides the specific requirements for thermogenesis through activation of uncoupling protein 1 (40Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), fatty acids also decrease the efficiency of energy conservation in mitochondria from a variety of sources. The mechanism of uncoupling by fatty acids (41Scholefield P.G. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1956; 34: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been the subject of considerable debate. It has been attributed to a protonophoretic (42Gutknecht J. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 106: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or decoupling effect (43Rottenberg H. Hashimoto K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), to increased slipping of the redox H+ pumps (44Luvisetto S. Buso M. Pietrobon D. Azzone G.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and to a dissipative cycle involving transport of the deprotonated form through the adenine nucleotide translocase (45Andreyev A.Y. Bondareva T.O. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. Tsofina L.M. Volkov N.I. Vygodina T.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Fatty acids also cause respiratory inhibition, which is particularly prominent with AA at the level of Complex I (46Hillered L. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 19: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A discussion of the mechanisms through which fatty acids exert this multiplicity of effects is beyond the scope of this work, but a thorough discussion can be found in Ref. 28Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar. The relevant issue in the context of PT modulation is that fatty acids can cause depolarization and hence PTP opening as a secondary consequence. Indeed, the PTP is voltage-dependent both in the sense that membrane depolarization favors pore opening (47Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the sense that a variety of inducers are able to shift the apparent threshold voltage for opening closer to the resting value thereby favoring onset of a PT (25Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A first important result of the present work is the demonstration that, at variance from PA, AA is able to cause PTP opening at concentrations that do not cause respiratory inhibition and membrane depolarization (Fig. 2). We conclude that low concentrations of AA (below 10 μm) selectively interact with the PTP, possibly by modifying its putative voltage sensor. Consistent with this view is our finding that pore opening by AA can be fully inhibited by the arginine reagent PGO (Fig. 3), which is also able to block PTP opening by the protonophore FCCP (35Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is important to stress that the PT-inducing effects of AA were insensitive to inhibition by NEM (Fig. 3), which is able to block PTP opening caused by a variety of oxidants (like organic hydroperoxides, diamide, menadione, and paraquat) as well as dithiol reagents (like arsenite and phenylarsine oxide) (32Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore appears extremely unlikely that the inducing effects of AA are mediated by oxidative processes triggered by AA metabolism. AA is emerging as a very important player in the pathways to cell death. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are among the few agents that can effectively prevent neoplasias (49Baron J.A. Sandler R.S. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), induce apoptosis through elevation of the intracellular levels of AA, and their effects can be mimicked by the addition of exogenous AA (50Chan T.A. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The role of AA has been recently addressed in an elegant model where the levels of intracellular AA could be modulated by overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and fatty acyl-CoA ligase, two of the major intracellular “sinks” for AA. Apoptosis was reduced by induction of either enzyme, which also protected from the killing effects of AA added at the same concentrations used in the present study (51Cao Y. Pearman A.T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11280-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Importantly, apoptosis induction by AA involved activation of caspase-3, a process that is amplified by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (8Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar) and Smac/DIABLO (52Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the PT is a causative event in AA-dependent cell death. Indeed, added AA induces the mitochondrial PT, which in turns causes cytochrome crelease, and blocking the PT-inducing effects of AA with CsA also blocks commitment to apoptosis. Further work will be needed to assess whether this paradigm also applies to other cell types, but the identification of mitochondria as early targets of AA may have far-reaching implications for conditions like brain ischemia where the increase of AA is a key pathogenetic event, and prominent mitochondrial swelling in situ can be observed (53Yoshida S. Inoh S. Asano T. Sano K. Shimasaki H. Ueta N. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 54McGee-Russell S.M. Brown A.W. Brierley J.B.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, neurons were protected from ischemia-reperfusion damage through inhibition of the PTP by CsA (55Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Bengtsson F. Halestrap A.P. Wieloch T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Li P.A. Uchino H. Elmer E. Siesjo B.K. Brain Res. 1997; 753: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which also completely prevented mitochondrial swelling in situ (55Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Bengtsson F. Halestrap A.P. Wieloch T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PT has been implicated in apoptotic signaling through the TNFα receptor in primary cultures of hepatocytes expressing an IκB super repressor (38Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and in L929 fibroblasts (39Tafani M. Schneider T.G. Pastorino J.G. Farber J.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2111-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that PTP opening is an early event in TNFα-dependent induction of apoptosis in rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells as well (Fig. 7). A novel finding of the present work is the demonstration that aristolochic acid, a PLA2 inhibitor (29Rosenthal M.D. Vishwanath B.S. Franson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that does not affect the PT caused by AA either in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1) or in intact cells (Fig. 4), prevented PTP opening and cell death when TNFα was the stimulus (Fig. 7). This suggests that AA may be an endogenous mediator of the PT-inducing effects of TNFα. Early work indicated that PLA2 activation is involved in tumor cell killing by TNFα (57Neale M.L. Fiera R.A. Matthews N. Immunology. 1988; 64: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar, 58Mutch D.G. Powell C.B. Kao M.S. Collins J.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 866-872PubMed Google Scholar), and one of the effects of TNFα-dependent caspase activation is cleavage of cytosolic PLA2 followed by its membrane association with production of AA (21Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The identification of the PTP as one of its downstream targets may guide new pharmacological strategies for the control of pathophysiological conditions where production of AA is part of the signaling mechanism itself and/or of the cellular response to TNFα (11Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2022548242,"The adherence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to the urothelial surface, a critical first step in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI), is controlled by three key elements: E. coli adhesins, host receptors, and host defense mechanisms. Although much has been learned about E. coli adhesins and their urothelial receptors, little is known about the role of host defense in the adherence process. Here we show that Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is the principal urinary protein that binds specifically to type 1 fimbriated E. coli, the main cause of UTI. The binding was highly specific and saturable and could be inhibited by d-mannose and abolished by endoglycosidase H treatment of THP, suggesting that the binding is mediated by the high-mannose moieties of THP. It is species-conserved, occurring in both human and mouse THPs. In addition, the binding to THP was much greater with an E. coli strain bearing a phenotypic variant of the type 1 fimbrial FimH adhesin characteristic of those prevalent in UTI isolates compared with the one prevalent in isolates from the large intestine of healthy individuals. Finally, a physiological concentration of THP completely abolished the binding of type 1 fimbriated E. coli to uroplakins Ia and Ib, two putative urothelial receptors for type 1 fimbriae. These results establish, on a functional level, that THP contains conserved high-mannose moieties capable of specific interaction with type 1 fimbriae and strongly suggest that this major urinary glycoprotein is a key urinary anti-adherence factor serving to prevent type 1 fimbriated E. coli from binding to the urothelial receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1983640618,"Among the extracellular signals that modulate the synthesis of collagen, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are preeminent. These two cytokines exert antagonistic effects on fibroblasts, and play important roles in the physiologic regulation of extracellular matrix turnover. We have shown previously that in normal skin fibroblasts, TGF-β positively regulates α2(I) procollagen gene (COL1A2) promoter activity through the cellular Smad signal transduction pathway. In contrast, IFN-γ activates Stat1α, down-regulates COL1A2transcription, and abrogates its stimulation induced by TGF-β. The level of integration of the two pathways mediating antagonistic collagen regulation is unknown. We now report that IFN-γ abrogates TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription in fibroblasts by inhibiting Smad activities. IFN-γ appears to induce competition between activated Stat1α and Smad3 for interaction with limiting amounts of cellular p300/CBP. Overexpression of p300 restoredCOL1A2 stimulation by TGF-β in the presence of IFN-γ, and potentiated IFN-γ-dependent positive transcriptional responses. In contrast to fibroblasts, in U4A cells lacking Jak1 and consequently unable to activate Stat1α-mediated responses, IFN-γ failed to repress TGF-β-induced transcription. These results indicate that as essential coactivators for both Smad3 and Stat1α, nuclear p300/CBP integrate signals that positively or negatively regulateCOL1A2 transcription. The findings implicate a novel mechanism to account for antagonistic interaction of Smad and Jak-Stat pathways in regulation of target genes.

One of the most potent effects of TGF-β1 is connective tissue accumulation, achieved in part by stimulation of the transcription of type I collagen genes (2Ignotz R.A. Endo T. Massague J. J. Biol.

Thus, TGF-β plays crucial roles in embryonic development and organogenesis, and physiologic connective tissue remodeling during wound healing and tissue repair. On the other hand, excessive TGF-β activity is implicated in the development of pathological fibrosis, the “dark horse of tissue repair” (6Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). TGF-β initiates cellular signals through two distinct transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, the activated TGF-β receptor complex transiently interacts with receptor-activated Smads which propagate TGF-β signals (7Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 are direct substrates of the TGF-β receptor kinase, and interact with the common partner Smad4 (8Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Feng X-H. Wu R-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 10Wu R.Y. Zhang Y.

Smad4-containing heteromeric Smad complexes then translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they function as transcriptional regulators. Smads2–4 share highly conserved DNA-binding MH1 and transactivating MH2 domains; the latter also mediates Smad interactions with other proteins (11Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R.

Smad7 contains a characteristic MH2 domain, but lacks the conserved SSXS phosphorylation motif, and its MH1 domain shows marked divergence from that of Smad3 (13Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to receptor-activated Smads, Smad7 stably binds to TGF-β receptors and interferes with ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (14Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Because its expression is markedly induced by the ligand, Smad7 appears to serve an autoregulatory negative feedback function in cellular TGF-β signaling. We have shown previously that overexpression of Smad3 in primary skin fibroblasts mimicked the action of TGF-β, markedly inducingCOL1A2 promoter activity in vitro (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Transactivation was blocked by phosphorylation-defective dominant negative mutants of Smad3, establishing the critical role of endogenous Smads in transducing information from the activated TGF-β receptor in these cells. The COL1A2 promoter contains Smad3/Smad4-binding consensus “CAGA boxes” (16Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), also found in the promoters of PAI-1, junB, and other TGF-β inducible genes (17Dennler S. Itoh S.

However, asCAGA boxes are widely distributed in the promoters of mammalian genes, and the affinity and specificity of SMAD binding to these is relatively low, other nuclear factors are likely to contribute to the specific and tight Smad-DNA interactions that are required for transcriptional regulation (20Hua X.

CREB-binding protein (CBP) and adenovirus E1A-associated protein p300 are structurally conserved large proteins that function as essential coactivators in several signal transduction pathways. p300/CBP enhance transcription by bridging DNA-bound factors and the basal transcriptional machinery, thereby stabilizing the pre-initiation complex. Furthermore, by nature of their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase enzyme activity, these coactivators acetylate amino-terminal lysine residues of nucleosomal histones (27Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 28Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Local histone hyperacetylation causes nucleosomal relaxation, thus promoting access of transcription factors to target DNA sequences. The transcriptional activity of genes is strongly correlated with their acetylation state (29Turner B.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The presence of conserved protein-binding domains enables p300/CBP to interact with distinct classes of regulated transcription factors. Through binding to CREB, the p65 component of NF-κB, the c-Jun, and c-Fos components of AP-1, and Stats, p300/CBP integrate converging cellular signaling pathways (30Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N.

We previously demonstrated that p300 markedly enhanced TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription in fibroblasts (42Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). By competing with activated Smad3 for limiting amounts of cellular p300/CBP, the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A abrogated TGF-β transactivation, indicating the critical role of p300/CBP in collagen gene transcription in fibroblasts. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a pleiotropic cytokine produced by T cells and NK cells, plays fundamental roles in both innate and acquired immune responses (43Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Transcriptional responses induced by IFN-γ in most cells are mediated through the Jak-Stat pathway (44Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by IFN-γ, tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic Stat1α forms homodimeric complexes that can translocate into the nucleus, and bind directly to palindromic γ-activated sites (GAS) of IFN-γ-responsive target gene promoters. Stat1α thus serves as an essential mediator of IFN-γ-induced transcriptional responses. Stat1α physically associates with p300/CBP near its amino-terminal domain; this interaction plays an important functional role in positive regulation of IFN-γ-induced transcriptional responses (45Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard E. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld D.W. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 46Zhang J.J.

In addition to transcriptional stimulation, IFN-γ can also negatively regulate the transcription of selected genes, but no common IFN-γ-specific inhibitory elements have been identified. We and others have shown previously that IFN-γ inhibits the transcription of collagen in fibroblasts independent of Stat1-promoter interactions, and abrogates its stimulation induced by TGF-β (47Kähäri V.-M.

Because these two cytokines are secreted by inflammatory cells at sites of tissue injury, their antagonistic interactions regulating collagen synthesis are likely to be of great importance in the maintenance of connective tissue homeostasis. As well as suppressing the stimulation of collagen transcription, IFN-γ abrogates other TGFβ responses, including collagenase-3 expression in epithelial cells (52Ala-Aho R. Johansson N. Grenman R. Fusenig N.E. Lopez-Otin C. Kähäri V.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), perlecan expression in colon carcinoma cells (53Sharma B. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar). The basis underlying antagonistic modulation of TGF-β signaling by IFN-γ is incompletely understood. In the present report, we characterized the repression of TGF-β-stimulated collagen transcription by IFN-γ in normal skin fibroblasts. The results indicate that the stimulatory effects of TGF-β on Type I collagen gene (COL1A2) transcription were abrogated by IFN-γ through a minimal Smad-binding element of the COL1A2promoter. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in fibroblasts was not mediated through antagonistic Smad7. The stimulatory effect of TGF-β on COL1A2 transcription could be rescued in the presence of IFN-γ by overexpression of p300. These findings indicate that p300/CBP integrate IFN-γ/TGF-β-induced signals that positively or negatively regulate collagen gene transcription in fibroblasts, and suggest that an increase in activated Stat1α in IFN-γ-treated fibroblasts suppressed Smad-mediated transactivation by titrating away the coactivators. The findings provide novel understanding of the physiologically important antagonistic regulation of collagen gene transcription by cytokines. All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Recombinant human IFN-γ was from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and TGF-β from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Primary cell cultures were established from neonatal foreskin by previously described explant techniques (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and studied between passages 4 and 8. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5‥ CO2 atmosphere in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1‥ or 10‥ fetal calf serum, 1‥ vitamins, and 2 mml-glutamine. The U4AJak1-deficient cell line, which does not support IFN-γ-induced gene expression (55Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and U4A/Jak1 were a kind gift of O. Colamonici. Transforming growth factor-β and IFN-γ were added simultaneously, and cultures were harvested following 24–48 h incubation. In previous studies under similar conditions, we found that neither TGF-β nor IFN-γ significantly effected cell number or viability in confluent fibroblast cultures (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the indicated periods of incubation, and relative levels of mRNA were examined by Northern analysis using radiolabeled Smad3, Smad7, andglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes. The cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 films exposed for 24–48 h with intensifying screens. At the end of the indicated period of incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell lysates prepared. Lysates were either directly resolved by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, or first immunoprecipitated for 1 h using anti-p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and subjected to immunoblotting with primary antibodies (human anti-p300, anti-Smad7, and anti-actin (C-2) from Santa Cruz; anti-Smad3 fromZymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA; anti-Type I collagen from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL); anti-Stat1 from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY); and anti-phosphotyrosine Stat1 (Y701) from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed, followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence. The expression and intracellular localization of endogenous SMADs and Stat1α in the presence or absence of IFN-γ or TGF-β was studied by indirect immunofluorescence. For this purpose, fibroblasts were seeded into chamber glass slides and incubated in media with 0.1‥ fetal calf serum and IFN-γ added 30 min before TGF-β. After 2 h incubation, cells were then fixed with methanol, incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 from Santa Cruz; anti-Stat1α from Transduction Labs) for 1 h, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz). After three washes, the slides were stained, and the intracellular distribution of Smads and Stat1 was examined by fluorescence or confocal microscopy. Quantitation was performed in a blinded fashion by scoring 100 fibroblasts in different fields as showing predominantly nuclear or cytoplasmic immunofluorescence. To measure transcriptional responses to IFN-γ or TGF-β, 772COL1A2/CAT consisting of the −772 to +58 bp segment of human COL1A2 promoter linked to theCAT gene (56Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J.

Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ting, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) containing an IFN-γ-responsive 152-bp segment of theHLA-DR promoter ligated to the CAT gene (60Moses H. Panek R.B. Benveniste E.N. Ting JP-Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3642-3651Google Scholar), andGAS-tk-CAT (from G. Sen, Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Institute) containing an IFN-γ-responsive 24-bp segment of the IRF-1 promoter ligated to the CAT gene, were used. Transient transfections were performed by calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation or using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described previously (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by addition of appropriate empty vectors, as required. Following incubation with the indicated cytokines, CAT, and luciferase activities were determined in duplicate and normalized with protein concentration. Fresh media with 0.2‥ fetal calf serum and IFN-γ alone or with TGF-β were added to confluent fibroblasts. At the end of the indicated incubation periods, nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (61Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a consensus Smad-binding element (SBE). The probes were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison WI). Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance, and values of p < 0.05 by Fisher's test were considered significant. To examine the regulation of collagen transcription, normal skin fibroblasts were transiently transfected with COL1A2 promoter-CATreporter constructs. TGF-β caused marked stimulation of CAT activity driven by 772 bp of the COL1A2 promoter. This induction was completely abrogated by IFN-γ, indicating that cis-elements necessary for negative regulation of COL1A2 expression were contained within this region of the promoter (Fig.1 A, left panel). The activity of Δ152DR-CAT was induced by IFN-γ, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ was selective for theCOL1A2 promoter (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). Changes in the intracellular pool of collagen in response to the cytokines paralleled those in promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of collagen synthesis did not require pretreatment with IFN-γ prior to stimulation. IFN-γ induced the rapid nuclear translocation of Stat1, an essential mediator of IFN-γ transcriptional responses (Fig.2). To further examine Stat1 activation, the consensus Stat1α-binding GAS oligonucleotide was used as probe in gel shifts. As expected, IFN-γ treatment of fibroblasts for 15 min resulted in the formation of a GAS-specific DNA-protein complex (Ref. 62Yuan W. Collado-Hidalgo A. Yufit T. Taylor M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar; and data not shown). A careful analysis of the proximal COL1A2 promoter failed to identify the presence of consensus Stat1α-binding GAS elements (TTN5AA). Furthermore, in contrast to classical Stat1-mediated transcriptional responses, the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on COL1A2 promoter activity was delayed (>8 h) (51Yuan W. Yufit T. Li L. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, these observations suggested that Stat1α activation could not be fully responsible for suppression of COL1A2transcription by IFN-γ .Figure 2IFN -γ induces Stat1 activation in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were treated with IFN-γ for 2 h, or left untreated. At the end of the incubation period, cells were processed for immunocytochemistry, and STAT1-specific immunofluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy, as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because we have previously established a fundamental role for Smad3 in TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 transcription in fibroblasts (15Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), the possibility that the Smad signal transduction pathway was a target for the inhibitory activities of IFN-γ was considered. To directly examine the involvement of Smad3, the heterologous minimal construct CAGA-COL1A2/luc, which contains six tandem copies of the COL1A2 Smad-binding CAGAelement shown to be sufficient to mediate TGF-β responses (19Chen S-J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was used. The TGF-β-induced increase in activity of this promoter was suppressed in IFN-γ-treated fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Identical results were obtained with SBE4-luc, containing a consensus SBE (16Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). IFN-γ had no effect on endogenous Smad3 or Smad4 mRNA or protein expression (data not shown). Together, these findings indicated that IFN-γ suppressed TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 transcription mediated by multimerized Smad3-recognition sites, while inducing endogenous Stat1α activation. Inhibition did not result from decreased expression or DNA binding of cellular Smads, suggesting instead that IFN-γ targeted their transcriptional activities.

https://openalex.org/W2038251790,"In most central neurons, action potentials are followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that controls firing pattern and excitability. The medium and slow components of the AHP have been ascribed to the activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channels. Cloned SK channels are heteromeric complexes of SK α-subunits and calmodulin. The channels are activated by Ca2+ binding to calmodulin that induces conformational changes resulting in channel opening, and channel deactivation is the reverse process brought about by dissociation of Ca2+ from calmodulin. Here we show that SK channel gating is effectively modulated by 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (EBIO). Application of EBIO to cloned SK channels shifts the Ca2+ concentration-response relation into the lower nanomolar range and slows channel deactivation by almost 10-fold. In hippocampal CA1 neurons, EBIO increased both the medium and slow AHP, strongly reducing electrical activity. Moreover, EBIO suppressed the hyperexcitability induced by low Mg2+ in cultured cortical neurons. These results underscore the importance of SK channels for shaping the electrical response patterns of central neurons and suggest that modulating SK channel gating is a potent mechanism for controlling excitability in the central nervous system.

Two classes of AHPs and the underlying Ca2+-activated currents may be distinguished based on their time course and pharmacological properties. IAHP underlies part of the medium AHP (mAHP) following single or repetitive APs, is sensitive to the bee venom toxin apamin, and exhibits fast rise and decay (time constants ≈100 ms). sIAHP mediates the slow AHP that follows trains of APs, is apamin-insensitive, has much slower kinetics (range of seconds), and is modulated by several neurotransmitters (1Sah P. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 4: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The mAHP controls the tonic firing frequency of neurons, whereas the slow AHP is responsible for spike frequency adaptation, a prominent reduction in the firing frequency in the late phase of responses to prolonged depolarizing stimuli (1Sah P. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 4: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-activated currents underlying different phases of the AHP have been ascribed to the activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channels (1Sah P.

SK channels are potassium-selective and voltage-independent and are activated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) such as occurs during an AP. Three highly homologous mammalian SK channels (SK1, SK2, and SK3) have been cloned (4Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P.

As for their native counterparts, these channels are gated by [Ca2+]iin the submicromolar range independent of the transmembrane voltage.

Analysis of Ca2+ gating showed that SK and IK channels use calmodulin (CaM) constitutively associated with the C terminus of the SK/IK α-subunit as a high-affinity Ca2+ sensor (13Fanger C.M.

Activation of the channels occurs by Ca2+ binding to at least one of the N-terminal EF hands of CaM in each of the four SK α-subunits, which, by the subsequent conformational changes in CaMs and the SK C termini, leads to channel opening. Channel deactivation is the reverse process and occurs upon dissociation of Ca2+from CaM (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P.

Recently, it was shown that the compound 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (EBIO) activates IK channels in colonic epithelia as well as in transfected cultured cells when applied extracellularly under physiological conditions (10Jensen B.S.

The molecular mechanism behind this shift in Ca2+ sensitivity remained unclear. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the EBIO-mediated activation of cloned SK channels at subthreshold Ca2+ concentrations and tested the effects of EBIO on the excitability and firing pattern of hippocampal neurons and cortical neuronal networks. The results suggest that EBIO affects the interaction between channel α subunits and CaM and that modulating SK channel activity is an effective mechanism for tuning excitability in central neurons. In vitro mRNA synthesis and oocyte injections were performed as described previously (23Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Giant patch recordings were made 3–7 days after injection. Pipettes made from thick-walled borosilicate glass had resistances of ≈0.3 megohms when filled with 120 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid) or with 115 mm NaOH, 5 mmKOH, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm CaCl2(pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid). Inside-out patches were superfused with an intracellular solution containing 119 mmKOH, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid); all chemicals used were of the highest grade; Millipore water was treated with Chelex100 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) before solution preparation. The amount of CaCl2 required to yield the concentrations indicated was calculated as described by Fabiato (24Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and added to the EGTA solution under pH meter control; thereafter, pH was readjusted to 7.2 with KOH. EBIO (Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK) was added to the intracellular solution to yield the final concentrations indicated. Rapid exchange of Ca2+ was achieved using a piezo-driven application system (25Oliver D. Klocker N. Schuck J. Baukrowitz T. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); the time constant of solution exchange with this system was 0.5 ms. Data analysis and fitting were performed with IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) on a Macintosh PowerPC; for the Ca2+ concentration responses in symmetrical and asymmetrical K+, currents recorded at −80 mV and −120 mV were used, respectively. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. of n experiments. Transverse hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) were prepared from Wistar rats (23–28 days old) with a vibratome (VT 1000S Leica) and subsequently incubated in a humidified interface chamber at room temperature for ≥1 h. Tight-seal whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from 28 CA1 pyramidal neurons using the “blind method” (55Blanton M.G. Lo Turco J.J. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1989; 30: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes (4–7 megohms) were filled with an intracellular solution containing 135 mmpotassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Na2-ATP, 0.4 mmNa3-GTP, and 1 mm MgCl2(osmolarity, 280–300 mosmol; pH 7.2–7.3 with KOH). 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8CPT-cAMP; 50 μm) was included to measure the apamin-sensitive IAHP in isolation. All neurons included in this study had a resting membrane potential below −55 mV (−61 ± 1 mV;n = 19) and an input resistance of 215 ± 5 megaohms (n = 19). Recordings were performed in a submerged recording chamber with a constant flow of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (2 ml/min) at room temperature. Drugs were applied in the bath solution. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained 125 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 16 mm d-glucose and was bubbled with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2). EBIO was dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C as a 0.4m stock solution, diluted before use, and bath-applied in the perfusing artificial cerebrospinal fluid. All controls were performed in Me2SO at the same final concentration used during EBIO application (0.25%), and no significant effects of Me2SO were detected. Neurons were voltage-clamped at −50 mV, and 100-ms-long depolarizing pulses to +10 mV were delivered every 30 s. These pulses led to unclamped Ca2+ action currents sufficient to activate IAHP and sIAHP. Series resistance was monitored at regular intervals throughout the recording, and only recordings with stable series resistances ≤25 megohms were included in this study. No series resistance compensation and no corrections for liquid junction potentials were made. Only cells with a stable resting potential throughout the current-clamp protocols (±1 mV) were included in the analysis. Data were acquired using a patch-clamp EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), filtered at 0.25–1 kHz, sampled at 1–4 kHz, and stored on a Macintosh PowerPC. Analysis was performed using the programs Pulse and Pulsefit (HEKA), Igor Pro 3.01 (Wave Metrics), and Excel (Microsoft). Values are presented as mean ± S.E. For statistical analysis, the Student's t test was used, and differences were considered statistically significant ifp ≤ 0.05. Tetraethylammonium, potassium gluconate, Na2-ATP, Na3-GTP, 8CPT-cAMP, and Me2SO were obtained from Sigma; tetrodotoxin was obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel); noradrenaline was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA); apamin was obtained from Latoxan (Rosans, France); samples of EBIO were obtained from Sigma and from Tocris Cookson; and all other salts and chemicals were obtained from Merck. Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described by Wang and Gruenstein (26Wang X. Gruenstein E.I. Brain Res. 1997; 767: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 7–10 days. About 15 min before the experiments, the culture medium was removed, and cells were loaded with 2 μm fluo-4 (Molecular Probes) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4). After loading, cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution + 2 mmCa2+ without Mg2+ and then transferred into a fluorescence plate reader I fluorescence image plate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluo-4 fluorescence from ≈5000 cells (on an area of ≈10) was measured at a sampling rate of 0.5 Hz, drug application (20 μl of a 5-fold concentrated stock in 80 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution + 2 mm Ca2+without Mg2+) was performed within 1 s simultaneously in 96 wells during measurement. Fluorescence oscillations were analyzed by determining (i) the number of peaks above threshold and (ii) the area under curve (AUC) after baseline subtraction during intervals before and after drug application. The effect of EBIO on cloned SK channels was investigated in giant inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing either hSK1 (SK1) or rSK2 (SK2) channels. Fig. 1 illustrates the response of SK2 channels to cytoplasmic application of EBIO at various [Ca2+]i; SK currents were recorded under symmetrical K+ conditions at a membrane potential of −80 mV (intermittently stepped to 50 mV for 50 ms every 1 s). EBIO induced robust activation of SK2 channels at Ca2+concentrations as low as 50 and 100 nm, which, in the absence of the benzimidazolinone, did not elicit any SK currents (Fig.1 A). In the absence of Ca2+, however, EBIO failed to activate SK currents, similar to reports on IK channels (21Pedersen K.A. Schroder R.L. Skaaning-Jensen B. Strobaek D. Olesen S.P. Christophersen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1420: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, EBIO did not increase the amplitude of SK currents when applied at a saturating [Ca2+]i of 10 μm (Fig. 1 A). The results suggest that EBIO shifts the apparent Ca2+sensitivity of SK channels. This was quantified in Ca2+concentration-response relationships determined for SK1 and SK2 currents in the absence and presence of EBIO under symmetrical and physiological K+ conditions. As shown in Fig. 1,B and C, EBIO induced a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve by about 7-fold for either SK subtype, with [Ca2+]i required for half-maximal activation (EC50) of SK1 and SK2 channels of 81.6 ± 31.4 nm (n = 6) and 69.4 ± 3.2 nm (n = 5), respectively. This shift in the Ca2+ concentration-response curve was independent of the extracellular K+ concentration (120 or 5 mm; Fig. 1, B and C). Additionally, the steepness of the concentration-response curves obtained in the presence of EBIO appeared slightly increased with respect to the controls (Hill coefficients were 4.0 ± 1.0 and 5.6 ± 0.5 for SK2 channels in the absence and presence of EBIO; the respective values for SK1 were 4.4 ± 1.0 and 6.6 ± 1.1). The observations that EBIO was ineffective either in the absence of [Ca2+]i or with saturating [Ca2+]i suggested that the compound may operate by interacting with the gating apparatus of SK channels rather than working as a classical channel opener requiring Ca2+ as a “cofactor.” Therefore, the kinetics of channel gating were examined in “fast application” experiments where activation and deactivation kinetics of Ca2+ gating can be monitored separately (15Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar,25Oliver D. Klocker N. Schuck J. Baukrowitz T. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows SK2 currents measured in response to fast application and removal of a saturating [Ca2+]i of 10 μm to inside-out patches in the absence (gray trace) and presence of EBIO. Whereas the time course of channel activation was not affected by EBIO at this [Ca2+]i, the current decay upon removal of Ca2+ was markedly slowed down by the benzimidazolinone (Fig. 2 A, top panel). When fitted with monoexponentials, the respective time constants for activation (τon) and deactivation (τoff) were 4.4 ± 0.5 ms (n = 8) and 294.2 ± 21.9 ms in the presence of EBIO, whereas control values were 4.4 ± 1.1 ms (n= 7) and 39.4 ± 4.1 ms. EBIO prolonged channel deactivation by about 7.5-fold (Fig. 2 B), and the increase of τoff was only observed when EBIO was present after removal of Ca2+; washout of EBIO together with Ca2+ resulted in a current decay identical to that recorded in controls (Fig. 2 A, middle panel; τoff = 40.2 ± 5.8 ms; n = 4). To test whether EBIO may also affect channel activation, fast applications were done with [Ca2+]i of 0.5 μm, a value close to the EC50 for SK channels (Fig. 1, B and C). Under these conditions, application of EBIO changed both τon and τoff; τoff increased by about 6.8-fold, whereas τon decreased by a factor of 1.5 (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel and Fig. 2 B). Thus, the predominant effect of EBIO was on channel deactivation, whereas the activation kinetics were only slightly affected. The EBIO-induced increase of τoff was independent of channel activation (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of EBIO, either 50 or 100 nm Ca2+ activated currents that decayed with essentially the same τoff of about 300 ms (283.2 ± 7.6 and 303.9 ± 13.7 at 50 and 100 nm, respectively). In contrast, channel activation strongly depended on [Ca2+]i; τon exhibited values of 608.3 ± 49.3 and 83.6 ± 7.3 ms (n= 8) for 50 and 100 nm Ca2+, respectively (Fig.2 C). These results suggested that EBIO modulates the interaction between the SK channel α-subunit and Ca2+-bound CaM (Ca2+-CaM). This was further tested in experiments probing the influence of the SK α-subunit and CaM on the EBIO effect. In a first set of experiments, EBIO was tested on SK2 channels coexpressed with either wild-type CaM or mutant CaMs in which Ca2+ binding was largely impaired in both N-terminal EF hands (Mut CaM1, 2 and Mut CaM1–4, (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A.

Fig. 3 A shows that whereas EBIO effectively activated SK channels at [Ca2+]iof 50 nm when coexpressed with wild-type CaM, little or no current induction was observed for SK channel coexpression with Mut CaM1,2 or Mut CaM1–4 (data not shown). The small increase in current is most likely due to the fraction of SK2 channels coassembled with endogenous wild-type Xenopus CaM (15Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar); the amplitude of this current was 0.02 ± 0.01 (n = 7) of that obtained by coexpression with wild-type CaM. The second set of experiments probed the SK C terminus, the domain where CaM interacts with the channel α-subunit, as a candidate site for EBIO action (13Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J.

SK and IK channels share the basic Ca2+ gating mechanism mediated by CaM and exhibit similar Ca2+ concentration-response relations (13Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J.

However, the primary sequences of the C termini, including the CaM binding domains, show considerable variability (4Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P.

Therefore, concentration-response relations for EBIO-induced channel activation in the presence of a constant [Ca2+]i of 100 nm were determined for both channel types. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the concentration-response relationships for IK1 and SK2 differed in their EC50 by more than 20-fold with values of 28.4 and 654.2 μm for IK1 and SK2, respectively. Moreover, when the C terminus of IK1 was exchanged into the SK2 subunit (SK2-IK1C-term), the resulting chimeric channel showed an affinity for EBIO very similar to that obtained for IK1 (EC50 for SK2-IK1C-term was 22.3 μm; Fig. 3 B). Taken together with the effects on kinetics, the results shown are consistent with EBIO modulating the Ca2+ gating of SK channels by stabilizing the interaction between Ca2+-CaM and the SK α-subunit. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, voltage-independent, Ca2+-activated K+ channels are responsible for the generation of two distinct phases of AHP, the mAHP and the slow AHP. According to their distribution and pharmacological properties, SK channels likely underlie at least part of the mAHP in hippocampal neurons (27Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Given the observed effects of EBIO on the Ca2+ gating of cloned SK channels, the compound was tested on the Ca2+-activated K+ currents underlying mAHP (IAHP) and slow AHP (sIAHP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices. In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, currents were elicited by a standard protocol (27Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) and tetraethylammonium (1 mm) to block Na+ channels and Ca2+- and voltage-dependent K+ (BK) channels, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A, EBIO induced a marked increase of the IAHP amplitude with respect to the controls recorded under steady-state conditions before application of the compound. The relative increase of the IAHP was 3.5 ± 0.4 (n = 5) (Fig. 4 D). Moreover, the enhanced IAHP was fully suppressed by apamin applied to the neurons in the presence of the benzimidazolinone (Fig.4 B). EBIO also increased the apamin-insensitive sIAHP. When applied together with 50 nm apamin to block IAHP (27Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), EBIO induced an increase of the remaining sIAHP by a factor of 1.5 ± 0.1 with respect to the control (Fig. 4, C and D; n = 4). The EBIO-enhanced current was fully inhibited by noradrenaline at 1 μm (data not shown), identifying it as the sIAHP (28Nicoll R.A. Science. 1988; 241: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 29Pedarzani P. Storm J.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1023-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The effect of EBIO on the time course of IAHP was examined in isolation by inhibiting sIAHP by including the cAMP analogue 8CPT-cAMP in the patch pipette (27Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 29Pedarzani P. Storm J.F.

Consistent with the effect of EBIO on activation and deactivation kinetics of cloned SK channels (Fig. 2), the time constant of decay of the IAHP(τ decay) was increased by the benzimidazolinone. The values for τ decay were 90.5 ± 7.5 and 214.5 ± 9.8 ms (n = 6) in the absence and presence of EBIO, respectively (Fig. 4, E and F).

We investigated the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which S1P protects endothelial cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. We show here that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) undergo apoptosis associated with increased DEVDase activity, caspase-3 activation, cytochromec release, and DNA fragmentation after 24 h of serum deprivation. These apoptotic markers were suppressed by the addition of S1P, the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (100 μm), or caspase-3 inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. The protective effects of S1P were reversed by the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine, but not by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quanoxaline-1-one, suggesting that NO, but not cGMP, is responsible for S1P protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, S1P increased NO production by enhancing Ca2+-sensitive NOS activity without changes in the eNOS protein level. S1P-mediated cell survival and NO production were suppressed significantly by pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotide of EDG-1 and partially by EDG-3 antisense. S1P-mediated NO production was suppressed by the addition of pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi proteins, the specific inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), U73122, and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. These findings indicate that S1P protects HUVECs from apoptosis through the activation of eNOS activity mainly through an EDG-1 and -3/Gi/PLC/Ca2+ signaling pathway.

The protective effects of S1P were reversed by the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine, but not by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quanoxaline-1-one, suggesting that NO, but not cGMP, is responsible for S1P protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, S1P increased NO production by enhancing Ca2+-sensitive NOS activity without changes in the eNOS protein level. S1P-mediated cell survival and NO production were suppressed significantly by pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotide of EDG-1 and partially by EDG-3 antisense. S1P-mediated NO production was suppressed by the addition of pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi proteins, the specific inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), U73122, and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. These findings indicate that S1P protects HUVECs from apoptosis through the activation of eNOS activity mainly through an EDG-1 and -3/Gi/PLC/Ca2+ signaling pathway. sphingosine 1-phosphate tumor necrosis factor human umbilical vein endothelial cells N-monomethyl-l-arginine nitric oxide nitric-oxide synthase endothelial NOS 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quinoxaline-1-one poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase phospholipase c S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl keton dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nitrite plus nitrate 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester lipopolysaccharide Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P),1 generated from sphingosine by sphingosine kinase, is a recently described lipid mediator regulating cellular responses, including cell proliferation (1Hisano N.

All these effects of S1P on endothelial functions are thought to correlate with the intracellular signaling pathway linked to the EDG-1 (endothelialdifferentiation gene-1), EDG-3, and EDG-5 subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (1Hisano N.

Consistent with this view, we have recently observed that intracellular Ca2+ mobilization evoked by the Gi-PLC system is responsible for the signaling pathway of mitogen-activated protein kinases, focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), and chemotaxis in response to S1P in HUVECs (6Lee O.H.

It is likely that intracellular signaling events of S1P in endothelial cells may be directly associated with increase in [Ca2+]i.Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from l-arginine by catalytic reaction of three isotypes of NO synthases (NOS), the neuronal or type I isoform (nNOS), the inducible or type II isoform (iNOS), and the endothelial or type III isoform (eNOS) (7Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar, 8Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Endothelium-derived NO is formed by eNOS, which is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells and localized in plasmalemmal caveolae through association with the caveolae integral membrane structural protein caveolin-1 (9Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Binding of eNOS with caveolin-1 inhibits the eNOS catalytic activity, and the inhibitory effect of caveolin-1 on the eNOS activity can be reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin (10Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by diverse extracellular signals (stimuli), including shear stress (11James N.L. Harrison D.G. Nerem R.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), bradykinin (12Prabhakar P. Thatte H.S. Goetz R.M. Cho M.R. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), resulting in increased NO production.Numerous previous studies have demonstrated the role of eNOS in controlling blood pressure, vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (14Huang P.L.

In particular, NO is implicated as a cytoprotective effector molecule, protecting some cell types from apoptotic cell death induced by TNFα, anti-Fas antibody, LPS, and trophic factor withdrawal. These apogenic stimuli activate a series of tightly controlled intracellular signaling events that induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release into cytosol and the activation of cysteine proteases known as caspases (18Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Inappropriate endothelial cell apoptosis may be linked to several cardiovascular diseases. For example, eNOS-deficient mice exhibit delayed angiogenesis thought to be due to decreases in endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, compared with wild type controls (19Lee P.C. Salyapongse A.N. Bragdon G.A. Shears 2nd, L.L. Watkins S.C. Edington H.D. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1600-H1608PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that transduction with NOS gene into aortic allografts suppresses the development of allograft arteriosclerosis (20Shears L.L. Kawaharada N. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.C. Kovesdi I. Lizonova A. Pham S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2035-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), possibly in part via suppression of endothelial apoptosis (21Ceneviva G.D. Tzeng E. Hoyt D.G. Yee E. Gallagher A. Engelhardt J.F. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.A. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L717-L728PubMed Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic effects of NO are associated with direct inhibition of caspase activity by S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzymes, as well as through cGMP-dependent mechanism (22Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Therefore, eNOS-activating agents are capable of protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis. We hypothesized that S1P would protect endothelial cells by Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS. Here we show that S1P increases NO production in HUVECs by elevating [Ca2+]i through the EDG-1 and -3/Gi-PLC pathway. This increased NO production prevents serum-deprived apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochromec and release caspase-3 activation/activity.DISCUSSIONThis study was undertaken to determine the molecular mechanism by which S1P protects endothelial cells from apoptosis. We provide evidence that S1P protects HUVECs from serum-deprived apoptosis by increasing NO production. S1P increases NO production by Ca2+-sensitive eNOS activation without changing eNOS protein expression. NO production is associated with the inhibitory effect of S1P on apoptotic cell death, DEVDase activity, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Increases in cell survival and NO production by S1P were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotides of EDG-1, and to a lesser extent, by EDG-3 antisense, indicating that the cellular effects of S1P involve the activation of EDG-1 and -3. The antiapoptotic effects of S1P could not be inhibited by ODQ, indicating that the protective effect does not involve cGMP production. This study also provides evidence that the increase in NO production by S1P occurred through the involvement of EDG-1 and -3, Gi protein, PLC, and Ca2+. Thus, S1P increases eNOS activity via intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and the resulting increases in NO protect endothelial cells from apoptosis by suppression of apoptotic signaling cascade.Apoptotic cell death by cytotoxic stimuli and serum or growth factor withdrawal is induced by tightly controlled intracellular signaling events, which require serial activation of caspase family proteases and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Caspase-deficient animals or cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody (32Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and DNA-damaging agents (33Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Treatment with caspase inhibitors reduces fulminant liver injury and animal mortality induced by administration of anti-Fas antibody (34Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) or LPS (35Mignon A. Rouquet N. Fabre M. Martin S. Pages J.C. Dhainaut J.F. Kahn A. Briand P. Joulin V. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that inhibition of caspase activation/activity is a potential approach for the prevention of apoptosis. Our data show that serum deprivation induced HUVEC apoptosis, as indicated by increased DNA fragmentation, DEVDase activity, caspase-3 activation, and cytochromec release. Treatment with S1P and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk protected cells from serum-deprived apoptosis by suppressing these effects. These results raise the possibility that S1P is an endogenous protectant against endothelial cell apoptosis through a mechanism of suppressed cytochrome c release and caspase-mediated signaling.In this study, our major question was how S1P prevents serum-deprived apoptotic cell death in HUVECs. We (21Ceneviva G.D. Tzeng E. Hoyt D.G. Yee E. Gallagher A. Engelhardt J.F. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.A. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L717-L728PubMed Google Scholar) and others (17Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) have previously shown that NO protects endothelial cells from LPS- and TNFα-induced apoptosis. These studies directed our attention toward NO as a potential mediator of the S1P effect. Importantly, the present study revealed that S1P increased NO production from HUVECs by enhancing Ca2+-sensitive eNOS activity without significant increase in the eNOS protein. eNOS is normally located at the cell membrane within caveolae in an inactive state (36Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular Ca2+ promote calmodulin binding to the enzyme, leading to transient eNOS activation and NO production. Other interaction and modification can alter eNOS activity, including binding to caveolin-1, which inhibits eNOS activity (37Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation (38Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F.

Our studies suggest that the dominant action of S1P is to increase Ca2+levels; however influence on these other regulatory processes cannot be excluded.NO has been shown to regulate either induction of apoptosis in some cells (40Heneka M.T.

High levels of NO have been shown to be a cytotoxic through the inhibition of ATP synthetic enzymes, including mitochondrial aconitase and electron transfer complexes I and II (41Granger D.L.

In our studies, S1P did not increase many of proteins listed above, as measured by Western blot analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect of S1P is unlikely linked to the expression of these cytoprotective genes. We also excluded cGMP as a mediator of the S1P-NO protective pathway using the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ. Another mechanism involves the directed inhibition of caspases by NO viaS-nitrosylation of either the inactive (55Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) or active forms of the protease (17Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). NO suppresses the proteolytic activation and activity of multiple caspases in intact cells, including caspase-3 and caspase-8. This can prevent the downstream amplification of the signal by suppressing mitochondrial cytochrome c release or activation of other downstream caspases. Our data show that S1P suppressed mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation/activity and that this suppression was reversed by NMA. Also, the inhibition of DEVDase activity was partially reversed by preincubating the cytosol with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting that NO produced by S1P inhibited in part DEVDase activity by redox-sensitive S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine residue. This is consistent with the observation thatS-nitrosylation of caspase-3 by NO inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells (17Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It is likely thatS-nitrosylated caspases cannot proteolytically activate other caspases or induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release. NO can also activate other survival signals, including Akt/PKB (56Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol.

Others have shown that Akt activation can also protect endothelial cells through increasing eNOS activity (38Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar).We also addressed the question of how S1P increases NO production in HUVECs. Endothelial cells produce measurable levels of NO from eNOS at basal levels of [Ca2+]i (50–140 nmol/liter). Activity of eNOS can be enhanced by receptor-dependent stimuli such as bradykinin (12Prabhakar P. Thatte H.S. Goetz R.M. Cho M.R. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 171: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In these cases, an acute increase in [Ca2+]i has been observed before the elevation in NO production. Recent studies have shown that S1P induces a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells, CHO, and HL-60, mainly via the Gi-coupled receptors (4Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N.

HUVECs express EDG-1 and -3, which transduce signals to increase [Ca2+]i in response to <10 nm of S1P (4Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T.

Our results show that S1P increased cell survival and NO production in serum-deprived HUVECs at the concentration of μm levels. We (2Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W.

Antisense oligonucleotides of EDG-1 suppressed much of the S1P-mediated cell survival and NO production, whereas EDG-3 antisense oligonucleotide partially inhibited the effects of S1P (Fig. 3). Furthermore, HUVECs were cotreated with S1P and the sphingosine kinase inhibitor dihydrosphingosine, and then the S1P-mediated cell survival and NO production were measured. Dihydrosphingosine did not inhibit the effects of S1P (data not shown), suggesting that exogenous S1P does not act through intracellular generation of S1P by activation of sphingosine kinase. Recently, it has been shown that S1P treatment targets its receptor EDG-1 to plasmalemmal caveolae and facilitates the activation of eNOS in COS cells cotransfected with EDG-1 and eNOS (67Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of EDG-1 in NO production. Therefore, S1P-induced NO production is most likely to be occurred by the S1P receptors EDG-1 and-3 in HUVECs. Binding of eNOS with caveolin-1 inhibits the eNOS catalytic activity, and the inhibitory effect of caveolin-1 on the eNOS activity can be reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin (10Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K.

https://openalex.org/W2102891026,"Class E vacuolar protein sorting (vps) proteins are required for appropriate sorting of receptors within the yeast endocytic pathway, and most probably function in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies. We have identified the mammalian orthologue of Vps28p as a 221- amino acid cytosolic protein that interacts with TSG101/mammalian VPS23 to form part of a multiprotein complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments demonstrated that hVPS28 and TSG101 interact directly and that binding requires structural information within the conserved C-terminal portion of TSG101. TSG101 and hVPS28 are predominantly cytosolic. However, when endosomal vacuolization was induced by the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of another class E vps protein, human VPS4, a portion of both TSG101 and hVPS28 translocated to the surface of these vacuoles. We conclude that TSG101 and its interacting components are directly involved in endosomal sorting.

We conclude that TSG101 and its interacting components are directly involved in endosomal sorting. Cell surface receptors are internalized in endocytic vesicles and enter the early endosome, where they are sorted. Many receptors return to the cell surface to engage in further rounds of ligand uptake, whereas other receptors are targeted via the multivesicular body (MVB)1/late endosome for degradation in the lysosome (1Mellman I. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 1996; 12: 575-625Google Scholar). The molecular basis for selection of these receptors and their transfer to the MVB remains poorly characterized. Studies in yeast have, however, identified a number of gene products that are required for post-endosomal sorting. vps (vacuolar proteinsorting) mutants are defective in delivering newly synthesized hydrolases to the vacuole (the yeast lysosome) (2Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 1998; 62: 230-247Google Scholar). Among these, class E vps mutants are characterized by the formation of an exaggerated endocytic compartment (3Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Google Scholar). At least 15 class E vps mutants have been identified in yeast. It has been proposed that they act at a common step in endosomal sorting, and this has been borne out by several studies demonstrating physical and/or genetic interactions between them. The class E compartment contains endocytosed markers, as well as precursors of vacuolar hydrolases and markers normally associated with the trans Golgi (4Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 603-617Google Scholar, 5Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 1820-1831Google Scholar, 6Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Köhrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol.

Biol... 1996; 16: 2700-2707Google Scholar). Because proteins are retained in the yeast trans Golgi by a mechanism that involves their transport to and retrieval from the endocytic pathway (8Nothwehr S.F. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1996; 16: 2700-2707Google Scholar), class E proteins appear to be important for sorting material bound for the vacuole away from proteins that cycle through the endocytic system. Indeed, recent data are consistent with class E proteins participating in the formation of MVB (9Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell.. 1998; 95: 847-858Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the function of class E proteins on the mammalian endocytic pathway, we have generated specific reagents for a number of close structural mammalian homologues of yeast class E vps proteins. We (10Bishop N. Woodman P.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2000; 11: 227-239Google Scholar), and others (11Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2000; 11: 747-763Google Scholar), have shown that mammalian orthologues of the AAA (ATPases Associated with cellular Activities)-type ATPase, Vps4p, are required to maintain the morphological and functional organization of the endocytic pathway. Like yeast Vps4p (12Babst M. Wendland B. Estapa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 2982-2993Google Scholar), mammalian (m)VPS4 (and the closely related SKD1 (13Périer F. Coulter K.L. Liang H. Radeke C.M. Gaber R.F. Vandenberg C.A. FEBS Lett... 1994; 351: 286-290Google Scholar)) couples its ATPase activity to a cycle of binding to and release from endosomal membranes (10Bishop N. Woodman P.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2000; 11: 227-239Google Scholar, 11Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2000; 11: 747-763Google Scholar). Although the immediate substrates for mVPS4 have yet to be identified, our data are consistent with mVPS4 acting to release other soluble class E components from endosome-associated multiprotein complex(es) and thus recycle them for further rounds of sorting. In this study we have examined the interactions of TSG101, previously identified as the mammalian orthologue of Vps23p/Stp22p (14Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 3588-3599Google Scholar, 15Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic.. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar), another class E vps protein. TSG101, like Vps23p/Stp22p, positively regulates the lysosomal degradation of cell surface proteins, including mitogenic receptors (14Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 3588-3599Google Scholar, 15Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic.. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar). Tsg101 was identified originally as a tumor susceptibility gene by an assay for cellular transformation upon random gene disruption (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell.. 1996; 85: 319-329Google Scholar), although its importance as a tumor suppressor gene is still debated. A number of studies have reported the presence of aberrant splice variants ofTSG101 in specific human tumors (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell.. 1996; 85: 319-329Google Scholar, 17Ferrer M. López-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 2253-2259Google Scholar), although the significance of these findings has been disputed (18Steiner P. Barnes D.M. Harris W.H. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet... 1997; 16: 332-333Google Scholar, 19Hampl M. Hempl J. Plaschke J. Fitze G. Scheckert G. Saeger H.D. Schackert H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1998; 248: 753-760Google Scholar). Although the sorting defect associated with TSG101-deficient cells could underlie the susceptibility of these cells to transformation, limited evidence is available to explain how TSG101 acts to regulate mitogenic receptor down-regulation. The TSG101 peptide sequence was first interpreted to contain two DNA-binding motifs, perhaps indicative of a transcription factor (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell.. 1996; 85: 319-329Google Scholar). However, the existence of the DNA-binding motifs has not been substantiated in subsequent analyses (20Ponting C.P. Cai Y.-D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med... 1997; 75: 467-469Google Scholar, 21Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet... 1997; 16: 330-331Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this, recent reports have linked TSG101 to transcriptional regulation and have provided evidence that TSG101 can act in vitro as a transcriptional suppressor (22Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1998; 245: 900-905Google Scholar, 23Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 5380-5388Google Scholar). Therefore, TSG101 could act indirectly to aid receptor degradation by modulating the expression of specific protein(s), themselves involved in endosomal trafficking. Alternatively, TSG101 might interact with a number of other class E vps proteins to form a sorting complex on the surface of the sorting endosome. Here, it might function to recognize cargo destined for inclusion in the multivesicular body, or provide a structural component for the sorting event. As part of our studies we have identified a mammalian orthologue of a further class E vps protein, Vps28p. We now demonstrate that human VPS28 (hVPS28) interacts directly with TSG101. Moreover, both TSG101 and hVPS28 can be recruited to early endosome membranes by co-expression of a dominant-negative mutant of VPS4, consistent with a direct role for the TSG101 complex in receptor sorting. Escherichia colistrain XL1Blue (Stratagene) was used for maintenance, sequencing, and mutation of plasmids. Luria-Bertani medium was used for growth ofE. coli cells. For selection of plasmids, 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 25 μg/ml kanamycin was added to the media. Proteins tagged withmyc/His6 were detected using mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Sigma) or anti-polyhistidine (Sigma). Anti-TSG101 was from AbCam, Cambridge, UK. An anti-hVPS28 antibody was raised in sheep, with His6-tagged recombinant hVPS28 used as antigen. Immunizations were performed by Diagnostics Scotland (Carluke, Lanarkshire). Antibody was affinity-purified using glutathioneS-transferase-tagged hVPS28. Standard protocols for recombinant DNA manipulation were used (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ABI PRISM big dye terminator system was used for DNA sequencing, and mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange (Stratagene) method according to the manufacturer's instructions, or by cassette mutagenesis (see below). Mutagenesis and subcloning constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A human cDNA EST clone from a Soares senescent fibroblast (NbHSF) library (Clone ID 1331807) was obtained from the IMAGE consortium (25Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics.. 1996; 33: 151-152Google Scholar) in vector pT7T3D, with a modified polylinker. The EST sequence had amino acid similarity to the 5′-end of yeast VPS28. The DNA insert was subcloned into pBluescript SKII(−) for sequencing, and it was found that the cDNA encoded a human homologue of yeastVPS28, denoted hVPS28 (human VPS28; GenBank™ accession number AF316887). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the BCM search launcher and the ClustalW 1.8 program (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar, 27Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol... 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar), and graphics were performed using the BOXSHADE server. The cDNA insert for hVPS28 was subcloned into two mammalian expression vectors pEGFPC (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3.1myc/His (Invitrogen). These vectors were designed to express hVPS28 with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag at the N terminus of the protein (hVPS28-pEGFP) or amyc/His6 tag at the C terminus (hVPS28-pcDNA3.1-myc/His). Subsequently, themyc or His6 epitopes were deleted from construct hVPS28-pcDNA3.1-myc/His, and, therefore, these vectors were expressed hVPS28 with a His6 or myc tag alone (hVPS28-pcDNA3.1-His and hVPS28-pcDNA3.1-myc). For prokaryotic expression, hVPS28 was subcloned into pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pTrcHis (Invitrogen) vectors by standard methods. Plasmid pBluescript SKII(−) containing a full-length mouse TSG101 (mTSG101) cDNA was obtained from Dr. C. Miller (Stanford University). The mTSG101 gene was subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1myc/His, with the stop codon still present before the myc/His6 tag, and was named mTSG101-pcDNA3.1. The stop codon was then deleted to allow expression of mTSG101 with an in-frame myc/His6tag at the C-terminal end. An HA epitope tag was introduced at the N terminus of mTSG101-pcDNA3.1, creating vector HA-mTSG101-pcDNA3.1, designed to express mTSG101 with an N-terminal HA epitope tag. TSG101 domain deletions were performed by introducing restriction enzyme sites as indicated in Fig. 4 A. The DNA was cut using pair-wise combinations of restriction enzymes, and then religated. Secondary structure prediction was determined using a variety of secondary structure prediction methods via the Network Protein Sequence Analysis server. These included DPM (28Deleage G. Roux B.

A human multiple tissue cDNA panel (CLONTECH) was probed using hVPS28-specific primers according to the manufacturer's instructions, using good PCR practices, and utilizing touchdown PCR to increase the specificity of the reaction. The levels of PCR products were also analyzed before the reactions reached their plateau (i.e.before saturation), as determined by taking samples of each PCR product after varying cycle times. This ensured that the relative abundance of target in each tissue could be directly compared. The primers used to amplify the hVPS28 gene were located: (i) just after the initiation codon, and (ii) in the 3′-untranslated region. A primer in the 3′-untranslated region was used to reduce any possible risk of amplifying a related member of the same gene family. The sequences of the primers were (i) cat ggg atc cca gcc acg ccg ggc ata gg and (ii) gtg gat gac cac ggc ctg tgt ggc gg. The multiple tissue panel used had been normalized using the mRNA expression levels of several housekeeping genes, allowing use of the panel to estimate the relative abundance of hVPS28 expression. The PCR products were analyzed before the reaction reached its plateau, by monitoring PCR products at five time points during thermal cycling. PCR products were run in parallel with DNA size markers (MBI Fermentas). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For fluorescence studies, cells were transfected when ∼30% confluent using the lipid-based FuGene method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Controls of expression vectors without insert and FuGene alone were used. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed 18–24 h post-transfection using methanol at −20 °C and mounted using ProLong mount (Molecular Probes). Cells were examined using a Leica confocal microscope. For large scale transfections, COS cells were passaged in medium containing HyClone fetal calf serum and transfected using the ProFection CaPO4-based reagent (Promega). COS-1 cells were washed in homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 250 mm sucrose) and harvested by scraping. The suspended cells were lysed by passaging 20 times through a fine micropipette tip, and postnuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g. Where appropriate, protein concentrations of parallel samples were equalized by dilution. For gel filtration experiments, cytosols were prepared by centrifuging cell extracts at 400,000 × g for 15 min in a TL100 bench-top ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Samples were applied to a 2.4-ml Superose 12 column equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm MgCl2, and fractionated on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Smart system. Proteins were precipitated using chloroform/methanol (40Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem... 1984; 138: 141-143Google Scholar) and processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In vitrotranslations were performed using standard procedures and reticulocyte lysates from Promega. Each translation typically contained 1 μg of DNA and 60 μCi of [35S]methionine. Translations were terminated by addition of 1 mm cycloheximide. The specificity of translation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. For generation of TDBA-lysyl [35S]protein, TDBA-modified lysyl tRNA was prepared as described previously (41Görlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol... 1991; 34: 241-262Google Scholar) and used to supplement in vitrotranslation reactions at the level of 40 pmol per 25 μl of translation mix (42Swanton E. Sheehan J. Bishop N. High S. Woodman P. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1998; 9: 1633-1647Google Scholar). For native immunoprecipitations, 5–20 μl translation mix was diluted to 200 μl in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100) containing 1 μl of ascites and incubated on ice for 3–4 h. 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added, and the incubation continued overnight with constant mixing, prior to washing. For cross-linking experiments, samples containing TDBA-lysyl translation products were diluted at least 5-fold and irradiated for 5 s using a UV lamp (SpotCure, Ultra Violet Products Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Native immunoprecipitations were performed as normal. For secondary denaturing immunoprecipitations, protein G-agarose beads containing bound antigen were incubated with 30 μl of denaturing buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS) for 5 min at 95 °C. After addition of 170 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer, samples were mixed on ice and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were incubated with a second antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were added, and samples were treated as for native immunoprecipitations. The nucleotide sequence of the EST clone with EMBLEST accession number W47604 was determined. Sequence comparisons at the amino acid level with those on the data bases indicated that the cDNA encoded a human homologue of yeast Vps28p (GenBank™ accession number U50630), and was designated hVPS28 (Fig.1 A). Comparison with other proteins on the data base indicated that homologues of Vps28p are also found in Drosophila melanogaster (SPTREMBL: Q9V359),Caenorhabditis elegans (SPTREMBL: Q9NA26), Arabidopsis thaliana (SPTREMBL: Q9S9T7), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SPTREMBL: O13872) (Fig. 1 B). Overall comparison of the VPS28 protein of the six species revealed an overall 34% sequence similarity. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps28p (6Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Köhrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1996; 7: 985-999Google Scholar) shows 28% amino acid sequence identity with hVPS28 with a further 38% similarity, giving an overall sequence similarity of 66%. Human VPS28 is most closely related to that of D. melanogaster. The major difference in protein sequence between S. cerevisiaeVPS28 protein and that of other species is an insertion of around 20–35 amino acids in the middle of the protein. These proteins are hydrophilic with no hydrophobic regions predicted to span a lipid bilayer. No significant similarities to known protein sequence motifs were revealed by searching the Prosite pattern, Blocks, ProDom, or Prints data bases. A multiple tissue cDNA panel was screened using PCR primers to the hVPS28 5′coding region and 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1 C). The hVPS28 mRNA is ubiquitous, because a PCR product of around 750 bp was detected in all human tissues examined (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, placenta, and skeletal muscle). No size variants were detected even when saturation of the PCR reactions occurred (data not shown), indicating splice variants of hVPS28 are not expressed. To determine the cellular localization of mammalian VPS28, a mammalian expression vector containing hVPS28 fused to amyc/His6 tag at the C terminus was used. As shown in Fig. 1 D, hVPS28 expressed in NRK cells was exclusively cytosolic. An affinity-purified antibody that specifically recognized hVPS28 by Western blot (Fig. 1 F) also recognized the expressed hVPS28 (Fig. 1 E). Staining untransfected cells with anti-VPS28 antibody revealed that endogenous VPS28 was likewise distributed throughout the cytoplasm, though the staining was typically more granular than for expressed hVPS28 (Fig. 1 G). At present, we do not know why the pattern of endogenous VPS28 staining differs from that of expressed VPS28. Fractionation experiments (data not shown) indicate that endogenous VPS28 is largely soluble. However, it is possible that much of this pool is lost during methanol fixation for immunofluorescence staining. The particulate VPS28 staining did not co-localize with markers for early endosomes, late endosomes, or lysosomes (data not shown). Evidence from yeast suggests that many class E vps proteins interact with each other to form multiprotein complexes. To examine whether hVPS28 binds to other mammalian class E vps proteins, 35S-labeled hVPS28 was in vitro-translated and combined with other class E proteins. Among those tested for its ability to bind hVPS28 was TSG101 (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell.. 1996; 85: 319-329Google Scholar), the mammalian orthologue of Vps23p/Stp22p (14Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 3588-3599Google Scholar, 15Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic.. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, His6-tagged hVPS28 could not be precipitated with anti-myc antibody when incubated alone (lane 6). However, prior incubation of hVPS28-His6 with TSG101-myc/His6 allowed efficient immunoprecipitation of hVPS28-His6 by anti-myc(lane 7), providing evidence for an interaction between the proteins. Likewise, incubation of hVPS28-His6 with TSG101 tagged at the N terminus with an HA-tag allowed efficient immunoprecipitation of hVPS28-His6 by anti-HA (data not shown). To demonstrate that this interaction was direct and was not mediated by additional components within the reticulocyte lysate, a cross-linking approach was employed. Here, 35S-labeled TSG101-His6 was incubated alone, or with unlabeledmyc-tagged hVPS28 or TSG101 that had been in vitro translated in the presence of 4-(trifluoromethyldiazirino)benzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinic acid (TDBA)-modified lysyl tRNA and that therefore contained a monovalent UV-activated cross-linking moiety (41Görlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol... 1991; 34: 241-262Google Scholar, 43Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1986; 83: 8604-8608Google Scholar, 44Brunner J. Trends Cell Biol... 1996; 6: 154-157Google Scholar). Samples were treated with or without UV irradiation and immunoprecipitated under native conditions with anti-His antibody. No high molecular weight cross-linking adducts were observed upon UV irradiating35S-labeled TSG101-His6 alone or35S-labeled TSG101-His6 combined with TDBA-TSG101-myc (Fig. 2 B, top panel,lanes 2 and 4). However, when35S-labeled TSG101-His6 was combined with TDBA-hVPS28-myc, two high molecular weight radiolabeled adducts were detected upon UV irradiation (Fig. 2 B,top panel, lane 6, asterisks). No adducts were obtained without UV irradiation (Fig. 2 B,top panel, lane 5). Furthermore, the adducts were confirmed to contain hVPS28-myc by immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody under denaturing conditions (Fig.2 B, top panel, lane 12,asterisks). The same high molecular weight adducts were observed when35S-labeled hVPS28-His6 was combined with unlabeled TDBA-TSG101-myc (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lane 6, asterisks) but not when35S-labeled hVPS28-His6 was incubated alone or with TDBA-myc-hVPS28 (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lanes 2 and 4). Together, these results confirm that TSG101 and hVPS28 bind directly to each other but suggest that TSG101 and hVPS28 homodimers are not formed. Likewise, no evidence for homodimerization of TSG101 or hVPS28 was obtained when35S-labeled His6- and myc-tagged proteins were co-translated and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody (data not shown). The apparent molecular masses of ∼80 and 110 kDa for the TSG101·hVPS28 adducts are consistent with formation of both TSG1011-hVPS281 and TSG1011-hVPS282 species. However, cross-linking products may run aberrantly on SDS-PAGE, so that other interpretations of these data are possible. To provide further evidence that cytosolic TSG101/mVPS23 and hVPS28 interact, a high speed supernatant from COS cells was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed by Western blotting. TSG101 migrated as a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 350–400 kDa, consistent with previous findings (15Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic.. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar), and the migration of hVPS28 was precisely coincident with TSG101 (Fig.3 A). Moreover, overexpression of hVPS28-myc affected the stability of the TSG101 complex (Fig. 3 B). Although all of the detectable hVPS28-myc migrated to a position consistent with a monomer, the presence of hVPS28-myc resulted in a spread of TSG101 molecular mass between ∼100 and 400 kDa (Fig. 3 B). It remains unclear whether TSG101 complexes are destabilized within the cell by excess hVPS28-myc, or whether the reduced stability is only apparent after dilution of the complex during chromatography. Finally, TSG101 was substantially depleted from cell extracts incubated with immobilized anti-hVPS28 antibody (Fig. 3 C), confirming that most, if not all, cellular TSG101 is complexed to hVPS28. It is likely that the 350- to 400-kDa complex contains additional components involved in endosomal sorting, because we have found no evidence that either TSG101 or hVPS28 can homodimerize. The mammaliantsg101 gene product was originally described as having a coiled coil domain encompassing a leucine zipper of four helical turns and a proline-rich region (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell.. 1996; 85: 319-329Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis noted the presence of an N-terminal region with significant homology to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (20Ponting C.P. Cai Y.-D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med... 1997; 75: 467-469Google Scholar, 21Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet... 1997; 16: 330-331Google Scholar). The coiled coil domain interacts with nuclear proteins (22Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1998; 245: 900-905Google Scholar, 23Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J.

Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 3100-3103Google Scholar). Recently, the yeast geneSTP22 was found to be orthologous to human and mousetsg101 (15Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic.. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar), demonstrating that tsg101 is highly conserved. Our analyses of the protein sequence of mammalian TSG101 have identified further features of this protein. In addition to orthologues in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and S. cerevisiae, we have found potential orthologues in C. elegans, Saccharomyces carlbergensis pastorianus,S. pombe, Chelonia mydas caranigra (Green sea turtle) and A. thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) (Fig. 4 A), although the start codon of the S. pombe gene has not been conclusively identified. The similarities between each of these proteins was calculated using the ClustalW program (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar), and phylogenetic analysis was performed to create an unrooted tree (Fig. 4 B). The tree indicates that human and mouse TSG101 are most closely related to each other (95% identical; 99% similar) and then are most similar to C. mydas caranigra TSG101 (89% identical; 97% similar). A protein closely related to TSG101 is also found in D. melanogaster (Accession number Q9VVA7). This protein lacks the first part of the ubiquitin-conjugating ( UbC) domain (see Fig. 4C). The portion of the UbC domain missing is predicted to delete a motif conserved in inactive E2 UbC proteins, and the first N-terminal loop of the active UbCs (21Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet... 1997; 16: 330-331Google Scholar). After the truncated UbC region, this protein retains the same overall domain structure to TSG101 with a proline-rich region, a leucine zipper, and a C-terminal helical domain. The functional relationship of this protein to TSG101 is unknown. The C-terminal portion of TSG101 has the potential to form an amphipathic alpha helical domain (see Fig. 4 D),"

Partial oxidant deactivation may confound interpretation of the effects of HCO3−/CO2 on the oxidation of targets that react with peroxynitrite by both one- and two-electron mechanisms. Thiols are example of such targets, and previous studies have reported that HCO3−/ CO2 partially inhibits GSH oxidation by peroxynitrite at pH 7.4. To differentiate the effects of HCO3−/CO2 on two- and one-electron thiol oxidation, we monitored GSH, cysteine, and albumin oxidation by peroxynitrite at pH 5.4 and 7.4 by thiol disappearance, oxygen consumption, fast flow EPR, and EPR spin trapping. Our results demonstrate that HCO3−/CO2 diverts thiol oxidation by peroxynitrite from two- to one-electron mechanisms particularly at neutral pH. At acid pH values, thiol oxidation to free radicals predominates even in the absence of HCO3−/CO2. In addition to the previously characterized thiyl radicals (RS⋅), we also characterized radicals derived from them such as the corresponding sulfinyl (RSO⋅) and disulfide anion radical (RSSR⋅−) of both GSH and cysteine.

In general terms, peroxynitrite-mediated oxidations are either bimolecular, first order on peroxynitrite and biomolecule concentration, or unimolecular, first order on peroxynitrite and independent of biomolecule concentration. Bimolecular processes can result in product yield either around stoichiometry and over, as is the case for thiol oxidation (17Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Presently, most investigators accept that product yields around 30% are characteristic of peroxynitrite-mediated free radical processes. Indeed, it has been established that ONOO− protonation (pKa = 6.6) leads to its fast decomposition (k = 0.17 s−1 at pH 7.4) to yield approximately 70% nitrate and 30% hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2) (Fig. 1, path 1) (7Gatti R.M.

In the presence of HCO3−, ONOO− decomposes much faster because of its reaction with CO2 (k = 2.6 × 104m−1s−1 at pH 7.4, 25 °C) (18Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem.

The fast rate constant of this reaction and the ubiquity of the HCO⨪3/CO2 pair in biological environments indicate that CO⨪3 and ⋅NO2 are likely to play relevant roles in peroxynitrite-mediated oxidations in vivo. Recent detailed studies have established the role of CO⨪3in the potentiating effects of HCO3−/CO2 on peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration (20Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K.

This process has a zero order dependence on the target, being exclusively dependent on free radicals produced from peroxynitrite decay (20Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochem. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The higher fluxes of free radicals produced in the presence of HCO3−/CO2 and the more specific reactivity of the CO⨪3 compared with the⋅OH radical toward tyrosine result in higher yields of the tyrosyl radical and its recombination products with⋅NO2 (nitrotyrosine) and itself (dityrosine) (21Santos C.X.C.

The effects of HCO3−/CO2 on the oxidation of targets that compete with CO2 for the oxidant by reacting with peroxynitrite through second order processes have yet to be elucidated. Among these targets, thiols are particularly relevant because they are present in high concentrations in biological environments and react relatively fast with peroxynitrite (k = 6.6 × 102m−1s−1 for GSH at pH 7.4, 25 °C) (Fig. 1, path 3) (17Radi R.

Additionally, GSH is an important antioxidant, and thiol groups play a major role in maintaining the native conformation of proteins and in regulating enzyme activity. Previous studies have shown that HCO3−/CO2partially inhibited GSH and albumin thiol oxidation at pH 7.4, as monitored by thiol disappearance (19Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

However, this parameter does not differentiate between two- and one-electron mechanisms, and thiyl radicals (RS⋅) have been shown to be produced during the oxidation of thiols by peroxynitrite (6Augusto O.

In this context, it can be hypothesized that HCO3−/CO2 is likely to inhibit thiol oxidation by two-electron mechanisms while stimulating their oxidation to free radicals (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of HCO3−/CO2 on thiol disappearance and free radical production during the oxidation of GSH, cysteine, and albumin by peroxynitrite. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Fisher and were analytical grade or better. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from 0.6 m sodium nitrite and 0.65m hydrogen peroxide in a quenched flow reactor; excess hydrogen peroxide was used to minimize nitrite contamination. To eliminate excess hydrogen peroxide, the peroxynitrite solution was treated with manganese dioxide. Synthesized peroxynitrite contained low levels of contaminating hydrogen peroxide (<1%) and nitrite (10–30%) which were determined as described previously (29Scorza G. Minetti M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by the titanyl method and by absorbance measurements at 354 nm (ε = 24.6 m−1. cm−1), respectively. The concentration of peroxynitrite stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.670m−1. cm−1(30Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G.

The thiol group of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) was blocked by reaction with N-ethylmaleimide as described previously (27Gatti R.M. Radi R. Augusto O.

Buffers were pretreated with Chelex-100 to remove contaminant metal ions. All solutions were prepared with distilled water purified with a Millipore Milli-Q system. Total thiol oxidation was measured after a 20-min incubation at 25 ± 2 °C by spectrophotometric quantitation of sulfhydryls using the 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid assay as described previously (25Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Oxygen uptake studies were performed using an oxygen monitor (Gilson 5/6 oxygraphy) at 25 °C ± 1 °C. The saturation oxygen concentration at this temperature was taken as 250 μm. The EPR fast flow spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.65 GHz and 100 KHz field modulation equipped with a Bruker ER4117 D-MTV dielectric mixing resonator with a 9-mm distance between the mixing cell and the resonator center. Thiol solutions were pre-prepared in appropriated buffers to which sodium bicarbonate was added or not; in the former case, the solutions were left undisturbed for 5 min to permit HCO3−/CO2 equilibration. Peroxynitrite solutions were prepared with water. Thiol and peroxynitrite solutions were transferred to 60-ml plastic syringes mounted on a syringe infusion pump (Harvard apparatus pump 22). Spectra were recorded 3.5 and 12 ms after mixing at continuous flow of 20 ml/min and 6 ml/min, respectively. The dispensed mixtures were collected for pH measurement at the end of the experiments to detect changes caused by mixing with alkaline solutions of peroxynitrite. The magnetic field was calibrated with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (g = 2.0056) (15Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Da C. Ferreira A. Augusto O. J. Biol.

Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In the EPR spin trapping experiments, the incubation mixtures were transferred to a flat cell and the spectra recorded at room temperature 1 min after the addition of peroxynitrite. The concentrations of expected products during the oxidation of GSH and cysteine by peroxynitrite were estimated by calculating the percentage of the oxidant that decomposes to NO3−, ⋅OH, and⋅NO2 (Fig. 1, path 1; k), reacts with thiols (Fig. 1, path 3; kRSH), and reacts with CO2 producing CO2, NO3−, CO⨪3, and⋅NO2 (Fig. 1, path 2;kCO2) under our experimental conditions (1 mm RSH, 1 mm CO2, and 0.5 mm peroxynitrite at 25 °C) by Equation 1 (32Radi R.

The calculated ONOO−concentration that decays through path 3 (Fig. 1) was taken as the expected RSOH concentration. Because paths 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) produce radical and nonradical products, the calculated ONOO−concentrations were multiplied by 0.3 and 0.35 to estimate the produced⋅OH and ⋅NO2 and CO⨪3 and⋅NO2, respectively (TableI).Table IComparison of the experimental yields of depleted thiol with calculated yields of products formed during the oxidation of 1 mm GSH or 1 mm cysteine by 0.5 mm peroxynitrite in the presence and in the absence of 1 mm carbon dioxide at 25 °CSystemMeasured depleted thiol 1- aThe inhibitory effects of CO2 on thiol depletion were concentration-dependent but attained the maximum at 1.0 mm CO2 under the employed experimental conditions.Calculated product concentrations 1-bCalculations are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of each radical in the pairs (⋅OH/⋅NO2 and CO⨪3/⋅NO2) corresponds to half of the shown values.⋅OH + ⋅NO2CO⨪3+⋅NO2RSOHmmmmmmmmGSH, pH 7.40.72 ± 0.030.060.40GSH + CO2, pH 7.40.36 ± 0.03<0.020.320.01GSH, pH 5.40.26 ± 0.020.260.05GSH + CO2, pH 5.40.30 ± 0.010.100.200.02Cys, pH 7.40.60 ± 0.050.020.46Cys + CO2, pH 7.40.36 ± 0.01<0.020.320.04Cys, pH 5.40.37 ± 0.020.200.18Cys + CO2, pH 5.40.24 ± 0.020.100.200.091-a The inhibitory effects of CO2 on thiol depletion were concentration-dependent but attained the maximum at 1.0 mm CO2 under the employed experimental conditions.1-b Calculations are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of each radical in the pairs (⋅OH/⋅NO2 and CO⨪3/⋅NO2) corresponds to half of the shown values. Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effects of HCO3−/CO2 on peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of thiols, we monitored cysteine and GSH oxidation at pH 5.4 and 7.4 by both thiol disappearance (Table I) and oxygen consumption (Fig. 2). Oxygen uptake provides a nonspecific measurement of radicals that react fast with oxygen such as RS⋅ (33Quintiliani M. Badiello R. Tamba M. Estefandi A. Gorin G. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1977; 32: 195-202Google Scholar, 34Barton J.P. Packer J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1970; 2: 159-166Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results show that HCO3−/CO2 inhibited GSH and cysteine thiol disappearance at pH 7.4 (Table I) but in parallel increased the amount of consumed oxygen (Fig. 2). At pH 5.4, HCO3−/CO2 had marginal effects on both thiol depletion (Table I) and oxygen consumption (Fig.2). These results indicate that HCO3−/CO2 diverts peroxynitrite-mediated thiol oxidation from two- to one-electron mechanisms as initially hypothesized (Fig. 1). At pH 5.4 the CO2 effects were marginal because at this pH most of the thiol oxidation occurs by free radical mechanisms even in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 . These conclusions are well supported by comparison of the experimental yields of depleted thiol with the yield of products, radicals (⋅OH/⋅NO2; CO⨪3/⋅NO2), and thiol oxidized by two electrons (RSOH), which can be estimated from the known rate constants of the main competing reactions occurring under the experimental conditions used (Fig. 1, paths 1–3) (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). The data presented in Table I show that GSH oxidation at pH 5.4 occurs through the radicals produced from peroxynitrite in the presence or absence of HCO3−/CO2 . The produced radicals are different, but they are expected to be formed in similar yields (Table I), and all of them (⋅OH/⋅NO2/CO⨪3) react quickly with GSH to produce GS⋅ (TableII). Relevantly, the experimental values of depleted thiol (0.30 and 0.26 mm) were the same as the calculated total radical yields in the presence (0.10 + 0.20 mm) and absence (0.26 mm) of HCO3−/CO2 , respectively (Table I). Compared with GSH, a larger fraction of cysteine is oxidized by two-electron mechanisms at pH 5.4 in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 because of the higher second order rate constant of its reaction with peroxynitrite (24Koppenol W.H. Pryor W.A. Moreno J.J. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 25Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this case, HCO3−/CO2 inhibits total thiol disappearance to some extent, but the oxidized fraction should result from the produced radicals whose expected total yield is, again, similar to the measured depleted thiol (Table I). At pH 7.4 both thiols are oxidized mainly by two-electron mechanisms in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 . In this case, the experimental value of depleted thiol is considerably higher than the calculated one, confirming that the direct reaction between peroxynitrite and RSH consumes more than one thiol (Fig. 1, path 3) (17Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At pH 7.4 in the presence of HCO3−/CO2 , total depleted thiol decreased, but most of it should result from free radical mechanisms because of the similar concentration values of produced radicals and depleted thiols (Table I). In agreement, consumed oxygen increased in the presence of HCO3−/CO2 , particularly in the case of GSH (Fig. 2).Table IIReactions shown in the text for a general thiol (RSH) are listed with their corresponding available rate constants for GSH and cysteineReactionRate constantRef.m−1 s−1GSH + ⋅OH2.3 × 101035Misik V.

Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because oxygen consumption was lower than oxidized thiol (Fig. 2 and Table I), it is likely that RS⋅ is decaying by at least three competing routes,i.e. dimerization, reaction with oxygen, and reaction with excess thiolate (RS−) (Reactions 1–R3).RS⋅+RS⋅→RSSRRS⋅+O2→RSOO⋅→RSO⋅+[O]RS⋅+RS−→RSSR⋅−REACTIONS1–3Other decay routes also occur as indicated by the detection of low levels of GSNO2 (41Balazy M.

The importance of Reactions 2 and 3 arises from the production of sulfonyl (RSOO⋅) and disulfide radical anions (RSSR⋅−), respectively (Table II). In previous studies of thiol oxidation by peroxynitrite, we detected RS⋅radicals by EPR spin trapping and obtained indirect evidence for their conversion to both RSOO⋅ and RSSR⋅− (25Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Here, we present direct EPR evidence for the formation of these species and for the stimulatory effects of HCO3−/CO2 on their yields. We have demonstrated previously that fast flow EPR of concentrated solutions of peroxynitrite and CO2 produces detectable concentrations of CO⨪3 (15Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Da C. Ferreira A. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm cysteine (Fig. 3) or 5 mm GSH (Fig. 4), the one-line EPR signal of CO⨪3 produced from 5 mmperoxynitrite and 5 mm CO2 became barely detectable (indicated by ● in Figs. 3 and 4) and new EPR signals appeared, particularly at pH 7.4. Cysteine oxidation produced a three-line signal (a2H = 9.3 G; line width = 3.5 G; g = 2.0107) (Fig. 3) which has been characterized previously as the corresponding sulfinyl radical (CysSO⋅) by fast flow EPR studies of cysteine oxidation by Ti(III)-H2O2 (43Gilbert B.C. Laue H.A.H. Norman R.O.C. Sealy R.C. J. Chem Soc. Perkin Trans. 1974; 2: 892-900Google Scholar). GSH oxidation produced a four-line signal (aH = 7.1 G andaH = 10.7 G; line width = 2.6 G;g = 2.0109) whose EPR parameters are also consistent with the corresponding sulfinyl radical (GSO⋅) (Fig. 4). Both CysSO⋅ and GSO⋅ have two β-methylene hydrogens, but in the latter, a hindered rotation of the methylene group that is adjacent to a chiral center is likely to result in the magnetic nonequivalence (44Gilbert B.C.

We demonstrated previously that the yeast MAPKs Kss1 and Fus3 bind with high affinity to the N terminus of the MEK Ste7, and proposed that a conserved motif in Ste7, the MAPK-docking site, mediates this interaction. Here we show that the corresponding sequences in human MEK1 and MEK2 are necessary and sufficient for the direct binding of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Mutations in MEK1, MEK2, or Ste7 that altered conserved residues in the docking site diminished binding of the cognate MAPKs. Furthermore, short peptides corresponding to the docking sites in these MEKs inhibited MEK1-mediated phosphorylation of ERK2in vitro. In yeast cells, docking-defective alleles of Ste7 were modestly compromised in their ability to transmit the mating pheromone signal. This deficiency was dramatically enhanced when the ability of the Ste5 scaffold protein to associate with components of the MAPK cascade was also compromised.

Understanding how protein kinases recognize their substrates with efficiency and fidelity is of great interest to functional genomics and molecular pharmacology, as it could expedite substrate prediction and drug target discovery, respectively. Perhaps most importantly, it is key for understanding larger questions of signal-response specificity (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Kinase-substrate recognition and signal-response specificity are particularly pressing issues in signaling networks that involve mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascades (3Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). MAPK cascades contribute to the regulation of diverse responses, including hormone and growth factor action, cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, learning, inflammation, and stress responses, as well as tumorigenesis and other pathological processes (4Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the core of these cascades are a MAPK (also termed extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or ERK), and a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK or MKK) that phosphorylates and thereby activates the MAPK. MEK activity can be regulated, in turn, via phosphorylation by various classes of upstream kinase (5Garrington T. Johnson G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs phosphorylate targets including transcription factors, other kinases, and other enzymes. Some MAPKs also regulate some of their targets by direct binding, rather than by (or in addition to) phosphorylation (6Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Shapiro P.S. Whalen A.M. Tolwinski N.S. Wilsbacher J. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Garcia M. Osheroff N. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both yeast and animal cells possess multiple parallel MAPK cascades.Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains four fully elaborated MAPK cascades, the mating pheromone response, filamentation invasion, cell integrity, and high osmolarity response pathways (8Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These pathways, although distinct, share some components. Four mammalian MAPK pathways have been well characterized, the ERK1/2 module, the JNK module, the p38 module, and the ERK5 module (5Garrington T. Johnson G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Other mammalian MEKs and MAPKs have been identified as well, but await assignment to a pathway. It is generally observed that MEKs in one pathway do not phosphorylate MAPKs in other pathways, but how this selectivity is achieved is not well understood. MAPK cascades have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. For example, human ERK1 and ERK2 are ∼50% identical to the yeast mating/invasive growth MAPKs, Fus3 and Kss1. Likewise, the catalytic domains of human MEK1 and MEK2 are similar to that of the yeast mating/invasive growth MEK, Ste7. Indeed, molecular evolutionary analysis suggests that Fus3 and Kss1 are orthologs of ERK1 and ERK2, and that the yeast high osmolarity response MAPK, Hog1, is the ortholog of the mammalian JNK and p38 families (9Caffrey D.R. O'Neill L.A. Shields D.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 567-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In fact, mammalian p38 can functionally replace Hog1 in S. cerevisiae (10Galcheva-Gargova Z.B. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and ERK1 can substitute for Kss1 (11Atienza J.M. Suh M. Xenarios I. Landgraf R. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20638-20646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given that MAPK cascades require the sequential action of at least three tiers of protein kinases, properly directed kinase-substrate interactions are necessary to achieve efficiency and fidelity in these signaling modules. Insights into kinase-substrate transactions have come from studies of the phosphorylation of small peptides derived from protein substrates (12Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), or selected from combinatorial libraries (14Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Further understanding has come from crystal structures of such peptides bound to the catalytic clefts of protein kinases (15Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, peptides are often relatively poor substrates when compared with native proteins. Furthermore, phosphorylation site consensus sequences cannot fully account for the specificity observed in many kinase-substrate relationships. For example, all MAPKs phosphorylate substrates that have the core consensus, -(Ser/Thr)-Pro-. This sequence, by itself, cannot be the sole determinant of MAPK specificity because it is found in more than 75% of all proteins and because it is also at the core of phosphorylation sites recognized by cyclin-dependent kinases. Clearly, other factors must contribute to MAPK recognition of unique substrates. In the case of MEK recognition of MAPKs, altering the loop on MAPKs that is phosphorylated by MEKs does not result in the predicted alterations in specificity (16Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Li Z. Schwarz E. Lin A. Guan K. Ulevitch R. Han J. J. Biol.

Also, unlike most protein kinases, MEKs do not recognize peptide versions of their target site (19Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Additional contributions to protein kinase target selection are provided by “docking sites” on substrates that are separate from the phosphoacceptor residues (reviewed in Ref. 20Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, some protein kinases use domains or subunits other than the catalytic domain to aid in substrate recognition (21Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol.

Another means to influence efficiency and fidelity of kinase-substrate transactions is via a “scaffolding” or “anchoring” protein that binds both kinase and substrate (24Karandikar M. Cobb M.H. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 26Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The prototype MAPK-cascade scaffold is S. cerevisiae Ste5, which is essential for the mating pheromone response. Distinct regions of Ste5 bind the MEK Ste7 and the MAPKs Fus3/Kss1 (27Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Ste5 also binds Ste11 (MEK kinase that phosphorylates and activates Ste7) (27Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hence, Ste5 is thought to function, first, by recruiting Ste11 to the plasma membrane, where it can be activated by the Ste20 protein kinase (which also binds Gβ) (33Drogen F. O'Rourke S. Stucke V.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2684-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and second, by co-localizing, sequestering, and properly organizing the component protein kinases of the mating MAPK cascade (36Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Sette C. Inouye C.J. Stroschein S.L. Iaquinta P.J. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4033-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this second role, Ste5 is thought to enhance signal transmission from MEK kinase to MEK to MAPK, and to insulate the mating pheromone response pathway from other pathways that use some of the same components. Despite initial expectations, no metazoan homologues of Ste5 have been identified. However, analogous scaffolding functions have been ascribed to mammalian MP1 and KSR (which bind both MEK and ERK) (38Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 39Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and to JIP1-JIP3 (which bind members of the JNK cascade) (40Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 41Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Current interest in docking and scaffolding stems not only from their influence on signaling specificity and insulation, but also from their role in shaping the kinetics, efficiency, and threshold properties of within pathway signal transmission (42Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 43Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given that similar functions have been attributed to kinase-substrate docking and to scaffolding, it seems possible that these mechanisms may act cooperatively within the cell. This has not been heretofore investigated, to our knowledge. Here we present evidence that indicates that the MAPK-docking site of MEKs has been structurally and functionally conserved from yeast to humans. We also demonstrate that peptides corresponding to these MAPK-docking sites inhibit MEK-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Finally, we show that docking and scaffolding make mututally reinforcing, synergistic contributions to signal transmission in vivo. Standard yeast media and culture conditions were as described previously (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Yeast strain YLB105 (MATa ste5Δ ste7Δ) was derived from YPH499 (46Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the endogenous STE5 andSTE7 alleles with theste5Δ::LYS2 (47Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andste7Δ::ADE2 (29Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) alleles, respectively. Strain JCY107 (MATaste7Δ) has been described (48Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Strain DC17 (MATα his1) was used as a mating tester. The following mammalian genes were used in this study: human MEK1 (MAP2K1; GenBankTMaccession number NM_002755), human MEK2 (MAP2K2;L11285), human ERK1 (MAPK3; X60188), and ratERK2 (M64300). To construct pGEM-MEK1, the MEK1 coding sequence was amplified by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), primers LB111 (see TableI for the sequence of all oligonucleotides) and LB113, and template plasmid pBS-MEK1 (49Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI andSalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z (Promega). pGEM-MEK1Δ3–11 was constructed using the same procedure except that primer LB112 was substituted for LB111. To construct pGEM-MEK2, the MEK2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using primers LB114 and LB116 and template plasmid pBS-MEK2 (49Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI andXhoI and inserted into pGEM4Z that had been digested withEcoRI and SalI. pGEM-MEK2Δ4–16 was constructed using the same procedure except that primer LB115 was substituted for LB114.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyName Sequence (5′ → 3′)UseLB111*GCGGGATCCACCATGCCCAAGAAGAAGCCGApGEM-MEK1LB112*GCGGGATCCACCATGCCCAACCCGGCCCCCGACGGCpGEM-MEK1Δ3–11LB113CGGTCGACTCGCTCTTTGTTGCTTCCCAAMEK1 3′LB114GCGAATTCACCATGCTGGCCCGGAGGAAGpGEM-MEK2LB115GCGAATTCACCATGCTGGCCACCATCGCCGAGGGCCCATCCpGEM-MEK2Δ4–16LB116CGCTCGAGACGCAGGGAGCCCGGCCAMEK2 3′LB70AATTCGAAGGAGGTGGCATGTTTCAACGAAAGACTTTACAGAGAAGGAACTTGAAAGGGCTCAATCTTAACCTGCACCC AGATGTGGGCAATTAGpGEX-STE71–25LB71TCGACTAATTGCCCACATCTGGGTGCAGGTTAAGATTGAGCCCTTTCAAGTTCCTTCTCTGTAAAGTCTTTCGTTGAAA CATGCCCCCCCBBHHHHCCACCTCCTTCGpGEX-STE71–25LB72AATTCGAAGGCGGTGGCATGCCGAAGAAGAAGCCGACCCCGATCCAGCTGAACCCGGCTCCGGACGGTTCTGCTTAGpGEX-MEK11–19LB73TCGACTAAGCAGAACCGTCCGGAGCCGGGTTCAGCTGGATCGGGGTCGGCTTCTTCTTCGGCATGCCACCGCCTTCGpGEX-MEK11–19LB74AATTCGAAGGCGGTGGCATGCTGGCTCGTCGTAAGCCGGTTCTGCCGGCTCTGACCATCAACCCGACCATCGCTGAAGG CCCGTAGpGEX-MEK21–22LB75TCGACTACGGGCCTTCAGCGATGGTCGGGTTGATGGTCAGAGCCGGCAGAACCGGCTTACGACGAGCCAGCATGCCACC GCCTTCGpGEX-MEK21–22LB101GATCTGGCGGAGGCGGTGGATCCGGAGpGEXLBLB102AATTCTCCGGATCCACCGCCTCCGCCApGEXLBLB103GCGGGATCCACCATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGGCCCpGEX-GERK2LB104CGGTCGACTAAGATCTGTATCCTGGCTGGAATCGpGEX-GERK2LB88GATCCAACATGTTTCAACGAAAGACTCTGCAGAGAAGGAACTTGAAAGGGCTCAATCTTAACCTGCACCCAGACGTCGG CAATAATGGYCpT3-STE7LB89CCATTATTGCCGACGTCTGGGTGCAGGTTAAGATTGAGCCCTTTCAAGTTCCTTCTCTGCAGAGTCTTTCGTTGAAACA TGTTGYCpT3-STE7LB105GGAAGAGAACTTGAAAGGGCTCAATCTTAACCTGCACCCAGACGTYCpT3-STE7(9E10E)LB106CTGGGTGCAGGTTAAGATTGAGCCCTTTCAAGTTCTCTTCCTGCAYCpT3-STE7(9E10E)LB127GATCCGGTACCATGCAYCpT3-STE7Δ2–7LB128GCCATGGTYCpT3-STE7Δ2–7LB131GATCCACCATGCACCCAGACGTYCpT3-STE7Δ2–19LB132GTGGTACGTGGGTCYCpT3-STE7Δ2–19LB133GAGAAGGAACTTGAAAGGGCTCAATCTTAACCTTGGYCpT3-STE7Δ20–26LB134ACGTCTCTTCCTTGAACTTTCCCGAGTTAGAATTGGAACCYCpT3-STE7Δ20–26LF4GATCCTTGGTCATGGTCGGCAATAATGGYCpT3-STE7Δ2–22LF5CCATTATTGCCGACCATGACCAAGYCpT3-STE7Δ2–22SP6PLTGGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACGAASTE71–172fragmentsSTE7-X- 172TCACTATTAATCTGCTGCGGCTGGCGATASTE71–172fragmentsSTE7–1 -XGCGAATTCACCATGTTTCAACGAAAGACTTTACAGAGAAGGAACTTGAAAGGGCTCASTE71–98fragmentsWhere appropriate, restriction sites used for subcloning are underlined.

To construct pGEX-STE71–25, oligonucleotide LB70 annealed to LB71 was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI. To construct pGEX-MEK11–19, oligonucleotide LB72 annealed to LB73 was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI. pGEX-MEK11–19EE was constructed by the same procedure, except that oligonucleotides encoding the indicated amino acid substitutions were used. To construct pGEX-MEK21–22, oligonucleotide LB74 annealed to LB75 was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI. pGEX-MEK21–22ATA was constructed by the same procedure, except that oligonucleotides encoding the indicated amino acid substitutions were used. To construct pGEXLB, oligonucleotide LB101 annealed to LB102 was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 that had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI. This results in the replacement of an encoded Pro residue with a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly sequence designed to facilitate the independent functioning of the GST and fusion moieties. The FUS3 coding sequence on anEcoRI-SalI fragment was excised from pGEM4Z-meFUS3 (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB, yielding pGEXLB-FUS3. The ERK2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using as primers LB103 and LB104 and as the template plasmid pBS-ERK2 (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI andSalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB, yielding pGEX-GERK2. The plasmid encoding GST-ERK1 is described elsewhere (50Charest D.L. Mordret G. Harder K.W. Jirik F. Pelech S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4679-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). YCpT3-STE7 is a low copy (CEN), TRP1-containing vector, in which theSTE7 open reading frame, modified by silent substitutions that introduce additional restriction sites, is expressed from the STE7 promoter. This vector, which was used as the starting point for construction of multiple alleles, was itself constructed in several steps. First, the single AatII site in plasmid YCpT-STE7 (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was destroyed by digestion withAatII, treatment of the resulting linearized DNA fragment with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of all 4 deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, and recircularization the resulting “filled-in” product, generating YCpT2-STE7. Second, oligonucleotide LB88 annealed to LB89 was inserted into YCpT2-STE7 that had been digested with BamHI andMscI, yielding YCpT3-STE7. This resulted in the replacement of the sequence encoding residues 1–27 of Ste7 protein with a sequence encoding the same amino acids but containing silent substitutions that introduced a PstI site (spanning codons 7 and 8) and anAatII site (spanning codons 22–23). YCpT3-STE7 was able to fully complement the mating and invasive growth defects of aste7Δ strain, and was used as the wild-type control for the experiments in this study. To construct YCpT3-STE79E10E, oligonucleotide LB105 annealed to LB106B was used to replace the corresponding PstI-AatII fragment of YCpT3-STE7. YCpT3-STE7R10A, YCpT3-STE715A17A, and YCpT3-STE7AAAA were constructed by the same procedure, except that oligonucleotides encoding the indicated substitutions were employed. TheBamHI-PstI fragment of YCpT3-STE7 was replaced by oligonucleotide LB127 annealed to LB128, yielding YCpT3-STE7Δ2–7. TheBamHI-AatII fragment of YCpT3-STE7 was replaced by oligonucleotide LB131 annealed to LB132, yielding YCpT3-STE7Δ2–19. TheAatII-MscI fragment of YCpT3-STE7 was replaced by oligonucleotide LB133 annealed to LB134, yielding YCpT3-STE7Δ20–26. TheBamHI-MscI fragment of YCpT3-STE7 was replaced by oligonucleotide LF4 annealed to LF5, yielding YCpT3-STE7Δ2–22. The wild-type, AAAA, Δ2–7, Δ2–19, and Δ20–26 alleles of STE7 were subcloned from their YCpT3-based vectors into pGEM4Z as BamHI-HinDIII fragments. Fragments encoding the N-terminal third of these alleles (through residue 172 of wild-type STE7) were then amplified by PCR using primers SP6PL and STE7-X-172. The wild-type allele was produced as a fragment encoding the first 98 residues by PCR using primers STE7–1-X and STE7-X-98 (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An SP6 promoter was added to this fragment in a second round of PCR using primers SP6EP and STE7-X-98, as described (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used to produce N-terminal fragments of the Δ9–19, G14A, R10A, R10E, 9E10E, 15A17A, and 4E5E alleles, except that oligonucleotides encoding the indicated amino acid changes were used in place of STE7–1-X. Low-copy (CEN4, ARS1) plasmids YCpU (containing URA3) and YCpT (containing TRP1) have been described elsewhere (48Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). YCpH-STE11-4 (a gift of Deepak Voora, our (J. T.) laboratory) contains the STE11-4 allele (51Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) inserted into the low-copy plasmid pRS313 (46Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The YCpU-based plasmids expressing STE5alleles from the STE5 promoter are described elsewhere (28Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the reporter plasmid YEpL-FUS1Z (a gift of Judy Zhu-Shimoni, our (J. T.) laboratory), the URA3 gene was excised from YEpU-FUS1Z (52Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Zhu-Shimoni J.X. Voora D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15400-15405Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and replaced with the LEU2 gene following a procedure described previously (52Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Zhu-Shimoni J.X. Voora D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15400-15405Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transcription and translation reactions in vitro, the partial purification of translation products by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the quantification of translation products were performed as described previously elsewhere (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In general, polypeptides encoded by plasmid-borne alleles were produced using a coupled transcription/translation system (SPT3; Novagen); polypeptides encoded by PCR products were produced by sequential transcription and translation. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as instructed by the manufacturer. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were quantified by comparison to known amounts of bovine serum albumin, following SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Binding assays were performed as described (53Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Kron S.J. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2831-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were analyzed by scintillation counting and SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels were first Coomassie stained (Gelcode blue, Pierce) and photographed, then treated with fluorography solution (Amplify; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried down, and autoradiographed. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, purified rat ERK2 was purchased from Calbiochem, anti-ERK2 antiserum from New England Biolabs, and purified human JNK1 (α1 isoform, GenBankTML26318) and anti-JNK1 antiserum from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Binding constants were calculated as described (45Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), based on the known input concentrations and a determination of the amount complex formed, assuming a simple bimolecular binding reaction. A further assumption was that 100% of input molecules were active (i.e. capable of binding). We find Kdvalues calculated in this manner to be useful for relative comparisons of the affinities of different protein-protein interactions measured using the same assay. We have noted, however, that theKd for (essentially) the same interaction, determined in two different assays (e.g. GST cosedimentationversus coimmunoprecipitation), can vary up to 20-fold. Kinase reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg (1.25 μm) of inactive mouse ERK2 (K52R mutation; New England Biolabs), 0.1 unit of active human MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology), 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the indicated concentration of peptide. ERK2 and peptide were preincubated in buffer for 10 min at 37 °C, then returned to ice prior to the addition of ATP and MEK1. Reactions were for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified on a PhosphorImager. The results were also verified qualitatively by immunostaining with antisera specific for the dually phosphorylated ERK isoform (New England Biolabs). Mating assays were performed as described (28Inouye C. Dhill"
https://openalex.org/W2053296317,"Azo dyes are regarded as pollutants because they are not readily reduced under aerobic conditions. Bacillussp. OY1-2 transforms azo dyes into colorless compounds, and this reduction is mediated by a reductase activity for the azo group in the presence of NADPH. A 1.2-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the gene that encodes azoreductase was cloned by screening the genomic library of Bacillus sp. OY1-2 with digoxigenin-labeled probe designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. An open reading frame encoding the azoreductase, consisting of 178 amino acids, was predicted from the nucleotide sequence. In addition, because only a Bacillus subtillis hypothetical protein was discovered in the public databases (with an amino acid identity of 52.8%), the gene encoding the azoreductase cloned in this study was predicted to be a member of a novel family of reductases. Southern blot analysis revealed that the azoreductase gene exists as a single copy gene on a chromosome. Escherichia coli-expressing recombinant azoreductase gave a ten times greater reducing activity toward azo dyes than the originalBacillus sp. OY1-2. In addition, the expressed azoreductase purified from the recombinant E. coli lysate by Red-Sepharose affinity chromatography showed a similar activity and specificity as the native enzyme. This is the first report describing the sequencing and characterization of a gene encoding the azo dye-reducing enzyme, azoreductase, from aerobic bacteria and its expression in E. coli."

It exists as two isoforms, A and B, which have a 70% amino acid identity and different substrate and inhibitor specificities. This study reports the identification of residues responsible for conferring this specificity in human MAO A and B. Using site-directed mutagenesis we reciprocally interchanged three pairs of corresponding nonconserved amino acids within the central portion of human MAO. Mutant MAO A-I335Y became like MAO B, which exhibits a higher preference for β-phenylethylamine than for the MAO A preferred substrate serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), and became more sensitive to deprenyl (MAO B-specific inhibitor) than to clorgyline (MAO A-specific inhibitor). The reciprocal mutant MAO B-Y326I exhibited an increased preference for 5-hydroxytryptamine, a decreased preference for β-phenylethylamine, and, similar to MAO A, was more sensitive to clorgyline than to deprenyl. These mutants also showed a distinct shift in sensitivity for the MAO A- and B-selective inhibitors Ro 41–1049 and Ro 16–6491. Mutant pair MAO A-T245I and MAO B-I236T and mutant pair MAO A-D328G and MAO B-G319D reduced catalytic activity but did not alter specificity.

Mutant pair MAO A-T245I and MAO B-I236T and mutant pair MAO A-D328G and MAO B-G319D reduced catalytic activity but did not alter specificity. Our results indicate that Ile-335 in MAO A and Tyr-326 in MAO B play a critical role in determining substrate and inhibitor specificities in human MAO A and B. monoamine oxidase 5-hydroxytryptamine β-phenylethylamine. Monoamine oxidase (MAO1; amine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) (flavin-containing), EC1.4.3.4) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of biogenic and xenobiotic amines and plays an important role in regulating their levels. MAO is a flavin-adenine dinucleotide-containing enzyme located on the mitochondrial outer membrane (1Greenawalt J.W. Schnaitman C. J.

It exists in two forms, A and B. MAO A preferentially oxidizes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and is inhibited by low concentrations of clorgyline (4Johnston J.P. Biochem.

Higher 5-HT and norepinephrine levels and a phenotype characterized by increased aggressive behavior is observed when the MAO A gene is deficient in humans (12Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakfield X.O.

Because MAO is an integral membrane protein, it is difficult to crystallize, and its three-dimensional structure has not been reported. To determine the region(s) responsible for the substrate and inhibitor specificities of the two isoenzymes, we and other groups have made point mutations and chimeric MAO A/B enzymes (15Cesura A.M.

It has been shown that reciprocally interchanging amino acids Phe-208 in MAO A and its corresponding residue in MAO B, Ile-199, was sufficient to partially reverse the substrate and inhibitor specificities of rat MAOs (22Tsugeno Y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14033-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but not human MAOs (21Geha R.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This indicated that different amino acid residues may determine specificity in human and rat MAOs. We also found that the residues that may be important for specificity in human MAOs are within a 161-amino acid segment (amino acids 215–375 in MAO A and 206–266 in MAO B) (21Geha R.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This segment contains 32 amino acids that are nonconserved between human MAO A and B, of which 15 are conserved among the different species of MAO A or B. Trout MAO shares a 70 and 71% amino acid identity with MAO A and B, respectively. However because the substrate and inhibition profile of trout MAO is much closer to that of MAO A than to that of MAO B (23Chen K. Wu H.-F. Grimsby J. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 1226-1233Google Scholar), classifying it as such allows us to reduce the number of amino acids potentially responsible for specificity from 15 to 5 (Fig. 1). Of these five, two were mutated as part of an earlier experiment to the corresponding residue in the other MAO, expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and did not exhibit any kinetic differences from the wild-type enzyme. 2R. M. Geha, I. Rebrin, K. Chen, and J. C. Shih, unpublished data. This indicated that they do not play an important role in specificity. For the other three amino acids we have made six reciprocal mutants. We found that when two corresponding amino acids, Ile-335 and Tyr-326 in human MAO A and B, respectively, were reciprocally interchanged, the substrate and inhibitor specificities were also switched. This result suggests that Ile-335 and Tyr-326 in human MAO A and B, respectively, play a key role in conferring substrate and inhibitor specificities in human MAOs. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides were from Operon Technologies Inc. (Alameda, CA). 5-HT, PEA, clorgyline, and (−)-deprenyl were from Sigma. 5-[2-14C]hydroxytryptamine binoxalate (57.80 mCi/mmol) and β-[ethyl-1-14C]phenylethylamine hydrochloride (52.00 mCi/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ro 41–1049 and Ro 16–6491 were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). The pVL1392 transfer vector and the linearized BaculoGold™ DNA were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Gentamycin, antibiotic-antimycotic solution, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was from Pierce. The EagleSight software was from Stratagene. Full-length human MAO A and B cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pVL1392 transfer vector and named pVL1392-hMAOA and pVL1392-hMAOB, respectively. The clone was verified for proper insertion by restriction digest analysis. Recombinant MAO A and B-encoding virus was produced by homologous recombination and cotransfection of Sf21 insect cells with the transfer vector and the linearized baculovirus DNA via the calcium phosphate method (24Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by plaque purification and amplified by infection of insect cells with a multiplicity of infection of 1. After four passes a viral stock with a titer of 108plaque-forming units/ml was produced. Site-directed mutagenesis on pVL1392-hMAOA and pVL1392-hMAOB were performed using the QuikChange kit and following the protocol of the kit.

The mutagenic bases are underlined. The introduction of the mutations was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing analysis of the region of interest. The wild-type and mutant MAOs were overexpressed in adherent cultures of Sf21 insect cells (24Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). 150-mm cell culture dishes were seeded with 20 × 106 Sf21 cells, and recombinant virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 2. The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 72–80 h and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 ×g. Cell pellets were homogenized in 5 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using the polytron homogenizer for 15 s at setting 5. The homogenates were divided into 0.5-ml aliquots, frozen by dipping into liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The homogenates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar) and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A dense band appeared at the expected molecular mass of MAO (∼60 kDa) and represented >70% of the total protein. The identity of the band was further confirmed by Western analysis using rabbit anti-MAO A and anti-MAO B antibodies coupled to hydrogen peroxidase. Signals were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG as secondary antibody followed by exposure to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and H2O2. A highly purified bovine serum albumin standard was electrophoresed in parallel with the homogenates at nine concentration points ranging from 0.1 to 8 μm. The densities of the MAOs and the bovine serum albumin bands were quantitated using the EagleSight software, and the MAO concentrations were calculated according to the linear bovine serum albumin standard. The kinetic constants for the oxidation of 5-HT and PEA and the inhibition by clorgyline, deprenyl, Ro 41–1040, and Ro 16–6491 were determined by the radiochemical method as previously described (26Grimsby J. Zentner M. Shih J.C. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using O2-saturated 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer. For the Kmdetermination [14C]5-HT and [14C]PEA concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 5 times theKmvalues that were determined via an Eadie-Hofstee plot (v versus v/[S]). Thekcatvalues were calculated from theVmaxvalues obtained by fitting the [S]versus activity curve to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the calculated concentration of the enzyme from the quantitation assay. The IC50 values for the irreversible inhibitors clorgyline and deprenyl were determined by preincubating the inhibitor with the homogenate for 30 min at 37 °C and assaying for the remaining activity as described (26Grimsby J. Zentner M. Shih J.C. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reversible inhibitors were incubated with PEA without the 30-min preincubation. Inhibitor concentrations ranged from 10−4 to 10−11m, and the IC50values were determined by Hill analysis. We reciprocally interchanged amino acids Thr-245, Asp-328, and Ile-335 individually in human MAO A with their corresponding amino acids in human MAO B to produce the mutants A-T245I, A-D328G, and A-I335Y. Their equivalent mutants in MAO B (B-I236T, B-G319D, and B-Y326I) were also made. Wild-type MAO A and B, as well as the six mutants, were successfully overexpressed in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus. The turnover number (kcat) and the affinity (Km) toward the MAO A-specific substrate 5-HT and the MAO B-specific substrate PEA were determined. We used the specificity constant,kcat/Km, to depict the specificity of an enzyme toward 5-HT or PEA. As shown in Table I, MAO A wild type had a 6-fold higher kcat for 5-HT than for PEA but a similar Km for both substrates, resulting in akcat/Km value for 5-HT that is about seven times that of PEA (Fig.2). MAO B wild type, on the other hand, had a 19-fold higher kcat for PEA than for 5-HT and a much lower Km for PEA, resulting in akcat/Km for PEA that is about 40,000 times that for 5-HT. Similarly, MAO A and B had a higherkcat/Km for 5-HT and PEA respectively. These results are consistent with literature findings that classify 5-HT as MAO A-specific and PEA as MAO B-specific (16Chen K. Wu H.-F. Shih J.C. J.

The values given are the means of at least three experiments ± S.E. Open table in a new tab The kcat and Km values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” for the MAO A-preferring substrate 5-HT and the MAO B-preferring substrate PEA. The values given are the means of at least three experiments ± S.E. In contrast to MAO A, mutant MAO A-I335Y showed a higherkcat for PEA than for 5-HT. It also exhibited a 35-fold increase in its Km for 5-HT to 2801 μm (which is similar to the 5-HT Km of MAO B of 3891 μm); thus the Km for 5-HT was lower than for PEA (Table I). This produced a largerkcat/Km for PEA than for 5-HT (Fig. 2). In effect, A-I335Y acquired an MAO B-like substrate specificity. Mutant B-Y326I had similar kcat values for 5-HT and PEA and, compared with MAO B, exhibited a 7-fold decrease inKm for 5-HT and a 5-fold increase inKm for PEA (Table I). The resultingkcat/Km values (Fig.2) indicate that this mutant retained MAO B-like substrate specificities. However, thekcat/Km of the mutant was only about 75-fold higher for PEA than for 5-HT, compared with an ∼40,000-fold difference in the MAO B wild type. Therefore even though B-Y326I retained a higher specificity for PEA than for 5-HT, it exhibited a significant shift in specificity toward MAO A. In summary, Ile-335 in MAO A and Tyr-326 in MAO B play an important role in the substrate specificity of human MAO A and B. A switch in sensitivities for MAO A and B irreversible inhibitors clorgyline and (−)-deprenyl was also observed (Fig.3). MAO A has an IC50 value of 1.2 × 10−9m for clorgyline and 1.3 × 10−6mfor deprenyl, whereas MAO B has an IC50 value of 6.3 × 10−7m for clorgyline and 4.3 × 10−9m for deprenyl. Compared with MAO A, A-I335Y exhibited about a 6000-fold decrease in sensitivity toward clorgyline (IC50 = 7.1 × 10−6m) and a 10-fold increase in sensitivity toward deprenyl (IC50 = 1.2 × 10−7m) (Fig. 3). Thus the inhibitor sensitivity of this MAO A mutant became MAO-B like. Similarly, MAO B-Y326I was MAO A-like and was more sensitive to clorgyline (IC50 = 2.8 × 10−8m) than to deprenyl (IC50 = 1.8 × 10−7m) (Fig. 3). Therefore Ile-335 and Tyr-326 determine clorgyline and deprenyl sensitivities. We also studied enzyme sensitivity toward the reversible inhibitors Ro 41–1049 (MAO A-specific) and Ro 16–6491 (MAO B-specific). As shown in Fig. 4 A, A-I335Y had about a 4000-fold decreased sensitivity toward Ro 41–1049 compared with MAO A (IC50 = 5.6 × 10−8m for MAO A and 2.5 × 10−4m for A-I335Y), becoming MAO B-like. Similarly, B-Y326I exhibited a 1000-fold higher sensitivity for the MAO A-specific inhibitor Ro 41–1049 compared with MAO B (IC50 = 2.5 × 10−4m for MAO B and 2.5 × 10−6m for B-Y326I) and became more like MAO A. However, for the MAO B-specific inhibitor Ro 16–6491, both mutants exhibited a decrease in sensitivity when compared with their parent enzyme, and no reversal in specificity was observed. The substrate and inhibitor specificities exhibited by A-I335Y and B-Y326I suggest that specificity may be determined by the presence of either an aliphatic or an aromatic side chain at this position. To confirm this, we made mutants A-I335F and B-Y326V. A-I335F hadkcat/Km values of 3.2 × 10−4 for 5-HT and 0.03 for PEA, making it similar to A-I335Y. In addition, B-Y326V hadkcat/Km values of 0.042 for 5-HT and 2.71 for PEA, which are similar to values for B-Y326I. For the inhibitors, A-I335F had IC50 values of 6.8 ± 0.7 × 10−6 for clorgyline and 3.8 ± 0.4 × 10−7 for deprenyl, which are similar to values for A-I335Y, and equivalently B-Y326V had IC50 values of 2.4 ± 0.8 × 10−8 for clorgyline and 2.2 ± 0.5 × 10−7 for deprenyl, which are similar to values for B-Y326I. These results show that it is the presence of either an aromatic or aliphatic side chain that is responsible for the inverse specificity effect. The other two pairs of mutants, A-T245I and B-I236T and A-D328G and B-G319D, showed a decrease in kcat values for both 5-HT and PEA compared with their parent enzymes. A-T245I and A-D328G showed a kcat of 12.6 ± 1.6 and 1.6 ± 0.2 min−1, respectively, for 5-HT (compared with 67.4 ± 3.4 min−1 for MAO A wild type) and 4.2 ± 0.5 and 0.3 ± 0.1 min−1, respectively, for PEA (compared with 11.2 ± 0.4 min−1 for MAO A wild type). B-I236T and B-G319D showed kcat values of 1.8 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.1 min−1, respectively, for 5-HT (compared with 5.1 ± 0.1 for MAO B wild type) and 19.4 ± 0.8 and 14.3 ± 2.0 min−1, respectively, for PEA (compared with 98.4 ± 5.2 for MAO B wild type). However, they retained theKm values for both substrates, thus resulting in unaltered specificities. Their IC50 values for clorgyline, deprenyl, Ro 49–1049, and Ro 16–6491 were also unchanged compared with their parent enzyme. These results suggest that the mutations decrease the catalytic activity by either directly or indirectly affecting the active site. However, they do not affect substrate or inhibitor specificity. It should be noted that even though the substrate and inhibitor specificities of A-I335Y and B-Y326I were switched, their kinetic and inhibitory constants were not identical to those of the other MAO; the Km values for PEA were not greatly affected. The IC50 values for the inhibitors shift toward, but do not become identical to, the opposite MAO, and no specificity change was observed for Ro 16–6491. This suggests that other amino acids also play a role in determining substrate and inhibitor specificities. In summary, the MAO A mutant A-I335Y acquired kinetic parameters similar to those of MAO B. Similarly, the MAO B mutant B-Y326I acquired kinetic parameters more like those of MAO A. Therefore our results suggest that Ile-335 in MAO A and its corresponding residue in MAO B, Tyr-326, play an important role in conferring substrate and inhibitor preferences to human MAO A and B. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed six MAO mutants by reciprocally interchanging three corresponding amino acid pairs in human MAO A and B within a region thought to be important for conferring substrate and inhibitor specificities. The corresponding mutant pair A-I335Y and B-Y326I exhibited opposite specificities compared with their parent enzymes, MAO A and B, respectively. A-I335Y became more like MAO B, whereas B-Y326I became more like MAO A. This suggests that Ile-335 in MAO A and Tyr-326 in MAO B have an important function in determining the specificities of human MAO A and B. Although the three-dimensional crystal structure of the enzyme is not available, we can explain the specificity switch effect in the following manner. It is possible that in human MAO A the binding of the substrate or inhibitor may be facilitated by direct hydrophobic interactions within the active site with Ile-335, whereas in human MAO B such binding may be mediated by aromatic stacking or hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-326. This view is supported by the observation that mutants A-I335F and B-Y326V also exhibited a change in specificity similar to the reciprocal mutants. It is also possible that these two amino acids influence the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and affect substrate and inhibitor specificities. However, this binding interaction may not be generalized to MAOs of other species. It was reported that switching Phe-208 and Ile-199 in rat MAO A and B, respectively, results in a partial inversion of specificities for some substrates and inhibitors (22Tsugeno Y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14033-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the structural feature responsible for determining specificity was the aromatic ring of Phe-208 in rat MAO A and the aliphatic side chain of Ile-199 in rat MAO B. This is the reverse of our present observation in human MAO, in which the aliphatic residue is in MAO A (Ile-335), and the aromatic residue is in MAO B (Tyr-326). Even though the data from the rat MAO mutants consisted only of Km values to ascertain substrate specificity and a single inhibitor concentration to determine inhibitor specificity, when compared with our results, these data may point to an MAO species difference in the way specificity is determined. In fact, we have previously found that the same amino acid substitutions made on human MAO, A-F208I and B-I199F, did not result in a change in specificities (21Geha R.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as was observed in rats. Several reports indicate the existence of large differences in specificities among MAOs of the same subtype but from different mammalian species (27Glover V. Sandler M.

Some oxadiazolone compounds have inhibitory potencies that vary four orders of magnitude between rat and bovine MAO B (28Krueger M.J. Mazouz F. Ramsay R.R. Milcent R. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas some antidepressant drugs show a B over A specificity in mouse and rat MAOs and the reverse specificity in rat and monkey MAOs (29Egashira T.

These reports and our results suggest that the specificities of rat and human MAOs (and MAOs of other species) are determined by different amino acids. Indeed, a computer modeling study suggests spatial differences between the binding sites of MAO A and B and that one amino xsacid can be responsible for the binding of some but not all substrates and inhibitors (31Veselovsky A.V. Ivanov A.S. Medvedev A.E. Biochemistry ( Mosc. ). 1998; 63: 1441-1446PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, according to a three-dimensional MAO model 3Johan Wouters, Belgium, personal communication. based on the recently crystallized polyamine oxidase (32Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Structure. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that shares a 20% amino acid identity with MAO, Phe-208 and Ile-335 in MAO A and their equivalents in MAO B, Ile-199 and Tyr326, have adjacent side chains within a region close to the isoalloxazine moiety of the FAD. This suggests that the overall three-dimensional structure of human and rat MAOs may be similar but that specificity may be determined by different amino acids within the binding domain. MAO A and B may have similar amino acids involved in the active site; however, small variations in the three-dimensional structure result in different specificities. The other four mutants (A-T245I, B-I236T, A-D328G, and B-G319D) did not result in any marked differences in their specificities when compared with the wild types. However their kcat values for both 5-HT and PEA were lower than those of the parent enzymes. Among them, a large decrease in kcat was observed in the two MAO A mutants, A-T245I and A-D328G. This indicates that these amino acid residues interact either directly or indirectly with the active site. In summary, the present study identifies the corresponding amino acid pair Ile-335 and Tyr-326 as critical for the substrate and inhibitor specificities in human MAO A and B, respectively. Thr-245 and Asp-328 in MAO A and Ile-236 and Gly-319 in MAO A may interact with the active site but do not determine specificity."

The effect was observed under strong stimulation and was independent of EGF concentration. In addition, three mutants of class Ia PI3Ks were found to inhibit MAPK activation to an extent similar to their effect on Akt/protein kinase B activation. To determine the importance of PI3K lipid kinase activity in MAPK activation, we have used the phosphatase PTEN and the pleckstrin homology domain of Tec kinase. Overexpression of these proteins, but not control mutants, was found to inhibit MAPK activation, suggesting that the lipid products of class Ia PI3K are necessary for MAPK signaling. We next investigated the location of PI3K in the MAPK cascade. Pharmacological inhibitors and dominant negative forms of PI3K were found to block the activation of Ras induced by EGF. Upstream from Ras, although association of Grb2 with its conventional effectors was independent of PI3K, we have observed that the recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 required PI3K. Because SHP2 was also essential for Ras activation, this suggested the existence of a PI3K/SHP2 pathway leading to the activation of Ras. In addition, we have observed that the docking protein Gab1, which is involved in PI3K activation during EGF stimulation, is also implicated in this pathway downstream of PI3K. Indeed, the association of Gab1 with SHP2 was blocked by PI3K inhibitors, and expression of Gab1 mutant deficient for binding to SHP2 was found to inhibit Ras stimulation without interfering with PI3K activation. These results show that, in addition to Shc and Grb2, a PI3K-dependent pathway involving Gab1 and SHP2 is essential for Ras activation under EGF stimulation.

Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The mechanisms leading to their activation by ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases appear well understood and the GTPase Ras plays a central role (2McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates its receptor tyrosine kinase, which autophosphorylates, creating binding sites for SH2-domain containing proteins, including the adapter proteins Shc and Grb2. In addition to its SH2 domain, Grb2 binds through its SH3 domains to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. Thus, the binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated EGF receptor (EGFR) results in the recruitment of Sos to the plasma membrane and has been proposed as a model for activation of membrane-bound Ras (3Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF-induced activation of Ras may be transduced via Shc, which binds to activated EGFR and becomes phosphorylated, creating an additional binding site for Grb2 (4Pelicci G. Lanfracone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Once Ras has been activated by Sos, GTP-bound Ras stimulates the serine/threonine kinase Raf. Activated Raf stimulates the downstream kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates ERK. In addition, activation of ERK under EGF stimulation can be mediated by Ras-independent pathways, through protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium-mediated mechanisms (5Burgering B.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) also transduce proliferative signals. PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the 3′-position of the inositol ring, and their major lipid product is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is produced during cell stimulation by various mitogens (6Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 7Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Three classes of PI3Ks have been defined, and class I enzymes are involved in mitogen signaling. The members of the subclass Ia include the catalytic subunits p110α, p110β, and p110δ associated with a regulatory subunit p85 and activated through protein tyrosine kinases, and subclass Ib is represented by p110γ, which is activated by heterotrimeric G proteins. On a functional point of view, subclass Ia PI3Ks are required for growth factor-induced mitogenesis (8Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 9Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was recently reported that embryos of p110α knockout mice die at early age due to a profound proliferative defect (10Bi L. Okabe I. Bernard D.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10963-10968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which PI3Ks activate signaling pathways have been recently unraveled. PIP3 has binding affinity for a conserved peptidic sequence called the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, thereby inducing the localization of PH-domain-containing proteins to membrane-associated signaling complexes (6Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Several targets for PI3K lipid products have been proposed, including the proto-oncogene product Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and its upstream activators, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases. These kinases activate various enzymes that are important for cell growth, including the p70-S6 kinase and the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (6Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 7Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In addition, the catalytic subunits of PI3Ks possess an intrinsic protein kinase activity, which is involved in the down-regulation of their lipid kinase activity (11Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, at least in the case of p110γ, this protein kinase activity has been reported to participate to MAPK signaling, whereas its lipid kinase activity appeared not to be necessary (13Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although the model for growth factor-induced MAPK activation described above does not show an obvious role for PI3K, many reports have documented inhibition of MAPK activation by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (14Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Marra F. Pinzani M. DeFranco R. Laffi G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30495-30500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, recent data have suggested that the role of PI3K depends on signal strength and is in fact limited to weak activations. In Swiss 3T3 cells, PI3K was found to be required during stimulation induced by low, but not high, doses of platelet-derived growth factor (17Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In insulin-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells, the requirement for PI3K was reported to depend on the number of insulin receptors expressed on the cell surface (17Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similarly, in COS cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K were found to inhibit MAPK activation induced only by low doses of EGF (18Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). On a molecular point of view, two major mechanisms have been proposed to illustrate a possible involvement of PI3K in MAPK activation. One involves the ability of PIP3 to activate members of the PKC family, directly or via the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (19Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Anaja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Legood J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Activated PKC can then stimulate Raf (21Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The second involves the ability of p21-activated kinase, a downstream target of PI3K via Rac, to promote stimulation of Raf and MEK (22Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In the nontransformed cell line Vero, we have observed that various PI3K inhibitors block MAPK activation induced by EGF, independently of signal strength. This led us to show that a PI3K-dependent pathway involving Gab1 and SHP2 is required, in addition to Shc and Grb2, for the activation of Ras by EGF. Human recombinant EGF was from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies against Grb2, SHP2, and EGFR and monoclonal anti-Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against Gab1, Sos, Shc, p85, and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-phospho-ERK antibody was fromPromega. Monoclonal anti-pan Ras was from Oncogene Research. Monoclonal anti-His tag antibody was from Invitrogen, anti-HA tag was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and anti-T7 tag was from Novagen. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Vero cells (a monkey kidney cell line, ATCC CCL 81) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transfection experiments, cells in 60-mm plates were incubated 3 h with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg of total DNA, 6 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 6 μ of Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Before stimulation, cells were blocked overnight by serum starvation. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were stimulated for 5 min with 10 ng/ml EGF. Before stimulation, cells were incubated for 15 min with 100 nmwortmannin (Sigma Chemical Co.) or 25 μm LY294002 (BioMol) where indicated. Cells were scrapped off in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm orthovanadate. After shaking for 15 min at 4 °C, soluble material was incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h and washed three times with lysis buffer. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A plasmid encoding wild type HA-tagged p110β was kindly provided by Drs. P. Hu and J. Schlessinger (New York University) (24Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The kinase-inactive K805R mutant of p110β was obtained by replacing with arginine the lysine 805 present in the putative ATP binding site using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primer: 5′-GTTGGAGTGATTTTTAGAAATGGTGATGATTTACG-3′ (the changed nucleotide is underlined). The cDNA of Tec was cloned using RT-PCR (Superscript II, Life Technologies) from poly(A)+ RNA purified from the megakaryoblastic cell line Dami and inserted into pET21 (Novagen) to introduce a N-terminal T7 epitope tag. The cDNA of T7-Tec was then subcloned into pCI-neo (Promega) for mammalian expression. A construct encoding the N-terminal PH domain was obtained by deleting the fragment between the two StuI internal sites which encompasses the SH3, SH2 and kinase domains. The R29C mutant was obtained using the following mutagenic primer: 5′-CGCCCTTAAACTACAAAGAGTGCCTTTTTGTACTTACAAAGTCC-3′. The cDNA of Gab1 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Ullrich (Max Planck Institute, Germany). To generate the mutant of Gab1 defective for p85 binding (YF3), tyrosines 447, 472, and 589 were replaced with phenylalanines using the following primers, respectively: 5′-CTGGATGAAAATTTCGTCCCAATGAATC-3′; 5′-CAGGAAGCAAATTTTGTGCCAATGACTC-3′; 5′-CAGTGAAGAGAATTTTGTTCCCATGAACC-3′. The SHP2 binding site of Gab1 was mutated by replacing tyrosine 627 with phenylalanine using the following primer: 5′-GGAGACAAACAGGTGGAATTCTTAGATCTCGACTTAGA-3′. Gab1 deleted of the PH domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 104–694. In this mutant, translation is initiated on the second methionine at position 104. All Gab1 constructs have a C-terminal Myc tag. In addition, HA-tagged Gab1 was obtained by subcloning the entire coding sequence of wild type Gab1 into pcDNA-HA using polymerase chain reaction amplification. All the mutations were verified by sequencing. A construct encoding His/Myc-tagged ERK1 was obtained by subcloning ERK1 (kindly provided by Dr. E. vanObberghen, Nice, France) into pcDNA3.1-MycHis (Invitrogen). The constructs encoding HA-tagged PTEN and its G129E mutant have been already described (25Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The vectors encoding Δp85 and p110α-K802R mutants were kindly provided by Drs. W. Ogawa (University of Kobe, Japan) and M. Wymann (University of Fribourg, Switzerland), respectively. The plasmids encoding SHP2 and its catalytically inactive mutant (C/S) have been kindly provided by Dr. N. Rivard (Sherbrooke University, Canada). To measure activation of Akt/PKB, cells were cotransfected with 0.5 and 1.5 μg of DNA encoding HA-tagged Akt/PKB and the indicated effector, respectively. After stimulation, cells were scrapped off in lysis buffer, then subjected to HA immunoprecipitation using 12CA5 antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, then with kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with Histone 2B (Roche Diagnostics) and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (26Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To measure MAPK activation, cells were transfected with 1 μg of each DNA encoding ERK1-His and the indicated effector protein. After stimulation, cells were harvested in lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mm NaCl. Soluble material was incubated with 30 μl of ProBond Resin (Invitrogen), then washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mm imidazole, followed by washes with kinase buffer. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) was performed as described (27Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Dellarocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of MBP and histones was quantified using a PhosphorImager. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The recombinant Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 (kindly provided by Dr. F. R. McKenzie, Nice, France) was expressed as GST fusion protein inEscherichia coli and extracted using glutathione-Sepharose beads. To measure Ras activation, Vero cells were scrapped off in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 30 μg of GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and then boiled, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-pan Ras antibodies. To study the activation of Ras in transfected cells, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of each plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild type Ras (kindly provided by Dr. B. M. Burgering, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and the indicated effector. The GST-RBD pull-down assay was performed as above, except that immunoblots were revealed with anti-HA antibody. Membrane fractions were prepared as described (29August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scrapped off in hypotonic lysis buffer then Dounce-homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was dissolved in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the insoluble material was spun out. This was taken as the solubilized membrane fraction. By using anti-phospho-ERK immunoblotting, we have observed in Vero cells that the phosphorylation of ERK2 induced by 10 ng/ml EGF is abolished when cells are preincubated with wortmannin or LY2940002 (Fig. 1 A). Because the role of PI3K in ERK activation is thought to be limited to weak stimulations, we have measured the activation of transfected ERK1-His using an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig.1 B, treatment with 10 ng/ml EGF induced a >10-fold increase in ERK1-His activity, in agreement with the strong phosphorylation of endogenous ERK2 observed using anti-phospho-ERK immunoblotting. Preincubation of the cells with PI3K inhibitors reduced by over 80% the activation of purified ERK1-His. In addition, the requirement for PI3K appeared independent of EGF concentration, because wortmannin treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of endogenous ERK2 induced by 30 or 50 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1 C), To confirm these data obtained with pharmacological inhibitors, we have studied the ability of three PI3K mutants to inhibit ERK1-His activation in cotransfection experiments. In parallel, we have determined their efficiency to inhibit PI3K signaling by measuring their ability to interfere with the activation of Akt/PKB. This was achieved in cotransfection experiments with HA-Akt/PKB, followed by anin vitro kinase assay. First, cells were transfected with a form of p85α lacking the p110 binding site (Δp85), which is a widely used dominant negative mutant for class Ia PI3Ks (30Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of Δp85 almost completely inhibited the activation of ERK1-His induced by EGF. Because Δp85 contains SH2 and SH3 domains that might interfere with MAPK activation, we have tested catalytically inactive mutants of p110α (αK802R) and p110β (βK805R) subunits. Expression of these mutants was found to produce a partial inhibition of ERK1-His activation, the p110β construct being more efficient than p110α. However, these mutants also inhibited partially the activation of HA-Akt/PKB, and the p110β construct was more efficient (Fig.2 B). Thus, the ability of the PI3K mutants to inhibit MAPK activation was correlated to their capacity to interfere with PI3K signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that, in Vero cells stimulated with EGF, PI3K plays an essential role in MAPK activation. One important question regarding the involvement of PI3Ks in MAPK activation is the respective role of their lipid kinase and protein kinase activities, because PIP3 has been shown not to be necessary for p110γ-mediated activation of MAPK (13Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To define the importance of PI3K lipid products in EGF signaling, we have taken advantage of PTEN, a protein phosphatase that is also capable of dephosphorylating PI3Ks lipid products (25Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of PTEN inhibits ERK1-His activation induced by EGF. To determine whether the PTEN effect is due to its protein or lipid phosphatase activity, we have used as a control the “protein phosphatase only” mutant of PTEN (G129E), which does not interfere with PI3K signaling (25Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 31Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Vazquez F. Batt D.B. Perera S. Roberts T.M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Transfection of PTEN-G129E did not significantly inhibit ERK1-His activation, whereas this mutant was somewhat more expressed than wild type PTEN (Fig. 3). To confirm the importance of PI3K lipid products, we have used the PH domain of Tec as a competitor for binding to PIP3. Tec belongs to a family of tyrosine kinases containing a PIP3-sensitive PH domain (32Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E.

As shown in Fig. 3, expression of the Tec PH domain significantly inhibited ERK1-His activation induced by EGF. As a control, we have used the Tec PH domain containing the R29C mutation, which decreases the affinity of Tec kinases for PIP3 (32Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

Altogether, these results suggested that PIP3 produced during EGF stimulation is necessary for MAPK activation. We next investigated the location of PI3K function in the MAPK pathway. Considering that PI3K-dependent mechanisms have been proposed at the level of Raf and MEK (19Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Anaja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J.

Expression of dominant negative RasN17 was found to abolish ERK1-His activation induced by EGF (data not shown), indicating that MAPK activation is strictly dependent on Ras in Vero cells. Because MAPK activation also requires PI3K, we have determined whether PI3K was involved in the activation of Ras. This was achieved using a precipitation assay for activated Ras. Following cell stimulation and lysis, endogenous activated Ras was extracted using a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of Raf (RBD), which interacts specifically with GTP-bound Ras (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The amount of activated Ras in the GST-RBD pull-down assays was determined by anti-Ras immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment of Vero cells with 10 ng/ml EGF induced the coprecipitation of Ras with GST-RBD, and preincubation of the cells with wortmannin or LY294002 strongly inhibited this association, suggesting that PI3K is involved in Ras activation. To confirm this hypothesis, the activation of HA-tagged Ras was studied in cells cotransfected with dominant negative PI3Ks. As shown in Fig. 4 B, expression of Δp85 or p110β-K805R inhibited the amount of HA-Ras associated with the GST-RBD protein. Taken together, these results indicate that PI3K plays a critical role in the activation of Ras induced by EGF. Upstream from Ras, membrane translocation of Sos is thought to be the limiting event for Ras activation. To determine whether PI3K was involved in Sos redistribution, we have prepared membrane fractions from EGF-treated cells preincubated or not with PI3K inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the membrane enrichment of Sos induced by EGF was nearly abolished by PI3K inhibitors. In addition, overexpression of Sos was found to partially overcome the need for PI3K in ERK activation without increasing the basal activation of ERK1-His (Fig. 4 D). This suggested that PI3K was involved at the level or upstream of Sos. However, expression of constitutively activated PI3K (p110α-CAAX) was"

This is an unrecognized association, which was not explained by diet or medication. We hypothesized that pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6 coenzyme) was de-activated by l-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, the major intermediate that accumulates endogenously in hyperprolinemia type II. The proposed interaction has now been investigated in vitro with high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry at a pH of 7.4 and temperature of 310 K. Three novel adducts were identified. These were the result of a Claisen condensation (or Knoevenagel type of reaction) of the activated C-4 carbon of the pyrroline ring with the aldehyde carbon of pyridoxal phosphate. The structures of the adducts were confirmed by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. This interaction has not been reported before. From preliminary observations, pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid also condenses with other aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, and this may be a previously unsuspected generic addition reaction. Pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid is thus found to be a unique endogenous vitamin antagonist. Vitamin B6 de-activation may contribute to seizures in hyperprolinemia type II, which are so far unexplained, but they may be preventable with long term vitamin B6supplementation.

This analytical study was prompted by finding vitamin B6 deficiency in a child with hyperprolinemia type II (genetic classification McKusick 23591, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, available on the Web), a rare inherited disorder due to lack of the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12) (8Phang J.M. Yeh G.C. Scriver C.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1125-1146Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This association has not been reported before. Full clinical details of the case and diagnostic biochemistry have been reported previously (9Walker V. Mills G.A. Peters S.A. Merton W.L. Arch. Dis. Child. 2000; 82: 236-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, a previously healthy girl presented at 20 months of age with prolonged seizures and depressed conscious level in association with pneumonia. She was well nourished and usually had a normal mixed diet. Abnormalities of plasma and urine biochemistry were diagnostic of hyperprolinemia type II (8Phang J.M. Yeh G.C. Scriver C.R. Scriver C.R.

Plasma proline was 2690 μm (reference range 90–280 μm) and has remained high since (2290–2955 μm, six observations over 2 years). She recovered slowly over 5 days and was then healthy, except for a severe diaper rash during convalescence. Xanthurenic acid was found in her urine organic acid profile at presentation. We have not seen this tryptophan metabolite in other children's urine, and it indicated the possibility of vitamin B6 deficiency (1György, P., The Vitamins, 2nd Ed., Sebrell, W. H., Harris, R. S., II, 1968, 90, 104, Academic Press, Inc., New York.Google Scholar, 2McCoy E.E. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors Vol. I Vitamin B6. Pyridoxal Phosphate. Part B.

John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 421-447Google Scholar, 5Holtz P. Palm D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1964; 16: 113-178PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this by finding marginally low plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentrations (23.5 and 22.7 μm; reference range 24.3–81.0 μm) and barely detectable pyridoxic acid (1.0 and 2.7 μm, reference range 10.9–27.3 μm) in her plasma on two occasions when she was well (3 and 8 months after her illness) and a grossly abnormal response to tryptophan loading at 8 months after presentation (9Walker V. Mills G.A. Peters S.A. Merton W.L. Arch. Dis. Child. 2000; 82: 236-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The deficiency was not nutritional or due to ingestion of antagonistic drugs. We therefore proposed that the vitamin was de-activated by an interaction between pyridoxal phosphate (PP)1 (Structure FT1), the active coenzyme form of vitamin B6 (the keto [1k] tautomer), and l-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) (Structure FT2), the intermediate which accumulates in hyperprolinemia type II. (Structures FT1 and FT2). There was some foundation for this, because a chemical test for P5C is based on its reaction with 2-aminobenzaldehyde (10Vogel H.J. Davis B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 109-122Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This reagent, like pyridoxal phosphate, is an aromatic aldehyde. We have now investigated the proposed interaction in vitro using mass spectrometry (MS) and high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Preliminary NMR and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) studies confirmed a reaction between PP and P5C co-incubated in aqueous solution at physiological pH (7.4) and temperature (310 K). Three adducts were produced, which we have characterized and found to be novel. They result from a Claisen condensation (or Knoevenagel type of reaction) involving the pyridoxal phosphate carbonyl group and the activated C-4 carbon of the pyrroline ring. This reaction has not been reported before. The most common type of in vivo enzymatic reaction of PP is in transamination, the transfer of an α-amino group of an amino acid to the α-carbon atom of an α-keto acid (5Holtz P. Palm D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1964; 16: 113-178PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vogel, H. J., and Davis, B. D. (1952) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 74, 109-122Google Scholar). These reactions are reversible and involve the formation of Schiff bases as intermediates. Therefore, P5C is a unique endogenous pyridoxal phosphate antagonist. If this condensation occurs in vivo, as we propose, individuals with hyperprolinemia type II would have an increased vitamin B6requirement and be at risk of symptomatic deficiency. In preliminary observations we find that P5C also reacts with a range of aliphatic aldehydes and ketones and benzaldehyde at physiological pH. This condensation may be a newly recognized general reaction with activated carbonyls. dl-Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride double salt, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, 4-pyridoxic acid, pyridoxine, and pyridoxal hydrochloride were from Sigma, and acetophenone (99% pure), benzaldehyde, and aliphatic aldehydes were from Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Poole, UK). Deuterium oxide (D2O), deuterium chloride (DCl), and sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) were from Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd., Great Baddow, UK. Sodium-3-trimethylsilyl-1-[2,2,3,3-2H4]propionate (TSP) was from Fluorochem Ltd., Old Glossop, Derbyshire, UK, and diethyl ether (Analar) from BDH, Poole, Dorset, UK. Glassware for P5C preparation was acid-washed. The P5C was prepared from its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride double salt, using a method based on that of Mezl and Knox (12Mezl V.A. Knox W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) but modified by using a more concentrated starting solution of the hydrazine and a diethyl ether wash instead of toluene to remove excess acetophenone. Preparations made according to the published method were found by NMR to be contaminated with toluene and acetophenone, and P5C was polymerized. Thus a slightly modified method was adopted. To 40 mg of the hydrazine in a glass tube were added 2.0 ml of 0.25 m DCl and 8 ml (0.2 ml/mg hydrazine) of acetophenone. The mixture was shaken on a roller mixer for 30 min in a cold room at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the lower aqueous layer was transferred to a clean tube and washed with ∼8 ml of diethyl ether five times to remove acetophenone. Ether was removed from the aqueous extract by evaporation under nitrogen at room temperature. After adjusting the pH to 7.4 with NaOD, the extract was stored at 4 °C. NMR confirmed P5C to be present, with no evidence of polymerization or contamination with acetophenone. This is the first report of the NMR spectrum of P5C (shown in Fig. 3 B). Contrary to expectation (12Mezl V.A. Knox W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) we found that P5C was reasonably stable under these conditions, with no evidence of polymerization after 4 weeks of storage at room temperature. Different batches showed varying rates of degradation, and after 3 months each batch had degraded by ∼50–70% to a complex mix of monomeric substances. Pyridoxal phosphate (PP) (5 mg/ml in D2O) was adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOD, protected from light, and stored at 4 °C. NMR (see Fig. 3 A) confirmed the purity of the preparation and the 4:1 ratio of the keto to enol forms. Incubates of P5C and PP were prepared in two ways. In the earlier experiments, 250 μl of stock P5C was added to 5 mg of PP (solid) in a vial, the pH was adjusted immediately to 7.4 with NaOD, D2O was added to a volume of 1.5 ml, and the pH was readjusted to 7.4. In later experiments, aliquots of stock solutions of P5C and PP, both prepared at pH 7.4, were mixed and diluted appropriately with D2O, and the pH was readjusted to 7.4. The method of preparation did not influence the products of co-incubation. After incubation at 310 K for 24 h, the mixture was analyzed, initially using HPLC-MS (Fig. 2) and then NMR (Fig. 3 C, around 36 h after mixing). The solution was found to be reacting slowly at ambient temperature, and the reaction was monitored by 1H NMR over a period of 12 days. The mixture was then characterized by MS and1H NMR and heteronuclear NMR, including1H-13C correlation experiments HMQC and HMBC at 14.1 tesla (T) and 17.6 T. In addition, diffusion (13Stejskal E.O. Tanner J.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 288-292Crossref Scopus (6728) Google Scholar) and gradient nOe experiments (14Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar) were employed to distinguish the various components in the mixture. The structures were further confirmed by HPLC-NMR-MS. The mass spectra were obtained under positive and negative ionization conditions on a Micromass Platform II electrospray HPLC-MS system. The HPLC was carried out on an HP1100 (Hewlett Packard) system using a reverse phase C18 column (Phenomenex 100 × 2.0 mm) at ambient temperature. The eluents were water and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid added as an ion-pairing agent. An 8-min gradient from 100% water to 100% acetonitrile was employed, and the fractions were observed using a UV diode array detector followed by MS. Experiments were carried out at 750.3 MHz (1H) and 188.7 MHz (13C) on a Varian INOVA 750 (17.6 T) spectrometer and at 600.13 MHz (1H), 150.9 MHz (13C), and 242.9 MHz (31P) on a Bruker DRX600 (14.1 T) spectrometer. To 500 μl of each sample in a 5-mm NMR tube, 10 μl (10 μg) of 0.1% w/v TSP in D2O was added to enable accurate quantification and act as an internal shift reference. The one-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were carried out under conditions of full relaxation and good digitization to enable reasonable integration for quantification. The 90° pulses used were calibrated after tuning and matching the rf for each sample at the temperatures for which different measurements were taken. Typically 65,536 data points were acquired over a 16.02-ppm (9614 Hz at 600 MHz) spectral width or 131,072 data points over 16.0 ppm (12,001 Hz at 750 MHz) using a noesypresat (15Nicholson J.K. Foxall P.J.D. Spraul M. Farrant R.D. Lindon J.C. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 793-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) solvent suppression pulse sequence. A mixing time of 100 ms, together with 3 s of presaturation and an acquisition time of 3.4 s at 600 MHz or 5.3 s at 750 MHz, was employed. The gradient nOe experiments were done at 750 and 600 MHz using the same respective data tables as above, with mix times of 0.8–1 s and gradient ratios of 35:5:3:2:1 and from 2000 to 8000 transients per experiment. The diffusion experiments (Fig.4) were acquired as above at 750 MHz with the diffusion time fixed at 0.5 s. The gradient strength was ramped successively from 0.5 to 30.5 gauss/cm in increments of 2 gauss with 16 experiments each of 64 transients acquired with a repetition time of 5 s per transient. Two-dimensional experiments TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC were run at 750 MHz and 310 K (nominal, actual temperature was 311.4 K) in phase-sensitive mode, typically 2048 (or 4096 for HMBC) data points acquired over a 13-ppm spectral width in F2 (and F1 for the TOCSY homonuclear experiment), the proton dimension, and 200 ppm in F1 for the carbon dimension. The TOCSY experiment was carried out with 32 transients for each of 256 increments using a spin lock period of 60 ms and a relaxation delay of 1.5 s, during which the HOD signal was pre-saturated to reduce the dynamic range. A total of 256 transients at a pulse repetition rate of 0.5 s per scan for each of 128 increments in the HMQC, and 440 transients (pulse repetition rate equal to 1.5 s) for 256 increments in the HMBC experiment were employed. Globally optimized alternating-phase rectangular decoupling of the carbon frequencies was employed in the HMQC experiment. Cosine window functions were used in the F2 (acquisition dimension) and linear prediction to 1024 complex data points (coefficients optimized for each experiment) with no window function applied in the F1 dimension, prior to Fourier transformation. The phosphorus spectra were acquired at 242.9 MHz (14.1 T) with and without proton decoupling {1H} using 65,536 data points over 50 ppm with 640 transients for both experiments, employing 90° pulses at a pulse repetition time of 4.7 s. An external reference of phosphoric acid was used for calibration and set to 0 ppm. A line broadening of 1 Hz was used in the exponential multiplication window function to increase the apparent signal to noise prior to Fourier transformation. The carbon spectra were acquired with Waltz-16 (12̄3) decoupling of the protons. A 250 ppm spectral width with 131,072 data points and 102,000 transients (51 h) at a repetition rate per scan of 1.8 s yielded a low signal-to-noise spectrum at 150 MHz. The sample was concentrated to 160 μl of volume and run on a 3-mm dual 13C/1H probe at 188.69 MHz. After 40,000 transients at 310 K (nominal, actual temperature was 311.8 K) and a pulse repetition time of 2 s, the spectrum shown as the F1 projection trace in Fig.5 was obtained. With gradient elution, HPLC-NMR was carried out using a Bruker LC-22 HPLC system. The mobile phase was pumped at 1 ml/min through a C18 reverse phase column (Phenomenex 250 × 4.6 mm) at 25 °C. The eluents were D2O and CH3CN (ACN) each with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid added, starting with 100% D2O decreasing to 60% D2O and 40% ACN over 25 min, followed by a 2-min 100% ACN purge flush before returning to 100% D2O. The eluting fractions were detected by UV (Bischoff Lambda 1000) at 254 nm, and the absorption was used as a delayed trigger to stop the pump when the fraction had flowed into the NMR probe cell. The 1H NMR at 600 MHz was measured while the flow was stopped. The pulse sequence was noesypresat with double-solvent suppression and ACN 13C satellite decoupling. A selective-shaped rf pulse was employed, with frequency adjusted to the ACN at the center of the spectrum (2 ppm also used as internal reference) and to the residual HOD signal, which reduced its shift value with increasing ACN concentration during the gradient elution. Shape selective gradient shimming of the ACN signal was used to maximize the magnetic field homogeneity. The number of transients taken varied from 128 to 1024 for the different fractions, prior to continuing the HPLC pump and moving on to the next peak in the UV. The number of scans depended upon the fraction's concentration and the signal-to-noise ratio achieved between 5 and 11 ppm. Each fraction was collected post-NMR using a Foxy Junior fraction collector and was then run on a Micromass Platform Q-TOF in positive ion electron impact conditions for accurate mass measurement. Erythromycin was co-injected, and the ion atm/z = 734.4690 used as the lock reference mass. The initial analysis was by MS of the mixture, arising from a 24-h incubation at 310 K of 1 ml of P5C and 1 ml of PP solution (Fig. 2). Three new quasimolecular ions (M − H)− were observed at m/z = 297, 341, and 359 Da by negative ion electrospray, in addition to the expected quasimolecular ions for P5C at m/z = 112 and PP atm/z = 246 Da. The initial 1H NMR spectrum at 600 MHz (Fig. 3 C, after 36 h of reaction) of the same solution at 298 K showed several products in addition to the two starting components. In an attempt to analyze these components in situ, while the reaction was still ensuing, a series of diffusion (13Stejskal E.O. Tanner J.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 288-292Crossref Scopus (6728) Google Scholar) experiments were conducted at 750 MHz for maximum shift dispersion. The mixture was partially resolved into its component parts, termed Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY) (16Gibbs S.J. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar, 17Barjat H. Morris G.A. Smart S. Swanson A.G. Williams S.C.R. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; 108: 170-172Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 4. The technique relies upon the individual species having different diffusion coefficients, which often vary with the size of the molecule. Hence, for neutral compounds, a separation of each compound's spectrum along the diffusion axis occurs with increasing molecular mass. However, if there is molecular association of any kind, the diffusion coefficient of the associated components will change and the above progression no longer holds. The products were obviously the result of reaction of P5C and PP, because signals with similar shifts and couplings were observed. The question was, what structures did they have? The lack of any additional aldehyde proton signals around 9.5–10.5 ppm indicated that reaction had occurred at that site on the PP. The appearance of a finely coupled triplet of doublets at δ 6.93 suggested an olefinic proton with three remote coupling partners. A series of one-dimensional TOCSY experiments established that these were a pair of double, double doublets (ddd) at δ 2.36 and δ 2.75 and a finely coupled doublet at δ 8.09. The former were a geminal methylene pair and the latter an olefinic proton β to a hetero-atom, similar to H5 in P5C. These signals, when carefully integrated and compared with the signal at δ 6.93, were present at equimolar equivalents to one another. The diffusion spectra revealed that a significant set of signals was hidden under the water signal at δ 4.77. The sample was therefore heated to 310 K, causing the water signal to shift to a higher field and the multiplets thus became observable in the one-dimensional noesypresat spectrum. They integrated for a total of three protons when compared with the new doublet at δ 8.09. At this point a series of heteronuclear experiments were measured, first on 31P to establish the presence of the phosphate group. Three clearly distinguishable triplets were observed, the largest at the lowest field δ 5.19 was attributed to the unreacted PP. The other two triplets at δ 5.02 and δ 5.08 were clearly new phosphate-containing molecules. Other signals were present but were overlapped by the major and minor components or at too low a concentration to be observed at the signal-to-noise level achieved. The next step involved acquisition of an HMQC and HMBC1H-13C correlated set of two-dimensional spectra (Fig. 5). The identity of the reaction products was deduced by combination of the two data sets. The coupled network of five carbons connected to the geminal methylene pair corroborated the earlier one-dimensional evidence and confirmed the olefinic functionality. The possibilities for the reaction products were thus narrowed down to one site of reaction on the P5C, namely the C-4 carbon. The other possibilities arising from either isomers of P5C or the ring opened form dl-glutamic-γ-semialdehyde (the latter would involve addition of the amine to the aldehyde of PP to form a Schiff base) were all excluded on the basis of the coupling network observed from the TOCSY and HMBC experiments. The proposed new Structures 3a and 3b would have resulted from an addition of the C-4 carbon to the aldehyde of PP, reminiscent of the Knoevenagel reaction, with the imine function of P5C behaving like the carbonyl in the more usual ketone-aldehyde reaction. Following the condensation, elimination of water formed an olefin with two possible stereoisomers, one of which turned out to be the major product with a molecular mass of 342 Da. Distinction between these isomers was achieved using double-pulse field gradient nOe (14Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar) experiments as shown in Fig.6 B. Selective inversion of the resonance at δ 6.93 resulted in a positive enhancement of the signals at δ 8.09 and δ 4.76, thus proving that the major product isomer had the configuration as shown in Structure 3a.Figure 6One-dimensional-TOCSY (A) of selective perturbation of the signals at δ 2.75 and one-dimensional proton nOe difference spectra irradiating signal at δ 6.93 (B) compared with the mixture 1H spectrum (C) at 600 MHz.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The other new components observed in the spectra were characterized in the same way. The precursor to Structures 3a and 3b was Structure FT4 and was steadily converted to the olefins (Structure FT3) on standing. Structure 4's molecular mass was 360 Da. The spectrum in Fig. 3 C was not definitive, because there are three chiral centers, and the eight diastereoisomers are paired into four NMR distinguishable structures. The spectrum obtained by HPLC-NMR established the presence of two NMR-distinguishable structures. The multiplets at δ 4.84 and δ 4.91 and their coupled partners from the one-dimensional TOCSY at δ 2.11, ∼δ 2.3 (obscured by methyls), and δ 7.99 suggested the presence of two of the diastereomeric structures represented by Structure FT4. We have found no evidence of the formation of the remaining two possible diastereoisomers, possibly because these are also transient products present at even lower concentrations than their isomers. From the NMR data obtained, we are unable to assign the stereochemistry of the observed diastereoisomers. The third (minor) component consisted of the compounds withm/z of 297. Their identities were more difficult to prove, because they were present at low concentration. However, the HPLC-NMR-MS resolved them satisfactorily and confirmed their structures that of Structure FT5. The key information was the absence of any signal between 4 and 5 ppm and the presence of two mutually coupled pairs of methylene groups. Two isomeric forms of this compound were observed, the E andZ forms. However, owing to the small quantity (∼2 μg) present in the mixture, it was not feasible to prove which was the major isomer. The observed chemical shifts and coupling constants for the various components identified in the mixture at 310 K after 12 days of reaction are listed in Table I.Table IAnalysis data of reactants and productsKey to abbreviations: b, broad; c, complex; d, doublet; m, multiplet; nd, not detected; o, obscured; q, quartet; s, singlet; t, triplet.

Concentrations of compounds in the reaction mixture after 36 h of incubation were PP 6.9 mm, P5C 4.6 mm, and the three products 1.14 mm (Structure 3a), 0.23 mm(Structure 3b), and 1.50 mm (Structure FT4). To discover whether the same reactions occur at lower concentrations (closer to those expected in vivo), aliquots of each stock solution were diluted 10-fold with D2O, mixed, and again incubated at 310 K. This reaction was monitored by 1H NMR and MS and confirmed that products were formed with similar chemical shifts in the1H NMR and quasimolecular ions of the same mass as those observed in the reaction at the higher concentration. We incubated P5C with a range of aldehydes and ketones and successfully formed condensation products with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, benzaldehyde, pyruvic aldehyde, glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid (methyl glyoxylic acid), acetoacetic acid, 2-oxobutyric acid, and oxaloacetic acid. New products were confirmed by gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) of their trimethylsilyl (tms) derivatives. The first seven of these (all aldehydes) had products with the molecular mass predicted for di-tms derivatives. The second group of four acids had tri-tms, and the last, oxaloacetic acid, had a tetra-tms derivative of the corresponding P5C/carbonyl adduct (comparable with Structure FT4 for P5C/PP). The key product was the acetoacetic acid/P5C adduct, molecular mass 432 Da, for the tri-tms derivative. We found the latter in the first urine sample collected from the child at the time of her acute illness. This specimen showed moderate ketonuria (4 mm) upon stick testing. The characterization of this adduct and others, will be the subject of a separate publication. Vita"

A series of quantum chemical calculations on the water-nicotinamide adduct showed that the puckering of the pyridine ring in the crystal structures can only be reproduced when the water is considered a hydroxide ion. These observations provide fundamental insight into the enzymatic activation of NADH for hydride transfer. liver alcohol dehydrogenase 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol reduced nicotinamide Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD(H) is the most abundant electron carrier in cell metabolism. It exists in an oxidized (NAD+) and a reduced (NADH) form, and both species are stable under physiological conditions. Its capacity as a redox agent is exploited by numerous enzymes that catalyze reactions in which NAD+ is reduced to NADH and vice versa. The interconversion of NAD+ and NADH is achieved by the transfer of a hydride ion (two electrons and a proton) between a substrate and NAD(H). A study on deuterated model compounds has shown that the hydride carrier is the C-4 atom on the pyridine ring of the nicotinamide and that the transfer process is stereospecific (Ref.1Loewus F.A. Westheimer F.H. Vennesland B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 5018-5023Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Theoretical calculations on the nicotinamide indicated that deformation of the pyridine ring into a boat conformation enhances hydride transfer (2Almarsson O. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2125-2138Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been observed by UV-visible spectroscopy and NMR that the puckering of the pyridine ring changes upon enzyme binding (3Burke J.R. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13220-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Until now it was unclear how an enzyme could steer the puckering of the ring to facilitate hydride transfer. Here, we present for the first time an example of enzymatic activation of NADH as it was found in a complex of NADH with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH; EC.1.1.1.1).1 LADH is an NAD(H)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar). It belongs to the Class I of the alcohol dehydrogenase family (5Jörnvall H. Persson B. Jeffrey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which also contains yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and the human zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. The yeast enzyme is the key mediator of alcohol production, whereas the human enzyme cleanses the blood from poisonous compounds. Other functions that have been assigned to the human enzyme are the involvement in the hormonal household by switching on and off steroids like testosterone. It has been associated with the production and neutralization of free radicals, thereby protecting the organism against DNA damage (6Mantle D. Preedy V.R. Adverse Drug React. Toxicol. Rev. 1999; 18: 235-252PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, alcohol dehydrogenase is thought to play a role in the development of the organism through retinoid regulation (7Foglio M.H. Duester G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that regulate the expression of various genes involved in embryonic growth. It has been observed that heavy drinking leads to retarded growth and night blindness. This can be explained by the fact that the continuous oxidation of ethanol interferes with the reduction of carotene to vitamin A. LADH is a homodimer with 374 residues and two zinc sites in each monomer. One zinc is thought to play a structural role, and the other forms the core of the active site. The latter is liganded to two cysteine residues (Cys46 and Cys174) and a histidine (His67). The x-ray structure of the apo-enzyme indicated that the fourth metal ligand was a water molecule (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar). The enzyme has been the focus of intensive studies involving kinetics, x-ray crystallography, and spectroscopic methods (8Bertini, I., Luchinat, C., Maret, W., and Zeppezauer, M. (eds) (1986) Zinc Enzymes, pp. 377-492, Birkhauser, StuttgartGoogle Scholar). Much is known about the kinetics of the assembly of the enzyme-cofactor complex (9Adolph H.W. Kiefer M. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8743-8754Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but the actual mechanism for hydride transfer and proton release is still under debate (10Northrup D.B. Cho Y.-K. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1621-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alternative reaction mechanisms have been proposed for LADH. In one of these (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar), LADH is regarded an exception among zinc-dependent enzymes in that no water molecule is involved in the reaction. This is the standard textbook description of the LADH mechanism (11Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 460-465Google Scholar). In the second mechanism (12Dworschack R.T. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the water molecule is linked to the zinc ion during the reaction and goes through a cycle of (de)protonation. This mechanism demands a five coordination around the metal. Such coordination of the metal is thought to be highly improbable, because a fifth ligand would cause collisions with surrounding residues (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar). EPR (13Maret W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9944-9949Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and NMR (14Sloan D.L. Young J.M. Mildvan A.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) on cadmium-substituted enzyme indicate the existence of a five coordinate intermediate. Unbound NADH displays an absorption maximum at 340 nm in the UV-visible range. When NADH is bound to LADH, the maximum shifts to 325 nm. Early on, it was proposed that this blue shift is caused by the formation of a bond between the catalytic zinc ion and the nicotinamide (16Mahler H.R. Douglas J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 1159-1166Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This proposal was discarded after elucidation of the 3 Å resolution x-ray structure of the NADH-LADH complex because it was concluded that the distance between the zinc ion and the nicotinamide was too long. To access the minute structural changes that an enzymatic environment might impose on NAD(H), it is necessary to collect structural data at a truly atomic level. Atomic resolution x-ray data provide an accuracy in atomic positions in the range of 0.03 Å (17Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and detailed features of the active site of the protein structure become visible that are lost at lower resolution. Once the precise positions of all the atoms that are essential for the reaction to proceed are known, detailed theoretical studies can be launched to unravel the reaction mechanism.

A cadmium-substituted enzyme was complexed with MPD and NADH and is further referred to as the Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex. The Zn-MPD-NADH-LADH complex was crystallized with polyethylene glycol 400 at a concentration of 20% in 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.2 with 0.5% MPD present. The Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex was crystallized by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and stepwise addition of MPD up to a concentration of 12%. Subsequently, polyethylene glycol 400 was added as a cryoprotectant to a final concentration of 20%. Diffraction data were collected on the BW7B beamline at the EMBL Outstation Hamburg, DESY, from flash-cooled crystals, using an image plate from MAR X-ray Research GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). An additional data set was collected on the Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex at 277 K. Data were processed, merged, and scaled with the HKL suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The resolution of the x-ray data allowed the geometry of the nicotinamide of NADH to be freed from restraints to get an accurate picture of the puckering of the pyridine ring. No restraints were applied either to metal-ligand distances. The Cd-MPD-LADH-NADH complex collected at 277 K was refined using the cryo structure as a starting model. Because of the low number of observations, it was not possible to release the restraints in the active site in this case. X-ray structure factor amplitudes and the derived atoms coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers R1HEUSF,1HEU, R1HF3SF, 1HF3, R1HETSF, and 1HET. Single crystal polarized absorption spectra were recorded at 283 K using a Zeiss MpM800 microspectrophotometer on a crystal placed in a quartz flow cell with the incident beam perpendicular to the face of the crystal (25Merli A. Brodersen D.E. Morini B. Chen Z. Durley R.C.E. Matthews F.S. Davidson V.L. Rossi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9177-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystal was oriented with either of the two principle optical directions parallel to the electric vector of the polarized light. The nicotinamide moiety was truncated in such a way that the oxygen connecting the ribose to the pyrophosphate group was replaced by a hydrogen. Starting coordinates for this nicotinamide moiety were taken from the Zn-MPD-NADH-LADH crystal complex, and the geometry was optimized at the Hartree-Fock level using the GAMESS (26Schmidt M.W. Baldridge K.K. Boatz J.A. Elbert S.T. Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Koseki S. Matsumaga N. Nguyen K.A. Su S.J. Windus T.L. Dupuis M. Montgomery J.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1993; 14: 1347-1363Crossref Scopus (19089) Google Scholar) software package with a 6–31+G** basis set. The hydrogen bonds that influence the geometry of the nicotinamide moiety were initially mimicked by fixing the dihedral angles XN and XAM (Fig. 1 a). A water molecule was placed at 1.7 Å from C-6 of the pyridine ring of the nicotinamide. The geometry of the nicotinamide moiety was optimized to fit the new conditions with constraints applied to the oxygen of the water molecule to keep the water in a fixed position relative to the pyridine ring as observed in the Zn-MPD-NADH-LADH x-ray structure. For the reduced nicotinamide system these calculations were then extended to further approximate the electronic environment of the nicotinamide moiety by the introduction of precalculated potentials placed at all hydrogen bonding positions. Fig. 1 b shows the enzyme hydrogen bonding environment in the crystal structure and the fragments used for the electronic potential calculations. Their potential, dipole, and quadropole moments were incorporated at fixed positions. Finally, the zinc atom was included in a similar manner together with the two SH groups and an ammonia mimicking its cysteine and histidine ligands in the crystal structure. X-ray data were collected to a resolution of 1 Å on native zinc LADH and the cadmium-substituted enzyme in complex with NADH and MPD (TableI). MPD was used as a precipitating agent during crystallization of the cadmium-substituted protein but only as a minor addition in case of the zinc enzyme. MPD formed an abortive complex in both cases. Two complexes were measured under cryogenic conditions. A separate data set was collected on the Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex at 277 K to a resolution of 1.95 Å that has shown that there were no gross structural changes in the active site induced by flash cooling. In both subunits of the Zn-MPD-NADH-LADH complex there is a residual density peak close to the C-6 atom of the nicotinamide (W1 in Fig.2 a and TableII). This peak is within inner coordination sphere distance of the catalytic zinc ion. Another peak of similar height and distance from the metal (W2) is also seen in both monomers. The second location corresponds to the position otherwise taken by a zinc-interating atom of a substrate (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar). The distance between the two peaks is 1.47 Å. In the Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex, the distances are essentially the same (Table II). In both monomers and in both complexes the W2 site is remote from the C-6 NADH atom. Similar peaks are observed in the active site of the Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH complex measured at 277 K. Accurate distances cannot be obtained from this structure as a result of the limited resolution.Table IIDistances (Å) between peaks W1 and W2 (as shown in Fig. 2a) and the key atoms in the active site of the Zn/Cd-MPD-NADH-LADH crystal structuresAtomW1W2Subunit ASubunit BSubunit ASubunit BC-6 NADH1.761.703.283.25Zinc2.232.252.122.11Oγ Ser482.752.702.702.76C-6 NADH1.771.933.683.85Cadmium2.442.412.292.36Oγ Ser482.622.862.652.64 Open table in a new tab The proton shuffling residue Ser48 is equidistant to both peaks in all complex structures. In each case, the pyridine ring of NADH is puckered in a twisted boat conformation. We interpret the two peaks together to represent a metal-bound water molecule occupying two alternative positions, partially forming an adduct with the pyridine ring of NADH. UV-visible spectra were recorded on crystals from the same batch as those used for x-ray data collection. Fig. 3 shows an absorption maximum at 325 nm typical for enzyme bound NADH. Subsequent treatment with substrates shows that the crystalline enzyme is active. This allows us to interpret the crystal structures in terms of the enzymatic reaction mechanism. Water involvement in (de)protonation reactions in LADH has played a central role in explaining pH dependences for enzymatic activity (27Kvassman J. Pettersson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In many other zinc enzymes (28Coleman J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the metal-bound water ought to be deprotonated to facilitate catalysis. Because of the fact that the water is disordered, it is not possible to assign its protonation state directly from the x-ray structure. To establish whether the adduct observed involves plain water or a hydroxide ion, quantum chemical calculations were performed on a nicotinamide model system (Fig. 1 b). Our calculations indicate that the pyridine ring structure is a highly sensitive system in terms of basis set and of its electronic environment. The system was initially modeled by fixing the two dihedral angles XN and XAM (Fig. 1 a) as described under ‘Experimental Procedures’ and presented in TablesIII andIV. The unperturbed oxidized nicotinamide (NIC+) and its adducts with H2O and OH− are essentially planar. The unperturbed reduced nicotinamide (NICH) shows some deviations from planarity. Pronounced puckering is seen in both NICH adducts. It can be seen in Fig.4 that the NICH-OH− mostly resembles the puckering observed in the pyridine rings of the crystal structures. Furthermore, an increase in bond length for C-5[en]C-6 is observed in the reduced NICH adducts.

Open table in a new tab The C-6 atom is positively charged in a reduced pyridine ring, thereby attracting the metal bound hydroxide. The charge on the C-4 atom remains relatively equal upon adduct formation, whereas the charges on the respective hydrogens HR and HS become increasingly negative. The bond order for the bond between C-4 and the leaving hydrogen, HR, decreases when the NICH-OH− adduct is formed, whereas the bond order increases for the C-4–HS bond. For the NADH-OH− adduct fixation of the two dihedral angles proved to be a valid approximation. The geometry of the system did not change when the constraints on the dihedral angles XN and XAM were released and hydrogen bonding network was introduced in the form of fragments. For the H2O adduct, the removal of the dihedral angle constraints resulted in significant deviations from the crystal structure. This is a possible indication that an NADH-H2O adduct is unlikely to acquire the observed crystal structure geometry. The introduction of zinc to the NICH-OH− system affected mainly the charge distribution, and the electronegativity of the HR hydrogen became more profound. Because the crystal structures considered here all contain NADH, we restrict ourselves to describe the implications of adduct formation for NADH oxidation and aldehyde reduction. The forward reaction will be ruled by the same mechanism of adduct formation, but NAD+might be oriented toward the water molecule in a different manner. No crystal structure of a binary LADH-NAD+ complex is available so far. In the reduced OH− ring adduct, the ProR hydrogen at the C-4 atom is in a pseudo-axial position. The bonding order of the C-4[–]HR bond decreases indicating a tendency for the ProR to leave according to the stereospecific requirements (Table IV). Based on the results of the calculations and comparison with the crystal structures, we suggest that OH− adduct formation is part of the activation process for hydride transfer from the reduced cofactor in the LADH-NADH complex. The hydrogen bonding between the nicotinamide moiety and the protein plays mainly a structural role of holding NADH in place. In Fig. 5 a revised reaction mechanism is proposed that is an extension of the ‘dissenting’ mechanism that incorporates the metal-bound water (12Dworschack R.T. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was expected that a five coordination of the metal leads to collisions with surrounding residues or with the cofactor NAD(H) (4Eklund H. Brändén C.I. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 73-143Google Scholar). As can be seen in the crystal structures presented here such a ‘collision’ is indeed observed. The revision of the mechanism alludes to the functional displacement of the water and the formation of a nicotinamide derivative. The metal-bound water alternates between two positions. The movement of the water/OH− is directed at the C-6 of the nicotinamide guided by Ser48. The formation of a nicotinamide derivative leads to a redistribution of electric charge along the ring, inducing hydride transfer. The (de)protonation of the alcohol goes through the metal-bound water. In this manner, the enzyme can influence the course of the reaction by changing the coordination chemistry of the metal and the proton flow toward the active site. The new reaction mechanism resolves controversy over spectroscopic data on the metal coordination during the reaction. Perturbed angular correlation of γ-rays measurements on the binary LADH-NADH complex revealed a mixed geometry of equal occupation (29Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Bjerrum M.J. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This would imply that already in the binary complex, water displacement and adduct formation occurs. Large shifts are observed in the metal spectra of cobalt-substituted (30Dunn M.F. Dietrich H. MacGibbon A.K.H. Koerber S.C. Zeppezauer M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and copper-substituted (8Bertini, I., Luchinat, C., Maret, W., and Zeppezauer, M. (eds) (1986) Zinc Enzymes, pp. 377-492, Birkhauser, StuttgartGoogle Scholar) enzymes upon NADH binding. These shifts can now be attributed to geometrical changes in the metal coordination sphere. The presence of a water molecule in the vicinity of the nicotinamide has been found in several other protein structures. In a complex of dihydrofolate reductase, folate, and NAD+ at a resolution of 1.6 Å (31Sawaya M.R. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 586-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), a water is situated at 3.2 Å of C2 of the pyridine ring. In a complex of ferredoxin reductase with NADP+ and FAD (32Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), a close interaction between a protein residue (Thr166) and the C-6 (3.2 Å) of the pyridine ring is found. The distances quoted here are from x-ray structures with a restrained geometry, which implies that all the atoms that are expected to be nonbonding are kept at a distance that is in agreement with a van der Waal's radius of 3.3 Å. Given sufficiently high resolution of the x-ray data, the release of such restraints might reveal other enzyme-coenzyme complex structures with close interactions between the pyridine ring and neighboring oxygen atoms. The work presented here highlights an essential aspect of the NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenation: the enzymatic activation of the cofactor. The combination of truly atomic resolution x-ray crystallography and quantum chemical calculations provided the opportunity to study enzymatic catalysis in unprecedented detail and enabled us to detect that NADH is indirectly linked to the catalytic metal ion. This observation is independent of the nature of the transition metal and the temperature of the environment. We propose that the link established by the enzyme activates the NAD(H) molecule to become involved in hydride transfer. Further atomic resolution x-ray studies and extended theoretical calculations on other dehydrogenases will certainly lead to a more complete understanding of NAD(P)-dependent hydride transfer.

Coexpression of each IL-1R chimera with each AcP chimera and an NF-κB-responsive reporter demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domains could be classified as IL-1R-like, AcP-like, or neither. Any IL-1R-like cytoplasmic domain could cooperate with any AcP-like cytoplasmic domain.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three structurally related cytokines have been identified; IL-1α1 and IL-1β are agonists that induce identical responses, whereas IL-1 receptor antagonist functions to block IL-1α and IL-1β activity. All known biological functions of IL-1 are mediated through the type I IL-1R (3Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F. Re F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K.

All three members of the IL-1 family have been shown to bind the type I IL-1R with high affinity, whereas IL-1β binds the type II IL-1R with high affinity and IL-1α and IL-1 receptor antagonist bind the type II IL-1R with a low affinity. The type II IL-1R contains a severely truncated cytoplasmic domain and acts as a decoy receptor (4Colotta F. Re F. Muzio M. Bertini R. Polentarutti N. Sironi M. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E.

Downstream of TRAF6 lie at least two independent pathways leading to transcriptional activation. First, TRAF6 has been shown to activate NF-κB through TGF-β activated kinase-1, NF-κB-inducing kinase, and IκB kinases (29May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

TRAF-6 also plays a role in IL-1-mediated activation of p38, Jun N-terminal kinase (p54), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p42/44), and ultimately AP-1 (31Ridley S.H. Sarsfield S.J. Lee J.C.

The one exception is SIGIRR, which contains only one putative Ig domain (10Thomassen E. Renshaw B.R. Sims J.E. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Conservation also exists within the intracellular region of these receptors, with several highly conserved regions having been shown to be critical for signaling (35Heguy A. Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Telford J.L. Melli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2605-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Although the cytoplasmic domains and downstream signaling events seem to be largely conserved with those of the IL-1R family, the Toll subfamily extracellular domains are dissimilar from the IL-1R family, containing multiple leucine-rich repeats. Toll itself is critical for the establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity and for antifungal defenses in Drosophila. The mammalian TLRs are similarly implicated in the innate immune response, based on their ability to induce critical immune modulators such as proinflammatory cytokines, effector cytokines, chemokines, and co-stimulatory molecules in response to conserved bacterial and fungal products (42Janeway C.A.

Events implicated in IL-1 signal transduction, such as recruitment of MyD88 and activation of NF-κB have also been shown to be critical for mammalian TLR signaling (38Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P.

We have identified, through examination of human genomic sequence deposited in public data bases, two novel IL-1R family members, which we have called TIGIRR-1 and TIGIRR-2. One of these receptors (TIGIRR-2) has recently been identified by others based on its mutant phenotype and called IL1RAPL (1Carrie A. Jun L. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.C. McDonell N. Couvert P. Zemni R. Cardona A. Van Buggenhout G. Frints S. Hamel B. Moraine C. Ropers H.H. Strom T. Howell G.R. Whittaker A. Ross M.T. Kahn A. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Marynen P. Chelly J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Full-length sequence and tissue distribution were determined for both receptors. Initial signaling experiments indicated that neither receptor could mediate NF-κB activation in response to IL-1 or IL-18. Chimeras consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane (extm) domain of the IL-1R and cytoplasmic (cyto) domain of TIGIRR-1 or IL1RAPL were similarly nonresponsive to IL-1. We therefore set out to devise a strategy to characterize more fully the signaling capabilities of novel IL-1R family members. Since both IL-1R and AcP share a high degree of homology, it is possible that any novel receptor may play a role similar to that of IL-1R (i.e.binding and signaling) or to that of AcP (i.e. affinity conversion, signaling). To delineate these possibilities and to verify that the receptor family members could be thus categorized, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors containing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of either IL-1R or AcP and the cytoplasmic domain of each IL-1R family member. Members of the two chimeric series were then coexpressed in every possible combination, along with an NF-κB-driven reporter plasmid, and IL-1-stimulated transcriptional activation was assessed. We were able to characterize all previously reported members of this family functionally as IL-1R-like (IL-1R, IL-18R, IL-1Rrp2, T1/ST2) or AcP-like (AcP, IL-18RAcP). TIGIRR-1 and IL1RAPL, however, failed to signal in either capacity, suggesting that they might form a novel IL-1R subfamily. Homology searches of GenBankTM revealed that six different, partly overlapping cosmids derived from the human X chromosome appeared to contain exons 4–12 of a novel IL-1R family member (exon 4 accession number Z74477; exon 5 accession number Z81144; exon 6 accession number Z69721; exon 8 accession number Z68330; exons 9 and 10 accession number Z68908; exons 11 and 12 accession number Z68328; exon numbering is by analogy to type I IL-1R (47Sims J.E. Painter S.L. Gow I.R. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). PCR amplification of human liver first strand cDNA, using primers from within the putative exons 4 and 12, gave a product of the expected size. Sequencing confirmed that the predicted exons had indeed been spliced into the same mRNA. By comparison with other members of the IL-1R family, the portion of the mRNA that we had identified lacked the coding sequence for the initiating methionine and the signal peptide. These were cloned using standard 5′-RACE techniques, with Marathon-ReadyTM human liver cDNA (CLONTECH) and a λgt11 human cerebellum library as templates. Once the putative full-length sequence for TIGIRR-1 was obtained, the entire sequence was amplified from human liver cDNA and several independent products were sequenced. A murine genomic library was screened using the human TIGIRR-1 sequence as a probe. A portion of a resultant clone from this screen was then utilized to screen a murine brain cDNA library, and several overlapping partial sequences were obtained in the clones identified. The murine TIGIRR-1 sequence was further verified by amplification from a murine liver library. TIGIRR-2/IL1RAPL exons were initially predicted from sequence contained in GenBankTM accession numbersAL031575 (exons 4–6) and AC005748 (exons 10–12) (numbering by analogy with the IL-1R gene structure (47Sims J.E. Painter S.L. Gow I.R. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). A spliced product could be obtained from human brain cDNA by PCR amplification. cDNA sequence to the 5′ side of exon 4 was obtained via 5′-RACE using Marathon-ReadyTM human testis cDNA according to the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The full-length sequence was subsequently amplified by PCR from ovary cDNA for sequence verification and subcloning. Normal and cancer cell line human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH and Biochain Institute, Inc. (San Leandro, CA). The blots were hybridized overnight with a32P-labeled TIGIRR-1 riboprobe in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide at 63 °C and then washed at 63 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Similar blots were probed with IL1RAPL riboprobes under the same conditions, except hybridization was carried out at 68 °C and the most stringent wash was in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. After exposure, the blots were rehybridized with a random prime-labeled probe against β-actin for standardization. An exhaustive panel of human cDNAs (Human Immune System Panel, Human Panel I, Human Panel II) was purchased fromCLONTECH, and both TIGIRR-1-specific and IL1RAPL-specific primers were used for amplification under standard PCR conditions (35 cycles unless otherwise noted). Full-length human and murine TIGIRR-1 were generated by PCR and cloned into pDC409 (48Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Full-length human IL1RAPL was subcloned into pDC304, a variant of pDC302 (49Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L.

The NF-κB-luciferase plasmid has been described previously (50Mitchell T. Sudgen B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A panel of chimeric expression vectors was created by first generating IL-1Rextm and AcPextm cassette vectors, both in pDC304. The IL-1Rextm cassette vector contained amino acids 1–362 of murine IL-1R, with a BglII site causing a single amino acid substitution (KVF to KIF) just inside the transmembrane region (36Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The AcPextm cassette vector contained amino acids 1–381 of murine AcP with a BstZ17 site created by introducing a silent mutation (see also Table I).

For the generation of chimeric murine IL-1Rrp2 constructs, we cloned the murine IL-1Rrp2 sequence by direct PCR amplification and subsequent RACE amplification of murine brain and kidney cDNAs or libraries. At this time, we also cloned the human IL-1Rrp2 sequence and found the C terminus of the encoded protein to differ from the GenBankTM entry (U49065) by a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 1767. This frameshift results in a slightly larger protein, in which the last 18 amino acids of the previous GenBankTM entry are replaced with the sequence PPVQLLQHTPCCRTAGPELGSRRKKCTLTTG. We amplified the human IL-1Rrp2 mRNA from several different sources and repeatedly isolated this sequence. We have therefore also deposited this revised human IL-1Rrp2 sequence. Human TIGIRR-1 and IL1RAPL were used in the chimeras, but we and others (1Carrie A. Jun L. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.C. McDonell N. Couvert P. Zemni R. Cardona A. Van Buggenhout G. Frints S. Hamel B.

COS7 (monkey kidney) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal bovine serum, and S49.1 (murine T) cells were grown in RPMI 1640/5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. COS7 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described (51Cosman D. Cerretti D.P. Larsen A. Park L. March C. Dower S. Gillis S. Urdal D. Nature. 1984; 312: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), using 10 ng of each receptor, 50 ng of the reporter plasmid, and enough empty expression vector to yield a total of 1 μg of DNA per 4.5 × 104 cells. Two days post-transfection, cells were blocked for endogenous IL-1R signaling by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with sheep anti-human IL-1R antiserum (36Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E.

Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assessed using Reporter Lysis Buffer and Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega, Madison WI). All results reported represent at least two independent transfections. S49.1 cells (1 × 107) were electroporated (320 V, 960 microfarads) with 30 μg of reporter DNA and 10 μg each of receptor-encoding DNA. Following electroporation, cells were diluted in fresh medium and aliquoted to five individual wells. After 2 days, cells were stimulated with phosphate-buffered saline (one well), IL-1α (two wells), or IL-1β (two wells), and luciferase levels were measured as described above. All results reported represent at least one electroporation, which was split and then stimulated and assayed in duplicate. Due to the low level of transfection efficiency by electroporation in the S49.1 cells, we were technically unable to demonstrate surface expression of all chimeras in these cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The inability to detect recombinant receptor expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting is probably due to two factors. The number of cells successfully transfected is quite low, and therefore it is difficult to detect those cells in the background of the nontransfected cells, even when the analysis is done by two-color sorting. Second, the level of receptor expression in the cells that are transfected is probably quite low due to the fact that there is no mechanism for plasmid amplification in these cells. IL-1 signaling is possible with only a small number of receptors per cell, so whereas our expression is sufficient for signaling studies, it is probably insufficient for detection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (52Orencol"

The increase of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in response to a stimulus results from the opening of Ca2+ channels present in the plasma membrane and in the membranes of intracellular Ca2+stores, mainly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 It has more recently also become clear that the Ca2+ stored in the lumen of many intracellular compartments not only serves as a reservoir of releasable Ca2+, but also plays a regulatory role in several important cell biological functions. Luminal Ca2+ in the ER as well as in the Golgi or other components of the secretory pathway is required for the proper translation, translocation, folding, and processing of secreted proteins (for review, see Ref. 1Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A sufficiently high level of intraorganellar Ca2+ has been implicated also in intra-Golgi membrane transport (2Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), transport between the Golgi and the ER (3Ivessa N.E. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Gravotta D. Sabatini D.D.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Besides these constitutive actions, luminal Ca2+ controls movements of the Ca2+ ion itself: its release from the intracellular stores, its permeability through the nuclear pore complexes, and capacitative Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 5Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The pivotal role of the ER as a Ca2+ store is well established. There is a growing consensus that also the Golgi apparatus can function as an agonist-releasable Ca2+ store (6Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the importance of which may, however, greatly differ among the different cell types and ranges from relatively unimportant in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells (7Yagodin S. Pivovarova N.B. Andrews S.B. Sattelle D.B. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to very important in renal LLC-PK1 cells (8Zha X. Chandra S. Ridsdale A.J. Morrison G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1133-C1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The storage capacity for Ca2+ in the Golgi is greatly increased by specific proteins like Calnuc/nucleobindin (9Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast to the growing unanimity on the role of Golgi as a Ca2+ store, there remains some confusion as to the type of Ca2+-accumulation system responsible to replenish the store. Ca2+ pumps belonging to the class of P-type ion-motive ATPases have been proposed to take up this task: SERCA2 (6Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,10Lin P. Yao Y. Hofmeister R. Tsien R.Y. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the plasma-membrane Ca2+ pump PMCA en route to the plasma membrane (12Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howel K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and PMR1 (6Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 13Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Clarke D. Shull G.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7600-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The SERCA pumps, which are encoded by three different genes in vertebrates (human gene names:ATP2A1–3), but apparently only by a single gene in invertebrates like C. elegans, are the best characterized members of this class and are responsible for the accumulation of Ca2+ into the ER or into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The PMCA Ca2+ pumps (corresponding human gene names:ATP2B1–4) responsible for the extrusion of Ca2+out of the cell, also belong to the same class but are themselves not involved in Ca2+ transport into the stores, with as a possible exception the above mentioned Golgi-based PMCA pumps which are on their way to the plasma membrane. The PMR1-type of Ca2+-transport ATPases was first identified in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. Le Vitre J. Davidov J.S. Mao J.L. Moir D.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 133-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and localized to the Golgi or one of its subcompartments (15Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Genes homologous to the S. cerevisiae PMR1 have been reported for a number of other fungi (see Ref. 16Benito B. Garciadeblás B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and references therein). The PMR1 ion-motive ATPase supplies the secretory pathway with Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions required for glycosylation, sorting, and ER-associated protein degradation (17Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated capacitative Ca2+ entry in S. cerevisiae, a mechanism that in higher eukaryotes is thought to be initiated by depletion of intracellular stores that are filled by the SERCA Ca2+ pump (19Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The process was stimulated inpmr1 mutants, indicating that in yeast capacitative Ca2+ entry in combination with PMR1 activity supplies the secretory pathway with Ca2+. Yeast pmr1 mutants do not grow on a medium containing submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and show defects in the maturation of secretory proteins which are suppressed by supplying millimolar Ca2+or micromolar Mn2+ to the growth medium. Mutations inPMR1 were also reported to rescue yeast mutants, which as a result of the lack of superoxide dismutase, show impaired growth in aerobic conditions (20Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is ascribed to increased cytosolic levels of Mn2+ resulting from a lack of accumulation of the ion in the Golgi compartment. Mn2+ is known for its capacity to scavenge superoxide ions. Mandal et al. (21Mandal D. Woolf T.B. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23933-23938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) pointed recently to the critical role of transmembrane segment M6 in yeast PMR1 for defining the cation-binding sites in general and in particular of residue Gln783 in this segment for the Mn2+ selectivity. Relatively less is known on the PMR1 homologues in animal cells. The cDNA of the putative rat form of the yeast PMR1 was already cloned in 1992 with a SERCA-derived probe (13Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Clarke D. Shull G.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7600-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but the authors failed in their efforts to show that the corresponding protein, upon its expression in COS cells, was able to catalyze the uptake of Ca2+ into vesicles consisting of fragmented membranes. In the meanwhile homologous cDNAs or genes were reported for D. melanogaster, 2M. Adams and J. C. Venter, accession numberAC014929. 2M. Adams and J. C. Venter, accession numberAC014929. Bos taurus, 3T. A. Reinhardt and S. Prapong, accession number AF230532. 3T. A. Reinhardt and S. Prapong, accession number AF230532. and C. elegans. But again until now no direct indication that any of these was involved in Ca2+ uptake has been provided. However, indirect evidence comes from two recent reports which show that Hailey-Hailey disease (MIM 16960), which is manifested by the impaired intercellular adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes, results from mutations in one of the alleles of a human orthologue of yeastPMR1, the ATP2C1 gene (22Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein E.H. Nature Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 23Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C.

The symptoms of Hailey-Hailey disease strongly resemble those of Darier-White disease (MIM 124200) which is due to a mutation in one of the alleles of the SERCA2 gene ATP2A2. This, together with the observation that expression of the mammalian SERCA1a prevented the lethality of thepmr1-pmc1 double mutations in yeast (24Degand I. Catty P. Talla E. Thinès-Sempoux D. De Kerckhove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. Ghislain M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that the human PMR1 pump can act as a Ca2+ pump. We now show for the first time that an animal PMR1 homologue can transport Ca2+ or Mn2+ into the Golgi apparatus of COS-1 cells with high affinity and in a thapsigargin-insensitive manner. The accumulated Ca2+ can be released by IP3, in line with the view that the Golgi apparatus is an IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store. [γ-32P]ATP and 45Ca were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Roosendaal, The Netherlands), 54Mn from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Sequencing was done with the AutoRead™ 200 Sequencing Kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Sigma (Sigma/Aldrich NV, Bornem, Belgium) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit antibodies from Dako (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). The full-length rabbit SERCA1a clone was kindly provided by J. P. Andersen and B. Vilsen (University of Aarhus, Denmark). The EST clones yk218a11 and yk334d5 were obtained from Yuji Kohara's database, and sequenced. Both clones contained the complete open reading frame ofC. elegans PMR1. It should, however, be remarked that the open reading frame is 63 bp smaller than predicted in the database annotation (see “Results”). Clone yk334d5 was used to make an expression construct. The 3.2-kb PMR1-encoding EcoRI/XhoI fragment of yk334d5 was ligated into the dephosphorylated pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen Co., British Biotechnology Products Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom) cut with the same restriction enzymes. The pig SERCA2a expression vector has been described by Verboomen et al. (25Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The full-length rabbit SERCA1a was cloned in the pMT2 expression vector (26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For microsome preparation, COS-1 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per plate. For immunocytochemistry 2.0 × 104 cells were seeded on gelatin (1%)-coated coverslips. For 45Ca2+ or54Mn2+ fluxes 3.0 × 104 cells were seeded in gelatin-coated 12-well plates. For microsome preparation and immunocytochemistry, transfection was performed the day after seeding. For isotope fluxes the period between seeding and transfection was extended to 5 days to allow better attachment of the cells to the plates. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 60 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The immunogen was a recombinant protein corresponding to the putative large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 of C. elegansPMR1. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli using the QIAexpress Type IV System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In a first step the cDNA corresponding to the loop region was amplified by PCR with primers PMR1CYTF (5′-CAAGCATGCCGTGAAGAAGATGCCAGCAG-3′) and PMR1CYTR (5′-CTAGTCGACTTTTCCCTCCTCAATCGCC-3′) containing, respectively, a SphI and SalI restriction site at their 5′ end. The PMR1CYTF primer corresponds to nucleotides 26812–26831 of cosmid CECC4 (accession number Z81490) and PMR1CYTR primer to the inverse complement of nucleotides 136–154 of cosmid CEZK256 (accession numberZ82088). PCR was carried out for 20 cycles using the Expand™ Long Template PCR System from Roche Molecular Diagnostics. Each cycle consisted of 10 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 2 min of elongation at 68 °C. TheSphI/SalI-cut PCR fragment was ligated in theSphI/SalI sites of the pQE-31 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen), containing a 6xHis tag coding sequence 5′ to the cloning region. The expression of the recombinant protein inE. coli M15 cells was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purification of the 6xHis-tagged protein was achieved by a Ni-NTA agarose-based method as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of about 42 kDa in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and reacted with the monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (clone HIS-1, from Sigma, dilution 1:1000) on Western blots. In a last step the recombinant cytoplasmic loop was concentrated by CentriconTM Plus-20 centrifugal filtering (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Rabbits were immunized with 0.1 mg of recombinant protein in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline emulsified with 0.5 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections of the same immunogen with incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given at 4-week intervals. Preimmune serum and serum obtained after 4 boosters were used. The antiserum is designated as Celpmrloop. Total RNA was prepared from C. elegans with TriPure™ Isolation Reagent (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Thermoscript™ RT-PCR System (Life Technologies NV, Merelbeke, Belgium) using the modified oligo(dT) primer 5′-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGC(dT)10-3′ (27Cools J. Bilhou-Nabera C. Wlodarska I. Cabrol C. Talmant P. Bernard P. Hagemeijer A. Marynen P. Blood. 1999; 94: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of C. elegans Pmr1 was checked by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR using the AmpliTaq Gold™ PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Gouda, The Netherlands) and primer CePMR1For (5′-CCGACAATAAAGTAACACCACG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 1955–1976 of cosmid CEZK256, primer 468 (5′-GAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGC-3′) which partially contains the sequence of the modified oligo-(dT) primer, primer CePMR1Rev (5′-TGCTTCGGCTCAGTTTCTCC-3′) corresponding to the inverse complement of nucleotides 25104–25123 of cosmid CECC4, and SL1 primer (5′-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3′) and SL2 primer (5′-GGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG-3′), which contain the sequence of splice leaders SL1 and SL2, respectively. PCR amplifications were carried out for 30–35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50–58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. PCR fragments were gel-purified (QIAquick Gel Purification Kit, Qiagen) and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Several individual clones were sequenced. Microsomes were isolated from COS-1 cells as described by Verboomen et al. (25Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Membranes from C. elegans were isolated as described by Baylis et al. (28Baylis H.A. Furuichi T. Yoshikawa F. Mikoshiba K. Sattelle D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Denaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were done as described earlier (29Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown on 12-well plates. Loading with45Ca2+ and efflux were done essentially as described earlier (30Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.-B. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7238-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 10 min with 20 μg/ml saponin at 25 °C and loaded for the indicated lengths of time in 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaN3, 0.44 mm (for Ca2+ fluxes) or 0.1 mm (for Mn2+ fluxes) EGTA. MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2 were added to obtain a calculated free Mg2+ concentration of 0.5 mm and the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+ and Mn2+. Free concentrations of Ca2+ and Mn2+ were calculated based on the stability constants for EGTA and ATP given by Fabiato and Fabiato (31Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) (for Ca2+) and by Martell and Smith (32Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York, NY1974Google Scholar) (for Mn2+). Thapsigargin (2 μm) was added if inhibition of pumping by the SERCA Ca2+ pump was needed. Efflux was performed in 120 mm KCl, 30 mmimidazole (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EGTA. All experiments on Mn2+ transporting activity or Mn2+ effects on Ca2+ uptake activity were performed with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad, Eke, Belgium)-treated solutions. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out on ice in 100 μl of solution containing 15 μg of microsomal protein, 80 mm KCl, 17 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the indicated concentrations of total EGTA and free Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+. Thapsigargin was used at 0.1 μm. The reaction was started by adding 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP of 2 μCi/μl. After 20 s the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of ice-cold stop solution (6% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm phosphoric acid, 1 mm ATP). The mixture was left on ice for 0.5 h and centrifuged in the cold to precipitate the protein. The pellet was washed two more times in stop solution and once in 0.2 macetic acid-NaOH (pH 5.3). To test the sensitivity of the phosphoprotein to hydroxylamine, the samples were additionally incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 0.2 m acetic acid-NaOH with or without 0.2 m hydroxylamine. The samples were then dissolved in a modified SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis in acid gels as described by Sarkadi et al. (33Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were dried between gel drying sheets (Promega) and exposed to screens for quantification of the radioactive bands on a Storm840™ scanner in combination with the ImageQuantTMsoftware (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin at the indicated dilutions. The C. elegans genome is predicted to contain a single PMR1 orthologue on chromosome I, which is annotated ZK256.1 by the C. elegans sequencing consortium (34The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, Science, 282, 1998, 2012, 2018.Google Scholar). The genomic sequence can be found on the two overlapping cosmids CECC4 (accession number Z81490) and CEZK256 (accession number Z82088). Two EST clones from Yuji Kohara's database, yk218a11 and yk334d5, representing cDNA clones of the C. elegans PMR1 gene, were completely sequenced. The deduced C. elegans PMR1 protein would contain 901 amino acids instead of the 922 predicted in the database annotation (protein identification number CAB04015.1). This is because a sequence of 63 bp is wrongly assigned by the Genefinder program to the putative exon 8 (303 bp). We found this sequence to be absent from both cDNA clones (see Fig.1 A) and hence the actual protein should correspondingly be 21 amino acids shorter. Furthermore, it was clear from clone yk334d5 that the 5′ UTR of C. elegans PMR1 is at least 257 bp long and contains, besides exon 1, two extra exons, comprising only untranslated sequences and designated exon −1 and exon −3 for reasons discussed below (Fig. 1 B, second line). Exon 1 (399 bp) starts at position −87 relative to the ATG start codon, which corresponds to nucleotide 23653 on cosmid CECC4. Exon −1 (105 bp) and exon −3 (65 bp) correspond, respectively, to nucleotides 23111–23215 and 15957–16021. This implies that exon −3 is located more than 7 kb upstream from exon −1. EST clone yk218a11 does obviously not contain the entire 5′ UTR, as only the last part of exon 1 is represented in this clone. A comparison of the exon/intron layout of CePMR1 to that of the D. melanogaster (accession number AC014929) and human orthologues (gene ATP2C1, Refs. 22Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) shows that the human gene contains the most elaborate exon/intron layout, D. melanogaster the simplest, whereas C. elegans takes an intermediate position (Fig. 1 B). Apparently C. elegans and to a larger degree D. melanogaster have lost most of the introns during evolution. The worm and human have in total 5 conserved exon boundaries, the worm and the fly only one. The localization of the exon 5/6 boundary in CePMR1 corresponds to the exon 1/2 boundary in D. melanogaster and to the exon 18/19 junction in the human gene. There are four extra conserved exon/intron positions between C. elegans and the humanATP2C1 gene (asterisk in Fig. 1 B) while there is no other exon/intron junction at homologous positions between the C. elegans and D. melanogaster PMR1 genes. One extra exon boundary is conserved between exons 2 and 3 in D. melanogaster and between exons 21 and 22 in the human ATP2C1 gene. Among the exon borders of the PMR1 family, only one (exon 1/2 in CePMR1, exon 5/6 in the humanATP2C1) is conserved in the mammalian SERCA genes (exon 4/5 in human ATP2A1–3). Compared with the mammalian PMCA family, none of the exon/intron borders is conserved. Because in C. elegans the majority of the mRNAs aretrans-spliced, we have investigated whether this is also the case for transcripts of CePMR1 in the worm. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments were performed on whole worm RNA. PCR reactions with primer pairs SL1/CePMR1Rev and SL2/CePMR1Rev resulted in the amplification of an 824- and 818-bp fragment, respectively. The 818-bp PCR product corresponded to a cDNA in which splice leader SL2 was trans-spliced to exon −3 and exon −3 was in turn spliced to exon −1, i.e. an exon layout as found in EST clone yk334d5. By sequencing the SL1/CePMR1Rev fragment of 824 bp, we found that SL1 was spliced to a novel exon (−2) in the 5′ UTR of the gene, which corresponds to nucleotides 22950–23020 on cosmid CECC4 (Fig. 1 B, upper line). Thus it appears that the C. elegans transcripts are both alternatively spliced and trans-spliced at their 5′ end. Both types of splicing are coupled: a mRNA transcript containing exon −1 and exon −2 is trans-spliced to SL1, a mRNA containing exon −1 and exon −3 is trans-spliced to SL2. We also performed 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends with primer pair CePMR1For/468 to check for the possibility of 3′ alternative processing at the 3′ end of the gene's transcript. PCR amplification gave a product of about 600 bp. By subcloning and sequencing of several individual clones, it became clear that the gel band actually consisted of a mixture of three products with small differences in length and corresponding to three polyadenylation isoforms. The isoforms are the result of the use of three polyadenylation sites (pA1, pA2, and pA3) in the 3′ UTR of the gene (Fig.1 B). Both yk218a11 and yk334d5 apparently used pA2. However, no indication was found for 3′ alternative splicing, neither in our 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments nor by database searching. In summary, the C. elegans PMR1 gene consists of 12 exons (−3 to 9) of moderate length and spans a region of more than 19 kb of genomic DNA. The transcripts are both alternatively andtrans-spliced at their 5′ end. At their 3′ end, however, no alternative splicing could be documented but alternative polyadenylation occurs. Fig.2 shows the predicted amino acid sequence of C. elegans PMR1 and its major domains together with an alignment with the corresponding sequences of three distant species,Homo sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae. In the sequences of all species 10 hydrophobic segments can be identified, which like in the SERCA Ca2+pumps, presumably form the transmembrane domain. The highest degree of sequence similarity occurs around the phosphorylation site, in regions demonstrated in SERCA to contribute to the ATP-binding site or to form structurally important loops, and in transmembrane segments M4, M6, and M8, which have been documented in SERCA to form the binding sites for Ca2+ (35MacLennan D.H.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The overall amino acid sequence is 37% identical to rat SERCA2a. The percentage identity with the PMR1 sequences of human, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae is, respectively, 59, 57, and 49%. The amino acids that form the binding site for one of the transported Ca2+ions in SERCA, more specifically the site II, are conserved in the PMR1 homologues in all species. The amino acids belonging to site I are not conserved in the PMR1 protein. In S. cerevisiae, Gln783 has been demonstrated to define the Mn2+sele"
https://openalex.org/W2013615451,"N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) is a key enzyme that inhibits the extension ofN-glycans by introducing a bisectingN-acetylglucosamine residue. In this study we investigated the effect of GnT-III on epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling in HeLaS3 cells. Although the binding of EGF to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was decreased in GnT-III transfectants to a level of about 60% of control cells, the EGF-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in GnT-III transfectants was enhanced to ∼1.4-fold that of the control cells. A binding analysis revealed that only low affinity binding of EGF was decreased in the GnT-III transfectants, whereas high affinity binding, which is considered to be responsible for the downstream signaling, was not altered. EGF-induced autophosphorylation and dimerization of the EGFR in the GnT-III transfectants were the same levels as found in the controls. The internalization rate of EGFR was, however, enhanced in the GnT-III transfectants as judged by the uptake of125I-EGF and Oregon Green-labeled EGF. When the EGFR internalization was delayed by dansylcadaverine, the up-regulation of ERK phosphorylation in GnT-III transfectants was completely suppressed to the same level as control cells. These results suggest that GnT-III overexpression in HeLaS3 cells resulted in an enhancement of EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation at least in part by the up-regulation of the endocytosis of EGFR.

In this paper, we report on a study involving the downstream EGF signaling in GnT-III-transfected HeLaS3 cells to further elucidate the mechanism by which this enzyme affects EGF signaling. Our findings show that the internalization rate of EGFR was up-regulated and that EGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation was enhanced in the GnT-III transfectants.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we report on a study of the effect of GnT-III transfection on EGF signaling in HeLaS3 cells. Consistent with our previous report (15Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T. Meuillet E. Kim P. Kersey D.S. Bremer E.G. Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. J. Biol.

However, our findings showed that EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation was up-regulated in the GnT-III transfectants. To know the mechanism by which ERK phosphorylation is up-regulated, we first examined EGF binding to EGFR in GnT-III transfectants. A Scatchard analysis of the binding assay data revealed that only low affinity binding was decreased in the GnT-III transfectants, whereas the high affinity binding was not changed. The fact that the cell surface expression of EGFR was not altered in GnT-III transfectants suggests that about 40% of the low affinity receptors lost their function, whereas high affinity receptors remained intact. EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation were not down-regulated in the GnT-III transfectants, which is consistent with the fact that the high affinity class, which constitutes 5–10% of the EGFR population, is required, and sufficient for EGF-induced responses (27Defize L.H.K.

It has been shown that the intracellular part of the EGFR regulates its affinity for EGF. It was observed that the activation of PKC converted high affinity EGFR to low affinity EGFR (29King A.C.

It has been also demonstrated that high affinity EGFR represents the cytoskeleton-associated population (33Landreth G.E. Williams L.K. Rieser G.D. J.

One possible mechanism by which GnT-III overexpression affected the EGF binding of low affinity receptor is that GnT-III transfection alters the status of the intracellular domain of EGFR. We observed that GnT-III overexpression in CHO-HER cells changed the reactivity of EGFR toward the antibody which recognized a part of intracellular domain of EGFR (residues 996–1022). 2M. Takahashi, Y. Ikeda, and N. Taniguchi, unpublished observation. Therefore, the introduction of GnT-III might result in some modification of the intracellular domain of EGFR. Another possible mechanism is that GnT-III affects an affinity-modulating protein, the presence of which has been suggested by van der Heyden et al. (31van der Heyden M.A.G. Nievers M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrated that the overexpression of GnT-III affected the internalization rate of EGFR. This effect seems specific to EGFR, since internalization rate of transferrin receptor was not affected, which is internalized by different mechanisms (24Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The internalization of the EGFR is generally thought to be essential for ERK activation (25Di Fiore P.P. Gill G.N.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor receptor (38Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol.

Several studies have also demonstrated that down-stream signaling molecules locate in endosomes with activated EGFR in response to EGF stimulation and support a role for membrane trafficking in EGF signaling (41Di Guglielmo G.M.

Cytochem. 2000; 48: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of the internalization rate of EGFR observed in GnT-III transfectants could be involved in the enhancement of downstream signaling. Quite recently, Tong et al. (44Tong X-K. Hussain N.K. Adams A. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated that endocytosis of EGFR affects downstream of Ras. We observed that activation levels of Ras were not changed in GnT-III transfectants compared with mock transfectants (data not shown). This observation also supports the hypothesis that the enhancement of EGF-stimulated ERK activation in GnT-III transfectants is due to the increase of internalization of EGFR.The mechanisms by which GnT-III overexpression affects endocytosis is now under investigation. Recently, Altschuler et al. (45Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that the internalization of MUC1 is affected by itsO-glycosylation state and that MUC1, which is expressed in glycosylation-defective cells, accumulates in intracellular compartments. They hypothesized that more of the underglycosylated MUC1 can fit into a clathrin-coated pit because of less steric hindrance and that this enhances the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins regulating endocytosis such as dynamin. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis since GnT-III overexpression suppresses the processing and elongation of N-glycans. Another potential cause of enhancement of endocytosis is the molecular changes observed in the intracellular domain of EGFR (residues 996–1022) as stated above. The residues 996–1022 are located in the CaIn domain, so-called because it mediates the EGF-induced calcium response and internalization (46Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and modification within or near the domain could cause a change of status or the physicochemical constitution of the molecule such as charges or steric hindrance, which could, in turn, affect the receptor internalization rate.It was reported that the progression of hepatic neoplasms is retarded in GnT-III−/− mice (47Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). They suggested that GnT-III plays an important role in tumor progression in liver. We offer evidence here that ERK phosphorylation is up-regulated in GnT-III transfectants, and it might account for the tumor progression activity of GnT-III. Further investigations are now under way with a goal of identifying and characterizing the molecules that are involved in changes of EGF signaling in GnT-III transfectants. It is a generally accepted fact that N-glycans play an important role in the folding, stability, and sorting of glycoproteins (1Dwek R.A.

The residues 996–1022 are located in the CaIn domain, so-called because it mediates the EGF-induced calcium response and internalization (46Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and modification within or near the domain could cause a change of status or the physicochemical constitution of the molecule such as charges or steric hindrance, which could, in turn, affect the receptor internalization rate.It was reported that the progression of hepatic neoplasms is retarded in GnT-III−/− mice (47Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). They suggested that GnT-III plays an important role in tumor progression in liver. We offer evidence here that ERK phosphorylation is up-regulated in GnT-III transfectants, and it might account for the tumor progression activity of GnT-III. Further investigations are now under way with a goal of identifying and characterizing the molecules that are involved in changes of EGF signaling in GnT-III transfectants. In this paper, we report on a study of the effect of GnT-III transfection on EGF signaling in HeLaS3 cells. Consistent with our previous report (15Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T. Meuillet E. Kim P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9275-9279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), EGF binding to its receptor was significantly decreased in GnT-III transfectants. However, our findings showed that EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation was up-regulated in the GnT-III transfectants. To know the mechanism by which ERK phosphorylation is up-regulated, we first examined EGF binding to EGFR in GnT-III transfectants. A Scatchard analysis of the binding assay data revealed that only low affinity binding was decreased in the GnT-III transfectants, whereas the high affinity binding was not changed. The fact that the cell surface expression of EGFR was not altered in GnT-III transfectants suggests that about 40% of the low affinity receptors lost their function, whereas high affinity receptors remained intact. EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation were not down-regulated in the GnT-III transfectants, which is consistent with the fact that the high affinity class, which constitutes 5–10% of the EGFR population, is required, and sufficient for EGF-induced responses (27Defize L.H.K.

It has been shown that the intracellular part of the EGFR regulates its affinity for EGF. It was observed that the activation of PKC converted high affinity EGFR to low affinity EGFR (29King A.C. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3053-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a deletion of the entire intracellular domain (30Livneh E. Prywes R. Kashles O. Reiss N. Sasson I.

It has been also demonstrated that high affinity EGFR represents the cytoskeleton-associated population (33Landreth G.E. Williams L.K. Rieser G.D. J.

Cell Res. 1992; 199: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which GnT-III overexpression affected the EGF binding of low affinity receptor is that GnT-III transfection alters the status of the intracellular domain of EGFR. We observed that GnT-III overexpression in CHO-HER cells changed the reactivity of EGFR toward the antibody which recognized a part of intracellular domain of EGFR (residues 996–1022). 2M. Takahashi, Y. Ikeda, and N. Taniguchi, unpublished observation. Therefore, the introduction of GnT-III might result in some modification of the intracellular domain of EGFR. Another possible mechanism is that GnT-III affects an affinity-modulating protein, the presence of which has been suggested by van der Heyden et al. (31van der Heyden M.A.G. Nievers M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the overexpression of GnT-III affected the internalization rate of EGFR. This effect seems specific to EGFR, since internalization rate of transferrin receptor was not affected, which is internalized by different mechanisms (24Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The internalization of the EGFR is generally thought to be essential for ERK activation (25Di Fiore P.P. Gill G.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin.

Several studies have also demonstrated that down-stream signaling molecules locate in endosomes with activated EGFR in response to EGF stimulation and support a role for membrane trafficking in EGF signaling (41Di Guglielmo G.M.

Cytochem. 2000; 48: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of the internalization rate of EGFR observed in GnT-III transfectants could be involved in the enhancement of downstream signaling. Quite recently, Tong et al. (44Tong X-K. Hussain N.K. Adams A. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated that endocytosis of EGFR affects downstream of Ras. We observed that activation levels of Ras were not changed in GnT-III transfectants compared with mock transfectants (data not shown). This observation also supports the hypothesis that the enhancement of EGF-stimulated ERK activation in GnT-III transfectants is due to the increase of internalization of EGFR. The mechanisms by which GnT-III overexpression affects endocytosis is now under investigation. Recently, Altschuler et al. (45Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that the internalization of MUC1 is affected by itsO-glycosylation state and that MUC1, which is expressed in glycosylation-defective cells, accumulates in intracellular compartments. They hypothesized that more of the underglycosylated MUC1 can fit into a clathrin-coated pit because of less steric hindrance and that this enhances the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins regulating endocytosis such as dynamin. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis since GnT-III overexpression suppresses the processing and elongation of N-glycans. Another potential cause of enhancement of endocytosis is the molecular changes observed in the intracellular domain of EGFR (residues 996–1022) as stated above. The residues 996–1022 are located in the CaIn domain, so-called because it mediates the EGF-induced calcium response and internalization (46Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.

The dsRBM is a conserved protein motif found in many proteins from most organisms. In this study, we investigated the biochemical functions and cytological activities of the two PKR dsRBMs (dsRBM1 and dsRBM2) and the cooperation between them. We found that dsRBM1 has a higher affinity for binding to dsRNA than dsRBM2. In addition, dsRBM1 has RNA-annealing activity that is not displayed by dsRBM2. Both dsRBMs have an intrinsic ability to dimerize (dsRBM2) or multimerize (dsRBM1). Binding to dsRNA inhibits oligomerization of dsRBM1 but not dsRBM2 and strongly inhibits the dimerization of the intact PKR N terminus (p20) containing both dsRBMs. dsRBM1, like p20, activates reporter gene expression in transfection assays, and it plays a determinative role in localizing PKR to the nucleolus and cytoplasm of the cell. Thus, dsRBM2 has weak or no activity in dsRNA binding, stimulation of gene expression, and PKR localization, but it strongly enhances these functions of dsRBM1 when contained in p20. However, dsRBM2 does not enhance the annealing activity of dsRBM1. This study shows that the dsRBMs of PKR possess distinct properties and that some, but not all, of the functions of the enzyme depend on cooperation between the two motifs.

It plays an important part in cellular anti-viral defense as well as apoptosis, signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation (1Williams B.R. Biochem. Soc.

Jarrous N. Ben-Asouli Y. Kaempfer R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3280-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The role of PKR in protein synthesis is well studied. It inhibits translation initiation by phosphorylating the α subunit of initiation factor eIF2. Phosphorylated eIF2α binds with high affinity to a second initiation factor, eIF2B, that is usually present in limiting amounts. Sequestration of eIF2B prevents it from promoting GTP/GDP exchange on the eIF2 complex, a critical step in forming the ternary complex eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAithat is essential for initiation. Kinase activity of PKR is activated by autophosphorylation upon binding to its activators, which include most notably, perfect duplex dsRNAs (4Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell.

The dsRBM is a ∼70-amino acid motif that has been found in various proteins in almost all organisms from Escherichia coli to humans (16Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem.

The three-dimensional structure of the dsRBM has been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic techniques (18Bycroft M. Grunert S. Murzin A.G. Proctor M. St. Johnston D.

The x-ray crystal structure of the second dsRBM of XlrbpA in complex with dsRNA revealed three regions of dsRBM forming direct contacts with dsRNA. Sequence alignments of dsRBMs display the existence of variations in these regions, suggestive of variations in dsRNA binding. Several biochemical studies have indicated that dsRBMs can exhibit wide differences in dsRNA binding (21St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, the deletion or mutation of dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 of PKR exerts different effects on its dsRNA binding ability and kinase activity (23Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B.

Yang Y. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The dsRBMs play a key role in PKR function and regulation. Although their exact role in PKR activation is still not clear, it appears that dsRNA binding leads to autophosphorylation of PKR facilitated by protein homodimerization (27Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ortega L.G. McCotter M.D. Henry G.L. McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1996; 215: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that latent PKR exists in an inactive dimer conformation and changes to an active dimer form upon binding to activators, possibly by releasing the kinase domain from inhibitory interactions with the protein's N terminus (2Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-528Google Scholar,29Robertson H.D. Mathews M.B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An intrinsic dimerization activity has been mapped within this region (30Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M.

The dsRBMs have also been implicated in further aspects of PKR function. For example, mutations in the kinase domain of PKR usually show dominant negative effects, including the ability to enhance the expression of reporter genes (23Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ortega L.G. McCotter M.D. Henry G.L. McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E.

The mechanism for the dominant negative effect is not fully understood, but it is thought that the mutants either dimerize with wild-type PKR, thereby blocking its function, or bind to and sequester cellular PKR activators such as dsRNA (23Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PKR localizes in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of the cell (34Jimenez-Garcia L.F. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Spector D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 11-22PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jeffrey I.W.

The ribosome association is tightly related to the dsRNA-binding activity of PKR, but the region of PKR that is responsible for its subcellular localization is not clear. Finally, a dsRNA-annealing activity has been reported for the dsRBMs of Xlrbpa (40Hitti E. Neunteufl A. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4382-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whether this feature is shared by the dsRBMs of PKR is unknown. To understand the functional differences between the two dsRBMs of PKR, and their involvement in the biochemical activities and cytological properties of the full-length protein, we have studied protein-RNA interactions, RNA annealing, protein dimerization, reporter gene activation, and protein localization. Our results suggest that, with the exception of oligomerization, the differences between dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 reflect their different dsRNA binding affinities. Nevertheless, the two dsRBMs cooperate to achieve optimal dsRNA binding and to accomplish both reporter gene activation and correct protein localization. Plasmids SRG5ΔLBN and SRG5ΔLp10 (24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were used to construct 6xHis-tagged p10A, p10B, and p20. SRG5ΔLBN was cut withNdeI and BamHI to give a fragment encoding p20, or with NcoI and BamHI for p10B. SRG5ΔLp10 was cut with NdeI and BamHI to give a fragment encoding p10A. Using complementary restriction sites, the fragments were ligated into pET28b (Novagen) yielding His-p10A and His-p20, and into pET30LIC for His-p10B. For EGFP constructs, the EGFP expression vector pcEGFP (BE) was first constructed by inserting the EGFP coding fragment from pBIEGFP (CLONTECH) into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI. pcEGFP was cut with NheI and BamHI and ligated with PKR fragments generated by PCR using the following primers: PKR-N, 5′-TAGCGCTAGCATGGCTGGTGATCTTTCAG-3′; PKR-C, 5′-AGCTGGATCCACATGTGTGTCGTTCATTTT-3′; p10B-N, 5′-TAGCGCTAGCATGACAACAACGAATTCTTC-3′; p10A-C, 5′-CAGCTGGATCCTTCTGAAGAATTCGTTG-3′; and p20-C, 5′-CAGCTGGATCCACACGTAGTAGCAAAAGA-3′. p10A-EGFP, containing amino acids 1–95 of PKR, was constructed using the primer set PKR-N and p10A-C. Similarly, p10B-EGFP (amino acids 88–186) was constructed using p10B-N and p20-C; p20-EGFP (amino acids 1–186) using PKR-N and p20-C, PKR-EGFP and K296R-EGFP (full-length, amino acids 1–551) using PKR-N and PKR-C, and Δ1-EGFP (amino acid 88–551) using p10B-N and PKR-C. The primer set PKR-N and PKR-C was also used for constructing Δ2-EGFP, and ΔN-EGFP. PCR was carried out with pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using the following templates: human wild-type pcDNA3-PKR (41Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for ΔN-EGFP. For point mutants in p20, templates were from Green et al. (44Green S.R. Manche L. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cut withNheI and BamHI, and ligated into the pcEGFP vector that was cut with the same enzymes. For His-EGFP-tagged proteins, fragments cut from various EGFP constructs were inserted into pET28b using NheI and NotI. For luciferase reporter assays, the luciferase plasmid pBILuc(+) was constructed by ligating the luciferase fragment excised from pSPLUC(+) (Promega) byNheI and XbaI into pcDNA3.1(+) cut withNheI. Transformed E. coli were grown overnight in 3-ml cultures and transferred to 500 ml of LB medium with kanamycin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until the absorbanceA600 reached 0.5 then 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) was added to induce protein expression at 30 °C for 2.5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A with protease inhibitors (5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for protein purification. For His-tagged protein purification, the POROS-MC (PE Applied Biosystems) column matrix was used on a BioCAD Sprint perfusion chromatography system (PE Applied Biosystems). The column was charged with 50 column volumes of 0.1 m NiCl2, washed, and loaded with bacterial extract. After extensive washing with buffer A, His-tagged proteins were eluted by buffer B (500 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5). Proteins were dialyzed overnight against dialysis buffer (20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C until use. For protein purification under denaturing conditions, cell extracts were suspended in buffer DA (6m guanidine-HCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6), loaded onto the column, washed with buffer DA then buffer RA (6 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and renatured on the column at room temperature for 90 min by gradually changing the proportions of buffer RA (from 100% to 0%) and buffer RB (150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; from 0% to 100%). Proteins were eluted with buffer DB (0.5 m imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and dialyzed as above. The denaturation step reduced the binding of32P-labeled poly(rI·rC) with His-tagged p20-EGFP to background levels. RNAs for dsRNA production and annealing assays were obtained by cutting plasmid pBSKII (Strategene) with PvuII and transcribing with T3 and T7 RNA polymerases. The T3 and T7 transcripts are 245 and 335 nucleotides long, respectively, and complementary over 132 nucleotides. dsRNAs were generated and purified as described previously (4Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The gel mobility shift assay was described previously (24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified dsRNAs and proteins were mixed on ice in gel mobility shift buffer and run on 5% tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. The poly(rI·rC) pull-down assay was described previously (43Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Methods. 1998; 15: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(rI·rC)-Sepharose was incubated with the proteins and washed with different concentrations of salt. Proteins were eluted by mixing with gel loading buffer, briefly boiled and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Poly(rI·rC) at 200 μg/ml was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 45 min, heated at 68 °C for 5 min, cooled down slowly to room temperature, and passed through a Bio-Gel p-30 polyacrylamide gel column (Bio-Rad). Labeled poly(rI·rC), about 50,000 cpm, was incubated with proteins on ice for 20 min in binding buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The filter binding assay was carried out as described previously (4Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) using washing buffer (50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Retained poly(rI·rC) was quantified using an InstantImager (Packard). For each reaction, a 15-μl solution containing proteins or KCl, labeled T3 and T7 RNA substrates, and 1× annealing buffer (200 mm KCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Digestion mix (35 μl) containing 25 unit T1 RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μl 5× T1 digestion buffer (5 mmEDTA, 750 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was then added. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of precipitation mix (80 μg/ml yeast total RNA and 266 μm NaCl) and 200 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (1:1:1, v/v). The RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and resolved in an 8 m urea/10% TBE polyacrylamide gel. Proteins and poly(rI·rC) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were incubated on ice for 20 min and then mixed with cross-linking buffer (2 mm dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). After incubation at room temperature for 90 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m glycine and 2× gel loading buffer. Samples were run in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blotted with anti-His-tag antibody (CLONTECH), and visualized with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST fusion PKR was expressed inE. coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Dialyzed purified GST-PKR was immobilized on the beads, His-tagged p20 and different concentrations of poly(rI·rC) were added, and the slurry was incubated on ice for 30 min. The beads were then washed five times with PBS containing 1 mm DTT and briefly boiled in 2× gel loading buffer. Samples were run in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody. Human 293 cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (41Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection by washing once with PBS and incubating with 150 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris. Supernatant (20 μl) was used for luciferase assay (luciferase assay kit, Promega) and monitored using a Lumicount luminometer (Packard). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips (No. 2, 18-mm circle, VWR) until 70% confluence and then transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described above. Cells were grown for 36 h after transfection, washed once with PBS, and fixed with freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) using a 100×-magnification objective. Earlier mutational and deletion analysis indicated that the two dsRBMs of PKR differ in their dsRNA binding affinity and their importance for PKR function (23Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N.

To examine their properties and behavior at the biochemical level, we cloned dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 of PKR into vectors that allowed expression inE. coli either as unmodified or His-tagged proteins (Fig.1). In accordance with their approximate molecular weights and following the previous convention (4Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the recombinant proteins p10A (previously called p10), p10B, and p20 carry, respectively, the first dsRBM, second dsRBM, and the intact N terminus of PKR containing both dsRBMs. We used three methods to compare the binding affinities of the dsRBMs for dsRNA, namely a poly(rI·rC)-Sepharose pull-down assay, a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay, and a gel mobility shift assay. First, the proteins were incubated with poly(rI·rC)-Sepharose in low salt concentration (25 mm KCl). Aliquots of the beads were washed with buffer containing increasing concentrations of KCl, and the protein remaining associated with dsRNA was assayed by gel electrophoresis and staining. Fig.2 A shows that the three proteins bound to the resin and were eluted at varying salt concentrations. p20 resisted elution to 0.75–1 m KCl, whereas p10A was eluted at ∼0.4 m KCl and p10B at ∼0.2m. These data confirm that the binding of p20 to poly(rI·rC) is stronger than that of p10A (24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and show that p10B also binds but more weakly. For a more quantitative comparison of the relative affinities, we conducted filter-binding assays with end-labeled poly(rI·rC). As estimated from the data of Fig.2 B, the Kd for p20 binding to poly(rI·rC) is about 5 × 10−9m, in agreement with previous measurements by gel mobility shift analysis (24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 45McCormack S.J. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1995; 206: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The affinities of p10A and p10B were lower, withKd values about 5 × 10−8 and 2 × 10−7m, respectively. The affinity of p10A for perfectly duplexed RNA measured by gel mobility shift analysis, 3.8 × 10−7m (24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was somewhat lower than the estimate obtained here, possibly implying that single-stranded tails present in poly(rI·rC) contribute to the binding. In gel mobility shift assays with purified dsRNA of defined size, p20 gives rise to a series of bands corresponding to the sequential binding of p20 molecules until the RNA is fully saturated. This occurs at ∼11 base pairs/p20 molecule (4Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 24Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using dsRNA of 132 base pairs in the presence of competitor tRNA, low concentrations of p20 gave rise to several distinct bands (Fig.3 A, lane 5). At higher concentrations, p10A caused a mobility shift without giving rise to a very discrete banding pattern (lanes 9–12), whereas p10B did not elicit a mobility shift even at the highest concentrations tested (lanes 6–8). These assays indicate that p10A binds to dsRNA with a higher affinity than p10B and that there is cooperativity between the two dsRBMs in binding dsRNA. Mixing experiments (lanes 2–4) show that this cooperativity is achieved only when the two dsRBMs are tandemly located on the same protein molecule. The failure to detect an interaction between p10B and dsRNA by the mobility shift technique, in contrast to the matrix-binding techniques used with poly(rI·rC) in Fig. 2, prompted us to carry out assays in the absence of tRNA competitor. Under such conditions, p10B gave rise to a mobility shift at high concentrations (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5–9), reaffirming the conclusion that dsRBM2 interacts with dsRNA with lower affinity than dsRBM1 and implying that the dsRBM2 interaction is not entirely specific for dsRNA. Hitti et al. (40Hitti E. Neunteufl A. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4382-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dsRBMs of Xlrbpa have RNA annealing activity. However, this activity did not correlate with the affinity of the Xlrbpa dsRBMs for dsRNA. Using the protocol diagrammed in Fig.4 A, we assayed the ability of the dsRBMs of PKR t"

The analysis of fluorescence induction at room temperature indicates that stigmatellin consistently prevented transition to State 2, whereas 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone behaved as an inhibitor of state transitions only after the cells were preilluminated. The same effects were observed on the phosphorylation patterns of the LHCII proteins, while subunit V of the cytochromeb6 f complex showed a different behavior.

It is usually triggered by the binding of an external signal molecule to a membrane located receptor, as in the case, for example, of the hormone-induced signal transduction pathway (1Gillman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). In other instances, however, membrane-bound receptors are not involved in the reception of external signals. This is the case of the short time chromatic adaptation phenomena, known as state transitions (2Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), that occur in plants and in algae. In these organisms, changes in the quality of the absorbed light energy induce the phosphorylation and reversible migration of a fraction of the light harvesting proteins (LHCII) between the grana and the stroma domains of the thylakoids (4Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Following an illumination with light absorbed preferentially by photosystem II (PSII),1 LHCII is phosphorylated and becomes part of PSI antenna (State 1 to State 2 transition) (5Delosme R. Béal D. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 56-64Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The illumination with PSI-absorbed light has the opposite effect: a dephosphorylation triggers the re-association of LHCII to PSII (State 2 to State 1 transition (5Delosme R. Béal D. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 56-64Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). In vivo studies with the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have also demonstrated that state transitions are controlled by the intracellular demand for ATP: dark-adapted cells are locked in State 2 when the intracellular content in ATP is low, whereas they shift to a State 1 configuration when the ATP pool is restored (7Bulté L. Gans P. Rebéillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar).The changes in the phosphorylation state of antenna proteins result from the combined actions of an LHCII kinase, the activation of which is redox-dependent (8Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and a phosphatase that is considered permanently active (9Elich T.D. Edelmen M. Matoo A.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 4111: 236-238Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although recent data have suggested the possibility of a regulation via its interaction with an immunophilin-like protein (10Fulgosi H. Vener A.V. Altchmied L. Hermann R.G. Andersson B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism for kinase activation involves the reduction of the plastoquinone pool (3Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 11Horton P. Black M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and requires the presence of cytochrome b6 fcomplexes (12Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys.

The nature of the kinase is still obscure, even though its presence has been reported in partially purified preparations of cytochrome b6 fcomplexes (14Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19742-19749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism through which the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool is transduced to the kinase is not known, the implication of the quinol binding site, Qo, of the cytochrome b6 fcomplex has been demonstrated both in vivo with C. reinhardtii (13Zito F.

The activation was maintained even after reoxidation of the PQ pool, provided that a Qo-bound plastoquinol was retained per cytochrome b6 f complex (16Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Rich P.R. Ohad I.

The Rieske protein was shown to adopt at least two different positions: one close to the membrane surface, next to heme b1(the so called proximal position, Ref. 20Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), another extending more in the lumen, next to heme c1 (respiratory,f) (the distal one, Ref. 20Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The existence of a third position, intermediate between the two, has also been suggested by Iwata and co-workers (17Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). According to the model proposed by Veneret al. (21Vener A.V. Ohad I. Andersson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the Rieske subunit would be kinase-activating in its distal position, and inhibiting in the proximal one, due to some interaction with a putative transmembrane segment of the kinase. We have recently questioned this hypothesis and suggested that activation of the kinase was produced when the Rieske was in its proximal position (13Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).To further test the relationship between the movements of the Rieske protein and the activation of the LHCII kinase, we have studied the effects on state transitions of two Qo site inhibitors of electron transfer in the cytochromeb6 f complex. We have used stigmatellin, which blocks electron transfer in both thebc1 and b6 fcytochrome complex (22Frank K. Trebst A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by fixing the iron sulfur protein in its proximal conformation (17Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.

Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have also used DBMIB, which inhibits cytochrome b6 f but notbc1 complexes (22Frank K. Trebst A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and develops contrasted interactions with the Rieske protein depending on its redox state (23Schoepp B. Brugna M. Riedel A. Nitschke W. Kramer D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Remarkable differences were observed between the effects of the two inhibitors, indicative of the existence of a rather complex relationship between the occupancy of the Qo site and the activation of the LHCII kinase. We present here a structural hypothesis that could account for these observations. Protein phosphorylation is a general mechanism for signal transduction that is present both in eucaryotes and procaryotes. It is usually triggered by the binding of an external signal molecule to a membrane located receptor, as in the case, for example, of the hormone-induced signal transduction pathway (1Gillman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). In other instances, however, membrane-bound receptors are not involved in the reception of external signals. This is the case of the short time chromatic adaptation phenomena, known as state transitions (2Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), that occur in plants and in algae. In these organisms, changes in the quality of the absorbed light energy induce the phosphorylation and reversible migration of a fraction of the light harvesting proteins (LHCII) between the grana and the stroma domains of the thylakoids (4Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Following an illumination with light absorbed preferentially by photosystem II (PSII),1 LHCII is phosphorylated and becomes part of PSI antenna (State 1 to State 2 transition) (5Delosme R. Béal D. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 56-64Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The illumination with PSI-absorbed light has the opposite effect: a dephosphorylation triggers the re-association of LHCII to PSII (State 2 to State 1 transition (5Delosme R. Béal D. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 56-64Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). In vivo studies with the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have also demonstrated that state transitions are controlled by the intracellular demand for ATP: dark-adapted cells are locked in State 2 when the intracellular content in ATP is low, whereas they shift to a State 1 configuration when the ATP pool is restored (7Bulté L. Gans P. Rebéillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The changes in the phosphorylation state of antenna proteins result from the combined actions of an LHCII kinase, the activation of which is redox-dependent (8Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and a phosphatase that is considered permanently active (9Elich T.D. Edelmen M. Matoo A.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 4111: 236-238Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although recent data have suggested the possibility of a regulation via its interaction with an immunophilin-like protein (10Fulgosi H. Vener A.V. Altchmied L. Hermann R.G. Andersson B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism for kinase activation involves the reduction of the plastoquinone pool (3Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 11Horton P. Black M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and requires the presence of cytochrome b6 fcomplexes (12Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 85: 85-94Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The nature of the kinase is still obscure, even though its presence has been reported in partially purified preparations of cytochrome b6 fcomplexes (14Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19742-19749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism through which the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool is transduced to the kinase is not known, the implication of the quinol binding site, Qo, of the cytochrome b6 fcomplex has been demonstrated both in vivo with C. reinhardtii (13Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and in vitro with thylakoid preparations from spinach (15Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Andersson B. Ohad I. J. Biol.

The activation was maintained even after reoxidation of the PQ pool, provided that a Qo-bound plastoquinol was retained per cytochrome b6 f complex (16Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Rich P.R. Ohad I.

Myosin was purified from the indirect flight muscles of wild-type and transgenic flies expressing a major embryonic isoform. The in vitro actin sliding velocity on the flight muscle isoform (6.4 μm·s−1 at 22 °C) is among the fastest reported for a type II myosin and was 9-fold faster than with the embryonic isoform. With smooth muscle tropomyosin bound to actin, the actin sliding velocity on the embryonic isoform increased 6-fold, whereas that on the flight muscle myosin slightly decreased. No difference in the step sizes of Drosophila and rabbit skeletal myosins were found using optical tweezers, suggesting that the slower in vitro velocity with the embryonic isoform is due to altered kinetics. Basal ATPase rates for flight muscle myosin are higher than those of embryonic and rabbit myosin.

Developmental- and tissue-specific isoforms have distinct ATPase rates and velocities that are the primary determinants of muscle contractile properties (1Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20414-20418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not well understood how functional properties of myosin are determined by variations in myosin heavy chain (MHC)1 sequence and structure (2Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 543-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Genetic engineering, sequence comparisons, in vitro motility assays, and crystallographic structures have facilitated recent investigations into MHC structural regions that might influence function properties (3Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For example, the two flexible loops (25/50-kDa, loop 1; 50/20-kDa, loop 2) in the chicken skeletal andDictyostelium myosin heads, unresolved in the atomic structures, have been examined as possible determinants of functional variation between isoforms (4Sweeney H.L.

Substituting different loop 1s with varying charge and length affected ADP release rate, ATPase rate, andin vitro actin sliding velocity (4Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, these changed properties did not correlate well with the relative speed of the native myosin from which the loop was derived, suggesting that additional regions need to be altered in concert to give the unique kinetic and velocity characteristics of a specific isoform. Investigations using species-specific myosins differing only in one or a few regions result in better insights. In phasic smooth muscle myosin, seven additional amino acids near the nucleotide binding site increase actin-activated ATPase rate and in vitro motility velocities compared with the tonic smooth muscle isoform (7Lauzon A.M. Tyska M.J. Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res.

Perreault-Micale C.L. Trybus K.M. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7517-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Drosophila system has the potential to provide even greater insights. Fifteen different MHC isoforms, arising from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts from the singleMhc gene (10Bernstein S.I. Mogami K. Donady J.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Nature. 1983; 302: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Rozek C.E. Davidson N. Cell. 1983; 32: 23-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), have been found so far in a wide variety of muscle types, ranging from the supercontractile larval muscles to the highly ordered, asynchronous indirect flight muscles (IFMs) (12Zhang S. Bernstein S.I. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13George E.L. Ober M.B. Emerson Jr., C.P. Mol. Cell.

Edwards K.A. Roche E.S. Wells L. Bernstein S.I. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Four of the five alternatively spliced exon sets occur in the myosin head coding region and have been proposed to determine functional differences between isoforms (Fig. 1) (16Bernstein S.I. Milligan R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The variety of myosins normally expressed and the ease of creating transgenic flies make the Drosophila Mhc gene a powerful system for studying the relationships between myosin sequence and in vivofunctional variation (17Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, to take full advantage of this system, it is necessary to develop in vitro assays to determine the different properties of Drosophila myosins. As the IFMs constitute a major part of the adult fly (approximately 20% of body weight), myosin isolation from these muscles following dissection is relatively straightforward compared with attempting recovery from other muscle types. Recently, a major embryonic isoform (Emb) was transgenically expressed in a myosin null background (18Wells L. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4454-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) such that every muscle type expressed only the Emb isoform. Although the transgenic flies were viable, they exhibited a flightless phenotype and were severely impaired in jumping and walking abilities. In addition, the IFMs showed severe myofibrillar degeneration soon after the time at which flight normally commences. Clearly, this embryonic isoform cannot substitute functionally for the IFM isoform. The embryonic isoform differs from that of the IFM at all alternatively spliced regions; therefore, one or more of the alternative exons must be responsible for the functional differences between these isoforms. We report on the purification and functional characterization ofDrosophila IFM and modified embryonic (Emb18) myosins. We present the first optical trap measurements ofDrosophila myosin step size, attachment lifetimes, in vitro motility velocities, and isoform-specific ATPase measurements. The results demonstrate that alternatively spliced exon regions of MHC dramatically influence cross-bridge cycle kinetics and set the stage for the evaluation of chimeric MHC constructs to pinpoint functional variations to particular polypeptide sequences encoded by the alternative exons. Myosin was prepared from the dorsolongitudinal IFMs (DLMs) of 100–120 wild-type (for muscle genes; the flies carry the yellow body color and white eye mutations) or transgenic Emb18 flies. Emb18 myosin (hereafter referred to as Emb18) was expressed transgenically following P element-mediated germline transformation of a modified version of a major embryonic isoform cDNA (17Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Emb18was modified from a native embryonic myosin to have the shorter adult tailpiece encoded by exon 18. The adult tailpiece enhances myosin accumulation in the adult IFMs (17Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By expressing Emb18 in a Mhc 10 background (null for myosin in flight and jump muscle), the Emb18 isoform could be isolated from the IFM without contamination by other myosin isoforms. However, it had the IFM-specific essential myosin light chain isoform. Thus, the only differences between the isolated myosin isoforms were located in head regions encoded by exons 3, 7, 9, and 11 (Fig. 1), and the rod hinge region, encoded by exon 15. DLMs were dissected at 4 °C from split thoraces in York Modified Glycerol (YMG: 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 8 mm DTT, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 50% (v/v) glycerol) (19Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. White D.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) without Triton X-100, but with the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A protease inhibitor mixture was also included in all subsequent myosin extraction solutions. IFMs were suspended in YMG (with Triton X-100), incubated for 30 min, centrifuged (8,500 × g), and washed in YMG without Triton X-100 and glycerol. Myosin was extracted into three volumes (55 μl) of 1.0 m KCl, 0.15 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 8 mm DTT for 10 min and centrifuged at 8,500 ×g for 5 min. The proteins in this initial extraction are shown in Fig. 2 A (lane 2). The pellet was sometimes used to make acetone powder for actin isolation (see below). The extracted myosin was precipitated by decreasing KCl to 40 mm and incubating for 16 h (overnight). Following a 15-min centrifugation in a Beckman TL-100.3 rotor at 100,000 ×g, the pellet (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) was dissolved in an equal volume (18 μl) of Wash B (2.4m KCl, 100 mm histidine, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EGTA, 8 mm DTT) (20Hynes T.R. Block S.M. White B.T. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1987; 48: 953-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Myosin that did not dissociate from actin (shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 6) was precipitated by slowly adding water until the KCl concentration was decreased to 0.3 m and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and further diluted until the KCl concentration reached 30 mm and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of myosin storage buffer (0.5 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm DTT). Drosophila myosin preparations were quantified by their absorbance at 280 nm using an absorbance coefficient of 0.53 cm−1 for 1 mg·ml−1(21Margossian S.S. Lowey S.

The Bradford assay (Coomassie Plus-200, Pierce) and semiquantitative SDS-PAGE gave similar results when rabbit myosin was used as the protein standard. Actin was isolated from dissected DLMs as described by Razzaq et al. (22Razzaq A. Schmitz S. Veigel C. Molloy J.E. Geeves M.A. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28321-28328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified F-actin was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h, and resuspended in actin buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT) (23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Cshows the purity of the actin preparation. Actin was quantified by subtracting absorbance at 310 nm from that at 290 nm and dividing by an absorbance coefficient of 0.62 cm−1 for 1 mg·ml−1 (24Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For the motility assay, actin was labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin as described by Kron et al. (23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Ca-ATPase activity of myosin was measured using a modification of the method described by Pullman (25Pullman M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 57-60Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activity was determined in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.0, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (500–800 cpm·nmol−1) with 2–5 μg of protein. The reaction was initiated by ATP addition. After incubating for 15 min at 22–23 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of 1.8m HClO4. Following centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were added to 0.5 ml of 5% ammonium molybdate, 2 ml of 1.25 m HClO4, and 2.5 ml of isobutanol-benzene (1:1). After vigorous mixing and phase separation, 1 ml of the organic phase containing 32Pi was assayed by Cerenkov counting. We found that the Ca-ATPase activity at pH 6 was approximately twice that obtained at pH 7.4 (data not shown), similar to previous reports for whole thorax myosin (26Takahashi S. Maruyama K. Zool. Sci. 1987; 4: 833-838Google Scholar). Thus, we measured ATPase activity at pH 6.0 to maximize ATPase rates. For determination of the Km of myosin Ca-ATPase activity, ATP was varied from 5 to 300 μm for IFM myosin and from 2 to 40 μm for Emb18 myosin. Specific radioactivity of [32P]ATP was increased to 5,000–8,000 cpm·nmol−1. The reaction time was reduced to 3 min to ensure that initial rates were determined. Mg-ATPase activity was determined in 0.5 ml of solution containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.0, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP with 2–5 μg of protein for 30 min at 22–23 °C, and processed as described above for Ca-ATPase. F-actin in vitro motility assays were conducted similarly to Kron et al. (23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), except for the following modifications. 1) The nitrocellulose-coated coverslip of the flow cell was blocked by incubating with assay buffer plus BSA (AB/BSA) prior to myosin addition at 0.5 mg·ml−1. 2) After myosin addition, dead heads (myosin that binds irreversibly to actin) were blocked by adding 5 μm phalloidin-stabilized IFM actin followed by AB plus ATP, 0.4% methylcellulose, and oxygen scavengers (27Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 39: 23-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After a 10-min incubation, ATP was washed out of the flow cell by several additions of AB/BSA. Labeled actin was added and the remainder of the protocol was as described by Kron et al. (23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This method was very effective, as continuous movement of actin filaments would last ∼10 min in unblocked cells before the majority of filaments were arrested by dead heads, while in cells employing dead head blocking, most filaments were still moving after 30 min. Filament movement in unblocked cells was used as an indicator of myosin quality. If continuous movement by the majority of actin filaments did not last for ∼10 min, the myosin preparation was not used for ATPase measurements. 3) The final activating motility solution contained 0.4% methylcellulose and no KCl. In some experiments, smooth muscle tropomyosin (smTM) (chicken gizzard, Sigma) was bound to Drosophila IFM actin by mixing at a 1:1 molar ratio. Centrifugation and one-dimensional SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of the pellet and supernatant confirmed the binding of smTM to Drosophila F-actin (data not shown). smTM (100 nm) was included in all solutions added to the flow cell after actin addition to prevent smTM dissociation from actin (28Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The assays were conducted at 22–23 °C, and filament movement was recorded onto videotape. Video sequences were captured at 10 frames/s with an Apple PowerMac computer. Actin filament velocity was calculated using the Autotrack Macro (29Root D.D. Wang K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12581-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) from the public domain NIH Image program. A filament's velocity was determined only if it moved smoothly for >2 s. At least 50 filaments from a flow cell with the best quality of movement were averaged to determine the mean velocity for each myosin preparation. Means for all preparations were then averaged to determine mean myosin isoform velocity. Standard deviations were calculated from the preparation averages. A Student'st test was used for all statistical analysis, withp values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The single actomyosin cross-bridge mechanical experiments were carried out using an optical tweezers transducer in the “three-bead” configuration (30Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 31Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C. Biophys.

Two independently trapped latex beads, attached to the ends of an actin filament, held the filament close to a glass bead coated with a low surface density of Drosophila myosin molecules (0.1 μg of protein applied to a 22 × 22-mm2coverslip) allowing interactions between single myosin heads and the actin filament. Beam steering of the traps and calibrations were performed as described previously (31Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 298S-305SPubMed Google Scholar, 32Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Actomyosin interactions were measured at trap stiffnesses between 0.02 and 0.04 pN·nm−1 at 22–23 °C. The optical trap assay buffer was 25 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm imidazolium chloride, pH 7.4, 20 mm DTT and glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase (0.2 mg·ml−1 glucose oxidase, 0.05 mg·ml−1 catalase, and 3 mg·ml−1 glucose). It included an ATP regeneration system (2 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg·ml−1 creatine phosphokinase) and 5 μg·ml−1 rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin (32Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The ATP concentration was 3 μm for both step size and attached lifetime measurements. The latter estimates the second order rate constant of A·M + ATP → A + M·ATP and was determined by fitting a least squares regression to a plot of frequency against the logarithm of binned event durations (31Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 298S-305SPubMed Google Scholar). The size of the working strokes of the two Drosophilamyosins interacting with rabbit or Drosophila IFM actin were determined by analyzing hundreds of displacement events (for details, see Refs. 31Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 298S-305SPubMed Google Scholar and 32Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Histograms of the displacement events were fitted with a Gaussian distribution whose midpoint was shifted from zero, reflecting the size of the working stroke, and whose width was determined by the trap stiffness (31Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 298S-305SPubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila myosin isolation method yielded an enzymatically active myosin capable of moving actin filaments in a smooth and continuous manner. The IFM myosin yield was 300–400 μg (2.5–3.3 μg/fly) and was at least 90% pure, as judged from the proportion of heavy chain (200 kDa) and light chains on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2 B). Two light chains associate withDrosophila MHC: the essential light chain and the regulatory light chain, which appears as two bands due to multiple phosphorylated versions (∼14 isoelectric variants; Refs. 33Moore J.R. Dickinson M.H. Vigoreaux J.O. Maughan D.W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1431-1440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 34Dickinson M.H. Hyatt C.J. Lehmann F.O. Moore J.R.

A negligible amount of actin was present. The Emb18 myosin yield was 200 μg (≈2 μg/fly), and its purity was similar to the IFM isoform (Fig. 2 B). The purified Drosophila myosins were kept in storage buffer at 5–10 mg·ml−1, and were used the same day they were isolated, as ATPase activity declines to 50–75% of the original activity within 2 days. The decline in activity is similar to that reported for other myosin types, including rat cardiac myosin (35VanBuren P. Harris D.E. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The yield of IFM actin was ∼0.5 μg/fly, similar to that reported by Razzaq et al. (22Razzaq A. Schmitz S. Veigel C. Molloy J.E. Geeves M.A. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28321-28328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Drosophila IFM myosin exhibited a high Ca-ATPase activity, of 7.5–9 s−1 (TableI). These values are the same as for phosphorylated myosin from whole Drosophila thoraces (36Takahashi S. Takano-Ohmuro H. Maruyama K. Hotta Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 95: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Ca-ATPase assay conditions, selected to maximize ATPase rate, were similar to those used by Takahashi et al. (36Takahashi S. Takano-Ohmuro H. Maruyama K. Hotta Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 95: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that we used 10 mm calcium rather than 3 mm. The Emb18 Ca-ATPase activity is similar to that reported for whole larval myosin (26Takahashi S. Maruyama K. Zool. Sci. 1987; 4: 833-838Google Scholar), which was 25% that of their adult myosin mixture (whole thorax). The Km for ATP of the Emb18 myosin Ca-ATPase activity was approximately one-fifth that of the IFM myosin (Fig. 3).Table IATPase activitiesIsoformCa-ATPaseKm(ATP)1-aDetermined from Ca-ATPase experiments.Mg-ATPases−1μms−1IFM8.3 ± 0.3 (4)20.8 ± 1.6 (3)0.11 ± 0.01 (4)Emb183.15 ± 0.4 (3) 1-bStatistically different from IFM, by Student's t test (p < 0.001).4.4 ± 0.8 (3)1-bStatistically different from IFM, by Student's t test (p < 0.001).0.022 ± 0.002 (3)1-bStatistically different from IFM, by Student's t test (p < 0.001).Values are the average of the means for each preparation ± standard error determined from preparation means.

Open table in a new tab Values are the average of the means for each preparation ± standard error determined from preparation means. Number of myosin preparations is indicated in parentheses. Mg-ATPase activity of the IFM isoform was only 1–2% of the Ca-ATPase activity. The Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities of transgenic Emb18 myosin were 20–37% of those obtained with IFM myosin (Table I, Fig. 3). Drosophila myosin K-ATPase (EDTA) activity at 0.5 m KCl was slightly higher than the Mg-ATPase rates (data not shown), and about 50% of the K-ATPase activity reported by Takahashi and Maruyama (26Takahashi S. Maruyama K. Zool. Sci. 1987; 4: 833-838Google Scholar) for whole thorax myosin. The in vitro motility assay required a few modifications from the standard rabbit heavy meromyosin (HMM) assay (23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) to obtain smooth and continuous movement of actin onDrosophila myosin. Actin filaments diffused off the myosin-coated surface after ATP addition unless 0.4% methylcellulose was added to the AB/BSA/glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase and ATP solutions. Actin interactions with myosin were enhanced when the overall ionic strength was lowered to about 25 mm (no added KCl). Higher ionic strengths decreased the number of filaments moving, and some filaments would leave the myosin surface even in the presence of methylcellulose. The best actin movement (greatest number of filaments moving smoothly and continuously) occurred at ∼0.5 mg·ml−1 of myosin, which is at the high end of values reported for other myosin types (0.1–0.5 mg·ml−1; Ref. 28Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Movement was not achieved below 0.3 mg/ml. Mean actin velocity on IFM myosin, 6.4 μm·s−1, was faster than that typically found with rabbit myosin (4–5 μm·s−1; Refs. 23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and 28Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Mean actin velocity on IFM myosin was 9-fold faster than with Emb18 myosin (TableII). Although it was much slower, the embryonic myosin still required methylcellulose to prevent actin diffusion away from the myosin-coated surface, and moved actin best at a myosin concentration of 0.5 mg·ml−1.Table IIMotility characteristicsIsoformVelocityStep sizeOff rateμm · s−1nmm−1 · s−1IFM6.4 ± 0.7 (4)3.91 ± 2.363.2 × 106Emb180.7 ± 0.1 (4) 2-aStatistically different from IFM, by Student's t test (p < 0.001).4.38 ± 2.271.9 × 106IFM + smTM5.2 ± 0.3 (4) 2-bStatistically different from IFM, by paired t test (p = 0.047).ND 2-dND, not determined.NDEmb18 + smTM4.0 ± 0.7 (5) 2-cStatistically different from Emb18, by Student's t test (p < 0.001) and IFM + smTM, Student's t test (p = 0.002).NDNDAll velocity and step size data are mean ± standard deviation.

Surprisingly, the binding of smTM to actin increased filament velocity over Emb18 myosin almost 6-fold (Table II, Fig.4 A). In contrast, smTM had a slight inhibitory effect on IFM myosin driven movement, reducing the velocity (Fig. 4 B) and decreasing the number of filaments that moved smoothly and uniformly. Reduced movement quality was not observed with Emb18myosin. Thus, with smTM bound to the Drosophila IFM actin, the difference in sliding velocity between IFM and Emb18myosins was only 1.4-fold. The displacements produced by the two Drosophila myosins in single molecule interactions with an F-actin in the optical trap are shown in Fig. 5.

Here, we show that the human B1R exhibits a high level of ligand-independent, constitutive activity. Constitutive activity was identified by the increase in basal cellular phosphoinositide hydrolysis as a function of the density of the receptors in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Several B1R peptide antagonists were neutral antagonists or very weakly efficacious inverse agonists. Constitutive B1R activity was further increased by alanine mutation of Asn121 in the third transmembrane domain of the receptor (B1A121). This mutant resembled the agonist-preferred receptor state since it also exhibited increased agonist affinity and decreased agonist responsiveness. A dramatic loss of constitutive activity occurred when the fourth intracellular C-terminal domain (IC-IV) of the human B2 BK receptor subtype (B2R), which exhibits minimal constitutive activity, was substituted in either B1R or B1A121 to make B1(B2ICIV) and B1(B2ICIV)A121, respectively. Activity was partially recovered by subsequent alanine mutation of a cluster of two serines and two threonines in IC-IV of either B1(B2ICIV) or B1(B2ICIV)A121, a cluster that is important for B2R desensitization. The ligand-independent, constitutive activity of B1R therefore depends on epitopes in both transmembrane and intracellular domains.

Despite binding very similar ligands, leading to their classification as receptor subtypes, these receptors exhibit only 36% identity.

This pattern of expression is consistent with the fact that the B2 receptor appears to be the principal kinin receptor under healthy conditions and in the acute stage of the inflammatory response (4Proud D.

The rationale for restricting B1 receptor expression primarily to conditions of injury is not understood. One explanation is that this receptor serves to provide a sustained kinin signal (7Marceau F.

This explanation is consistent with the fact that the B2 receptor response is transient and rapidly desensitizes upon agonist stimulation, whereas the B1 receptor response is sustained and desensitizes very slowly (15Bascands J.L.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-129PubMed Google Scholar). However, restricting B1 receptor expression to prohibit sustained agonist stimulation seems unnecessary since kinin production in the absence of injury is probably low, and the in vivo production of the B1 receptor agonists des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg10-KD by carboxypeptidases from BK and KD, respectively, is relatively inefficient (17Ward P.E. Burch R.M. Bradykinin Antagonists. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 147-170Google Scholar). On the other hand, limiting B1 receptor expression would be important if this receptor is constitutively active since constitutive GPCR activity, which occurs both spontaneously and in response to mutations in these receptors, can lead to disease (18Coughlin S.R.

The localization of many natural and unnatural constitutively activating GPCR mutations in transmembrane domains has led to the belief that interhelical contacts are important in regulating the ligand-independent isomerization of these receptors between the inactive and the activated states and, consequently, constitutive activity (22Scheer A.

In the present study, we show that the human B1 receptor exhibits a high level of constitutive activity in HEK293 cells. B2R IC-IV strongly suppresses B1R activity, and this occurs independently of the activation state of the receptor. The suppression is partially due to the presence of critical serines and threonines, but other epitopes are also involved. Thus, we propose that the high constitutive B1R activity is due to the lack of regulatory epitopes in IC-IV.

HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transiently transfected with varying amounts of DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitate method as described previously (32Pizard A. Blaukat A. Muller-Esterl W. Ahlenc-Gelas F.

Transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mm2-{[2(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and homogenized using an T25 Ultra-Turrax tissue homogenizer (IKA-Works, Wilmington, NC) at 20,500 rpm for 10 s. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed 1–3 times in the above buffer depending on the experiment. The pellets were then resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.014% bacitracin (binding buffer) and used immediately. The preparation was washed one time in the experiments determining the pharmacological profiles of agonist and antagonist binding to the B1 and B2 receptors (Figs. 1 and 4 A and Table I). In all other binding experiments, the preparation was washed three times. Increasing the number of washes from one to three resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in the value of the binding constants, Kd and Ki, for des-Arg10-KD on the various B1 receptor constructs.Figure 4Effects of antagonists on ligand-independent and agonist-dependent PI hydrolysis of the human B1 receptor.

Receptor density was determined on intact HEK293 cells by incubating cells in Leibovitz's L-15 medium, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin including the protease inhibitors bacitracin (140 μg/ml) and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm) and a saturating concentration of [3H]des-Arg10-KD or [3H]NPC17731 (3–5 nm) at 4 °C for 60–90 min. Competition binding was done on particulate preparations by incubating the preparations in binding buffer including ∼0.2–0.5 nm [3H]des-Arg10-KD or [3H]des-Arg10-[Leu9]KD with and without various concentrations of competitor at 25 °C for 60–90 min. Activities of various receptor constructs were assayed by monitoring PI hydrolysis in HEK293 cells (31Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29603-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PI hydrolysis was assayed in cells pre-labeled with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in DMEM containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. After washing, the cells were incubated in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 5 mm LiCl in the absence and presence of an agonist or antagonist for 30 min at 37 °C. When agonists and antagonists were coincubated, the antagonist was added 5 min before the addition of the agonist and then further incubated for 30 min. HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged receptors were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting essentially as previously described (34De Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J.

In short, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 ml) was then incubated 12–18 h with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:200) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads precoupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with 2 × 1 ml of lysis buffer and then with 1 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The pellet was heated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer containing 6% μ-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C and then electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gel was then electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes and stained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with an immunodetection kit using peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody according to the procedure described by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Where indicated, data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and were compared using the Student's ttest. The receptor binding constants, Kd andKi, for various ligands were calculated by the Radlig program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) using data from radioligand binding experiments. The human WT B1 receptor transiently expressed in HEK293 cells exhibited a typical agonist profile as determined by both receptor binding and receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis. Fig.1, A and B, shows that des-Arg10-KD, a B1 receptor-selective agonist, bound to the B1 receptor with an affinity (Kd = 0.098 nm) and stimulated PI hydrolysis with a potency (EC50 = 1.2 nm) which were ∼4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, higher than those of BK (Kd = 2880 nm, EC50 = 630 nm), a B2 receptor-selective agonist. This profile was clearly different from that of the human WT B2 receptor subtype transiently expressed in HEK293 cells to which BK bound with an affinity (Kd = 0.190 nm) and stimulated PI hydrolysis with a potency (EC50 = 2.0 nm) which were >4 orders of magnitude higher than those of des-Arg10-KD (Kd >5000 nm, EC50 >5000 nm). Ligand-independent, constitutive B1 receptor activity was monitored by assaying for basal cellular PI hydrolysis as a function of the density of the receptors in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Fig. 2 shows a representative experiment in which cells were transfected with increasing amounts of cDNA (0.5–6 μg) of a FLAG-tagged human B1 receptor (B1R-FLAG) and then assayed in parallel for receptor expression by specific [3H]des-Arg10-KD binding and anti-FLAG immunoblotting and for ligand-independent activity by basal PI hydrolysis. PI hydrolysis increased with increasing amounts of des-Arg10-KD binding and the B1 receptor-specific 35-kDa peptide. Fig.3 A shows that the slope factor of the increase in PI hydrolysis as a function of the human WT B1 receptor, which may be considered as an index of ligand-independent receptor activity and which we previously termed the index of basal activity, or IB (31Fathy D.B.

By comparison, the human B1 receptor activity was considerably higher than that of the human B2 receptor, which had an IB of 0.03 (31Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29603-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results show that the B1 receptor is constitutively active, and this activity is evident at receptor densities that would be expected to occur in vivo. Similar results were obtained with the rabbit WT B1 receptor indicating that the constitutive activity was not a peculiarity of the human receptor (data not shown).Figure 3Ligand-independent and agonist-dependent PI hydrolysis by the human B1 and B2 receptors.

B, the effects of des-Arg10-KD and BK on the B1 and B2 receptor, respectively, are shown (dashed arrows). Note the difference in the y axis scale in A and B.

This factor, which we previously termed the index of agonist-promoted receptor activity, or IA (31Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29603-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), represented a 27-fold increase over the IB for the B1 receptor (Fig.3 B). By comparison, a similar increase (23-fold) was observed following addition of 1 μm BK to the B2 receptor-expressing cells (IA = 0.86) (31Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29603-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GPCR antagonists range in their actions from partial agonism to neutral antagonism to inverse agonism. Inverse agonism requires ligand-independent activity and is thought to involve the stabilization of the inactive receptor state. Several B1 receptor peptide antagonists have been developed (TableI). These peptides bound to the human B1 receptor expressed in HEK293 cells with an order of potency that was NPC18565 > B9858 ∼ des-Arg10[Leu9]KD ∼ R715 ∼ des-Arg10HOE140 > des-Arg9[Leu8]BK (Fig.4 A and Table I). As expected, all the peptides, at 1 μm (except des-Arg9[Leu8]BK which was at 10 μm), antagonized B1 receptor-mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis in response to 0.1 μm des-Arg9-BK in these cells (Fig. 4 B, left panel). On the other hand, none of the peptides significantly inhibited the constitutive B1 receptor activity, even though des-Arg10-[Leu9]KD, des-Arg9[Leu8]BK, and NPC18565 appeared to have some effect (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Thus, these peptides are neutral antagonists or, at most, very weakly efficacious inverse agonists on the human B1 receptor in HEK293 cells. Fig.5 A shows the position of Asn121 in TM-III of the human B1 receptor. This residue is conserved in some GPCR, and mutation of residues at this position in several GPCR results in the constitutive activation of the receptors (22Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept.

These observations have led to the belief that these residues participate in an interhelical contact with residues in other transmembrane domains that restrains the receptor in an inactive conformational state. One possibility is that the alignment of this residue is different in the B1 receptor resulting in a weaker contact,i.e. mutation of Asn121 does not lead to an increase in constitutive activity.

In many instances, functional studies have indicated that these sequences are required for second messenger-directed transcriptional responses (for review, see Ref. 6De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 64: 343-369Google Scholar). Whether variations of the CRE from the consensus sequence have functional consequences has not been determined. cAMP response element-binding protein basic leucine zipper cAMP response element CRE modulator activating transcription factor-1 tyrosine aminotransferase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Two general categories of factors can recognize the CRE (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 7Ellenberger T. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The first is composed of factors that can dimerize with CREB. This group includes the CRE modulator CREMα (and the multitude of splice variants that contain the CREMα DNA binding domain) and the activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1). CREMα and ATF-1 recognize the CRE as homodimers and as heterodimers with CREB (9Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 10Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P.

The second category of CRE binding proteins includes factors that cannot heterodimerize with CREB, such as c-Jun, some of the other ATFs, and members of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein gene family (12Yun Y.D. Dumoulin M. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their inability to heterodimerize with CREB, these factors appear to be capable of recognizing DNA sequences that are distinct from the CRE (14Sellers J.W. Vincent A.C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promiscuity in DNA binding is not entirely unexpected, because some of these distinct elements, such as the AP-1 site, differ from the CRE by only a single nucleotide. CREB family members are notable in that they recognize the CRE exclusively, or nearly so. One caveat in this characterization, however, is that the defining features of the CRE have not been established unequivocally. CREB binds as a dimer to the CRE with an affinity of ∼1–2 nm (15Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dimerization and DNA binding are mediated by the adjacent basic and leucine zipper domains (7Ellenberger T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 12-21Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Kerppola T. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At the extreme C-terminal end of the protein is the leucine zipper, characterized by a conserved heptad repeat of seven residues, denoted a–g. The residues at positions a and d typically form a hydrophobic interface, with conserved leucines at positiond. As with other bZIP proteins, this configuration in CREB allows for the formation of a two-stranded parallel coiled-coil and, along with charged residues at positions e and g, presents a plane for dimerization specificity (12Yun Y.D. Dumoulin M. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, dimerization of the CREB monomers apposes the basic regions in a parallel orientation to the DNA, allowing the dimer to bind at a right angle to the DNA helical axis. DNA binding elicits an α-helical conformation of the basic region that facilitates DNA recognition. The basic region of CREB abuts the amino terminus of the leucine zipper. This segment mediates DNA half-site sequence recognition and binding by passing through the major groove and forming several direct and indirect protein-DNA contacts. Insights into the mechanisms underlying CREB dimerization and DNA binding were obtained from the crystal structure of the CREB bZIP·CRE complex (20Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Two features of this structure were unexpected. First was a hexahydrated Mg2+ ion centered on the CRE between the two bZIP monomers at the dimer fork. This hexahydrated Mg2+ ion is not found in related bZIP-DNA complexes and participates in a water-mediated contact between Lys304 in the CREB basic domain and the CRE. Structurally, the hexahydrated Mg2+ ion was proposed to function by positioning and stabilizing the CREB basic region in the CRE major groove. It may also impart additional rigidity to the CREB basic domain, which may prevent binding to shorter or longer divergent CRE sequences. Fluorescence anisotropy assays revealed that CREB bZIP binding to the CRE was dramatically regulated by Mg2+ and other divalent cations. In the absence of divalent cation, binding decreased by at least 20-fold. The divalent cation concentration required for half-maximal binding was 340 μm, approximately the concentration of free Mg2+ ions in many types of cells. Thus, it was proposed that the concentration of free Mg2+ might regulate the level of CREB binding to the CRE. The second unexpected feature of the complex was the mechanism underlying the specificity of CREB dimerization. In addition to predicted electrostatic interactions between Glu319 on one monomer with Arg314 on the other, a critical interhelical hydrogen bond was found between Tyr307 and Glu312 (Fig. 1). The combination of Glu319–Arg314 and Tyr307–Glu312 is unique to members of the CREB family and was proposed to be the primary determinant of CREB, CREMα, and ATF-1 heterodimerization. Of note, although dimerization is generally attributed to leucine zipper sequences, the Tyr307 is located at the C-terminal end of the basic region. Studies in this paper were designed to test the major predictions of the CREB bZIP·CRE crystal structure. First, we wanted to test the specificity of the divalent cation effect by determining whether the interaction of Lys304 with the hexahydrated Mg2+ ion was essential for CREB binding to DNA. Next, we asked whether Mg2+ ions regulated the binding of CREB to consensus and nonconsensus CREs. Finally, we tested the functional importance of the residues predicted to direct CREB dimerization specificity. Our studies confirm the predictions of the CREB-consensus CRE crystal structure and suggest that consensus and nonconsensus CREs interact with CREB through fundamentally distinct mechanisms. Construction of the wild-type full-length and CREB bZIP expression vectors was described by Richards et al. (15Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The three cysteine residues (Cys300, Cys310, and Cys337) in the bZIP region of rat CREB (residues 285–341) were mutated to serine. These mutations improved protein solubility but did not alter DNA binding, as demonstrated by the similar relative affinities of CREB/Ser and wild-type CREB for the CRE (15Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The following mutations were introduced into CREB bZIP/Ser by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide primers from Life Technologies, Inc.: Y307F, Y307R, E319A, E319K, and K304A. Purification of CREB bZIP/Ser proteins was described by Schumacher et al. (20Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Purification of full-length CREB protein was described by Richardset al. (15Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The stability of each bZIP protein was assessed in thermal melting assays by monitoring fluorescence as previously described (21Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, the fluorescence of the two tyrosine residues (positions 307 and 336) in wild-type CREB bZIP was monitored as a function of temperature. Measurements were taken on 1.3 ml of a sample containing 5 μm CREB bZIP in HEPES buffer (pH 7.6; with 50 mm or 150 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of 10 mm Mg2+) in a 6-mm cuvette. Temperature was monitored using a thermistor element/controller device (Omega Engineering Inc.; model no. DP25-TH-A), with the thermistor element positioned in the solution inside the cuvette. Excitation was set at 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 300 nm using 3-nm band pass settings. The emission data were collected by ramping the temperature from 4 to 85 °C at 2 °C/min. The temperature was ramped back down to 4 °C, and the process was repeated for each sample to confirm reversibility of protein folding. The fluorescence intensity data were fit using a nonlinear least squares regression analysis (Sigma Plot; Jandel Scientific). The thermodynamic relationship between the folded and unfolded states of the protein, represented by the melting temperature (T m), was used to compare protein stability and is represented as follows, Tm=ΔHu/ΔSuEquation 1 where ΔH u is the enthalpy and ΔS u is the entropy of unfolding (22Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 23Pace N.C. Scholtz M.J. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Tyrosine emission (300 nm; y axis) was plotted as a function of temperature (in degrees Centigrade). In the thermal melting experiments, the sharp upward slopes represent the transitions between protein folding and unfolding. Pretransition state fluorescence defines the fluorescence of the folded state of the protein (represented by the left tails of the melting curves). Post-transition state fluorescence defines the fluorescence characteristics of the unfolded state (represented by the right tails of the melting curves). By measuring free tyrosine in solution, we confirmed that the downward slopes observed for the pre- and post-transition states were due to the temperature sensitivity of tyrosine fluorescence (data not shown). Assays were performed on the wild-type CREB bZIP, and the mutants K304A, E319A, E319K, Y307F, and Y307R. Note that in the case of the Y307F and Y307R mutants, the emission of only one tyrosine was measured. Although the signal was reduced, the single tyrosine was adequate to measure the transition state of the mutant proteins. Selected proteins were also denatured with urea, yielding profiles that were similar to those produced by thermal melting (data not shown), indicating that heat is a satisfactory denaturing reagent for measuring tyrosine emission. The binding affinities of CREB bZIP proteins for DNA were determined in solution using a PanVera Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system. 5′-Fluoresceinated oligonucleotides corresponding to the somatostatin (5′-CCTGACGTCAGCCCCCTGACGTCAGG-3′), rat c-Fos (5′-AGTGACGTAGGCCCCCCTACGTCACT-3′), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; 5′-CCTTACGTCAGCCCCCTGACGTAAGG-3′), and the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; 5′-TCTGCGTCAGCCCCCTGACGCAGA-3′) CREs were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The CRE binding sites are indicated in boldface type. Each oligonucleotide was designed to form a hairpin with a 5-nucleotide loop and was self-annealed by heating to 95 °C and snap-cooled on ice. Binding experiments with the somatostatin CRE were performed with wild-type and mutant CREB bZIP (residues 283–341) and wild-type full-length CREB (residues 1–341) proteins. Binding reactions with the PEPCK CRE were performed with wild-type and K304A bZIP and wild-type full-length CREB, and those with the c-Fos and TAT CREs were performed with wild-type and K304A CREB bZIP. Protein was titrated into 0.99-ml solutions that contained 1 nm fluoresceinated oligonucleotide in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 6 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of 10 mm MgCl2. Binding reactions were performed at 25 or 37 °C, and samples were incubated for 1 min to achieve equilibrium. Each sample was excited at 490 nm, and emission was measured at 530 nm. The binding curves were fit with a nonlinear least squares regression analysis using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). In addition to the rectangular hyperbolic binding function, the equation utilized for curve fit determination included a nonspecific component to account for the linear increase in polarization at higher protein concentrations. For a curve that begins at y 0 (minimum polarization) and rises toy 1 (maximum polarization), the following equation was used, f=y0+(y1−y0)x/(b+x)+cxEquation 2 where b represents K d as a function of x = [CREB], and c represents the nonspecific constant as a linear additive function (cx). Fig. 1 depicts two magnified views of a portion of the CREB bZIP-consensus CRE complex as reported by Schumacher et al. (20Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Key residues in the basic and leucine zipper domains are highlighted. The continuous α-helical chains are symmetrically apposed at the C-terminal leucine zipper and are fastened by an electrostatic interaction between Arg314and Glu319 as well as hydrogen bonds between Tyr307 and Glu312. The helices pass across the DNA through the major groove, where several residues from the basic region make protein-DNA contacts. The most extraordinary feature of the complex is the hydrated Mg2+ ion, which is juxtaposed between the two α-helices and appears to stabilize the dimer fork on the CRE sequence. A lysine residue (Lys304) in the basic region of each subunit provides a hydrogen bond to one of the coordination waters of the Mg2+ ion (Fig. 1 b). Thus, we hypothesized that Lys304 was essential for Mg2+ ion binding. To test this idea, we mutated Lys304 to Ala and performed thermal stability and fluorescence polarization assays on the mutated and wild-type CREB proteins in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions. Alanine was chosen for this substitution because it is predicted to maintain the helical structure of CREB bZIP. Moreover, the related factor CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α contains an Ala in the corresponding position. The thermal stability of each CREB protein was determined by measuring the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence (contributed by Tyr307 and Tyr336) as a function of temperature. These studies indicated that the conformational stability of the wild-type protein was unaffected by the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions, as indicated by the unchangedT m values (Fig.2 a and TableI; T m = 45.0 ± 0.2 °C with Mg2+, T m = 43.2 ± 0.4 °C without Mg2+). Similarly, the K304A mutation did not have an adverse effect on the conformational stability of the protein (Fig. 2 a and TableI; T m = 47.0 ± 0.3 °C with Mg2+, T m = 46.7 ± 0.3 °C without Mg2+), indicating that divalent ions are not necessary for maintaining structure in the absence of DNA. In contrast, fluorescence polarization measurements indicated that the absence of Mg2+ ions markedly decreased the binding affinity of wild-type CREB for the CRE (Fig. 2 b and TableII; K d = 1.8 ± 0.2 nm with Mg2+, K d > 20 nm without Mg2+), as reported previously (20Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, no binding of CREB bZIP K304A to the CRE was detected even in the presence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 2 b). Thus, the enhancement of CREB binding to the consensus CRE mediated by Mg2+ depends upon the integrity of Lys304.Table IMelting temperatures in the presence or absence of Mg2+ (10 mm)TmWith Mg2+Without Mg2+°C°CWild type45.0 ± 0.243.2 ± 0.4K304A47.0 ± 0.346.7 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIThe effects of Mg2+ (10 mm) on the affinity of CREB bZIP for various CREsConsensusPEPCKc-FosTAT+ Mg2+− Mg2++ Mg2+− Mg2++ Mg2+− Mg2++ Mg2+− Mg2+nmnmnmnmWild type1.8 ± 0.2>201.2 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.34.5 ± 0.210.0 ± 0.19.8 ± 0.2K304ANDND2.0 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.25.5 ± 0.45.7 ± 0.16.3 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.1Values represent K d ± S.E.

For not determined (ND) values, no specific binding was detected up to the concentrations indicated in the figures. With the exception of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) CRE, the binding properties of CREB for nonconsensus CRE sequences have been poorly explored. We recently reported that CREB binds the nonconsensus PEPCK CRE with high affinity (24Fass D.M. Craig J.C. Impey S. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2992-2997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This finding is not altogether surprising, because this sequence differs from the somatostatin CRE by only a single nucleotide (TTACGTCA; the single change in boldface type). However, these studies were performed under standard conditions, in the presence of Mg2+ ions. To test whether CREB binding to nonconsensus CREs similarly required Mg2+, we reanalyzed binding to the PEPCK element in the presence and absence of divalent cation. High affinity binding was detected in both cases (Fig. 3,a and b, and Table II; K d = 1.2 ± 0.4 nm with Mg2+,K d = 1.4 ± 0.2 nm without Mg2+). Similar findings were obtained in binding assays performed using full-length CREB (data not shown). Consistent with these observations, the K304A mutant bound equally to the PEPCK CRE in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3 cand Table II; K d = 2.0 ± 0.4 nmwith Mg2+, K d = 2.0 ± 0.2 nm without Mg2+). These studies indicated that the mechanisms of CREB binding to the PEPCK and consensus CREs must be fundamentally different. Additional binding studies were performed using the c-Fos and TAT CREs. The rat c-Fos promoter contains a CRE element that differs from the somatostatin CRE by two nucleotides, in the seventh and eighth positions (TGACGTAG). The binding affinity of CREB for the c-Fos CRE had not been determined using equilibrium measurements in solution. The TAT promoter contains a CRE that differs from the consensus sequence by three nucleotides (CTGCGTCA) and has been characterized as a prototypical low affinity binding site (25Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of CREB for the TAT CRE was determined to be 11 nm by Richards et al. (15Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We analyzed the TAT and c-Fos CREs in the presence and absence of Mg2+ ions and found that in both instances CREB bZIP binding did not require Mg2+ (Figs. 4 and5; K d = ∼5 nm for the c-Fos CRE and 10 nm for the TAT CRE in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions). This Mg2+ independence of binding to the c-Fos and TAT elements was supported by the ability of CREB bZIP K304A to bind to both sequences irrespective of Mg2+ (Figs. 4 c and5 c).Figure 5CREB binding to the low affinity, nonconsensus TAT CRE does not require Mg2+.Representative fluorescence polarization plots are shown of the wild-type CREB bZIP with Mg2+ (K d = 10.0 nm (a) or without Mg2+(K d = 10.0 nm) (b) and the K304A mutant (with or without Mg2+, K d = 6.3 nm) (c) bound to the TAT CRE. Measurements were plotted as in Fig. 2. The binding curves were repeated at least three times for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two key determinants of dimerization unique to CREB family members are interactions between Glu319–Arg314 and Tyr307–Glu312. To investigate the contributions of these interactions to protein stability and DNA binding, we utilized CREB derivatives generated by mutating Tyr307 to Phe or Arg and Glu319 to Ala or Lys. The Y307F substitution was designed to test the importance of the Tyr307–Glu312 hydrogen bond (Fig.1 a). The Y307R substitution was designed to replace the hydrogen bond with an electrostatic interaction, which was predicted to increase the stability of a potential dimer structure. As compared with wild-type CREB (Fig. 2 a), the Y307F mutant shows a dramatic reduction in thermal stability in 50 mm NaCl (Fig.6 a and TableIII; T m = 24.3 ± 0.6 °C), while the Y307R mutation had a stabilizing effect under this ionic condition (Fig. 6 b and Table III;T m = 55.3 ± 0.3 °C). However, the Y307R mutant was irreversibly denatured at physiological ionic strength (150 mm NaCl), indicating that this concentration of NaCl can interfere with the formation of the Arg307–Glu312 salt bridge (data not shown). Fig. 7 b shows that the Y307F mutant also exhibited a temperature-dependent decrease in binding to the CRE, as determined by fluorescence polarization assays. Compared with wild-type CREB (Fig. 7 a and TableIV; K d = 2.0 ± 0.1 nm at 25 °C, K d = 15 ± 1.1 nm at 37 °C), DNA binding of the Y307F protein was greatly diminished at 25 °C and was abolished at 37 °C (Fig.7 b and Table IV). Thus, the interaction between Tyr307 and Glu312 is crucial for dimerization and subsequent DNA binding.Table IIIMelting temperatures of CREB bZIP proteinsProteinX Tm ± S.E.°CWild type45.0 ± 0.2Y307F24.3 ± 0.6Y307R55.3 ± 0.3E319A29.5 ± 0.8E319KND 3-aND, not determined.3-a ND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab The importance of the Glu319–Arg314interaction to dimer stability and specificity was tested by measuring the thermal stability of proteins containing mutations of Glu319 to Ala or Lys. As shown in Fig.8, both mutations reduced CREB protein stability compared with the wild type CREB bZIP control (Fig.2 a). The E319A substitution reduced dimer stability in an ionic strength-independent manner (Fig. 8 a and Table III;T m = 29.5 ± 0.8 °C; and data not shown), and the E319K mutant appeared completely unfolded at 4 °C, regardless of the ionic strength of the buffer (Fig. 8 b and data not shown). Despite the lowered thermal stability, both derivatives were able to bind to the consensus CRE, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, although with greatly reduced affinity at 25 °C (Fig.9 a and Table IV, E319AK d = 65.0 nm ± 1.1; Fig. 9 b, E319K K d > 250 nm). Consistent with their T m values, binding of both Glu319substitutions to the CRE was completely abolished at 37 °C (Fig. 9,a and b, and Table IV). In this study, we examined the contributions of key residues of the CREB bZIP to structural stability and DNA binding. For these determinations, we utilized thermal melting and fluorescence polarization assays. The melting assays measured the transitions of the mutant and wild-type CREB bZIP proteins from the folded to the unfolded states during thermal denaturation by tracking the emission spectra from tyrosine residues. In the context of the folded protein, the tyrosine fluorescence is quenched, presumably by neighboring residues (26Ross J.B.A. Laws W."

The exposed nature of the catalytic triad suggests that AXEII is a pure esterase,i.e. an α/β hydrolase with specificity for nonlipidic polar substrates. 1G66 acetylxylan esterase single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering Plant cell wall hemicelluloses are complex mixtures of heteropolysaccharides. Their main component is xylan, which is composed of a linear chain of β(1→4)glycosidic-linkedd-xylopyranoses, having various substitutions at carbon 2 and 3 positions (1Joselau J.P. Comptat J. Ruel K. Prog. Biotechnol. 1992; 7: 1-15Google Scholar). Biodegradation of xylan is a complex process catalyzed by several fungal and bacterial enzymes (2Biely P. Trends Biotechnol. 1985; 3: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Although the linear chain is cleaved by endoxylanases and β-xylosidases, acetylxylan esterases (AXE)1hydrolyze O-acetyl substitutions ofd-xylopyranose moieties. Penicillium purpurogenum secretes at least two forms of AXEs, I and II, that demonstrate substrate specificities toward acetate esters ofd-xylopyranose and belong to a new class of α/β hydrolases (3Egaña L. Gutiérrez R. Caputo V. Peirano A. Steiner J. Eyzaguirre J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 24: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar).

Recently, crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of the catalytic core of Trichoderma reeseiAXE have been published (14Hakulinen N. Tenkanen M. Rouvinen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here we present for the first time the complete description of the three-dimensional structure of P. purpurogenum AXEII and its active site at 0.90-Å resolution and 85 K, compare it with the 1.10-Å structure (Protein Data Bank Code:1BS9) determined at 295 K (room temperature), and investigate the structural basis for its acetyl d-xylopyranose specificity. The enzyme was crystallized from ammonium sulfate solution in 50 mmcitrate buffer at pH 5.3 (11Pangborn W. Erman M. Li N. Burkhart B.M. Pletnev V.Z. Duax W.L. Gutiérrez R. Peirano A. Eyzaguirre J.

Diffraction data were collected at the A-1 station of Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source using a 2000 × 2000 pixel charge-coupled device detector. The crystal (0.5 mm × 0.6 mm × 0.1 mm) was flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen vapor using a mixture of glycerol and polyethylene glycol as the cryoprotectant. The x-ray beam was tuned to the wavelength 0.920 Å. The entire data collection was carried out in two separate modes, a high (better than 1.6 Å) and a low resolution. A total of 403 frames of data were collected from two crystals, yielding 420,882 observations and 95,343 unique reflections between 99.0- and 0.90-Å resolution, an 86.6% complete set in the resolution range. The intensities were measured and processed with DENZO software package (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. The HKL Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1995Google Scholar).

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crystal structure of AXEII was determined by the single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method using an iodine derivative. A complete atomic model of the protein was built into this SIRAS map. This starting model was refined separately with both the 1.10-Å and the 0.90-Å data sets collected at 295 K and 85 K, respectively. The refinements were carried out first with XPLOR (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual 3.8. Yale University, New Haven, CT1997Google Scholar) and then with SHELX97 (17Sheldrick G.M. The SHELX-97 Manual. Göttingen University, 1997Google Scholar), implemented on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation. We describe here the procedure carried out with the cryogenic data. The initial XPLOR refinement was conducted using a 2.0ς cut off on structure amplitudes between 99.0 and 0.90 Å, which included 94,055 reflections. The refinement process consisted of 500 cycles of positional refinement followed by simulated annealing starting at 3000 K. Individual atomic temperature factors were refined isotropically yielding an R factor of 0.333. The refinement was further continued with SHELX97. Twelve cycles of conjugate gradient least squares minimization using SHELX97 were carried out leading to a convergence. A test data set of 5% of the total was used for calculating Rfree. During first six cycles, the model was refined isotropically and 290 fully occupied solvent waters and 3 sulfate ions were included in the model. Multiple conformers of serines 31, 36, 50, 58, 70, 74, 90, 120, 204 and tyrosine 177 were also included in the model. At this stage of the refinement, theR factor was 0.154 with an Rfree of 0.169. The seventh cycle of minimization included modeling of the disorder of Ser160, Ser196, and Gln154 side chains. The following cycles of anisotropic refinement of all nonhydrogen atoms reduced the R factor by 0.04 and Rfree by 0.035. Modeling of the multiple occupancies of His187 and further addition of solvent led to the convergence of the refinement process at anR factor of 0.107 for all data. All the computer graphics work was performed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation running CHAIN (18Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar).

Roe S.M. Heo N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Longhi S. Czjzek M. Lamzin V. Nicolas A. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 779-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), neither the 295 K nor the 85 K structure of AXEII shows any weak or poorly defined electron density usually associated with dynamic disorder. The difference between the low and high temperature structures appears to be in the number of amino acid side chains with multiple conformations. The 85 K structure has more multiply observed side chains. However, this could also result from better modeling of side-chain conformations owing to better data quality and higher resolution. The low temperature structure also shows more ordered solvent molecules, with higher number of tightly bound water oxygens and sulfate ions, including the sulfate at the active site, which is absent in the 295 K structure. The crystal structure of AXEII and the catalytic triad Ser90-His187-Asp175 are shown in Fig. 1 a. About 60% or 125 of its 207 amino acids are distributed in ten β-strands (β1 to β10) and six α-helices (α1 to α6). The remaining 82 residues are distributed in five type 1 and 2 β-turns, one γ-hairpin turn, and five extended loop regions. Fig. 1 b is a schematic showing the topology of the secondary structure of AXEII. The strands, loops, and helices have been numbered based on their sequence of occurrence in the polypeptide. All ten cysteine residues are involved in five intrachain disulfide bridge formation (Cys2-Cys79, Cys46-Cys55, Cys101-Cys161, Cys147-Cys179, and Cys171-Cys178). These disulfide bridges involve at least one cysteine in the loop regions. The tertiary structure consists of a doubly wound α/β sandwich, having a central parallel β-sheet flanked by two parallel α- helices on each side. The catalytic cleft is located at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet near the center, bordered by helical residues 183–193 from one side and the loop 105–113 containing an anti-parallel pair of strands from the other. The geometry and relative orientations of side chains of the catalytic triad are similar to those previously observed in other members of the α/β hydrolase family, such as in cholesterol esterase (21Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Pletnev V. Li N. Kaiser R. Pangborn W. Jörnvall H. Erman M. Duax W.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the polypeptide chain is anchored at the second residue by a disulfide bond and then flows into a long strand, β1. The C-terminal end of β1 is adjacent to the catalytic serine at the active site. The polypeptide chain then describes a loop structure, loop 1 (λ1) between residues 13 and 20, before entering the helix α1. After completing the terminal strand β2 of the central β-sheet via a right-handed βαβ-crossover, the polypeptide chain forms a long loop, λ2, between residues 41 and 55, the conformation of which is stabilized by an intra-loop disulfide between Cys46 and Cys52. The helix, α2, the longest secondary element in AXEII, comprises residues 56 through 79. The C-terminal Cys79 of α2 is involved in the disulfide bridge with Cys2, which anchors the N terminus. β3, having residues 83–89, is the central strand at the C-terminal end of which resides the catalytic Ser90 residue. The backbone conformation of Ser90 belongs to the very restrictive (+,−) quadrant of the Ramachandran plot, but otherwise is normal for a catalytic serine in esterases and lipases (22Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Shrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). β3 turns sharply into α3, a three-turn helix, which is the only helix in the interior of the molecule, surrounded completely by protein atoms. The C-terminal Cys101 of the helix is disulfide-bridged to Cys161 from loop λ5. This is followed by a 17-residue loop λ3 between 101 and 117, containing a short anti-parallel segment formed by β4 and β5. The loop ends in a two-turn helix α4 oriented nearly perpendicularly to the sheet, unlike other helices. The next segment of the polypeptide chain between residues 126 and 171 contributes three strands β6, β8, and β10 with terminal residues 127–131, 142–145, and 167–171, respectively, to the central β-sheet, as well as to a short anti-parallel segment, β7 and β9, consisting of residues 135–138 and 148–151, respectively, away from the sheet. The intervening loop λ4, the longest loop in the structure between residues 152 and 166, is held in place by a disulfide bridge between Cys161 and Cys101 from the C-terminal end of α4. All of the secondary structure crossovers are right-handed, whereas the β8-loop-β10 crossover is left-handed. This segment of the polypeptide consisting of peripheral strands and loops are held together by two additional disulfide bonds, between Cys147 and Cys179, and between Cys171 and Cys178, which also anchor the next loop, λ5 consisting of residues 172–183. Asp175 is contributed by this loop to the catalytic triad. Held by two disulfide bonds, the polypeptide chain makes a right-handed turn into a short helix α5 (residues 184–189), which contributes the last of the catalytic side chains, His187. This helix is separated from the C-terminal helix α6 (residues 195–207) by five intervening residues. The only other known structure that is similar to AXEII is that of cutinase, an esterase that hydrolyzes cutin, a polyester component of the waxy layer of a plant's cuticle. The structure of cutinase has been determined at 1.0-Å resolution (20Longhi S. Czjzek M. Lamzin V. Nicolas A. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 779-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a superposition of backbones of AXEII and cutinase. TableIII is an alignment of the AXEII amino acid sequence (7Gutiérrez R. Cederlund E. Hjelmquist L. Peirano A. Herrera F. Ghosh D. Duax W. Jörnvall H. Eyzaguirre J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with that of cutinase based on the secondary structures. In comparison with AXEII, cutinase has 29 additional residues at the N terminus of which the first 16 belong to a signal peptide. The next 13 are present in the crystal structure, where residues are numbered from 17 to 213 (197 amino acids; Protein Data Bank code: 1CEX). Although the overall similarity between the two tertiary structures is striking (the root mean squared deviation for 170 Cα atoms is ∼1.2Å), long insertions and deletions, substitutions, and altered disulfide bond structure account for a large number of local conformational changes, especially in loops around the active site. AXEII has five disulfide bonds, whereas cutinase has only four of these cysteines bonded into two disulfides. All three of these additional disulfides (Cys46-Cys55, Cys101-Cys161, and Cys147-Cys179) are involved in anchoring loops surrounding the active site that are associated with large conformational differences between two polypeptides. In contrast, loop λ1 (residues 13–21) between α1 and β1, adjacent to the active site but away from the substrate-binding cleft, is conformationally quite similar to the one in cutinase. The conformations of λ2 (residues 41–55) in these two structures are such that they project in opposite directions: in cutinase more toward the interior, in the direction of the active site, whereas in AXEII it is pulled outward away from the active site by the disulfide bridge between Cys46 and Cys52. A conformation of this loop like the one in cutinase would be in direct steric conflict with λ3 absent in cutinase. Also, the region 41–43 of the loop has a deletion of three residues in comparison with cutinase, which shortens the path to the disulfide bridge. The loop λ3 consists of an insertion of residues 101–115 that contain a short anti-parallel segment (β4–β5). This segment of polypeptide is absent in cutinase. Its strategic positioning at the rear wall of the active site opening suggests its distinctive role in recognition and processing of acetate side groups of a chain of d-xylopyranose as opposed to cutin molecules by cutinase. The next major difference between the two structures is in loop regions, including λ4, which spans between residues 148 and 166 for cutinase, corresponding to residues 132 and 166, respectively, in AXEII, in spatial positions. This 16-residue insertion in this segment is distributed mainly between two short anti-parallel strands β7 (135) and β9 (148), and the sixth strand of the central β-sheet, β8. Not one of these features of the region is present in cutinase. The presence of Cys101-Cys161 disulfide in AXEII also drastically alters the course of the backbone between residues 154 and 166, although these residues in the two proteins are analogous to each other in spatial positions and sequence alignment. The loop λ5 (residues 172–183 in AXEII and 172–184 in cutinase) contributes Asp175 to the catalytic triad and has one conserved disulfide (Cys171-Cys178); however, the additional disulfide in AXEII (Cys147-Cys179) alters the course of the main chain by pulling it away from the catalytic cleft. In addition to one residue insertion between 179 and 184, the backbone of cutinase in this segment adopts a different path such that the distance between Cα positions of 181 in AXEII and the equivalent 182 in cutinase is 10.4Å. This altered conformation of the polypeptide chain in cutinase partially shields catalytic Asp175 and His188 from exposure to the solvent, in contrast to exposed catalytic His187 in AXEII. Besides, a cutinase-like path for this segment of λ5 in AXEII would put residues 178 and 179 in steric conflict with the backbone of 150–152 of λ4. Residue 184 marks the beginning of a two-turn helix α5, which contains the catalytic histidine (His187 and His188, in AXEII and cutinase, respectively) and is quite similar in both structures. The C-terminal helix α6 in AXEII is similar to that in cutinase, except for the fact that cutinase has four additional C-terminal residues in the helix.Table IIISequence alignment of AXEII and cutinase based on three-dimensional structuresElementβαLoopβLoopαβLoopαβαβCutinase18–2122–2627–3233–4243–5152–6367–7374–8990–109113–119 Ser120121–131Axe4–1213–2021–3336–4041–5556–7983–89 Ser9091–100104–105ElementβαββββLoopβLoopαLoopαCutinase135–140142–148(loop 149–165)166–172173-Asp175–184185-His188 –190192–212Axe110–112118–124127–131135–138142–145148–151152–166167–171172-Asp175 –183184-His187–189190–194195–207 Open table in a new tab The secondary structure elements of the two proteins are otherwise quite similar, except for occasional insertion or deletion of few residues and their spatial displacement. The β-sheet core of the two structures superimposes almost perfectly, except for the terminal strand β2 and the missing β8 in cutinase. The Cα positions and side-chain atoms of the catalytic residues superimpose with an average deviation of 0.3 Å from each other. The active site gorge (Fig. 1 a) is bordered by the following segments of the tertiary structure: λ1 (residues 13–20) and λ2 (residues 41–55) to the left, in the view in Fig. 1 a; β3-to-α3 turn at the center of the gorge, where the three side chains of the catalytic residues are located; and, helix α5, λ5 (residues 175–183), β6-to-β7 turn (residues 132–134), and λ4 (residues 152–161) to the right. The opening of the active site is ∼11 Å across, 7 Å thick from the surface to the catalytic triad, and has a depth of 20 Å to the back wall delineated by residues of λ3 (101). Residues lining the gorge are Glu12, Tyr89, Ser21, Thr24, Gly191, Tyr190, Thr186, Pro176, Tyr177, Gln188, Thr13, Thr14, Gln49, Gly47, Tyr57, Pro134, and Phe152. A sulfate ion, a glycerol, and about 40 water molecules fill up the entire cleft. Of the catalytic residues, Ser90 and His187side chains are fairly exposed to the solvent (each generating 7.1 and 5.7 Å2 of solvent-accessible surfaces, respectively). In contrast, Asp175 is shielded from the solvent by the helix α5 and Pro176. Fig. 3depicts the two conformations of the catalytic residues observed in the 0.90-Å crystal structure determined at 85 K. The gray andgreen side chains of Ser90 and His187 represent conformations A and B, corresponding to 40 and 60% of the molecules in the crystal, respectively. In the A conformation, the most commonly observed in the resting state of esterases and lipases, as well as in the 295 K structure of AXEII (12Ghosh D. Erman M. Sawicki M. Lala P. Weeks D.R. Li N. Pangborn W. Thiel D.J. Jörnvall H. Gutiérrez R. Eyzaguirre J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), Ser90 side chain is trans (χ1 = −172°), whereas the Ser90 Oγ and Asp175Oδ1 atoms are in the plane of the imidazole ring of His187 (deviations of these two atoms from the plane are 0.03 and 0.02 Å, respectively; root mean square deviation from planarity of the ring is 0.05 Å). In the B conformation, the Ser90 side chain is gauche (χ1 = −65°) and the Oγ … Nε2 His187 distance is 3.09 Å, at an approach angle of 102° to the imidazole ring. The two His187 conformations have an average deviation of 0.40 Å with a maximum of 0.80 Å between two Nε2 atoms. The (φ,ψ) angles of His187 A and B conformers are (−62°, −30°) and (−60°, −20°), respectively, and, side-chain (χ1, χ2) torsion angles are (−164°, 61°) and (−164°, 51°), respectively. Conformational states A and B for the catalytic Ser90 and His187 exist at averages of 40 and 60%, respectively, of the volume of the crystal. The A state is not significantly different from the 1.10-Å structure at 295 K (12Ghosh D. Erman M. Sawicki M. Lala P. Weeks D.R. Li N. Pangborn W. Thiel D.J. Jörnvall H. Gutiérrez R. Eyzaguirre J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A to B transition necessitates some rearrangement of other residues of the active site as well. The most notable of them is the movement of Tyr177, which is at a van der Waal's contact distance from the His187 side chain in the A state. Tyr177 moves about 2 Å away to accommodate His187 in the B state (Fig.4). The transition to the B state at 85 K could have been initiated by binding of a sulfate ion to the His187 Nε2 atom through a hydrogen bond formation (His187 Nε2 … O2 SO4 210: 2.75Å) (Fig.5 a). O2 of SO4 210 is also hydrogen-bonded (2.75 Å) to water oxygen 473, which, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr57 side-chain hydroxyl (2.89 Å). The sulfate ion makes four additional hydrogen bond-forming contacts with protein atoms as shown in Fig. 5 a: O3 to Thr13 Oγ (3.03 Å), to Thr13 backbone NH (3.03 Å), and to Gln91 backbone NH (2.98 Å), and O4 to Thr13 Oγ (2.75 Å). In addition, the O1 oxygen of sulfate is coordinated to three water oxygens 465, 488, and 489 through strong hydrogen bonds (average distance ∼2.80 Å) in a tetrahedral manner, all of which are linked to protein atoms by hydrogen bonds (to Gln188 Nε2, Thr13 backbone carbonyl, and Ser90 Oγ; average distance ∼2.84 Å). In the B state, binding of the sulfate ion eliminates three water oxygens that are present only in the A state, namely, 598, 599, and 600. O3 of the sulfate ion replaces water oxygen 598. However, binding of the sulfate ion does not affect water oxygens 465, 473, 488, and 489, all of which are strongly coordinated to protein atoms. These water molecules are also present in the 295 K structure. There is an estimated net gain of two hydrogen bonds in the transition from the A state to the B state.Figure 5Hydrogen bonding interactions at the active site of AXEII in (a) B states and (b) A state. Side chains of residues Ser90, His187, Asp175, Thr13, and Gln91 in both states, as well as SO4 210 and water 598 in B and A states, respectively, are shown. Carbon atoms are shown in gray, nitrogen in blue, oxygen inred, and sulfur in yellow. Bonds in the B state are shown in green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An oxyanion binding site is comprised of two backbone amide groups of Thr13 and Gln91, as well as Ser90Oγ and Thr13 Oγ hydroxyls in the A state, as shown in Fig. 5 b. The Thr13 side chain is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from Gln91 Nε2 (2.90 Å). The water oxygen 598 is thus bound at this oxyanion binding site in a roughly tetrahedral geometry. In the B state, SO4 210 occupies the oxyanion hole by replacing water 598; the position of O3 of the sulfate nearly coincides with the oxygen atom of water 598. Furthermore, in the B state, O2 of SO4 210 occupies what used to be the Ser90Oγ position relative to the His187 imidazole ring in the A state, thus maintaining an orientation to the imidazole ring similar to that of Oγ in the A state. In addition to Ser90, Tyr177, and His187, 10 serine (residues 31, 36, 50, 58, 70, 74, 120, 160, 196, and 204) and Gln154 side chains possess two alternate conformations. These were identified from positive and negative difference electron density maps. The occupancies of the major conformations range between 55 and 75%. All of the alternate conformers have hydrogen bond-forming partners, either protein or solvent atoms, in both conformations. Side chains of the rest of the amino acid residues have well characterized electron densities that uniquely define their conformations. Unlike other high resolution structures, no dynamically disordered region of the polypeptide chain is identifiable. Only the residues at two termini have significantly higher than average temperature factors; their average equivalent isotropic temperature factors are 25 and 45 Å2 for main-chain and side-chain atoms, respectively. The average equivalent isotropic temperature factor for the rest of the protein C, N, and O atoms is about 12 Å2. One of the closest packing interactions between secondary structure elements in the crystal occurs between α1 of one molecule and α2 of another. However, very little direct hydrophobic packing s"

Previously, we showed that disrupting the disulfide bonds of the major house dust mite allergen Der p 2 resulted in 10–100-fold less skin test reactivity in mite-allergic subjects but did not change in vitro T-cell proliferative responses. To provide a more complete picture of the antigenic surface of Der p 2, we report here the identification of three epitopes using hydrogen protection nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The epitopes are defined by monoclonal antibodies that are able to inhibit IgE antibody binding to the allergen. Each monoclonal antibody affected the amide exchange rate of 2–3 continuous residues in different regions of Der p 2. Based on these data, a number of other residues were predicted to belong to each epitope, and this prediction was tested for monoclonal antibody 7A1 by generating alanine point mutants. The results indicate that only a small number of residues within the predicted epitope are functionally important for antibody binding. The molecular definition of these three epitopes will enable us to target limited positions for mutagenesis and to expand our studies of hypoallergenic variants for immunotherapy.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that between 10 and 20% of the world population exhibits some form of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, which is manifested as asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis (1Platts-Mills T.A.

A number of studies have shown that sensitivity to house dust mite allergens is the most important risk factor for asthma (1Platts-Mills T.A. Vervloet D. Thomas W.R. Aalberse R.C. Chapman M.D. J.

Allergy. 1992; 22: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). More than 10 mite allergens have been defined, and the 14-kDa Group 2 allergens (Der p 21 and Der f 2) are considered major allergens because of the fact that 80–90% of patients have specific IgE Ab to these allergens (3Heymann P.W.

Previously we reported that Der p 2 is structurally a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, although the function of the allergen remains unknown (4Mueller G.A. Benjamin D.C. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12707-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therapy for allergic disease includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and allergen-specific immunotherapy. Recently, new strategies for immunotherapy have been proposed with the aim of improving efficacy, patient compliance, and associated risks (5Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Bousquet J. Yssel H. Immunotherapy in Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Our studies have focused on the generation of hypoallergenic variants; the underlying hypothesis is that reducing IgE reactivity will reduce IgE-mediated side effects (6Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mapping of epitopes on Der p 2 and Der f 2 is an important step toward the development of hypoallergenic variants. Using murine mAb and sera from mite-allergic subjects, we have shown that the epitopes on the Group 2 allergens are conformational and that the three disulfide bonds stabilize this structure (6Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Lombardero M. Heymann P.W. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Fox J.W. Chapman M.D. J.

Although the above studies have been informative, they provide an incomplete map of the epitopes and do not necessarily identify those residues on Der p 2 that contribute significantly to the binding energy. Epitopes can also be mapped by measuring changes in amide hydrogen exchange rates of the antigen that occur as a result of the formation of an immune complex (11Patterson Y. Englander S.W. Roder H. Science. 1990; 249: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12Benjamin D.C. Williams D.C. Smith-Gill S.J. Rule G.S.

Biol. 1996; 257: 866-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These rates can be conveniently measured using NMR techniques. This method was first used by Pattersonet al. (11Patterson Y. Englander S.W. Roder H. Science. 1990; 249: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to localize the epitope of an anti-cytochromec mAb. We have subsequently measured similar effects in a number of anti-lysozyme antibodies (13Williams D.C. Benjamin D.C. Poljak R.J. Rule G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 866-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In general, those residues that are in the structural epitope (those that either contact the Ab or are buried by it) show the largest reduction in exchange rates. Once the location of the epitope has been obtained using amide exchange measurements the residues, which are important for mAb binding, can be systematically identified using scanning alanine mutagenesis (14Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Lin W. Teng C. Tsuchiya D. Li H. Ysern X. Braden B.C. Li Y.

Methods ( Orlando ). 1996; 9: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mutation to alanine reduces the side chain to as small as possible without substantially altering the secondary structure. Usually, glycine and proline are not altered, because both of these residues strongly influence the configurational entropy of the peptide chain. This approach has been used to map B-cell epitopes in a number of different model systems. Jin et al. (14Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) studied 43 different mutants of human growth hormone in combination with 21 different monoclonal antibodies. A study by Dall'Acqua et al. (15Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Lin W. Teng C. Tsuchiya D. Li H. Ysern X. Braden B.C. Li Y. Smith-Gill S.J. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7981-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) introduced alanine mutations into both the antibody and antigen (lysozyme) and reported the structure of a complex between the antibody and one of the lysozyme mutants. Benjamin and Perdue (16Benjamin D.C. Perdue S.S. Methods ( Orlando ). 1996; 9: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) characterized the interaction of 70 mutants of staphylococcal nuclease with 10 different mAb. All of these studies found that an average of 3 to 4 residues were energetically important to mAb binding. In this study, a residue was classified as being energetically or functionally important if the free energy of binding of the mutant to mAb binding was 1.0 kcal/mol or greater. The studies of growth hormone and staphylococcal nuclease examined virtually the entire surface of the respective proteins, and the study of lysozyme involved residues known to be in contact with Ab from crystallographic studies. In this study, the hydrogen exchange data were used to provide a starting point for a more focal analysis of the epitopes on Der p 2. Recombinant Der p 2 (rDer p 2) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures as previously described (9Mueller G.A. Smith A.M. Williams D.C. Hakkaart G.A. Aalberse R.C. Chapman M.D. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26893-26898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was recovered from the insoluble fraction of the cell sonicate and resolubilized with 6m guanidine (one-fifth the original cell culture volume), and after dialysis against buffer (10 mm Trizma (Tris base), 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), the protein was purified by mAb affinity chromatography. 15N-Labeled protein was obtained by growing the bacteria on a minimal medium with15N-ammonium sulfate as the sole nitrogen source. The murine mAb used in this study were produced at the University of Virginia Lymphocyte Culture Center and have been described in detail elsewhere (17Ovsyannikova I.G. Vailes L.D. Li Y. Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mAb αDpX was produced by Dr. Rob Aalberse and colleagues (18van der Zee J. Van Swieten P. Jansen H.M. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1988; 81: 884-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassay and ELISA have shown that this panel of 8 mAb defines three antigenic regions on Der p 2 (17Ovsyannikova I.G. Vailes L.D. Li Y. Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the mAb 7A1, αDpX, and 6D6 were selected as representative of these regions. For this study, mAb were purified from ascites fluid by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 followed by affinity chromatography using an rDer p 2 antigen affinity column. Protein concentrations were calculated using extinction coefficients of E0.1% = 1.42 and E0.1% = 0.72 for murine IgG and rDer p 2, respectively. The resins used for the mAb purification and the amide proton exchange rate protection studies (described below) were constructed using Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to manufacturer protocols. Briefly, 25 mg of protein was coupled per 1 ml of gel bed in a buffer of 0.1 m MOPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Typically greater than 95% of the protein coupled to the matrix. The capacities of the columns were as follows: rDer p 2 column, 27 mg of mAb; mAb 6D6 column, 5 mg of rDer p 2; mAb 7A1 column, 10 mg of rDer p 2; and mAb αDpX column, 13 mg of rDer p 2. Increasing concentrations of mAb were used to inhibit IgE binding to rDer p 2 in a modified enzyme immunoassay. The antigen was bound directly to the microtiter plate or presented by mAb αDpX. Sera were added along with increasing concentrations of mAb so that the final concentration of serum was 1:4 or 1:8, and the concentration of mAb ranged from 0.01 to 100 μg/ml. IgE binding was detected using biotinylated goat anti-human IgE (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The percent inhibition was calculated from theA405 of IgE Ab binding to rDer p 2 in the absence of inhibitor mAb. The positive control experiment used the anti-Der p 2 chimeric mAb 2B12-IgE developed by Schurmann et al. (19Schurmann J. Perdok G.J. Lourens T.E. Parren P. Chapman M.D. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 99: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sera from 4 mite-allergic subjects (radioallergosorbent assay positive to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinusextract), pooled sera from 7 additional subjects, and 1 radioallergosorbent assay negative control subject were tested. The amide exchange kinetics of the mAb·rDer p 2 complex was measured using the method described by Williams et al. (13Williams D.C. Benjamin D.C. Poljak R.J. Rule G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 866-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly15N-rDer p 2 was loaded on the mAb column in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) and washed with three column-volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. This was followed with three more column-volumes of NMR sample buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm K2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 m EDTA, pH 6.6) made with 99% D2O. Time 0 was considered the time at which the second volume of buffer was added. The columns were left at 4 °C for 48 h and then rinsed with 3 volumes of D2O before elution with 0.2 m acetic acid. The eluted protein was titrated to pH 3.2 using NaOH to quench the amide exchange. The 48-h control sample was made by concentrating and diluting the protein 3 times with the deuterated exchange buffer. The exchange was considered initiated after the first dilution, because the sample was greater than 94% D2O at this point. After a 48-h incubation at 4 °C the sample was titrated to pH 3.2 with HCl to quench the reaction. The protein was then placed into column elution buffer by 3 rounds of concentration and dilution. The control sample for the 0-h time point and the sample used for the assignment of the spectra were in H2O containing 0.2 m acetic acid. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Unity Plus spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 500 MHz. Amide peak intensities were obtained from two-dimensional HSQC spectra acquired using 256 t1 points and 1024 t2 points and with 64 transients (20Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1993; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional HSQC-NOESY spectra (21Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) were obtained as previously described (9Mueller G.A. Smith A.M. Williams D.C. Hakkaart G.A. Aalberse R.C. Chapman M.D. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26893-26898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All spectra were transformed and analyzed using Felix 95.0 (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) with standard protocols. Residues potentially within a given epitope were predicted by taking the midpoint between the two protected residues that were furthest apart and determining which residues had atoms that were less than 12.5 Å from this point. A 12.5-Å radius circle would have an area of 490 Å2 whereas a sphere of this radius would have a surface area of 1,960 Å2 (22Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Considering that the surface of protein antigen epitopes are convoluted, the area predicted should exceed the 600–900-Å2 surface area of known protein epitopes (22Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) and thus over-predict the size of the epitope. The accessible surface area was determined using a 9.0-Å probe (23Novotny J. Handschumacher E. Haber E. Bruccoleri R.E. Carlson W.B. Fanning E.W. Smith J.A. Rose G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Residues with accessible side chains (see Table II) were changed to alanine using the QuickChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was isolated using Wizard Plus minipreps (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced using automated methods. Because a polymerase chain reaction-based method was used to create the mutations, the entire coding sequence of each mutant was sequenced to ensure that no unintended changes were introduced.Table IIMutants of Der p 2 and the change in ΔΔG of binding mAb 7A1ResidueIC50 NativeIC50 MutantrelKAΔΔGΔGΔGNative/mutantkcal/molHis-302.365.640.420.52 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Arg-312.3630.000.081.51 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Lys-332.3610.820.220.93 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Ser-572.3910.650.230.88 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Asp-592.632.171.21−0.11Leu-612.632.660.990.01Val-632.753.930.700.21Asn-931.8011.040.161.07 2-bThe mutant N93A failed to interact with the αDpX control mAb.Lys-962.7513.510.200.94 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Ile-972.6112.790.200.94 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Lys-1002.472.710.910.06Ser-1012.472.830.870.08Glu-1022.756.430.430.50 2-aMutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.Asn-1032.472.960.840.11Val-1052.612.421.08−0.05Thr-1232.122.101.01−0.07His-1241.802.390.750.17Lys-1261.802.530.710.20Ile-1272.392.690.890.07Arg-1282.394.290.560.35Asp-1292.614.200.620.282-a Mutants showing ΔΔG greater than 0.50 kcal/mol.2-b The mutant N93A failed to interact with the αDpX control mAb. Open table in a new tab The ability of rDer p 2 and the various alanine mutants to inhibit mAb binding to solid phase rDer p 2 was measured using a goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (9Mueller G.A. Smith A.M. Williams D.C. Hakkaart G.A. Aalberse R.C. Chapman M.D. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. J. Biol.

The curves were fit to a sigmoidal function using Sigma Plot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) to determine the concentration of 50% inhibition (IC50). Relative binding constants were calculated, according to Equation 1, as follows. rel KA=IC50putive /IC50 mutant(Eq. 1) The change in free energy of the binding reaction as a result of the mutation was calculated from Equation 2 (13Williams D.C.

Consequently, a ΔΔG greater than 0.5 kcal/mol was considered significant. The mAb used in this study have been characterized by a variety of techniques including inhibition radioimmunoassay and ELISA and have been shown to define three antigenic regions on Der p 2 (17Ovsyannikova I.G. Vailes L.D. Li Y. Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that these antigenic regions also represent IgE-binding regions, we determined the ability of each mAb to inhibit the binding of IgE from allergic sera. Fig.1, panel A shows the control experiment using the murine-human chimeric IgE mAb that contains the 2B12 variable region. The data in panel A clearly show that inhibition of binding of the 2B12-IgE hybrid occurs only when the inhibiting mAb bind to the same antigenic region as does the 2B12 mAb itself. For example, only mAbs 1D8, 6D6, 4G7, and 2B12, which were previously shown by classical competitive inhibition studies to bind to the same antigenic regions on Der p 2 (17Ovsyannikova I.G. Vailes L.D. Li Y. Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), are capable of inhibiting the binding of the 2B12-IgE chimeric mAb in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, mAb 7A1 and αDpX, each of which binds to one of two other nonoverlapping regions, do not inhibit. These results are in complete agreement with a more detailed study on the competitive inhibition of these and other mAb for binding to Der p 2 (17Ovsyannikova I.G. Vailes L.D. Li Y. Heymann P.W. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Panels B and C show the ability of mAb to competitively inhibit binding of IgE in sera from two house dust mite-allergic subjects, and panel D shows results using pooled sera from 7 additional mite-allergic subjects. Each serum gave unique curves, and the maximum inhibition at 100 μg/ml ranged from 10 to 50% for any given mAb. Thus, the ability of the mAb to inhibit IgE binding to rDer p 2 suggests that these mAb are appropriate markers for IgE epitopes. Fig.2 shows sections of HSQC spectra of rDer p 2 for experiments conducted with mAb 7A1. Peaks for residues 73, 94, 97, and 101 are shown. The panels show spectra acquired in H2O (left), after 48 h in D2O (center), and after 48 h in D2O of a complex of Der p 2 and mAb 7A1 (right). These spectra clearly show that residues 94 and 101 were strongly protected from amide proton exchange while complexed with mAb. In contrast residue 97 was weakly protected, and residue 73 was not protected at all. A similar analysis of spectra obtained for rDer p 2 complexed with mAb αDpX and mAb 6D6 (data not shown) showed that residues 72, 73, and 75 were protected by mAb αDpX, and residues 111 and 116 were protected by mAb 6D6. The protected residues are highlighted on the structure of rDer p 2 in Fig. 3. Also displayed in Fig. 3 are the accessible surfaces of those residues that were predicted to be involved in the full structural epitope. The amino acid residues predicted to be in the epitope for each mAb are listed in Table I.Figure 3Epitopes of mAb 7A1, mAb αDpX, and mAb 6D6.

We selected mAb 7A1, because previous studies had shown that Lys-100 was important for binding (8Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only those amino acids with side chain exposure to solvent were analyzed. For example, although Trp-92 and Val-94 are both within the predicted epitope, they do not show any side chain exposure to solvent. Also systematically excluded from mutagenesis were glycine and proline residues. The binding of mAb 7A1 to these mutants was measured using competitive inhibition ELISA, and the calculated IC50values for these mutants are shown in Table II. A total of 8 residues (amino acids 30, 31, 33, 57, 93, 96, 97, and 102) showed a ΔΔG value greater than 0.5 kcal/mol, strongly suggesting that each of these residues contribute significantly to the binding affinity (Fig.4). The reduction in binding affinity, which occurred as a result of the mutation, was likely to be caused by changes in the direct interaction of the mAb with the altered residue. Alternatively, the mutation may have affected the secondary or tertiary structure of Der p 2. As a control, the alanine mutants were used to inhibit mAb αDpX binding to rDer p 2. The only mutant that did not interact with mAb αDpX in a manner similar to the native protein was N93A (data not shown). Thus the effect of this mutation cannot be definitively attributed to direct interactions of residue Asn-93 with mAb 7A1. Although the control experiments with mAb αDpX could identify gross changes in the structure, it was possible that more subtle changes occurred in the mutant proteins. Consequently, a detailed analysis of the K33A mutant was performed to assess the magnitude of the changes in the structure of Der p 2 due to this mutation. The HSQC spectrum of K33A was very similar to rDer p 2, and a portion of this spectrum is shown in Fig. 5 A. Theboxes overlaid on this section of the spectrum indicate the position of peaks in the HSQC spectrum of rDer p 2. One peak disappeared (at 120 ppm nitrogen and 7.32 ppm proton), this peak corresponded to Lys-33. Two new peaks from Ala-33 appeared that were not in the spectrum of rDer p 2. The presence of two peaks indicated that this residue exchanged slowly between two different conformations. However, the structure of these two conformations must be similar based on the similar pattern of NOEs for Ala-33 shown in Fig. 5 C. In an analysis of the full HSQC spectra, the only other peaks that shifted in the spectrum of K33A were Gly-32 and Val-94. The HSQC spectrum shown in Fig. 5 A suggests that the replacement of Lys-33 by Ala was not totally benign. To show that the changes in chemical shifts were not indicative of a significant structural rearrangement of the K33A protein, a three-dimensional15N1H HSQC-NOESY was acquired to detect changes in interproton distances. A section of this spectrum, corresponding to the amide proton of Ala-33, is shown in Fig. 5 C. For comparison the region of the same spectrum for residue Lys-33 in rDer p 2 is shown in Fig. 5 B. Indicated on these spectra are the NOE assignments from the previous structure determination. The same sequential and long range NOEs were found in the spectra of rDer p 2 and the spectrum of the K33A mutant. The NOEs from residue Ala-33 that are similar to those from Lys-33 are the sequential NOEs to the alpha protons of residues 32 and 34 and the long range peaks to the methyl protons of Val-94. Examining the NOEs from the new amide peak indicated that the differences in the spectra were the lack of intraresidue peaks due to the Lys-33 side chain protons and a new peak that was likely the methyl of Ala-33. These changes would be expected because of replacement of Lys by Ala. An examination of the NOEs from Val-94 and Gly-32 showed similar results; the pattern of NOEs did not change as a result of the K33A mutation (data not shown). These results indicate that there are no large structural changes induced by the K33A mutant; thus, this residue is likely to be in direct contact with mAb 7A1. To date, no data exist describing IgE Ab binding sites for any allergen at the molecular level. The lack of allergen-specific monoclonal IgE Ab precludes epitope mapping using crystallographic analysis of allergen-antibody complexes.

Src homology phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase post-synaptic density N-methyl-d-aspartate membrane-associated guanylate kinase Semaphorins are a large family of structurally distinct, secreted and transmembrane glycoproteins characterized by the presence of a conserved sema domain of about 500 amino acids (1Tessier-Lavigne M.

Several secreted semaphorins (group 3 semaphorins in vertebrates), such as Sema3A, E, and F (3Semaphorin Nomenclature Committee, Cell, 97, 1999, 551, 552.Google Scholar) induce the collapse of some populations of growth cones in cultured neurons and thus can function as inhibitory and repulsive cues in axonal guidance (1Tessier-Lavigne M.

Evidence implicating secreted semaphorins in chemorepulsion came initially from the finding that chick Sema3A can cause the collapse of the chick dorsal root ganglion growth cone (4Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Later studies have shown that Sema3A also acts as a chemorepellent for a variety of sensory and motor axons in mammals (5Adams R.H. Lohrum M. Klostermann A. Betz H. Puschel A.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6077-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Kobayashi H. Koppel A.M. Luo Y. Raper J.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8339-8352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is only limited evidence concerning the roles of transmembrane semaphorins in the nervous system. Of group 4 semaphorins, Sema4C (S4C, previously called M-SemaF) is especially expressed in neuronal tissues of embryos, suggesting some function of S4C in the neural tissues, such as directing axon pathfinding, axonal target selection, or synapse formation, although no evidence for such functions has been provided so far (9Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another group 4 semaphorin, Sema4D (previously called M-SemaG or hCD100; Refs. 10Furuyama T.

Sema6B forms a complex with c-Src through a proline-rich intracellular domain (12Eckhardt F. Behar O. Calautti E. Yonezawa K. Nishimoto I. Fishman M.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of S4C contains a proline-rich region that may interact with Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domains as well as cytoskeletal proteins, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of S4C may interact with some signaling-related proteins. To explore possible functions and the intracellular signaling of S4C, we investigated in which tissues and at which developmental stages S4C is expressed and then attempted to screen proteins that interact with S4C intracellularly. Based on yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified several PSD-95 isoforms as proteins interacting with S4C. Recently, a number of proteins have been shown to contain PDZ domains, which were originally recognized as repeats of about 90 amino acids in PSD-95/SAP90 and named after three proteins containing such repeats, PSD-95, the Drosophila septate junction protein discs-large (DLG-A), and the epithelial tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) (13Pawson T.

PDZ proteins were originally thought to mediate the concentration of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels at the synapses of neurons, as well as the asymmetric distribution of receptors in epithelial cells or their localization at tight junctions (19Sheng M.

Moreover, some of these PSD proteins also serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes at the membrane (13Pawson T. Scott J.D.

They mediate protein-protein interactions, generally recognizing short C-terminal motifs, originally described as the (T/S)XV motif (24Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one such consensus PDZ binding motif, SSV, is also seen in the C terminus of S4C (9Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated whether PSD-95 interacts with S4C in the central nervous system. Antibodies to S4C were raised in rabbits against the product of pGEX5X1 S4Ccd, which is the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of S4C. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to PSD-95 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal antibody to HA was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Tokyo) and mouse monoclonal antibody to Myc (9E10) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (New England Bio Labs, Beverly, MA) was used as the second antibody for immunoblot detection. Embryos and postnatal and adult ddY mice were purchased from SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). Tissues were homogenized with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The protein concentration was measured by the method of Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Twenty μg of each protein homogenate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Primary antisera to S4C, PSD-95, HA, and Myc were used at a 1: 2000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using CDP-Star detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the corresponding alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antiserum. The predicted cytoplasmic domain of the C-terminal amino acids of S4C (S4Ccd) (residues 663–834) was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid technique following the instructions of the Matchmarker two-hybrid assay system (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid libraries in pVP16 constructed from adult rat brain cDNA (26Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were screened using pGBT9. The bait vector pGBT9 was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the cytoplasmic domain of S4C. β-Galactosidase (GAL) assays were performed using doubly transformed Y190 yeast cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal) as previously described (26Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prokaryote and eukaryote expression vectors were constructed in pGEX5X1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGBT9 (CLONTECH), pVP16, pCMV, pCMV Myc, and pEF HA (Invitrogen) using standard molecular biology methods (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fusion protein with S4Ccd in pGBT9 and pGEX5X1 was prepared with a polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified from a plasmid containing mouse S4C cDNA (9Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using reverse primer GCGTCGACTATACTGAAGACTCCTCTGG and forward primer GCGAATTCTGGGGCACGAGTGGCTC. The S4C mutant construct pGEX-S4C*cd (C-terminal three amino acids SSV (832) replaced with AAA) was prepared with a polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified from the S4C plasmid using reverse primer GCGTCGACTATGCTGCAGCCTCCTCTGGGTTGTTGGAGTC and forward primer GCGAATTCTGGGGCACGAGTGGCTC. pEF HA S4C, which contains the HA-tagged full-length coding region of S4C was used as a mammalian expression plasmid. pCMV Myc PSD-95-1 (the full-length sequence of rat PSD-95), pCMV PSD-95-2 (rat PSD-95 containing the first (PDZ1) and second PDZ (PDZ2) domains), pCMV PSD-95-3 (rat PSD95 containing the PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 domains), pCMV PSD-95-4 (rat PSD-95 lacking the PDZ3 domain), and pCMV Myc PSD-95-5 (rat PSD-95 containing PDZ3, SH3, and guanylate kinase (GK) domains) were prepared using polymerase chain reaction fragments which were inserted into theEcoRI/SalI sites of respective vectors. The prey vectors of pVP16 ratPSD95–8 (PDZ1+PDZ2+PDZ3), pVP16 SAP102 (PSDZ1+PDZ2+ PDZ3), pVP16 ratPSD-93 (PDZ1+PDZ2+PDZ3), pVP16 mouseZO-1 (PSDZ1+PD-Z2+PDZ3), and pVP16 Drosophila DLG-A (PDZ1+ PDZ2+PDZ3) (28Irie M.

Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) were used for the β-galactosidase assays of yeast cotransformations with the bait vector pGBT9-S4Ccd. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-fused wild-type S4Ccd and GST-fused C-terminal mutant GST-S4C*cd proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (26Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with pCMV Myc PSD-95 (PSD-95-1), and various mutant plasmids of PSD-95 inserted into pCMV or pCMV Myc (PSD-95-2, -3, -4, and -5; see Fig. 4). The cells (in 10-cm plates) were homogenized in 0.3 ml of extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 min. Five hundred μl of the supernatant (original) of GST, GST-S4Ccd, and GST-S4C*cd proteins were fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the beads were washed with the extract buffer (flow through), proteins on the beads were subjected to the immunoblot analysis. Synapttosomal membrane and PSD (PSD1 and 2) fractions were prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult mice as previously described (26Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cerebral cortexes from eight adult mice were homogenized in 36 ml of homogenization buffer (4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 0.32 m sucrose, and 1 mm PMSF) in a glass Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 15 min, and the resulting crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) was washed twice by resuspension in 24 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifugation at 10,200 ×g for 15 min. The washed P2 pellet (P2′) was lysed by osmotic shock with ice-cold distilled water, homogenized in a glass Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to yield a supernatant (S3, crude synaptic vesicle fraction) and pellet (P3, lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction). The P3 fractions was resuspended in an appropriate volume of homogenization buffer and loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (1.2 msucrose, 0.8 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1 h. Thereafter, the fraction was removed from the interface between 1.2 m sucrose and 0.8 msucrose) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet (synapttosomal membrane) was incubated for 15 min in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at 32,000 g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant (S) the PSD pellet (PSD1). This PSD1 pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume of homogenization buffer and incubated again for 15 min in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at 201,800 × g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant (S) and the PSD pellet (PSD2). The S3 fraction was centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 2 h, and the resulting pellet (synaptic vesicle fraction) contained synaptic vesicle proteins. 10 μg of protein from each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with pCMV Myc PSD-95-1 and pEF HA S4C or pEF HA S4C* by the calcium phosphate method as previously described (29Sakai T. Furuyama T. Ohoka Y. Miyazaki N. Fujioka S.

The supernatant from the cell extracts prepared by lysis with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA was diluted with two volumes of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-S4C or anti-PSD-95 antibody. The synaptosome fraction prepared from the cerebral cortexes of eight animals was homogenized in 16 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 6 m urea, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 3 liters of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4 and 100 mm NaCl with one exchange of dialysis buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove the insoluble proteins. 4-ml aliquots of the supernatant (input) were incubated with the monoclonal anti-PSD95 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or the normal mouse serum for 3 h, and immune complexes were collected on 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL4B. After washing with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 33 mmNaCl and 0.33% Triton X-100, the protein A beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PSD-95 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or the antibodies to S4C. HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV Myc PSD-95 and pEF HA S4C were stained with the indirect immunofluorescence method. Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were reacted with monoclonal antibody to Myc and polyclonal antibodies to S4C, nd then incubated with Cy2- or Cy3-labeled second antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cortical neurons cultured on the poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (31Goslin K. Banker G. Goslin K. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 339-370Google Scholar) were also stained with the indirect immunofluorescence method using monoclonal antibody to PSD-95 and polyclonal antibody to S4C as described above. Immunofluorescence was visualized using a laser scanning confocal system (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemistry was performed on adult mouse brain sections by the ABC method as previously described (32Inagaki S. Takagi H. Suzuki K. Akai F. Taniguchi N. Brain Res. 1991; 541: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cryostat sections prepared from 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed animals were reacted with the antibodies to S4C either with or without antigen or with the antibody to PSD-95 and then incubated with biotinylated second antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After reaction with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Vecstatin ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA), immunoreactivity was visualized with diaminobenzidine (Dotite, Japan). As semaphorins have primarily been found to act as axon guidance molecules during development of the nervous system, it is important to clarify in which tissues and at which developmental stages S4C is expressed. We analyzed the protein expression in homogenates from various tissues. A protein of about 100 kDa was detected in homogenates from brain by immunoblot analysis using the antiserum generated to the S4Ccd (Fig. 1). Examination of various tissues revealed that S4C protein was predominantly expressed in the brain, whereas little or none was detected in the other tissues, including heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Only traces of the protein were detected in placental tissue (Fig. 1 A). Next we analyzed the protein expression in brain homogenates during at various developmental stages (Fig. 1 B). S4C was apparent in the brain on embryonic day 14 (E14); thereafter, the protein level markedly increased by birth, and high levels of S4C were detected at birth and during the postnatal developmental stage at postnatal days 7 and 14. The expression was still very strong in the adult brain, suggesting that the S4C functions in the adult brain as well as in the developing brain. In an effort to study the functional mechanism of S4C, we searched for proteins that can bind to S4Ccd. We used the entire cytoplasmic domain of mouse S4C inserted into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH) as bait to screen an adult rat brain cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid assay (26Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained 37 positive clones from 3 × 106 colonies. Eleven clones were false positives that encoded transcription factors. Sequence analysis revealed nine independent clones among 19 overlapping positive clones that represented three PSD-95 isoforms. Of these nine independent clones, four clones represented PSD-93/chapsin-110 (GenBankTMaccession numbers; RNU49049, Ref. 33Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

These clones representing PSD-95 isoforms necessarily contain the complete or partial sequence (longer than two-thirds) of the predicted PDZ1 domain and the complete sequence of PDZ2 but do not necessarily contain the following middle and C-terminal domains, PDZ3, SH3, and GK domains. To test whether S4Ccd interacts with various MAGUK (PDZ containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase) members including ZO-1, a tight junction protein, and DLG-A, a Drosophilaseptate junction protein, as well as PSD-95 isoforms, the interactions were monitored as β-galactosidase activity by using the yeast two-hybrid systems. Yeast cells were cotransformed with a bait vector pGBT9 S4Ccd and one of following prey vectors containing a MAGUK member such as pVP16 PSD-95/SAP90, SAP102, PSD-93/chapsin-110, ZO-1, and DLG-A. S4Ccd interact with the N terminus of PSD-95/SAP90, SAP102, and PSD-93/chapsin-110, which contain the three PDZ domains but lack the C-terminal SH3 or GK domains (Fig.2). In contrast, we observed no interaction of S4Ccd proteins with the PDZ domains of a tight junction protein, ZO-1, or a Drosophila septate junction protein, DLG-A. Thus, there appears to be a specific interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of S4C with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 isoforms of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95/SAP90, PSD-93/chapsin-110, and SAP102. Because PSD-95 is the best characterized member of the above identified PSD-95 isoforms, PSD-95 was used for the following studies. The interactions observed above were next explored via “pull-down” assays in which GST fusion proteins bearing wild type (GST-S4Ccd) or C-terminal mutated S4Ccd (GST-S4C*cd) were used to pull down the full-length PSD-95 proteins and various truncated forms of PSD-95 expressed in mammalian cells. Cell extracts from COS cells transfected with pCMV Myc-PSD-95 were incubated with immobilized GST-S4Ccd or GST-S4C*cd proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed no interaction of PSD-95 with GST but showed a strong interaction of PSD-95 with GST- S4Ccd (Fig.3). Substitution of three amino acid residues with three alanines at the C terminus of S4Ccd (GST-S4C*cd) abolished the interaction with PSD-95. These in vitrobinding experiments suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of S4C interacts with PSD-95. Next, we investigated which region of PSD-95 interacts with S4C. Cell extracts from COS cells transiently expressing wild type (PSD95–1) and mutated PSD-95 (PSD95–2 ∼ 5)(Fig.4, A and B) were incubated with immobilized GST-S4Ccd proteins (Fig. 4 C). Wild type PSD-95 and three truncated forms, PSD-95-2 (PDZ1 + PDZ2), PSD-95-3 (PDZ1 + PDZ2 + PDZ3), and PSD-95-4 (PDZ1 + PDZ2 + SH3 + GK) bound to GST-S4Ccd, whereas removal of PDZ1 and PDZ2 from PSD-95 (PSD-95-5) almost completely abolished the association with GST-S4Ccd (Fig. 4 C). These in vitro binding experiments suggest that the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PSD-95 interact with the C terminus of S4C. To confirm the interaction of PSD-95 and full-length S4C in a cellular environment, HEK293cells were cotransfected with pCMV Myc PSD-95 and pEF HA S4C wild type or pEF HA S4C*mutant. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies on protein A beads and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-S4C antibody (Fig.5, upper right panel) or with anti-PSD-95 antibody (Fig. 5, lower right panel). Anti-Myc antibody precipitated the Myc-PSD-95 protein from transfected cells, and Myc-PSD-95 protein coimmunoprecipitated with HA-S4C protein andvice versa. HA-S4C protein precipitated as a complex containing Myc-PSD-95 protein, whereas HA-S4C* mutant protein failed to precipitate Myc-PSD-95 protein. PSD-95 is a synapse-associated protein, enriched in PSD fractions (15Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1995; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) (Fig.6). If S4C interacts with PSD-95 in the brain, S4C should be enriched in PSD fractions. We explored whether S4C is concentrated in the synaptosome and PSD fractions by immunoblotting analysis using antiserum to S4C (Fig. 6). S4C was enriched in the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) fraction as compared with the homogenate or cytosolic synaptosomal (S2) fraction. The subfractionation of P2 crude synaptosomal pellet into the synaptic vesicle fraction, the lysed crude synaptosomal membrane (P3) fraction, the synaptosomal membrane fraction, and Triton X-100 insoluble PSD1and 2 fractions showed that S4C was most enriched in the synaptic vesicle and PSD fractions (PSD1 and PSD2), where PSD-95 was also most enriched (Fig. 6). These results suggest that S4C is associated with both pre- and post-synaptic components. S4C enriched in the PSD fraction most likely associates with PSD-95. To examine whether endogenous S4C interacts with endogenous PSD-95, brain cytosol was immunoprecipitated with an antiserum to PSD-95 (Upstate Biotechnology) and probed with antibodies to S4C by immunoblot analysis. Because PSD-95 and S4C proteins are concentrated in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet (PSD1 and PSD2) of the synaptosome, urea-containing buffer was used to extract these proteins from the crude synaptosomal pellet fraction (P2), and the extract was immunoprecipitated with normal mouse serum or antibody to PSD-95. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody to PSD-95 (Transduction Laboratories) to check the specificity of this antibody (Fig. 7 A, left panel) and with antibody to S4C (Fig. 7 A,right panel). PSD-95 protein coprecipitated with S4C in the P2 fraction from the cerebral cortex, suggesting the interaction of PSD-95 and S4C in the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that there is partial overlap of S4C and PSD-95 in the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex of the adult mouse (Fig.7 B). S4C was localized to the superficial layers of layers I–IV, whereas PSD-95 was extensively distributed throughout the cortical layers. In the parietal cortex, S4C was detected in the barrel fields, which receive projections especially from cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the mystacial vibrissae (Fig. 7 B). This pattern was similar to that of PSD-95. This is the first report showing immunohistochemical localization for S4C so far. In primary cultures of neocortical neurons, immunostaining for S4C was found in the neurites of cortical neurons with a dot-like pattern and was colocalized with PSD-95 (Fig. 7 C). These results suggest that S4C enriched in the PSD is related to the modulation of neocortical neurons that receive thalamocortical sensory projections. The present study shows that S4C is enriched in the adult brain as well as postnatal developing brain, whereas its lev"

This function is likely to be related to the peptide binding and chaperone functions of PDI, and it does not require the catalytic site cysteine residues (24Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Previous cross-linking studies with various peptides and polypeptides have indicated that the principal peptide binding site of PDI is located in the b′ domain and that this domain alone is sufficient for binding peptides of 10–15 residues (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, binding of longer peptides requires the additional presence of either the ab domains or the a′ domain (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, it has been found that the isolateda and a′ domains function effectively as simple thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases but that the remaining domains are required for full catalytic activity in assisting protein folding associated with the formation of native disulfide bonds (27Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It thus seems likely that the nonnative protein binding region extends beyond the principal peptide binding region present in domain b′, through all four domains (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J.

Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar) that forms complexes with both calnexin and calreticulin, these complexes being specifically involved in the modulation of glycoprotein folding within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (30Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 31Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ERp57 resembles PDI in size, has thioredoxin-like domains with CGHC catalytic site motifs in positions corresponding to the a and a′ domains of PDI, and also shows significant sequence similarity to PDI in regions corresponding to the b and b′ domains (32Koivunen P.

However, it does not substitute for PDI as the β subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (32Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present work sets out to study which domains of the PDI polypeptide are required for the assembly of a prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer and whether some of these domains can be substituted by the corresponding domains of ERp57. The vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunit has at least two isoforms, α(I) and α(II), which form with the PDI polypeptide the (α(I))2β2, type I, and (α(II))2β2, type II, enzyme tetramers (33Helaakoski T.

We therefore also studied whether any differences exist in the assembly of the PDI domains and PDI/ERp57 hybrid polypeptides between the α(I) and α(II) subunits. To correlate the prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly data with the less specific binding capabilities of PDI for folding substrates, we also analyzed the ability of the various PDI domains and PDI/ERp57 hybrid constructs to bind the peptide Δ-somatostatin and the misfolded protein “scrambled” RNase. PDI domain constructs were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using a human PDI cDNA (7Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I.

Similarly, ER-retention signals were added at the end of constructs that did not include regionc. Thus, construct PDIabb′ codes for amino acids 1–350 of the mature PDI polypeptide, PDIbb′a′c for 119–491, PDIb′a′c for 217–491, PDIa′c for 348–491, PDIbb′a for 119–351 and 1–120, and PDIabb′a for 1–352 and 1–120. cDNAs for PDIabb′ and PDIabb′a were ligated into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pVL1392 (Invitrogen), PDIb′a′c into the XbaI-BamHI site, and PDIbb′a into the EcoRI-SmaI site of this plasmid, whereas those for PDIbb′a′c and PDIa′c were ligated into the EcoRI site of pVL1393.

Two polymerase chain reaction products, one coding for the domains of PDI and the other for those of ERp57, were ligated blunt-ended together and into cohesive sites of pVL1392. Thus, PDIabb′ERp57a′ codes for amino acids 1–350 of PDI, 353–465 of ERp57, and an-AVKDEL retention signal; ERp57aPDIbb′a′c codes for amino acids 1–107 of ERp57, an R, and amino acids 117–491 of PDI; ERp57abPDIb′a′c codes for amino acids 1–218 of ERp57 and 219–491 of PDI; ERp57abb′PDIa′c codes for amino acids 1–352 of ERp57 and 351–491 of PDI; and PDIaERp57bb′a′c codes for amino acids 1–117 of PDI and 110–481 of ERp57. The constructs for PDIabb′ERp57a′, ERp57aPDIbb′a′c, and PDIaERp57bb′a′c were ligated into theEcoRI-BamHI site, and those for ERp57abPDIb′a′c and ERp57abb′PDIa′c were ligated into theEagI-BamHI site of pVL1392. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioclear) at 27 °C. The recombinant baculovirus transfer vectors were cotransfected into Sf9 insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen) by calcium phosphate transfection (35Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System, Procedures and Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). The resultant viral pools were collected 4 days later, amplified twice, and used for recombinant protein production. Other recombinant baculoviruses used in this work were human PDI, human ERp57, and human α(I) and α(II), coding for the corresponding prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunits (22Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T.

For the expression of recombinant proteins, Sf9 insect cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of 5. In coexpression experiments, viruses were used at a ratio of 1:1. The cells were harvested 3 days after infection; washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4; homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.1m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8; and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or by nondenaturing PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or Western blotting, and assayed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. In Western blotting, polyclonal antibodies against human PDI, human α(I) subunit and mouse α(II) subunit were used. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate as described previously (36Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Total cellular protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Scrambled RNase, the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 125I-Labeled Bolton-Hunter labeling reagent, ECL reagent, and x-ray films were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The somatostatin derivative without cysteine residues (Δ-somatostatin, AGSKNFFWKTFTSS) was synthesized as described previously for other peptides (37Klappa P. Mayinger P. Pipkorn R. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody raised against PDI was from Stressgene. 125I-Labeled Bolton-Hunter labeling of Δ-somatostatin was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the radiolabeled Δ-somatostatin was dissolved in distilled water. Labeled Δ-somatostatin (approximately 3 μm) or scrambled RNase (approximately 50 μm) was added to Buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) containing crude cell extracts (approximately 20 mg/ml). The samples (10 μl) were incubated for 10 min on ice before cross-linking (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed using DSG (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The samples were supplied with 110 volume of cross-linking solution (10 mm DSG in Buffer A). The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 0 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-PAGE with subsequent autoradiography. Western blotting was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against PDI. The detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Recombinant baculoviruses coding for the polypeptides described in Fig. 1 were generated and used to infect Sf9 insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by Coomassie staining. Bands corresponding to polypeptides of the expected size were found in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions of the samples (Fig. 2).Figure 2Analysis of expression of PDI , ERp57, PDI domain constructs, and PDI/ERp57 hybrids in insect cells by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.

The cells were harvested and homogenized as described above. Then the Triton X-100-soluble proteins were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE followed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody against human PDI (Fig.3) and assayed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity by a procedure based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (TableI).Table IProlyl 4-hydroxylase activity of Triton X-100-soluble proteins from insect cells expressing the α(I) or α(II) subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase together with either the wild-type PDI, ERp57, PDI domain constructs, or PDI/ERp57 hybridsPDI or its variant expressedProlyl 4-hydroxylase activityWith α(I) subunitWith α(II) subunitdpm/100 μg%dpm/100 μg%PDI5980 ± 63010013270 ± 800100PDIabb′<250<4.2600 ± 3104.5PDIbb′a′c285 ± 1754.85115 ± 118538.5PDIb′a′c<250<4.21150 ± 5208.7PDIa′c<250<4.2<550<4.2PDIbb′a<250<4.2<550<4.2PDIabb′a<250<4.2<550<4.2ERp57<250<4.2<550<4.2PDIabb′ERp57a′<250<4.2<550<4.2ERp57aPDIbb′a′c1380 ± 15023.15380 ± 148040.5ERp57abPDIb′a′c435 ± 507.32315 ± 82017.4ERp57abb′PDIa′c<250<4.2<550<4.2PDIaERp57bb′a′c<250<4.2<550<4.2Values are given in dpm/100 μg of extractable cell protein, mean ± S.D., for at least three experiments.

Open table in a new tab Values are given in dpm/100 μg of extractable cell protein, mean ± S.D., for at least three experiments. Values obtained with the α(I) (typically about 600 dpm) and α(II) (typically about 800 dpm) subunit alone were subtracted from all values. When PDIabb′ was coexpressed with either the α(I) or α(II) subunit, no enzyme tetramer was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) and no significant level of enzyme activity was generated (Table I). Coexpression of PDIbb′a′c with the α(I) subunit led to assembly of a product with slow mobility in Western blotting (Fig. 3,lane 5), but very little enzyme activity, if any, was generated (Table I). However, when this same construct was coexpressed with the α(II) subunit, an enzyme tetramer with a mobility that corresponded to the reduced size of the PDI polypeptide was produced (Fig. 3, lane 6), and this tetramer was an active prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Table I). Nevertheless, the amount of enzyme activity generated in insect cells using this construct was only about 40% of that obtained with wild-type PDI (Table I), due to either a less efficient assembly level obtained with the mutant or a lower specific activity of the mutant enzyme tetramer. When the PDI construct was shortened further to contain just b′a′c, no assembly was detected with the α(I) subunit (Fig. 3, lane 7). However, assembly was still detected with the α(II) subunit (Fig. 3,lane 8), although the amount of enzyme activity generated was only about 9% of that obtained with the wild-type control (TableI). PDIa′c gave no assembly (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and10) or activity (Table I) with either the α(I) or α(II) subunit. PDI domains a and a′ both contain the catalytic site motif CGHC, show a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity (7Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and have very similar folded structures (3Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Dijkstra K. Karvonen P. Pirneskoski A. Koivunen P. Kivirikko K.I. Darby N.J. van Straaten M. Scheek R.M. Kemmink J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the a′ domain could be substituted by the a domain. A baculovirus coding for PDIbb′awas generated and used to coinfect insect cells with a virus coding for either the α(I) or α(II) subunit. No assembly was obtained with this mutant polypeptide with either α subunit (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12), and correspondingly, no enzyme activity was generated (Table I). To ensure that the result was not influenced by the missing N-terminal a domain, a baculovirus coding for PDI abb′a was generated and used for additional coexpression experiments. However, no assembly or activity was seen with this construct either (Fig. 3, lanes 13 and14; Table I). The data thus indicate that the adomain of PDI cannot functionally substitute for the a′domain in prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly. To study whether the PDI domains can be functionally replaced by the corresponding domains of ERp57, baculoviruses coding for several hybrid PDI/ERp57 polypeptides (Fig. 1) were generated. Coexpression of PDIabb′ERp57a′with either the α(I) or α(II) subunit led to no assembly (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6) and generated no enzyme activity (Table I). In contrast, coexpression of ERp57aPDIbb′a′c with either the α(I) or α(II) subunit resulted in tetramer assembly (Fig. 4 A,lanes 7 and 8) and in the generation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity (Table I). In the case of the α(I) subunit, the amount of enzyme activity obtained with ERp57aPDIbb′a′c was about 23% of that obtained with the wild-type PDI. In contrast, the construct PDIbb′a′cwithout the ERp57 a domain gave less than 5% of the wild-type activity (Table I). In the case of the α(II) subunit, no difference could be observed between the ERp57aPDIbb′a′c and PDIbb′a′cconstructs, both of which gave about 40% of the activity level seen with the wild-type PDI (Table I). A positive effect of the addition of ERp57 domains was seen even more distinctly with the construct ERp57abPDIb′a′c. Cells expressing this polypeptide formed an active enzyme with both the α(I) and α(II) subunits even though detection of the complex with the α(I) subunit failed by nondenaturing PAGE, most probably due to lability of this tetramer (Fig. 4 A, lanes 9 and 10; Table I), whereas the PDIb′a′c construct showed no tetramer formation with the α(I) subunit and gave less enzyme activity with the α(II) subunit (8.7% versus 17.4%; Table I). The addition of ERp57abb′ in front of PDI a′c did not rescue prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly (Fig. 4 A, lanes 11and 12; Table I). Similarly, PDIaERp57bb′a′c resulted in no tetramer assembly (Fig. 4 A, lanes 13 and 14; Table I), as confirmed by Western blotting with anti-α(I) and anti-α(II) subunit antibodies (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 6). 125I-Labeled Bolton-Hunter labeled Δ-somatostatin was added to the insect cell extracts of PDI domain constructs and PDI/ERp57 hybrids to investigate their interactions. After cross-linking with DSG, single cross-linking products could be detected in cell extracts expressing PDI, PDIabb′, PDIbb′a′c, PDIb′a′c, PDIbb′a, PDIabb′a, PDIabb′ERp57a′, ERp57aPDIbb′a′c, and ERp57abPDIb′a′c (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–4, 6, and7; Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4). No cross-linking products were detected with Δ-somatostatin when cell extracts expressing PDIa′c (Fig. 5 A, lane 5), ERp57, ERp57abb′PDIa′c, or PDIaERp57bb′a′c (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1, 5, and 6) were tested. These results (TableII) are consistent with previous data (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) indicating that the minimum sequence requirement for binding of Δ-somatostatin to PDI is fulfilled by the b′ domain, and they extend the data by demonstrating that the b′ domain of ERp57 is not capable of replacing the corresponding PDI domain in this assay.Table IICorrelation between binding of Δ-somatostatin and scrambled RNase and the assembly of a functional prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramerPolypeptide expressedBindingProlyl 4-hydroxylase assemblyΔ-SomatostatinRNaseWith α(I) subunitWith α(II) subunitPDI++++PDIabb′++−−PDIbb′a′c++± aA complex with slow mobility was formed, but this complex had very little activity, if any.+PDIb′a′c++−+PDIa′c−−−−PDIbb′a++−−PDIabb′a++−−ERp57−NDbNot determined.−−PDIabb′ERp57a′++−−ERp57aPDIbb′a′c++++ERp57abPDIb′a′c+++ cNo complex could be observed in nondenaturing PAGE, but weak prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was generated, indicating the formation of a labile tetramer.+ERp57abb′PDIa′c−−−−PDIaERp57bb′a′c−ND−−a A complex with slow mobility was formed, but this complex had very little activity, if any.b Not determined.c No complex could be observed in nondenaturing PAGE, but weak prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was generated, indicating the formation of a labile tetramer. Open table in a new tab When crude cell extracts expressing the PDI domain constructs were incubated in the presence of scrambled RNase and subsequently cross-linked, cross-linking products were seen for PDI, PDIabb′, PDIbb′a′c, PDIbb′a, and PDIabb′a (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12) but not for PDIb′a′c or PDIa′c (Fig. 6 A, lanes 8 and 14). The cross-linking product of PDIb′a′c only became visible after a longer exposure time (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). When the corresponding polypeptide produced in Escherichia coli was incubated in the presence of scrambled RNase and subsequently cross-linked, a cross-linking product was also obtained (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). The result obtained with PDIabb′ differs from that previously obtained with the corresponding construct in crude cell extracts of E. coli, in which no binding of biotinylated scrambled RNase was detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This conjugate could not be used in insect cell extracts because the biotinylated scrambled RNase was bound by some polypeptide(s) present in the lysate. When PDIabb′produced in E. coli was analyzed by the method used here, a cross-linking product was also obtained (data not shown). Studies on the binding of scrambled RNase to the PDI/ERp57 hybrids were limited to those constructs that could be recognized by the anti-PDI antibody used. Cross-linking products were observed in the presence of scrambled RNase for the PDIabb′ERp57a′,ERp57aPDIbb′a′c, and ERp57abPDIb′a′c constructs (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). ERp57aPDIbb′a′cexhibited a doublet band on cross-linking, probably resulting from an intramolecular cross-linking event. No cross-linking to the ERp57abb′PDIa′c construct was observed. PDI has been shown to be a multifunctional protein. Because PDI is a modular polypeptide, one important issue in its molecular analysis is to understand the roles played by each of the individual PDI domains in its multiple functions. The data presented here allow us to analyze the roles of the individual domains of PDI in prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly and the degree to which ERp57 domains can substitute for PDI in assembly and in the binding of peptides and nonnative proteins. By coexpressing PDI domain constructs with the α subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, we have determined that the minimum sequence requirement for the assembly of an active tetramer is fulfilled by the PDI construct b′a′c (Table I). As a previous study (29Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the presence or absence of the C-terminal extensionc has no observable effect on any of the main functions of PDI (i.e. the oxidoreductase, disulfide isomerase, chaperone, or protein subunit functions), the minimum requirement for prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly is in fact fulfilled by the PDI domainsb′a′. However, the addition of the b domain gave a higher level of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, and all four domains of PDI were required for the highest level of activity measured. It is not clear whether this represents an increase in the absolute level of active prolyl 4-hydroxylase or in the specific activity of the enzyme tetramer formed using the PDI constructs. In either case, these data indicate that the primary sites of interaction between PDI and the α subunit lie in the b′ and a′ domains of PDI but that both the b and a domains contribute to the structure or stability of the tetramer. Such a contribution may either come from direct interactions between these domains and the α subunit or may come from a contribution due to interactions between the β subunits (i.e. a dimerization event in PDI). Further evidence for the absolute requirement for the b′ anda′ domains and also the involvement of the b anda domains in tetramerization comes from an analysis of the differences between α(I) and α(II) subunit tetramerization and the use of PDI/ERp57 hybrids. The two types of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunit, the α(I) and α(II) subunits, readily form the (α(I))2β2 and (α(II))2β2 enzyme tetramers in insect cell coexpression experiments with PDI. The catalytic properties of the two types of enzyme tetramer are highly similar, but there are some distinct differences in the binding properties and binding sites for proline-rich peptide substrates and peptide inhibitors between the two isoenzymes (34Annunen P.

Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To date, no differences have been reported in the tetramer assembly between these subunits (22Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Annunen P. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Veijola J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17342-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here indicate a major difference between the two types of α subunit, in that the α(II) subunit became more effectively associated with the shortened PDI constructs, as seen by both the appearance of tetramers on native gels and by prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. Detailed structural data are needed to fully understand the differences found here in the tetramer assembly between the α(I) and α(II) subunits. PDI and ERp57 have homologous domain structures, the highest degree of identity and similarity being found in the a anda′ domains. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the role of the a domain of PDI in prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly could, in part, be substituted by the a domain of ERp57, this effect being more significant with the α(I) subunit (Table I). The degree of amino acid sequence identity between the bdomains of human PDI and ERp57 is only 23% (based on the domain boundaries used here), but the ab fragment of PDI could likewise be, in part, substituted by the ab fragment of ERp57 (Tables I and II). Neither PDIabb′ERp57a′nor the ERp57abb′PDIa′c constructs formed prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers, further indicating the importance of theb′ and a′ domains of PDI in the assembly process. The primary peptide binding site of PDI is located in the b′domain, and this domain alone is sufficient for the binding of peptides of 10–15 residues (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In agreement with this requirement, Δ-somatostatin could be cross-linked here to all PDI domain and hybrid constructs that contain the PDI b′ domain. In contrast, the b′ domain of ERp57 does not appear to contain a binding site for small peptides such as Δ-somatostatin, as this peptide could not be cross-linked to ERp57 or to any hybrid lacking PDI domain b′ (Table II). Because the b′ domain of PDI could not be substituted by b′of ERp57 in the assembly of a prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer, it seems reasonable to speculate that the primary peptide binding domain of PDI, which is also required for nonnative protein binding, is involved in interacting with the α subunit during the assembly process. Whereas the primary peptide binding site of PDI is located in theb′ domain, binding of longer substrates (for example, a 28-amino acid fragment derived from bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) has been shown to minimally require either abb′or b′a′c (26Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The binding of nonbiotinylated scrambled RNase was likewise found here to require either PDI abb′ orb′a′c. A remarkable finding was that the a′ domain of PDI could not be replaced in prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly by either a′ of ERp57 2L. Silvennoinen, P. Karvonen, P. Koivunen, J. Myllyharju, K. I. Kivirikko, and I. Kilpeläinen, submitted for publication. or a of PDI, even though these three domains are highly similar in their amino acid sequences (7Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K.

Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and folded structures (3Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Dijkstra K. Karvonen P. Pirneskoski A. Koivunen P. Kivirikko K.I. Darby N.J. van Straaten M. Scheek R.M. Kemmink J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that substitution in PDI of the 78 most C-terminal residues of domain a′ and the C-terminal extensionc by the corresponding residues of ERp57 totally abolishes the assembly of a prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer (32Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, several mutations introduced into the C-terminal region of the PDI domain a′ prevent prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly (29Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It thus seems that the a′ domain contains a region that is highly critical for the assembly of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer (Table II), as is the primary peptide binding region present in theb′ domain. As no assembly was seen with PDIabb′ and either the α(I) or α(II) subunit, the implication is that the requirements for the assembly of a prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer are more stringent than those for the binding of nonnative proteins such as scrambled RNase (Table II). Detailed structural comparison between PDI domains a anda′ and ERp57 domain a′ and a determination of the relative spatial positions of the domains of PDI in the native structure are needed to understand these functional differences. The results presented here indicate that in PDI there is a broad binding region for folding substrates and functional partners to which domains contribute to different extents. For small peptides, theb′ domain is essential and sufficient. For large peptides, nonnative proteins such as scrambled RNase, and for the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the a′ domain contributes significantly to the binding and the b and adomains enhance binding. The inability of the b′ anda′ domains of ERp57 to substitute for the analogous PDI domains suggests that these domains have very specific binding properties, e.g. to their permanent partners, the lectins calnexin and calreticulin, which are therefore analogous to the α subunit in prolyl 4-hydroxylase.

https://openalex.org/W2150761911,"Sterol synthesis by the mevalonate pathway is modulated, in part, through feedback-regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). In mammals, both a non-sterol isoprenoid signal derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and a sterol-derived signal appear to act together to positively regulate the rate of HMGR degradation. Although the nature and number of sterol-derived signals are not clear, there is growing evidence that oxysterols can serve in this capacity. In yeast, a similar non-sterol isoprenoid signal generated from FPP acts to positively regulate HMGR degradation, but the existence of any sterol-derived signal has thus far not been revealed. We now demonstrate, through the use of genetic and pharmacological manipulation of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase, that an oxysterol-derived signal positively regulated HMGR degradation in yeast. The oxysterol-derived signal acted by specifically modulating HMGR stability, not endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in general. Direct biochemical labeling of mevalonate pathway products confirmed that oxysterols were produced endogenously in yeast and that their levels varied appropriately in response to genetic or pharmacological manipulations that altered HMGR stability. Genetic manipulation of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase did result in the buildup of detectable levels of 24,25-oxidolanosterol by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and NMR analyses, whereas no detectable amounts were observed in wild-type cells or cells with squalene epoxidase down-regulated. In contrast to mammalian cells, the yeast oxysterol-derived signal was not required for HMGR degradation in yeast. Rather, the function of this second signal was to enhance the ability of the FPP-derived signal to promote HMGR degradation. Thus, although differences do exist, both yeast and mammalian cells employ a similar strategy of multi-input regulation of HMGR degradation.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). As one tactic for regulating pathway production, the cell exerts tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control over the steady-state levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR),1 which catalyzes a rate-limiting, irreversible step in sterol synthesis (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). In fact, a significant component of this control is effected through regulation of HMGR stability (2Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

When the cellular amounts of mevalonate pathway products are abundant, HMGR degradation is rapid, and the protein's steady-state levels are correspondingly low. Conversely, when the cellular amounts of pathway products are insufficient for the cell's needs, HMGR degradation is slow, and the steady-state levels of HMGR are relatively high. Analyses of HMGR stability in both mammalian cells and yeast have revealed many aspects of HMGR-regulated degradation that are conserved among eukaryotes (4Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J.

To gain a better understanding of this aspect of cellular sterol regulation, we have been studying the genetics and biochemistry of the regulated degradation of the HMGR isozyme Hmg2p in yeast (4Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 8Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Through use of the powerful genetic manipulations possible in this organism, we have identified genes required for the degradation of Hmg2p, termed HRD genes (8Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and genes required for normal regulation of Hmg2p degradation, termedCOD genes (11Cronin S.R. Khoury A. Ferry D.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies have led to a clearer understanding of the degradation pathway, as they have demonstrated that the key components, Hrd1p and Hrd3p, form the core of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized ubiquitin ligase complex required for ubiquitination and degradation of HMGR (12Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and numerous other quality control substrates (14Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Regulation of HMGR degradation appears to occur through pathway signals controlling entry of the protein into the constitutively active HRD degradation pathway (11Cronin S.R. Khoury A. Ferry D.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), perhaps by allosteric conversion of HMGR from a stable protein into a quality control substrate. Recently, it has been confirmed that mammalian HMGR similarly undergoes regulated ubiquitination (15Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), most likely mediated by an ER-localized ubiquitin ligase complex similar to the HRD complex in yeast. In parallel studies, we have been examining the identities of the mevalonate-derived signals that control Hmg2p stability. Through use of both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of mevalonate pathway enzymes, we have identified the pathway intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) as the source of a positive signal for Hmg2p degradation (9Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). FPP is the substrate for squalene synthase (see Fig. 1) and occupies a key branch point in the mevalonate pathway for which its conversion is the committed step for each separate pathway (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). The identification of FPP as the primary signal for regulation of HMGR degradation in yeast is especially intriguing, as farnesol, a derivative of FPP, has also been implicated as the source of the signal for regulation of mammalian HMGR stability (16Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

In addition to farnesol, mammalian HMGR stability is also regulated by the levels of cellular sterols. Mammalian HMGR degradation is rapid when abundant sterols are present; HMGR degradation is slow when cellular sterol levels are insufficient (2Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Although the exact identity of the sterol-derived signal is unknown, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 24,25-oxidolanosterol have been shown to be potent enhancers of HMGR degradation when added to mammalian cells (2Nakanishi M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an oxysterol-derived molecule may be a source of the sterol signal that positively regulates mammalian HMGR degradation. These and related oxysterols can be generated in vivo either by an “alternate” pathway involving cyclization of 2,(3S),(22S),23-dioxidosqualene (see Fig. 1) or through the action of a family of enzymes that directly oxidize cholesterol (26Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Identification of an oxysterol-derived signal for HMGR degradation has added significance due to a growing body of evidence that oxysterols also function in numerous other aspects of cellular regulation and physiology (26Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), allowing for the possibility that oxysterols may serve to integrate cholesterol homeostasis with other distinct biological processes. Until now, it was unknown whether yeast also employed an oxysterol-derived positive signal for HMGR degradation or if this was only a characteristic of HMGR degradation in mammalian cells. Through pharmacological and genetic manipulations of mevalonate pathway enzymes downstream of squalene synthase, we have explored the possibility that yeast also utilizes an oxysterol-derived signal for HMGR degradation. In the following results, we have demonstrated the existence of a secondary positive signal for yeast HMGR degradation that is derived from the alternate oxysterol pathway. This secondary oxysterol-derived signal enhances Hmg2p degradation in addition to, but not in the absence of, the primary FPP-derived signal. Our results demonstrate that there is further striking conservation for mevalonate pathway regulation of HMGR degradation among eukaryotes. All enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc.

Egan K.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1984; 32: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for Ade+ prototrophy. Hmg2p ubiquitination was assayed by immunoprecipitation of 1Myc-Hmg2p and then immunoblotting the precipitate for covalently linked HA-tagged ubiquitin. Flow cytometry was performed as previously described (29Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B. Rine J. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2611-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Living cells were analyzed by flow microfluorometry using a FACSCalibur flow microfluorometer (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA) with settings for fluorescein-labeled antibody analysis. Histograms were produced from 10,000 individual cells and plotted with log fluorescence (arbitrary units) on the horizontal axis and with cell number on the vertical axis. TLC was performed similarly as previously described (33Fung B. Holmlund C.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C to log phase (A600 = 0.3) in 25 ml of minimal medium. In some cases, 50 μg/ml lovastatin, 10 μg/ml zaragozic acid, 40 μg/ml Ro48-8071, or 50 μg/ml terbinafine was added to the cells. Sodium [14C]acetate was added at the same time as the drugs to a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h at 30 °C. In the case of gene down-regulation, cells were incubated in the presence of 2 mm methionine for 19 h at 30 °C. Sodium [14C]acetate was added to a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml either at the same time as methionine addition or after 13 h of incubation with methionine. After incubation with [14C]acetate, cells were washed once with 0.5 volume of sterile water. 14C-Labeled lipids were extracted from the cells by addition of 9 ml of methanol. Extracts were saponified by addition of 6 ml of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide such that the methanol/water ratio was 3:2. The mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature. 14C-Labeled lipids were extracted twice from the saponification mixture by addition of 4 ml of petroleum ether, which was subsequently concentrated to 150 μl. The entire 150-μl fraction was applied to Silica Gel 60 F254plates (Fisher). The 14C-labeled lipids were resolved by developing the plates twice with 5:1 benzene/ethyl acetate to 10 cm and once with 95:5:1 petroleum ether/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid to 15 cm. The resolved 14C-labeled lipids were detected by autoradiography. Reference compounds were visualized by brief exposure of the plates to I2 vapor. Cells containing the appropriate PMET3 -expressed construct were grown in 2 liters of minimal medium containing 2 mmmethionine for 19 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C prior to the analyses. For processing, the samples were thawed, weighed, and combined with 1 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene, 15 mg of pyrogallol, 7.5 ml of methanol, and 3 ml of 60% aqueous KOH. The resulting mixtures were deoxygenated for 10 min with nitrogen and heated at 70 °C (1.5 h). After cooling to ambient temperature, the samples were extracted with methylt-butyl ether (4 × 12 ml). For each sample, the combined extracts were washed with 12 ml of water and 12 ml of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. A sample (10%) of each crude extract was reserved for analysis. The resulting residue (90% of the crude extract containing the non-saponifiable lipids) was subjected to normal-phase separation on an SPE cartridge. The residues were dissolved in 2 ml of 1:1 CH2Cl2/hexane and placed onto the SPE cartridge (6 ml, 1 g of silica; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) pretreated with the same solvent. Elution was conducted with 1:1 CH2Cl2/hexane (32 ml), then undiluted CH2Cl2 (36 ml), and finally 10% isopropyl alcohol/hexane (36 ml). TLC (Silica Gel 60 plates, EM Science) was used to identify the appropriate fractions, which were combined. Sterols were visualized with 5% ammonium molybdate in 10% sulfuric acid. Reversed-phase HPLC was used to purify material with a retention time corresponding to that 24,25-oxidolanosterol. HPLC was carried out with a Sphereclone 5μ ODS(2) reversed-phase column (4.6 mm (inner diameter) × 250 mm; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) with methanol isocratically at 1 ml/min and UV detection at 210 nm. Gas chromatography analyses were performed with derivatives (80 μl of pyridine and 20 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at 25 °C) and DB-5 capillary column (0.25 mm (inner diameter) × 30 cm, 5% phenyl and 95% methyl polysiloxane, 0.1-μm film thickness; J & W Scientific) with helium carrier gas (1.1 kg/cm2) on a Shimadzu GC-9A instrument (35:1 split ratio, 200 °C for 2 min, 10 °C/min to 280 °C, and injector and FID detector at 280 °C). Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analyses employed a VG ZAB-HF spectrometer interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard 5890A chromatograph (splitless injection, helium carrier gas at 1.4 kg/cm2, and the same column and program as for gas chromatography). NMR experiments were carried out with Bruker AMX500 and Avance 500 spectrometers (500.1 MHz for 1H) equipped with a 5-mm inverse geometry broadband or 5-mm normal geometry probe. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 25 °C in CDCl3 solution and referenced to internal bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro acetamide. In mammalian cells, oxysterols have been implicated as positive signals for HMGR degradation. The existence of such oxysterol signals has been proposed from the observations that HMGR degradation is enhanced as a result of either 24,25-oxidolanosterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol addition to cells (2Nakanishi M.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It appears that oxysterols do not alter HMGR degradation alone, but require the presence of a non-sterol positive signal derived from FPP to enhance HMGR degradation (20Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In our following examination of oxysterol-derived signals for yeast HMGR degradation, we utilized genetic and biochemical approaches to address this issue. Oxysterols can be produced in the cell from the alternate oxysterol pathway (Fig. 1) (35Dolis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which branches from the sterol biosynthetic pathway at 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene. These oxysterols are initially generated from 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene by an additional epoxidation at positions 22 and 23 through the action of squalene epoxidase (36Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Peffley D.M. Gayen A.K. Morand O.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase plays a critical role in determining availability of the dioxidosqualene required for production of oxysterols in the alternate pathway. By catalyzing the cyclization of 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene to lanosterol (35Dolis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the activity of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase determines steady-state cellular levels of 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene available for further epoxidation to 2,(3S),(22S),23-dioxidosqualene. If conversion of 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene to lanosterol by oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase is relatively slow, some 2,(3S)-oxidosqualene may be further epoxidized to 2,(3S),(22S),23-dioxidosqualene by squalene epoxidase (36Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Peffley D.M. Gayen A.K. Morand O.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 2,(3S),(22S),23-dioxidosqualene can be further converted to 24,25-oxidolanosterol by oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase (36Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Bai M. Xiao X.Y. Prestwich G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase has a higher affinity for the dioxidosqualene than for the monooxidosqualene (39Boutaud O. Dolis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); and thus, the cyclization of the dioxidosqualene is likely the favored reaction when both substrates are present. Through this competition, partial inhibition of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase causes increased production of 24,25-oxidolanosterol (38Bai M. Xiao X.Y. Prestwich G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and later oxysterols may be derived from this product. Thus, pharmacological or genetic manipulations of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase s"

Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MMTV integration intoint-6 may produce a dominant negative allele, because of expression of a truncated, unregulatable form of the protein. Alternatively, the truncation may simply disrupt the biological function of Int-6, and tumorigenesis would result from reducedint-6 gene dosage.Although Int-6 is a stable component of mammalian eIF3, it is not known whether it is required for the activity of eIF3 in translation initiation (3Asano K.

These results raised the possibility that integration into int-6 affected the role of Int-6 in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm as a component of eIF3. To identify the biological role of Int-6 and decipher the consequences of its truncation, it was important to establish the role of Int-6 in translation initiation as a part of eIF3.

Moreover, the complete S. cerevisiae genome sequence does not encode a protein closely related to Int-6. Thus, an Int-6-related protein does not seem to be involved in the functions of eIF3 in the yeastSaccharomyces. Besides Int-6, mammalian eIF3 contains three other noncore subunits, eIF3d (p66), eIF3f (p47), and eIF3h (p40), which are conserved in plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila melanogaster but absent in S. cerevisiae (19Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the activities of eIF3 from higher eukaryotes are modulated by association of the five core subunits with Int-6 and the other eIF3 subunits not found in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, the recent progress in sequencing the entire genome of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has revealed that it encodes the four orthologs of noncore eIF3 subunits, in addition to orthologs of the five core subunits (14Burks E.A. Bezerra P.P. Le H. Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2122-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, S. pombe eIF3 may resemble mammalian eIF3 in containing several polypeptides in addition to the five core subunits present in budding yeast.In this study, we examined the role of the S. pombe protein, Int6, closely related to murine Int-6. We found that Int6 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, unlike mammalian and plant Int-6. We also provide evidence that Int6 is a stable component of fission yeast eIF3 and is functionally homologous to human Int-6 protein. Unlike tif35+, which encodes an essential core eIF3g ortholog, int6+ is dispensable. The int6Δ mutant grew slowly in minimal medium, however, and this slow growth phenotype was accompanied by reduction in the amount of polyribosomes engaged in translation. Our results implicate Int-6 homologs in translation initiation and lay the groundwork for investigating the cytoplasmic function of Int-6 using fission yeast as a model organism.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we characterized a fission yeast protein Int6 closely related to murine Int-6 protein, encoded by a frequent MMTV integration site. We showed that Int6 is cytoplasmic (Fig. 2) and associates in vivo with 40 S ribosomes (Fig. 3). Affinity purification of the putative eIF3 complex of S. pombedirected against FLAG epitope-tagged Tif35/eIF3g revealed the presence of Int6 and the five proteins homologous to the core subunits of budding yeast eIF3 (Fig. 4 and Table II). This is the first evidence that fission yeast eIF3 contains the five core proteins that comprise budding yeast eIF3 (17Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and also occur in mammalian eIF3 (19Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to the five core subunit orthologs, we also identified the fission yeast ortholog of eIF3f (PIR accession number T40490, 33 kDa) as the 36-kDa polypeptide in the FLAG-Tif35 complex shown in Fig.4B (data not shown). Thus, physical interactions between the core and noncore subunits appear to be conserved between the fission yeast and mammalian eIF3 complexes. Furthermore, the complementation of the int6Δ slow growth phenotype by human int-6suggests that S. pombe Int6 is functionally homologous to mammalian Int-6 (Fig. 6).Despite the evidence for physical interaction between Int6 and the putative core eIF3 subunits, int6+ is not an essential gene, and we observed only a moderate reduction in the rate of protein synthesis initiation in int6Δ cells (Fig. 5). Thus, Int6 is dispensable for the essential activities of eIF3.moe1+, encoding the S. pombe homolog of human eIF3d subunit p66, is also nonessential (33Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although its association with S. pombe eIF3 remains to be determined. Presumably, the essential functions of S. pombe eIF3 depend only on the five core subunit orthologs, of which (at least) eIF3i (34Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Tif35/eIF3g are essential.We found that int6Δ cells showed several phenotypes, including frequent unequal nuclear partitioning during mitosis in haploids, abnormal spore formation in diploids (Fig. 1), and hypersensitivity to the microtubule-depolymerizing drug, thiabendazole. If Int6 is involved in general translation initiation, how can deletion of int6+ lead to such specific phenotypes? One possible explanation is that a moderate reduction in eIF3 function caused by int6Δ severely impaired translation of a subset of mRNAs with relatively poor initiation regions that compete poorly for ribosomes and other factors with mRNAs containing optimal initiation sites. Those mRNAs whose translation was strongly reduced in int6Δ cells would include mRNAs encoding proteins critical for nuclear partitioning or sporulation. An alternative explanation for the pleiotropic int6Δphenotype is that Int6 is involved in gene-specific translational control, e.g. by facilitating recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the eIF3 bound to 40 S ribosomes.In S. cerevisiae, reduced protein synthesis rates caused by mutations in eIF3 subunit genes TIF34, PRT1, orTIF32/RPG1 result in cell cycle arrest primarily in the G1 phase, although the tif34 mutation additionally impedes the G2/M transition (29Verlhac M.-H.

In contrast, int6Δ has more profound effects on the completion of mitosis (Fig. 1B) than on the start of the cell cycle, in favor of the model that Int6 is involved specifically in translational control in G2. In keeping with this idea, deletion ofmoe1+ encoding another noncore eIF3 subunit homolog impairs microtubule function and confers resistance to microtubule-destabilizing reagents (33Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between Moe1 (eIF3d) and Int6 (eIF3e) in mitosis. Recently, one of themis (minichromosome instability) mutations in fission yeast was shown to impair 18 S ribosomal RNA biogenesis, suggesting that a decrease in general protein synthesis rates would impair chromosome segregation (37Kondoh H. Yuasa T. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 525-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular basis for mitotic defects caused by disruption of the translation machinery will require further examination.While this manuscript was under review, two articles were published reporting the characterization of the Int-6 ortholog in S. pombe (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 4005-4018Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Crane et al. (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed thatS. pombe Int-6 is a part of eIF3, based on coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged eIF3i and eIF3b orthologs with Int-6-HA. We demonstrated this point by affinity purification (Fig.4B) and subsequent immunoblot (Fig. 4B) and mass spectrometry (Table II) analyses of a FLAG-Tif35/eIF3g-containing complex. This purified complex contained seven of the nine eIF3 subunit orthologs encoded in fission yeast. We also showed that the amount of polysomes engaged in protein synthesis was reduced significantly in theint6Δ mutant (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the polysome analysis of Bandyopadhyay et al. (39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 4005-4018Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who also observed a moderately reduced rate of total protein synthesis in theint6Δ mutant, as measured by amino acid incorporation. Together, these data provide convincing biochemical evidence that Int6 enhances the rate of translation initiation in vivo. These articles also reported interesting phenotypes associated with overexpression and deletion of int6+. Overexpression of int6+ conferred multi-drug resistance, dependent on the transcription activator Pap1 (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereasint6Δ cells were hypersensitive to caffeine (39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 4005-4018Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, human Int-6 protein did not function in place of fission yeast Int6 to confer drug resistance when overexpressed, nor did it complement the caffeine sensitivity of int6Δ cells. In contrast, the nuclear partitioning defect we observed in int6Δ cells (Fig. 1B) was complemented by expression of human Int-6 protein. Thus, the role of Int-6 in mitosis may be conserved between fission yeast and mammals.Finally, what are the implications of our results for MMTV tumor biology? Our hypothesis that the deletion ofint6+ has an impact on translation of a specific subset of mRNAs is consistent with the generation of tumors, which would contain normal rates of protein synthesis but display protein expression profiles different from that of normal cell lines. If unequal nuclear division observed for S. pombe int6Δhaploids also happens frequently for mice carrying the MMTV genome inserted at one allele of int-6, this might increase the degree of aneuploidy and, hence, the frequency of tumorigenesis (40Duesberg P. Rausch C. Rasnick D. Hehlmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13692-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that disruption of the nuclear function of Int-6 is responsible for tumorigenesis by altering the transcription rates of certain genes. PML, protein the major constituent of the PML nuclear bodies where Int-6 resides, has been implicated as a tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator (8Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although fission yeast Int6 was not localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2), the role of Int6 in activating multidrug resistance appears to be independent of the role of Int6 in translation (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of Int-6 by usingS. pombe as a model organism will contribute greatly to solving this complicated problem. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)1 integrates into the mouse genome and frequently causes mammary tumors. The sites of MMTV integration were identified to delineate the molecular basis of the tumorigenesis (see Refs. 1Li Y. Hively W.P. Varmus H.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 2Callahan R. Smith G.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar for review). Except forint-6, the int loci encode growth factors or transmembrane receptors. Thus, altered expression of these Int proteins leads to mammary tumorigenesis presumably by affecting signal transduction pathways controlling cell growth. By contrast, the molecular basis for tumorigenesis caused by integration into int-6 is unclear. Int-6 encodes a ubiquitously expressed, 52-kDa protein, which corresponds to the 48-kDa eIF3e subunit 2Nomenclature for eIF3 subunits is based on Ref.14Burks E.A. Bezerra P.P. Le H. Gallie D.R.

Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MMTV integration intoint-6 may produce a dominant negative allele, because of expression of a truncated, unregulatable form of the protein. Alternatively, the truncation may simply disrupt the biological function of Int-6, and tumorigenesis would result from reducedint-6 gene dosage. Although Int-6 is a stable component of mammalian eIF3, it is not known whether it is required for the activity of eIF3 in translation initiation (3Asano K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23477-23480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two laboratories (5Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P.

Nuclear localization of an Int-6 ortholog was also reported in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Yahalom A. Kim T.-H. Winter E. Karniol B. von Arnim A.G. Chamovitz D.A. J. Biol.

These results raised the possibility that integration into int-6 affected the role of Int-6 in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm as a component of eIF3. To identify the biological role of Int-6 and decipher the consequences of its truncation, it was important to establish the role of Int-6 in translation initiation as a part of eIF3. Thus far, eIF3 has been purified from mammalian cells (10Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Biochim.

Biophys Acta. 1979; 565: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Purified S. cerevisiae eIF3 was also shown to stimulate Met-tRNAiMet binding to 40 S ribosomes in vitro (16Danaie P.

Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The eIF3 purified from budding yeast consists of five proteins, eIF3a (TIF32), eIF3b (PRT1), eIF3c (NIP1), eIF3g (TIF35), and eIF3i (TIF34), homologous to mammalian eIF3 subunits and does not contain an ortholog of human eIF3e/Int-6 (17Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, the complete S. cerevisiae genome sequence does not encode a protein closely related to Int-6. Thus, an Int-6-related protein does not seem to be involved in the functions of eIF3 in the yeastSaccharomyces. Besides Int-6, mammalian eIF3 contains three other noncore subunits, eIF3d (p66), eIF3f (p47), and eIF3h (p40), which are conserved in plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila melanogaster but absent in S. cerevisiae (19Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the activities of eIF3 from higher eukaryotes are modulated by association of the five core subunits with Int-6 and the other eIF3 subunits not found in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, the recent progress in sequencing the entire genome of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has revealed that it encodes the four orthologs of noncore eIF3 subunits, in addition to orthologs of the five core subunits (14Burks E.A. Bezerra P.P. Le H. Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2122-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, S. pombe eIF3 may resemble mammalian eIF3 in containing several polypeptides in addition to the five core subunits present in budding yeast. In this study, we examined the role of the S. pombe protein, Int6, closely related to murine Int-6. We found that Int6 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, unlike mammalian and plant Int-6. We also provide evidence that Int6 is a stable component of fission yeast eIF3 and is functionally homologous to human Int-6 protein. Unlike tif35+, which encodes an essential core eIF3g ortholog, int6+ is dispensable. The int6Δ mutant grew slowly in minimal medium, however, and this slow growth phenotype was accompanied by reduction in the amount of polyribosomes engaged in translation. Our results implicate Int-6 homologs in translation initiation and lay the groundwork for investigating the cytoplasmic function of Int-6 using fission yeast as a model organism. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we characterized a fission yeast protein Int6 closely related to murine Int-6 protein, encoded by a frequent MMTV integration site. We showed that Int6 is cytoplasmic (Fig. 2) and associates in vivo with 40 S ribosomes (Fig. 3). Affinity purification of the putative eIF3 complex of S. pombedirected against FLAG epitope-tagged Tif35/eIF3g revealed the presence of Int6 and the five proteins homologous to the core subunits of budding yeast eIF3 (Fig. 4 and Table II). This is the first evidence that fission yeast eIF3 contains the five core proteins that comprise budding yeast eIF3 (17Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and also occur in mammalian eIF3 (19Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to the five core subunit orthologs, we also identified the fission yeast ortholog of eIF3f (PIR accession number T40490, 33 kDa) as the 36-kDa polypeptide in the FLAG-Tif35 complex shown in Fig.4B (data not shown). Thus, physical interactions between the core and noncore subunits appear to be conserved between the fission yeast and mammalian eIF3 complexes. Furthermore, the complementation of the int6Δ slow growth phenotype by human int-6suggests that S. pombe Int6 is functionally homologous to mammalian Int-6 (Fig. 6).Despite the evidence for physical interaction between Int6 and the putative core eIF3 subunits, int6+ is not an essential gene, and we observed only a moderate reduction in the rate of protein synthesis initiation in int6Δ cells (Fig. 5). Thus, Int6 is dispensable for the essential activities of eIF3.moe1+, encoding the S. pombe homolog of human eIF3d subunit p66, is also nonessential (33Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although its association with S. pombe eIF3 remains to be determined. Presumably, the essential functions of S. pombe eIF3 depend only on the five core subunit orthologs, of which (at least) eIF3i (34Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Tif35/eIF3g are essential.We found that int6Δ cells showed several phenotypes, including frequent unequal nuclear partitioning during mitosis in haploids, abnormal spore formation in diploids (Fig. 1), and hypersensitivity to the microtubule-depolymerizing drug, thiabendazole. If Int6 is involved in general translation initiation, how can deletion of int6+ lead to such specific phenotypes? One possible explanation is that a moderate reduction in eIF3 function caused by int6Δ severely impaired translation of a subset of mRNAs with relatively poor initiation regions that compete poorly for ribosomes and other factors with mRNAs containing optimal initiation sites. Those mRNAs whose translation was strongly reduced in int6Δ cells would include mRNAs encoding proteins critical for nuclear partitioning or sporulation. An alternative explanation for the pleiotropic int6Δphenotype is that Int6 is involved in gene-specific translational control, e.g. by facilitating recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the eIF3 bound to 40 S ribosomes.In S. cerevisiae, reduced protein synthesis rates caused by mutations in eIF3 subunit genes TIF34, PRT1, orTIF32/RPG1 result in cell cycle arrest primarily in the G1 phase, although the tif34 mutation additionally impedes the G2/M transition (29Verlhac M.-H.

In contrast, int6Δ has more profound effects on the completion of mitosis (Fig. 1B) than on the start of the cell cycle, in favor of the model that Int6 is involved specifically in translational control in G2. In keeping with this idea, deletion ofmoe1+ encoding another noncore eIF3 subunit homolog impairs microtubule function and confers resistance to microtubule-destabilizing reagents (33Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between Moe1 (eIF3d) and Int6 (eIF3e) in mitosis. Recently, one of themis (minichromosome instability) mutations in fission yeast was shown to impair 18 S ribosomal RNA biogenesis, suggesting that a decrease in general protein synthesis rates would impair chromosome segregation (37Kondoh H. Yuasa T. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 525-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular basis for mitotic defects caused by disruption of the translation machinery will require further examination.While this manuscript was under review, two articles were published reporting the characterization of the Int-6 ortholog in S. pombe (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed thatS. pombe Int-6 is a part of eIF3, based on coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged eIF3i and eIF3b orthologs with Int-6-HA. We demonstrated this point by affinity purification (Fig.4B) and subsequent immunoblot (Fig. 4B) and mass spectrometry (Table II) analyses of a FLAG-Tif35/eIF3g-containing complex. This purified complex contained seven of the nine eIF3 subunit orthologs encoded in fission yeast. We also showed that the amount of polysomes engaged in protein synthesis was reduced significantly in theint6Δ mutant (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the polysome analysis of Bandyopadhyay et al. (39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 4005-4018Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who also observed a moderately reduced rate of total protein synthesis in theint6Δ mutant, as measured by amino acid incorporation. Together, these data provide convincing biochemical evidence that Int6 enhances the rate of translation initiation in vivo. These articles also reported interesting phenotypes associated with overexpression and deletion of int6+. Overexpression of int6+ conferred multi-drug resistance, dependent on the transcription activator Pap1 (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereasint6Δ cells were hypersensitive to caffeine (39Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 4005-4018Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, human Int-6 protein did not function in place of fission yeast Int6 to confer drug resistance when overexpressed, nor did it complement the caffeine sensitivity of int6Δ cells. In contrast, the nuclear partitioning defect we observed in int6Δ cells (Fig. 1B) was complemented by expression of human Int-6 protein. Thus, the role of Int-6 in mitosis may be conserved between fission yeast and mammals.Finally, what are the implications of our results for MMTV tumor biology? Our hypothesis that the deletion ofint6+ has an impact on translation of a specific subset of mRNAs is consistent with the generation of tumors, which would contain normal rates of protein synthesis but display protein expression profiles different from that of normal cell lines. If unequal nuclear division observed for S. pombe int6Δhaploids also happens frequently for mice carrying the MMTV genome inserted at one allele of int-6, this might increase the degree of aneuploidy and, hence, the frequency of tumorigenesis (40Duesberg P. Rausch C. Rasnick D. Hehlmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13692-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that disruption of the nuclear function of Int-6 is responsible for tumorigenesis by altering the transcription rates of certain genes. PML, protein the major constituent of the PML nuclear bodies where Int-6 resides, has been implicated as a tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator (8Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although fission yeast Int6 was not localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2), the role of Int6 in activating multidrug resistance appears to be independent of the role of Int6 in translation (38Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 3993-4003Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2070023944,"Multiple or pleiotropic drug resistance often arises in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to genetic alterations of the functional state of the Cys6-Zn(II)2 transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p. Single amino acid substitutions give rise to hyperactive forms of these regulatory proteins, which in turn cause overproduction of downstream target genes that directly mediate multidrug resistance. Previous work has identified a novel Cys6-Zn(II)2 transcription factor designated Yrr1p as mutant forms of this protein confer high level resistance to the cell cycle inhibitor reveromycin A and DNA damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. In the present study, we demonstrate that Yrr1p also mediates oligomycin resistance through activation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding geneYOR1. Additionally, insertion of triplicated copies of the hemagglutinin epitope in the C-terminal region of Yrr1p causes the protein to behave as a hyperactive regulator of transcription. We have found that YRR1 expression is both controlled in a Pdr1p/Pdr3p-dependent manner and autoregulated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also show that Yrr1p associates with target promoters in vivo. Together these data argue that the signal generated by activation of Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p can be amplified through the action of these transcriptional regulatory proteins on downstream target genes, like YRR1, that also encode transcription factors.

ATP-binding cassette pleiotropic drug resistance Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element hemagglutinin recombinase 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) chromatin immunoprecipitation A common feature underlying acquisition of multiple or pleiotropic drug resistance is the overexpression of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 transporters. Multidrug resistant tumor cells often exhibit amplification of the gene encoding the Mdr1p, a prototypical drug efflux pump (1Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Gene amplification is typically not seen associated with pleiotropic drug resistance (Pdr) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), yet these highly drug-resistant strains commonly possess high level transcription of ABC transporter genes like PDR5 (3Balzi E.

Overexpression of these ABC transporters is required for the Pdr phenotype and most commonly results from genetic lesions that activate function of the Cys6-Zn(II)2 transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p (8Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B.

Robertson A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 144: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cloning and analysis of this gene indicated that Pdr1p likely acted as a transcriptional regulator (11Balzi E. Chen W. Ulaszewski S. Capieaux E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16871-16879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperactive alleles of PDR1led to marked overproduction of target genes, which in turn allowed cells to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of drugs (12Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutant forms of a PDR1 homologue (PDR3) produce a similar effect on both drug resistance and ABC transporter expression (13Dexter D. Moye-Rowley W.S. Wu A.-L. Golin J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments indicated that Pdr1p and Pdr3p bind to the same DNA element that was designated the Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PDR3 structural gene contains two PDREs and is regulated by Pdr1p and autoregulated at the transcriptional level (16Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The presence of at least one PDRE has been found associated with every gene regulated by Pdr1p or Pdr3p. Recently, another transcription factor has been identified that shows a partially overlapping regulatory network with Pdr1p and Pdr3p.YRR1 was cloned as a locus that could be genetically altered to give rise to high level resistance to the cell cycle inhibitor reveromycin A (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A mutant form of this gene (YRR1-1) contained a duplicated segment of the protein in the C-terminal region of the factor and strongly activated expression of the ABC transporter-encoding genes SNQ2 and YOR1. Construction of a SNQ2-lacZ fusion gene demonstrated that Yrr1p was able to regulate the promoter of this gene (18Cui Z. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that Yrr1p acts to regulate YOR1transcription at the level of its promoter by a Pdr1p/Pdr3p-independent mechanism. Analysis of expression of the YRR1 gene indicates that this locus is both responsive to Pdr1p and Pdr3p and autoregulated. Two different insertions of a 3× hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag into the C terminus of Yrr1p convert this protein into a hyperactive regulator of gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using these 3X-HA-tagged forms of Yrr1p demonstrate that this protein associates with both the YRR1 andYOR1 promoters in vivo. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study were all derived from SEY6210. The genotypes of the strains are listed in Table I. PB4 is a pdr1Δ and pdr3Δ mutant yeast strain as previously described (19Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). XZY1 and XZY2 were made by transforming ayrr1-Δ1::TRP1 gene disruption plasmid (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI and PstI into SEY6210 and PB4, respectively. Trp+ transformants were selected and analyzed by Southern blotting analysis to confirm introduction of the disruption allele. XZY12 to XZY17 were generated by using mTn-3X HA/lacZ transposon clones from the Yale Genome Analysis Center and used as described (20Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). XZY12, XZY13, and XZY16 were generated with one-step transformation of plasmids of clone V41A2 (YRR1::lacZ-URA3-3X HA-695), V54F11 (YRR1::lacZ-URA3-3X HA-730), and V122G2 (YOR172w::lacZ-URA3-3X HA-774) after NotI digestion, respectively. These three strains were then processed for lox excision by inducing the expression of cre recombinase from the pB227/GAL-cre plasmid with galactose. The resulting 3X-HA-tagged versions of XZY12, XZY13, and XZY16 were named XZY14, XZY15, and XZY17, respectively. All strains were propagated in YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or minimal media (21Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) supplemented with casamino acids at 30 °C with shaking. Drug resistance tests were carried out by gradient spot test method using YPD plates containing 4-NQO or YPGE (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 3% glycerol, and 3% ethanol) plates containing oligomycin. Yeast transformation was carried out by a lithium acetate method (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replacement of the PstI-SphI fragment of pXTZ30 with the corresponding one of YEp-YRR1 results in a wild-typeYRR1-containing plasmid pXTZ31. A series ofYRR1 promoter deletion constructs was generated by PCR. Four upstream primers, YRR1 sense (ccg gaa ttc CTT TCA GGC GTT ATT TCA GTG), YRR1up324 (cgg aat tcG CGA ATG TAG ATT TCT GCC AG), YRR1up270 (cgg aat tcA AAT CCG CGG AAA TTA G), YRR1up229 (cgg aat tcT GGG GTA GAG GCT GAT ATA CG), and one downstream primer, YRR1 antisense (ccg gga tcc ATT GTG ACG CTA TTC TTA TTG GC) were used for PCR. Note that anEcoRI restriction site was added to all upstream primers, whereas a BamHI restriction site was appended to the downstream primer as shown in lowercase letters. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with EcoRI andBamHI, and cloned into the lacZ-containing plasmid pSEYC102 (24Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garret J. Geller B.C. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that had also been digested withEcoRI and BamHI. The resulting plasmids produce a translational fusion between YRR1 and lacZ genes and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These four plasmids were named pES5, pXTZ38, pXTZ68, and pXTZ69 in the order of deletion from 5′ to 3′. The plasmids pXTZ111 to 119 were constructed by replacing the upstream activation sequence of the CYC1 gene with a −269 to −230 fragment of YRR1 promoter. YRR1(−269)F (gat cCG CGG AAA TTA GAA AAA CGT TAA AAG GTT CCA TGC A) and YRR1(−230)R (gat cTG GCA TGG AAC CTT TTA ACG TTT TTC TAA TTT CCG CG) were designed for this purpose. These two oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP, and then cloned into theBglII site of a low copy vector pRS314-ClZ after annealing. The vector pRS314-ClZ contains the minimal promoter of CYC1fused to a lacZ reporter gene (25Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were then sequenced. Three clones (pXTZ111, pXTZ115, and pXTZ117) were found to have a copy of the YRR1 oligonucleotide in the forward orientation (same orientation relative to CYC1 ATG as normally found in YRR1), whereas five plasmids had a copy of the oligonucleotide in the reverse orientation (pXTZ112, pXTZ114, pXTZ116, pXTZ118, and pXTZ119). One plasmid (pXTZ113) was found that contained a tandem repeat of the forward-oriented YRR1oligonucleotide. Several mutations were found in these oligonucleotide sequences, and the DNA sequence of each clone is shown in Fig.6 A (see below). The activity levels of lacZ-encoded β-galactosidase were determined in two different ways. For most gene fusions, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was used as substrate, and a standard permeabilized cell assay was employed (26Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, a luminescent β-galactosidase assay kit (CLONTECH) was used to determine the β-galactosidase activity of cells containing YRR1-lacZ due to its low expression level. Cells were grown toA600 = 1 in liquid media with shaking. Protein extracts were made by glass bead breakage. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. An equal amount of protein extracts were used for the assay, and the activity of β-galactosidase was evaluated using a luminometer. All enzyme assays were performed at least twice on independent transformants, and the values reported are expressed ± S.D. The vector pOTS-Nco12 expressing a Myc-tagged Pdr1p N-terminal 248 amino acids or vector only was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain AR68. Protein extracts were then made from heat-shocked cells as previously described (19Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An Asp718/SacI fragment of pXTZ118 was labeled with γ-32P at theAsp718-end and used as a footprint probe. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 5 min followed by a 30-s DNase I digestion on ice. The reaction mix was resolved by 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described (27O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with modifications from Steph Schroeder. Briefly, cells expressing either HA-tagged Tbp1p or Yrr1p were grown to mid-log phase in YPD medium and protein-nucleic acid complexes were fixed by formaldehyde treatment. Lysates were prepared by glass bead grinding, followed by sonication. A 20-μl aliquot of the lysate was saved at this step as the input fraction. Sonicated lysates were then incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco). After antibody binding, the samples were briefly centrifuged, followed by the addition of 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA along with protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and centrifuged to recover a pellet (bound) and supernatant fraction (unbound). 20 μg of RNase A was added to remove RNA. Protein was eluted from the Sepharose beads by treating with 1% SDS/0.1 m HaHCO3. Cross-links were reversed by adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl to all reactions and heating at 65 °C for 5 h. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated, digested with proteinase K, phenol-extracted, and then resuspended in TE (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) prior to PCR analysis. Both input and bound DNA were dissolved in 20 μl of TE. 1 μl of DNA of each reaction was used for polymerase chain reaction. The following primer sets: YRR1 up229 and YRR1 antisense, YOR1 (CCA CGG TAA TCG ACA TAT TCG TATA) and YOR1–207 (TCG ACC GGA AAT TTT GCC GGG AAT ATG), ATR1–500 (GCG GAT CCA ACA TCC AGA CTT TTA CGG G), and ATR1+40 (CCT TAC TTT CCG TAA GCA CA), were used to detect theYRR1, YOR1, and ATR1 promoter fragments, respectively. PCR analyses were performed at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min. 20 μl of each reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel, and images were captured by a UVP mini darkroom system. YRR1 was originally cloned by its ability to confer reveromycin A resistance (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data previously implicated YOR1 in resistance to both reveromycin A (7Cui Z. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Osada H. Miyakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (6Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Additionally, previous work showed that the mRNA expression level ofYOR1 was increased in presence of YRR1-1 (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further examine the effect of the loss of YRR1 on oligomycin resistance of cells, yrr1Δ deletion alleles were made in both wild-type or pdr1Δ, pdr3Δ strains by homologous recombination. All four yeast strains were grown in YPD medium to an A600 of 1, and 1000 cells of each were spotted on a YPGE plate containing a gradient of oligomycin. Loss of YRR1 from an otherwise normal background did not detectably influence oligomycin resistance (Fig.1). However, introduction of theyrr1Δ deletion mutation into the pdr1Δ,pdr3Δ reduced the ability of the resulting triple mutant to tolerate oligomycin. These data indicate that, althoughYRR1 does contribute to oligomycin resistance in S. cerevisiae, its contribution is masked in the presence of Pdr1p and Pdr3p. We have previously demonstrated that Pdr1p and Pdr3p regulate YOR1 gene expression via directly binding to the single PDRE (Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element) located in theYOR1 promoter (28Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine if the PDRE is also required for Yrr1p function, two different YOR1-lacZ fusion plasmids were used that either contained (YOR1-lacZ) or lacked(mPDRE-YOR1-lacZ) the PDRE in the YOR1 promoter. This mutant form of the PDRE contains a two-nucleotide substitution, which blocks Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding (28Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, low copy number plasmids expressing either wild-type YRR1 or the gain-of-function mutant YRR1-1 were cotransformed with either one of these two YOR1-lacZ fusion plasmids. Appropriate transformants were grown in minimal medium, and β-galactosidase activities were determined (Fig.2). Expression of the wild-typeYOR1-lacZ fusion gene was increased by ∼4-fold in the presence of the YRR1-1 allele. Both the loss of the PDRE from the YOR1 promoter and the loss of the PDR1and PDR3 genes failed to eliminate the observed elevation of β-galactosidase activity in the presence of the YRR1-1mutation. These data suggest that Yrr1p activation of YOR1gene expression depends on a DNA element other than PDRE. Additionally, the hyperactive form of Yrr1p (encoded by YRR1-1) produced high level activation of YOR1-lacZ that was independent of the presence of PDR1 and PDR3. To assess if the ability to activate the YOR1 promoter would produce a corresponding increase in oligomycin resistance, low copy number plasmids carrying YRR1 or YRR1-1 were transformed into either wild-type or a PDR1 andPDR3 deletion strain PB4. Transformants were selected and grown in minimal media, and 1000 cells were plated on YPGE plates containing oligomycin. It was found that cells expressingYRR1-1 showed strong resistance to oligomycin in comparison to either wild-type or pdr1Δ, pdr3Δ cells transformed with YRR1. It was also found that the resistance of cell to oligomycin by YRR1-1 requires the presence ofYOR1 structure gene (data not shown). These data are consistent with the idea that YRR1 confers oligomycin resistance by regulating gene expression of YOR1 in a Pdr1p/Pdr3p- and PDRE-independent manner. The above analysis suggested that Yrr1p did not act through the intact PDRE. To localize the Yrr1p binding site in the YOR1 promoter, a series of deletion derivatives of the YOR1-lacZ reporter gene was utilized. Low copy number plasmids containing the indicatedYOR1-lacZ fusion with varying amounts of 5′-promoter sequences were transformed into a wild-type yeast strain along with a second low copy number plasmid carrying either YRR1 orYRR1-1. The β-galactosidase activities were then determined for each transformant (Fig.3). A 5′ deletion to −222 bp upstream of the YOR1 transcription start site was as responsive to the presence of the YRR1-1allele as the fusion gene containing 1065 bp of upstream DNA. Further deletion to −129 bp upstream eliminated the response to Yrr1-1p. An internal deletion lacking the −190 to −129 region of theYOR1 promoter was still induced in the presence of Yrr1-1p, whereas the −299 to −50 deletion derivative lacked any response to the YRR1-1 allele. The elevated expression of the −299 to −50 internal deletion construct has been observed before (28Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Yrr1p acts through the −222 to −190 bp region upstream of the YOR1 transcription start site. Note that the PDRE corresponds to position −218 to −209 but is not required to mediate the response of YOR1 to Yrr1p (see above). Along with localizing the Yrr1p response element in the YOR1 promoter, we were interested in examining expression of the YRR1 gene itself. Inspection of the YRR1 promoter suggested that this gene might be transcriptionally regulated by Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p. A 9 of 10 match with the consensus PDRE was detected in the YRR1promoter (Fig. 4). To facilitate analysis of YRR1 gene expression, a YRR1-lacZ fusion gene was prepared. This fusion gene was introduced into wild-type cells along with low copy number plasmids carrying wild-type or thePDR1–3 allele of PDR1. PDR1–3 encodes a hyperactive form of Pdr1p that leads to overexpression of Pdr1p target genes and drug hyper-resistance (8Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transformants were assayed forYRR1-dependent β-galactosidase using a chemiluminescence method owing to the low level expression ofYRR1. The presence of the PDR1–3 allele increased expression of the YRR1-lacZ fusion gene by a factor of 4 compared with introduction of a second copy of wild-type PDR1. This analysis provided strong support for the view that YRR1represents a new target gene for Pdr1p (and likely Pdr3p). To directly demonstrate that Pdr1p was capable of binding to theYRR1 PDRE, a DNase I protection assay was performed using a probe containing this element from YRR1 promoter (Fig. 4). Incubation of this probe with protein extracts from bacteria expressing the DNA binding domain of Pdr1p but not with extracts from cells carrying the empty expression vector led to a region of DNase I protection corresponding to the YRR1 PDRE. Together, these data indicate that expression of YRR1 is regulated by Pdr1p. During this analysis of YRR1 expression, we tested if Yrr1p might influence transcription of its own structural gene. To evaluate this possibility, low copy number plasmids expressing either wild-type or the hyperactive YRR1-1 allele of YRR1 were introduced into wild-type cells along with the YRR1-lacZfusion gene. A series of 5′-truncated versions of theYRR1-lacZ reporter construct was prepared to localize important regulatory sequences. Transformants were processed for β-galactosidase activity measurements as described above (Fig.5). The presence of the YRR1-1 allele increased expression of the YRR1-lacZ fusion by nearly 600%. This same strong increase in expression was seen with reporter constructs containing 326 or 271 of 5′-noncoding DNA from YRR1. However, a fusion gene extending 220 bp upstream of the YRR1 ATG was no longer significantly responsive to YRR1-1. As we found for the YOR1 promoter, the YRR1 PDRE was localized from −269 to −260 and mapped to this Yrr1p-responsive region. These data provide two important additional findings about control ofYRR1 expression. First, YRR1 is autoregulated. Second, the element responsive to Yrr1p can be mapped to positions −271 to −220 upstream of the YRR1 ATG. This region of theYRR1 promoter was selected for further analysis to gain insight into the sequence elements required for response to Yrr1p. To determine whether the response elements for Yrr1p and Pdr1p were closely linked in the YRR1 promoter, an oligonucleotide corresponding to positions −269 to −230 in theYRR1 5′-noncoding sequence was synthesized. This oligonucleotide was used to replace the normal CYC1 upstream activation sequences in a CYC1-lacZ fusion plasmid. Several clones of this oligonucleotide were sequenced, and a number were found to contain mutant forms of the YRR1 DNA segment. Plasmids containing wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides were introduced into cells along with low copy number plasmids expressing wild-type or hyperactive alleles of PDR1 and YRR1. CYC1-dependent β-galactosidase activities were then determined for each transformant (Fig.6). Alterations at the 3′-end of this oligonucleotide had no effect on the ability of hyperactive forms of Yrr1p or Pdr1p to activate expression of the fusion gene. Introduction of the hyperactive form of Yrr1p led to ∼400% increase in expression, whereas the PDR1–3allele increased β-galactosidase activity by ∼300%. Substitution and deletion mutations between positions −242 and −231 had no effect on Pdr1p or Yrr1p regulation. However, clustered mutations located near the PDRE (−259 and −255 in pXTZ112, 114, 115, 117) eliminated the ability of the corresponding oligonucleotide to be regulated by Yrr1p in every case. Importantly, these mutant oligonucleotides did maintain their ability to respond to Pdr1p with the exception of pXTZ117, which contains a 1-bp deletion in the PDRE. These data are consistent with the view that the Yrr1p response element and the PDRE are linked but separable in the YRR1 promoter. An invaluable resource in the analysis of S. cerevisiae genes is the availability of a collection of transposon insertions into a large fraction of the genome (20Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This series of insertion mutations was found to contain two different in-frame insertions of E. coli lacZ into YRR1, one after codon 695 and one after codon 730. These insertions are in a region of the protein in which a gain-of-function mutation was previously isolated (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The transposon used to make these mutations also contains loxP sequences that can be cleaved by the cre protein expressed in yeast to evict the lacZ cassette and associatedURA3 marker, leaving behind a 3X hemagglutinin (3X HA) epitope tag inserted into the coding sequence. These two different transposon insertions were integrated in place of the wild-typeYRR1 locus in an otherwise wild-type strain, thelacZ/URA3 sequences removed by expressing cre in appropriate integrants and the resulting mutant YRR1 loci designated YRR1::3X HA-695 (3X HA insertion after codon 695) and YRR1::3X HA-730 (3X HA insertion after codon 730). Strains expressing wild-type or the two different 3X HA insertion variants of Yrr1p were assayed for their ability to confer resistance to oligomycin and 4-NQO using a gradient plate of each drug (Fig.7). Both the Yrr1p::3X HA-695 and Yrr1p::3X HA-730 gave rise to an increased ability to grow in the presence of both oligomycin and 4-NQO. To determine whether this increased oligomycin resistance correlated with an elevation inYOR1 expression, a YOR1-lacZ fusion plasmid was introduced into these backgrounds. The Yrr1p::3X HA-695 and Yrr1p::3X HA-730 led to an increase in YOR1-lacZexpression to 25 and 31 units/optical density, respectively, whereas the presence of wild-type Yrr1p produced 11 units/optical density. These data indicate that insertion of foreign sequences into the C-terminal region of Yrr1p activate the function of this transcriptional regulatory protein. Analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome detected the presence of a protein encoded by the YOR172w locus that shared strong sequence identity with Yrr1p (41%) identity (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Search of the transposon library indicated that a single insertion mutation had been isolated in which the transposon was placed after codon 774 of the 786 codon open reading frame. This transposon was integrated into a wild-type strain in place of the YOR172w locus, and thelacZ/URA3 sequences were eliminated by expression of cre recombinase in appropriate transformants. The resulting Yor172wp::3X HA-774-expressing strain was then assayed for drug resistance in comparison to an isogenic wild-type cell (Fig.7). Expression of Yor172wp::3X HA-774 led to a modest but reproducible increase in both oligomycin and 4-NQO tolerance. These findings suggest that, like Yrr1p, Yor172wp also requires an intact C terminus for normal regulation. A simple model that could explain the effect of Yrr1p on expression ofYOR1 and YRR1 would be provided by the ability of this factor to directly bind to and activate these promoters. We tried a variety of bacterial expression systems but were not able to reproducibly detect Yrr1p DNA binding activity. We turned to the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (27O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to determine if Yrr1p was capable of associating with these putative target promotersin vivo. Three different strains were used to assess in vivoassociation of Yrr1p with the YOR1 and YRR1promoters: a wild-type strain expressing no HA-tagged proteins (SEY6210), a strain expressing an HA-tagged Yrr1p (XZY15), and a strain expressing an HA-tagged form of TATA-binding protein (Tbp1p) as its sole source of this essential protein (DPY11). Three different primer pairs were used to evaluate the specificity of the ChIP assay. Primers corresponding to the promoter regions of YRR1 andYOR1 as well as a primer set that would amplify the promoter of the ATR1 gene (29Coleman S.T. Tseng E. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23224-23230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a locus not under Yrr1p or Pdr1p/Pdr3p control (data not shown). ChIP was performed using anti-HA antibody essentially as described (27O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and analyzed by PCR amplification of total DNA prior to immunoprecipitation (input) or specifically immunoprecipitated DNA (Anti-HA IP; Fig. 8). Both the YRR1 and YOR1 promoters are detected in DNA recovered from ChIP reactions performed on chromatin lysates from the cells expressing the HA-tagged proteins but not on control lysates from wild-type cells. Importantly, the ATR1 promoter was identified in the immunoprecipitates from the HA-Tbp1p expressing strain but not from the HA-Yrr1p-expressing cells. These data provide support for the view that Yrr1p associates in vivo with target promoters and through this association leads to an increase in gene expression. These data illustrate important new connections in the pleiotropic drug resistance pathway in S. cerevisiae. The finding that Pdr1p (and likely Pdr3p) regulate expression of YRR1 suggest a potential new complexity in the analysis of Pdr1p/Pdr3p target genes. Genome microarray experiments have suggested the presence of a large number of genes that increase in expression in response to activated forms of Pdr1p or Pdr3p (30DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although many of these genes contain at least one PDRE, not all do. These data provide a possible explanation for this observation, because activation of Yrr1p expression by Pdr1p or Pdr3p could lead to an increase in transcription of downstream target genes via Yrr1p binding to an element other than a PDRE. With this possibility in mind, it is interesting to note that in the two genes identified here are Yrr1p targets, both contain PDREs. Additionally, previous work (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) has provided evidence that Yrr1p activates expression of the ABC transporter-encoding locus,SNQ2, which in turn leads to the increase in 4-NQO resistance seen in cells containing activated forms of Yrr1p.SNQ2, like YRR1 and YOR1, also contains a PDRE. Examination of these three genes cannot be viewed as representative of all Yrr1p target genes, because all three loci are involved in drug resistance. Less directed approaches such as microarray analyses must be undertaken to give a more accurate picture of the necessary linkage of Yrr1p response with a PDRE. A second striking feature of the observed linkage of the PDRE with the Yrr1p response element is the finding that these two recognition sequences appear to be tightly physically linked. We have identified two base pairs, critical for Yrr1p activation, that are located immediately adjacent to the YRR1 PDRE. A 33-bp region containing the YOR1 PDRE appears to be necessary for the Yrr1p responsiveness of this gene. A similar tight linkage has been found for SNQ2 (18Cui Z. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At least for these three Yrr1p/Pdr1p-coregulated genes, the possibility exists that these regulatory proteins may directly communicate during gene regulation. Even though the actions of Pdr1p and Yrr1p occur through sites that are physically close on target promoters, we provide evidence that their actions are not through the same element. First, a mutantYOR1 promoter lacking a functional PDRE can still be activated by Yrr1p. Second, the presence of the YRR1-1allele completely bypasses the requirement for Pdr1p or Pdr3p in terms of oligomycin resistance and YOR1-lacZ expression. Finally, mutant forms of the YRR1 promoter can be generated that fail to respond to Yrr1p but are normally activated by Pdr1p. Although the ChIP analysis demonstrates that Yrr1p interacts with target promoters, a consensus binding site for Yrr1p has not yet been identified. Efforts to produce forms of Yrr1p in bacterial expression were not successful even though similar constructs were used to produce active forms of either Pdr1p or Pdr3p (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Inspection of the three known target promoters has not revealed any striking candidates for shared recognition elements. The identification of the precise binding site for Yrr1p is a high priority. The finding that insertions of random sequences into the C termini of either Yrr1p or Yor172wp lead to an increase in function of these factors suggests that these proteins may normally be negatively regulated. The insertion of this extraneous sequence leads to a loss of the ability to respond to this negative signal and results in a constitutively active protein. Previously, a hyperactive form ofYRR1 (YRR1-1) was identified that contained a duplication of amino acids 695–706 (17Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our observation that insertion of the 3X HA sequence after either position 695 or 730 indicates that there is not likely to be a special significance to the previously reported duplication but rather that this region of Yrr1p must be structurally intact for normal regulation of function. Other Zn(II)2-Cys6 transcription factors like Gal4p (31Stone G. Sadowski I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Pdr1p (32Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also possess central regulatory domains that can be mutationally altered to change the function of the resulting factor. We have previously reported that the activity of Pdr3p is tightly linked to the status of mitochondria (35Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and find that Yrr1p also appears to be involved in this regulatory circuit. 2X. Zhang, unpublished data. Together, these data illustrate the close communication between Pdr1p, Pdr3p, and Yrr1p activity (Fig. 9). Coordination of the activity of these transcription factors is a critical factor for normal drug resistance as shown by the interlocking systems of transcriptional control of the Pdr3p and Yrr1p structural genes. Identification of the precise regulatory signals controlling these factors will provide important new insight into the physiological basis underlying these multidrug resistance regulatory proteins.

Two isoforms of FGFR3 were expressed in these cells. One was the complete form of FGFR3 (FGFR3) already reported, and the other was a novel one that lacks the acid box domain (FGFR3ΔAB). The gene of FGFR3ΔAB was expressed in undifferentiated ATDC5 cells. In contrast, the transcripts of FGFR3 were not detectable in undifferentiated cells but increased during cellular condensation, which is an obligatory step for chondrogenic differentiation. FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression was higher than that of FGFR3 in undifferentiated cells. The gene expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21 was induced during cell condensation and correlated best with the expression of FGFR3 among the FGFR isoforms expressed. The differential expression of FGFR3 isoforms during chondrogenesis suggests that these isoforms may play different roles in the regulation of growth and differentiation in chondrocytes. To define the mitogenic response of FGFR3ΔAB and FGFR3 to FGFs, their cDNAs were stably transfected into mouse BaF3 pro-B cells. FGFR3 preferentially mediates the mitogenic response to FGF1 and poor response to FGF2. In contrast, FGFR3ΔAB mediated a higher mitogenic response to FGF2 as well as to FGF1. In addition, FGFR3ΔAB responds to FGF1 at lower concentrations of heparin than FGFR3 does.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1571-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The FGFR family consists of four closely related members, the amino acid sequences of which are highly conserved both between different members of the family and throughout evolution (1Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). They regulate a multitude of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, migration, and survival (2Baird A. Klagsbrun M.

The structure of FGFRs has three different parts: an extracellular portion with three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane portion, and a split tyrosine kinase domain inside the cell. The overall complexity of the receptor is increased by the existence of additional isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing (4Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 5Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gensnel M.C. Houssaint E. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar, 6Johnson D.E.

These receptors possess an alternative sequence for the C-terminal half of the third Ig domain (IgIII), encoded by a separate 5′-exon IIIa and 3′-exon, either IIIb or IIIc, which determines ligand specificity (1Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 7Werner S. Duan D.-H.R. De Vries C. Peter K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

In the segment between the first Ig domain (IgI) and the second Ig domain (IgII), there is a cluster of the acidic residues, which is referred to as the “acid box,” similar to that found in adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin/uvomorulin (9Kemler R. Ozawa M. Rigwald M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Chaudhuri M.M. Moscatelli D. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Another major alternative splicing event results in FGFR isoforms differing in the IgI and acid box domains (4Eisemann A.

FGFRs lacking IgI have a higher ligand affinity for some FGF ligands, although it is not known if ligand binding specificity is affected by removal of the IgI domain (6Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Distinct expression patterns of these isoforms have also been reported in cell differentiation (11Bansal R. Kumar M. Murray K. Morrison R. Pfeiffer S.E. Mol. Cell.

A. 1994; 91: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are functional differences between these isoforms. Activation of three members of the FGFR family, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, by FGFs induces mitogenic responses in various cell types (14Wang J.-K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and the thanatophoric dysplasia type II mutant (K650E) of FGFR3 expressed in 293 cells (29Su W.C. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W.A. Fu Z.Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and its translocation to the nucleus. One of the consequences of STAT1 activation is expression of p21 (30Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C.S. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), a general inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, which causes growth arrest in chondrocytes. To elucidate the role of the FGF·FGFR signaling system in normal bone growth, we chose ATDC5 cells as an in vitro chondrogenesis model system. ATDC5 cells have been shown to be very useful for molecular analysis of early and late phase differentiation of chondrogenesis, because the cells display the sequential transitions of their phenotype in a synchronous manner in vitro (31Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 32Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the sequential differentiation of ATDC5 in culture, we studied the gene expression of FGFRs during early chondrocyte differentiation. Our study showed temporal regulation of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 gene expression during chondrogenic differentiation. We also analyzed the expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of these receptors differing in IgI and acid box domains. During the study, we isolated and cloned the cDNA of a novel splice variant of FGFR3, designated “FGFR3ΔAB,” which lacks the acid box domain in the extracellular part of FGFR3. To determine whether FGFR3ΔAB has the potential to stimulate cell proliferation, and if so, whether it has a different ligand specificity than that of FGFR3, we compared the mitogenic response of BaF3 cells stably expressing FGFR3ΔAB or FGFR3 to various FGFs. Human recombinant FGF2 and FGF9 (N3) were gifts from Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) (34Kurokawa T. Sasada R. Iwane M. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 186-194Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Other human recombinant FGFs were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Heparin (Hepar Inc.) was a gift from Dr. J. Folkman. Bovine insulin was purchased from Sigma. BaF3 cells and WEHI-3 cells were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). BaF3 cells were cultured as described previously (36Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BaF3 cells are a pro-B cell line that is IL-3-dependent. BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10‥ FBS and 10‥ conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells, which contained IL-3. ATDC5 cells were cultured in the maintenance medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5‥ FBS (JRH Biosciences Co., Lenexa, KS), 10 μg/ml bovine transferrin (Nacalai Tesque Co., Kyoto, Japan), and 3 × 10−8m sodium selenite (Sigma), as described previously (32Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5‥ CO2, 95‥ air atmosphere. The inoculum size of the cells was 6 × 103 cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate and 2.5 × 105 cells/plate in a 100-mm plate. For induction of chondrogenesis, the cells were cultured in maintenance medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (differentiation medium). Differentiated ATDC5 cells were plated in 6-multiwell dishes and cultured in differentiation medium. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 100‥ methanol for 2 min at −20 °C. They were stained with 0.1‥ Alcian blue 8GS (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in 0.1m HCl for 2 h at 25 °C and then washed three times with distilled water, as previously described (32Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Rat chondrocytes were isolated from rib cartilage as described by Shimomura et al. (37Shimomura Y. Yoneda T. Suzuki F. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1975; 19: 179-187Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from the chondrocytes by the single step method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). ATDC5 cells were inoculated in 100-mm plates and cultured in either differentiation medium or maintenance medium. Total RNA was prepared from the cultures using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan) following instructions given by the provider. Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured with 6.29‥ formaldehyde, separated by 1.2‥ agarose electrophoresis, and capillary-transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 42 °C with the appropriate probe (106 dpm/ml) in hybridization solution containing 50‥ formamide, 5× SSPE (20× SSPE contains 3.6 m NaCl, 0.2m NaH2PO4, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.7), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5‥ (w/v) SDS, and 40 μg/ml sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Probes were prepared to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/μg with a random primer DNA labeling kit (Ready to go labeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using [α-33P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Templates were as follows: a 364-bp HincII fragment of pT7Blue 2-mouse FGFR1 for FGFR1 mRNA, a 1.11-kbBamHI fragment of pT7Blue2-mouse FGFR2 for FGFR2 mRNA, a 0.97-kb BalI fragment of pT7Blue2-mouse FGFR3 for FGFR3 mRNA, and a 452-bp purified PCR fragment for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The nylon membranes were washed once for 15 min at 42 °C in 2× SSPE and 0.1‥ SDS, once for 30 min at 42 °C in 1× SSPE and 0.1‥ SDS, and twice for 15 min at room temperature in 0.1× SSPE and 0.1‥ SDS. The membranes were exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with a TranScreen L-E intensifying screen (Kodak). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (First strand cDNA synthesis kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA (5 μg in 8 μl) was heated at 65 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. Then, 5 μl of the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction mixture (135 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 204 mm KCl, 27 mm MgCl2, 5.4 mm each dNTP, and 0.24 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), together with 1 μl of 0.2 m dithiothreitol and 0.2 μg/μl random d(N)6 primer were added to the RNA solution. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h the mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture consisting of 25 μl of cDNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1‥ Triton X-100, 200 μm each dNTP, 0.625 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), and 25 pmol each of the forward and reverse sequence-specific primers. The reaction was carried out for 25–30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, with an extra 7-min extension at 72 °C for the last cycle (RoboCycler Gradient40, Stratagene). The optimal Mg2+ concentrations, cycles, and the forward and reverse primers used for analysis of FGFR and other gene markers are summarized in Table I. Aliquots of the PCR products (10 μl) were electrophoresed on 3.5‥ agarose gels (Nusieve GTG/Seakem) in Tris acetate EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. A linear amplification dependent on the amount of RNA was obtained under the above conditions (from 2.5 to 40 ng of RNA). The amounts of mRNA were adjusted in each RT-PCR reaction by checking amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts. The identity of all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing with the AmpliTaq cycle sequence kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) using the dye terminator method and a 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).Table IPCR primers for amplification of FGFR and other cDNAsGeneSequence (5′–3′)Product size[Mg2+]Annealing temp.No. of cyclesbpmm°CFGFR1TTCTGGGCTGTGCTGGTCAC605, 3381.756030TATGATGCTCCAGGTGGCATFGFR2TTCATCTGCCTGGTCTTGGTCAC633, 366, 2881.756030AATAAGGCTCCAGTGCTGGTTTCFGFR3CTAGTGTTCTGCGTGGCGGT446, 3923.56030TTCTTATCCATTCGCTCCGGGAPDHACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC4521.06030TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAAggrecanTGGGTGGATGCAGAGAGACG4811.756030TTCGAGGCTCTTCCCGTCCCollagen type IICACACTGGTAAGTGGGGCAAGACCG1721.756030GGATTGTGTTGTTTCAGGGTTCGGGp21TCCTGGTGATGTCCGACCTG4371.56030GCGCTTGGAGTGATAGAAATC Open table in a new tab 3 μg of total RNA that was extracted from undifferentiated ATDC5 cells was used for the reverse transcription, which was performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara RNA LAPCR kit) and the oligo(dT) primer at 50 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was amplified using the forward primer (5′-CCCGAGCTCTGGAGCCATGGTAGTC) and the reverse primer (5′-CTAGGATCCGCGTAAACATTGCCTG) before being extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with cold ethanol. The DNA was then ligated into the pT7Blue2 vector (Novagen), and competentEscherichia coli cells (Nova Blue) were transformed with the ligated vector. The plasmids of positive clones were extracted, and the nucleotide sequences of their inserts were determined in both orientations with an AmpliTaq cycle sequence kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), as described above. Full-length cDNAs encoding the FGFR3ΔAB and FGFR3 were cloned into the pBKRSV expression vector (Stratagene). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the total RNA derived from ATDC5 cells. The full-length cDNAs encoding FGFR3 were amplified by LA PCR, using a pair of primers (forward, 5′-CGACACTAGTGGAGCCATGGTAGTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGCGGCCGCGTAAACATTGCCTG-3′). The resulting DNA was then cloned into the pT7Blue2 T-vector and sequenced. The plasmid pT7Blue2 T-FGFR3ΔAB was obtained as described above. The following fragments were isolated and ligated to yield the two pBKRSV plasmids: anSpeI-BamHI restriction fragment of FGFR3 from the pT7Blue2 T plasmids or NheI-BamHI fragment of FGFR3ΔAB with an NheI-BamHI fragment of the pBKRSVΔlac expression vector, in which the lac promoter was removed. To express these FGFRs in BaF3 cells, 4 × 106 cells were incubated with 20–30 μg of pBKRSV-FGFR3 or pBKRSV-FGFR3ΔAB plasmids for 10 min at 4 °C. The BaF3 cells were then electroporated in a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 400 V and 960 microfarads before being plated. After 2–3 days of incubation in RPMI 1640 containing 10‥ FBS and 10‥ of the conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells, the BaF3 cells were recovered. After washing the medium, the BaF3 cells were selected with 10 ng/ml FGF1 and 10 μg/ml heparin in RPMI 1640 containing 10‥ FBS without the conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells. The cells expressing each FGFR3 isoform were homogenized in isotonic buffer containing 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, 200 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell membranes were then electrophoresed through SDS-7.0‥ polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Co.). The membranes were incubated with anti-C-terminal FGFR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before finally being developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate solution (Super Signal West Pico; Pierce) and exposed to BioMax MS film (Kodak) to visualize immunoreactive bands. Cell proliferation was assayed by counting the number of BaF3 cells stably expressing FGFR3ΔAB or FGFR3. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing 10‥ FBS but lacking IL-3. The cells were plated at 1 × 104cells per well in a total volume of 500 μl of medium in 24-multiwell plates. Various concentrations of FGFs were added in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of heparin. After 3 days, the viable cells were harvested and counted by a Coulter Counter ZM type, Beckman Coulter Co.). Experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the results are expressed as means ± standard deviations. ATDC5 cells were cultured in the medium containing 10 μg/ml insulin (the differentiation medium) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As reported previously, the presence of insulin resulted in an increased number of chondrocytes in the culture, which promoted more efficient chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cells compared with that in the absence of insulin (32Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). At the beginning of culture, ATDC5 cells were undifferentiated and did not express chondrogenic markers. The cells stopped growing at confluence, reached 4–5 days after the culture was started, but remained undifferentiated with a fibroblastic morphology. A transient condensation of cells with an elongated spindle-like morphology preceded the formation of the nodules. ATDC5 cells reentered the growth state through the cellular condensation followed by the formation of cartilage nodules from day 7 to day 10, with a cell doubling time of 48 h. The cartilage nodular structures seen from day 14 were composed of proliferating chondrocytes with a round morphology. This postconfluent growth of cells continued until day 21, when typical cartilage nodules were formed all over the culture. This cell state is called early phase differentiation (32Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To visualize the chondrogenic differentiation, Alcian blue staining of ATDC5 cells was performed as shown in Fig.1. The Alcian blue positive cells produce the proteoglycan aggrecan, which is a major component of cartilage. Alcian blue positive cells were not seen until day 10 (Fig. 1,a and b). During the postconfluent growth phase between days 10 and 21, Alcian blue-positive cells appeared to expand by the accumulation of cartilage matrix resulting from the ongoing chondrogenesis (Fig. 1, c and d). Chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells was further characterized by the expression of cartilage-characteristic extracellular matrix genes such as aggrecan and type II collagen. As shown in Fig.2, transcripts of these genes were undetectable by RT-PCR in the cells cultured with the differentiation medium from day 3 until day 7. These transcripts became detectable after day 10 and gradually increased until day 21. At the same time, the cartilage nodules first appeared at day 10, and their number also gradually increased until day 21. The mRNA of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was first detected on day 7, when the cells were in the condensation stage, and its expression gradually increased until day 21. This correlates well with the appearance of cartilage nodules and the increase in number of mature chondrocytes in culture. Fig.3 shows the time course of changes in FGFR mRNA by Northern blot analysis. FGFR1 (4.0 kb) and FGFR2 (4.5 kb) mRNAs were detected on all days tested. In contrast, FGFR3 mRNA was not detected in undifferentiated ATDC5 cells (day 3). By means of Northern blot analysis, the 4.5 kb-FGFR3 transcript was weakly detected on day 7, when the cells reached postconfluence, and the levels of FGFR3 expression gradually increased until day 21. The expression levels of FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNAs appeared to greatly increase until day 21 during formation of cartilage nodules (Fig. 3) and continued even until day 42 during late phase differentiation, when the number of hypertrophic chondrocytes increased in the culture (data not shown). FGFR4 transcripts were not detected at any phase in ATDC5 cells (data not shown). Next, the expression of the alternatively spliced isoforms of FGFRs that differ in the presence or absence of IgI and the acid box was examined by RT-PCR. We used the forward and reverse primers, which annealed to the signal sequence region and to the 3′-half of IgII in each FGFR, respectively (Table I). In FGFR1 and FGFR2, several isoforms were detected, as reported previously (4Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 5Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gensnel M.C. Houssaint E. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). The two types of FGFR1 variants were detected, one of which contains IgI (FGFR1α; 605 bp) and the other of which lacks IgI (FGFR1β; 338 bp) (Fig. 4). In contrast, three types of FGFR2 variants were detected. These are the complete form (633 bp), an isoform that lacks IgI (366 bp), and an isoform that lacks IgI and the acid box (288 bp) (Fig. 4). We extracted all the DNA fragments and confirmed their sequences. The expression levels of these FGFR1 and FGFR2 isoforms were increased during chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells, but the ratio of them remained unchanged throughout. It was found that all isoforms expressed in ATDC5 cells had only the IIIc exon (data not shown). This result corresponds to the previous observation that the IIIc isoform of FGFRs is expressed mainly in mesenchymal lineages, whereas the IIIb isoform expression is restricted to epithelial lineages (39Orr-Urtreger A.

Rab3A is a neural/neuroendocrine-specific member of the Rab family involved in Ca2+ -regulated exocytosis, where it functions in an inhibitory capacity controlling recruitment of secretory vesicles into a releasable pool at the plasma membrane. The effector by which Rab3A exerts its inhibitory effect is unclear as the Rab3A effectors Rabphilin and RIM have been excluded from for this role. One putative Rab3A effector in dense-core granule exocytosis is the cytosolic zinc finger protein, Noc2. We have established that overexpression of Noc2 in PC12 cells has a direct inhibitory effect upon Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in permeabilized cells. We demonstrate specific nucleotide-dependent binding of Noc2 to Rab3A and show that the inhibition of exocytosis is dependent upon this interaction since Rab3A binding-deficient mutants of Noc2 do not inhibit exocytosis. We propose that Noc2 may be a negative effector for Rab3A in regulated exocytosis of dense-core granules from endocrine cells.

Intracellular transport occurs via the targeted passage of transport vesicles between distinct cellular compartments and is dependent upon the complex interplay of a large number of protein factors (1Sudhof T.C.

Rab proteins comprise a large family of monomeric GTPases that are intimately linked to the secretory pathway in eukaryotes (5Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Distinct Rabs appear to operate at different transport steps within the cell, exerting an essential or regulatory function on membrane fusion events (6Simons K. Zerial M.

Experiments using Rab3A knockout mice have demonstrated a nonessential role for this protein in regulating the efficiency of neurosecretion, possibly by limiting the recruitment of synaptic vesicles into the releasable pool at the plasma membrane for subsequent fusion events (11Geppert M.

The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of Rab3A on regulated exocytosis is unknown. It is likely that one or more specific Rab3A effector proteins that interact with the GTP-bound form of Rab3A are responsible for this inhibitory phenotype, and several such factors have now been identified and characterized. The first of these was Rabphilin3A (21Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

In addition, Rabphilin3A also binds to α-actinin, a cytoskeletal protein involved in actin bundling, and hence may serve to integrate Rab3A activation with cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for vesicle dynamics (26Kato M.

RIM is a large multidomain protein that localizes to pre-synaptic active zones and associates specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rab3A via a zinc finger motif. The function of RIM is as yet undetermined, although its limited homology to putative tethering proteins, along with its plasma membrane localization may link it to a pre-docking role via Rab3A (29Pfeffer S.R.

The use of mutagenesis and analysis of gene knockouts has ruled out a requirement for Rab3A interaction for these effects and have eliminated Rabphilin 3A or RIM as the inhibitory effectors of Rab3A (31Joberty G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that has been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of exocytosis (32Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is calmodulin. This interpretation is problematic, however, as calmodulin has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on exocytosis (36Chamberlain L.H. Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of calmodulin to Rab3A is of low affinity and is not dependent on the nucleotide state of Rab3A (35Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is, therefore, not consistent with calmodulin acting as a Rab3A effector. Noc2 (NoC2 domain) is a 38-kDa cytosolic protein cloned on the basis of its similarity to Rabphilin3A (28Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As the name suggests, Noc2 lacks the C2 domains present in the C-terminal half of Rabphilin3A and yet it is highly homologous (77.9% sequence similarity) to the N-terminal Rab3A-binding domain of Rabphilin. Noc2 appears to be predominantly expressed in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, and, although it is also expressed at low levels in brain, it may represent a dense core granule-specific Rab3A effector. Interestingly, despite its homology with Rabphilin3A, an interaction between Noc2 and Rab3A has not been demonstrated (28Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Noc2 was found, however, to enhance high K+ induced secretion from transfected PC12 cells, indicating a role for Noc2 in some aspect of regulated secretion from endocrine cell types, although an indirect action on Ca2+channels or the Ca2+ signal could not be ruled out. In this study, we have attempted to clarify the function of Noc2 in regulated exocytosis. The data presented here indicate that recombinantly expressed Noc2 is able to specifically associate with Rab3A and that this interaction is sensitive to the guanine nucleotide state of Rab3A. We have also provided evidence for a direct role of Noc2 in regulated exocytosis due to an inhibitory effect of Noc2 overexpression on exocytosis triggered directly by Ca2+ in permeabilized PC12 cells. To determine whether this inhibitory phenotype is dependent directly upon a Noc2-Rab3A interaction, we have generated mutant forms of Noc2, which fail to bind Rab3A completely or which do so with a reduced affinity. Overexpression of the mutant constructs in PC12 cells did not inhibit exocytosis as had been seen with wild type Noc2. We suggest that Noc2 directly associates with Rab3A in neuroendocrine tissues and that this interaction may be essential for an inhibitory action in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Rat brain cDNA was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The full-length Noc2 sequence was amplified by PCR1 using an Omne-E dryblock thermocycler (Hybaid, Middlesex, United Kingdom (UK)). Primers based on the rat Noc2 nucleotide sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF022774) containing restriction endonuclease sites (underlined) for subsequent cloning were: sense, 5′-GGCGGGATCCATGGCTGACACCATCTTCAGCAG-3′ (BamHI); antisense, 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCAGTAATGGGTAGTTGCCCAG-3′ (XhoI); and antisense, 5′-GCCGAAGCTTTCAGTAATGGGTAGTTGCCCAG-3′ (HindIII). For protein expression, BamHI andXhoI primers were used for PCR, the product digested and ligated into pGex4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate an N-terminally GST-tagged fusion construct. For expression in PC12 cells, BamHI and HindIII primers were used for PCR and the product ligated into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, The Netherlands). All constructs were checked in both directions by automated sequencing (Oswell, Southampton, UK). Mutations were generated in both pGex4T-2-Noc2 and pcDNA3.1(−)-Noc2 by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange system (Stratagene). For the V58A single amino acid mutant, the primers were: sense, 5′-GGTGGAGGTCATCCTTCAGG(T/C)CATCCAGAGAGCAGAGC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCTCTGCTCTCTGGATG(A/G)CCTGAAGGATGACCTCCACC-3′. The AAA triple amino acid mutant (residues 154–156) used the following primers: sense, 5′-GGAAGAGGTCAGGGGCCG(T/G)(G/C)G(T/G)(T/C)C(T/G) (A/C)CAAAGGGCTCCCCAAGTAC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GTACTTGGGGAGCCCTTTG(T/G)(A/C)G(A/G)(A/C)C(C/G)(A/C)GGCCCCTGACCTCTTCC-3′. Nucleotides in parentheses indicate bases that were changed to generate the appropriate amino acid substitutions. The underlined, mutated sequence also generated a NotI restriction site used to screen mutant colonies. All mutant constructs were checked by automated sequencing in both directions (Oswell, Southampton, UK). PC12 cells were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (37Graham M.E. Gerke V. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Freshly trypsinized cells were plated onto 24-well trays at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well and transfected with 2 μg of test plasmid along with 3 μg of human growth hormone (hGH) plasmid (pXGH5, Nichols Institute Diagnostics) using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) as described previously (38Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Three days following transfection, the cells were assayed for hGH release. Cells were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin for 6 min and then challenged with buffer containing either 0 or 10 μmfree Ca2+ for 15 min (39McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Secreted hGH was quantitated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, East Sussex, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Freshly trypsinized HeLa cells were plated at a density of 100 × 105/35-mm plate and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid (pcDNA3, or plasmids encoding Noc2, Noc2(V58A), or Noc2(AAA)) using 3 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche). After an additional 48 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS dissociation buffer and samples separated by SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with affinity-purified anti-Noc2 (1:100) and visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGex4T-2 Noc2 plasmid constructs encoding wild type, Noc2(V58A), or Noc2(AAA) sequences were used to transform BL-21 RIL codon plus Escherichia coli (Stratagene). Protein expression was induced with 50 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Protein was purified from cytosolic fractions on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GST-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. E. coli expressing His6-Rab3A (a gift from Dr. M. Clague, University of Liverpool, UK) were induced with 400 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h and protein purified from cytosolic fractions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted using 400 mm imidazole. 1 μm GST, GST-Noc2, or GST-Noc2 mutant proteins were immobilized onto 20 μl of GST-Sepharose by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4). This was supplemented with either 50 μm GDP or GTPγS. Recombinant His6-Rab3A was then added to incubations at a final concentration of 1 μm and binding allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. GST-Sepharose pellets were collected and washed three times in 1 ml of the appropriate binding buffer containing GDP or GTPγS. Final pellets were extracted by addition of 50 μl of SDS dissociation buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 125 mm HEPES, pH 6.8) and boiling for 5 min. Bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting via transverse electrophoresis. Protein was detected with anti-Rab3A (1:400, Transduction Laboratories) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL). In some experiments, the concentration of Rab3A was varied over the range of 0.2–1.0 μm and bound Rab3A quantified using Imagequant densitometry software (Molecular Dynamics). 1 μm GST or GST-Noc2 was immobilized onto 20 μl of GST-Sepharose by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. 200-μl aliquots of rat brain/PC12 cell cytosolic or membrane proteins, prepared as previously described (40Steel G.J. Buchheim G. Edwardson J.M. Woodman P.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were then added to incubations and supplemented with either 50 μm GDP or 50 μm GTPγS. Binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. GST-Sepharose pellets were then collected and washed three times in 1 ml of either GDP- or GTPγS-containing binding buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Protein was detected using anti-Rab3A (1:400, Transduction Laboratories) or anti-Rab5B (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by development with ECL. GST-Noc2 (100 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce, Chester, UK) was injected subcutaneously into rabbits, followed after 4 weeks by a similar injection with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce). Bleeds were taken thereafter at 2–4-week intervals following boosts with GST-Noc2 (100 μg) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. PC12 cells (1 × 106/well) were plated onto glass coverslips and transiently cotransfected with 2 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid in combination with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1(−) plasmid (control) or 2 μg of the appropriate pcDNA-Noc2 plasmid construct using LipofectAMINE treatment (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Three days following transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in PBTA (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Cells were subsequently incubated with anti-Noc2 serum (1:100) in PBTA for 1 h, and washed three times with 1 ml of PBTA. The cells were then incubated with anti-rabbit-biotinylated IgG (1:100, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h and washed three times in 1 ml of PBTA, followed by incubation with streptavidin-Texas Red (1:50, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBTA and coverslips blotted and allowed to air-dry prior to mounting. Noc2 overexpression has been found to modify K+-induced secretion in PC12 cells but it was not clear if this was a direct effect on exocytosis. We were interested, therefore, to determine whether overexpression of Noc2 would have a direct effect on exocytosis rather than via ion channels, by examining the effect of overexpression on exocytosis in permeabilized cells. The approach used involved cotransfection with a plasmid encoding hGH to allow assay of exocytosis from transfected cells (39McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Noc2 was overexpressed in PC12 cells, we observed a reproducible reduction in hGH release relative to controls (Fig. 1) following stimulation with 10 μm Ca2+ in digitonin-permeabilized cells. It appears, therefore, that Noc2 can exert a direct inhibitory effect on Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis. We also found that Noc2 overexpression led to an inhibition of K+-induced hGH release in intact cells (data not shown). To determine the mechanism by which Noc2 overexpression inhibited secretion we re-analyzed its potential association with Rab3A, as previous studies had apparently failed to show binding between these proteins (28Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). First, we analyzed the distribution of both Rab3A and the endosome-specific, Rab5B in rat brain protein extracts by immunoblotting, which demonstrated that we could detect Rab3A in the membrane fraction and Rab5B in both membrane and cytosol fractions (Fig. 2 A). A series of binding assays were then performed using immobilized GST-Noc2 as an affinity column over which rat brain or PC12 cell protein extracts were passed. In the first of these experiments, rat brain cytosol and membrane protein fractions were incubated with the GST-Noc2 affinity resin, or a GST control column. Incubations were supplemented with either GDP or GTPγS, and bound proteins analyzed by immunoblotting. In this experiment (Fig. 2 B), GST-Noc2 effectively bound Rab3A from rat brain membrane samples only in the presence of GTPγS. As a specificity check, samples were also blotted for the endosomal Rab5B protein. No binding of Rab5B to Noc2 was observed in any sample although Rab5B was easily detectable in the rat brain extracts (Fig.2 A). This result suggests that the Noc2-Rab3A interaction is highly specific since a second closely related Rab protein failed to bind to Noc2 under identical experimental conditions. No detectable binding of Rab3A to GST controls was observed (data not shown). We next used the same affinity binding approach to analyze association of proteins from PC12 cell extracts with immobilized GST-Noc2 (Fig.2 C). In this system, as with rat brain, GST-Noc2 specifically bound Rab3A from membrane protein samples, again in a GTPγS-dependent fashion. This interaction was confirmed with purified recombinant Noc2 and Rab3A, where we observed binding that was substantially greater in the presence of GTPγS compared with GDP (Fig. 2 D). No binding of Rab3A to GST-loaded control beads was detected in the presence of GTPγS or GDP (Fig.2 D). This experiment demonstrates that the Rab3A must bind directly to Noc2. To determine the efficiency of binding in the assay, the signal from bound Rab3A was compared with that from known amounts of input Rab3A. From a quantitative analysis, it appeared that around 0.3% of the input was bound. This low efficiency may be due to the low affinity of the Noc2-Rab3A interaction (see below) that would not be well preserved during washing of the beads in the assay. To determine whether the Noc2-mediated inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis in PC12 cells depends upon its association with Rab3A, we took a mutagenesis approach, whereby key residues in Noc2 were altered in an attempt to create mutant forms of the protein, which could no longer support binding to Rab3A. Previous studies with Rabphilin3A mutants highlighted a number of residues essential for Rab3A association (31Joberty G. Stabila P.F. Coppola T. Macara I.G. Regazzi R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3579-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the high degree of similarity between Noc2 and the Rab3A binding domain of Rabphilin3A (Fig. 3 A), we reasoned that mutations at corresponding positions in Noc2 might also generate mutants defective in Rab3A binding. The mutation V61A in Rabphilin3A completely abolishes Rab3A binding and so the first Noc2 mutant generated altered the corresponding valine at position 58 to alanine, to produce Noc2(V58A). The crystal structure of Rab3A complexed to the N-terminal domain of Rabphilin3A has recently been solved (23Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). From this structural analysis, it is clear that Val-61 of Rabphilin3A (Val-58 of Noc2) contacts the switch region of Rab3A, an important point of interaction between the two proteins. The crystal structure also highlighted the potential importance of a conserved six-amino acid motif, which is found in various Rab3A effector proteins (23Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This SGAWF(F/Y) sequence (Fig. 3 A) resides in a second important contact area between Rabphilin3A/Rab3A. Mutants in this motif have not previously been examined, but we reasoned from this structural information that mutation of residues in the SGAWF(F/Y) motif should also generate Noc2 mutants with defective Rab3A binding. The second Noc2 mutant generated, Noc2(AAA), therefore changed SGAWFYin Noc2 to SGAAAA. The recombinant Noc2 mutant proteins, fused to GST, were expressed, and their binding to recombinant Rab3A in the presence of GTPγS was analyzed and compared with wild type protein (Fig. 3 B). Wild type Noc2 effectively associated with Rab3A, as did the Noc2(V58A) single amino acid mutant at high concentrations. Noc2(AAA), conversely, exhibited a complete loss of Rab3A binding in the same assay. Control GST protein gave no detectable Rab3A binding. To further characterize the binding of the V58A Noc2 mutant, an assay was performed with a constant concentration of Noc2 protein and varying concentrations of wild type or mutant Rab3A in the presence of GTPγS (Fig. 3 C). In these assays, GST controls, along with GST-Noc2 (AAA) exhibited no detectable binding even at the highest concentration of Rab3A. Wild type Noc2 exhibited saturable binding over a range of Rab3A concentrations. This binding was of lower affinity than observed for Rabphilin3A binding to Rab3A (43Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S. Miyazaki M. Nishikawa J. Wada K. Numata S. Kaibuchi N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27164-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was half-maximal at around 500 nm Rab3A. Noc2(V58A) also bound Rab3A over this concentration range, although with a lower affinity than the wild type protein and with ∼40% less Rab3A bound at the maximal concentration tested (Fig. 3 C). Having generated Noc2 mutants defective in Rab3A association, we next analyzed the effec"

Nature. 1949; 109: 464-466Google Scholar), the human Kell blood group system has been shown to be highly polymorphic. A series of the Kell antigens express antithetically with high and low frequencies, including KEL2 (k)/KEL1 (K), KEL4 (Kpb)/KEL3 (Kpa)/KEL21 (Kpc), KEL7 (Jsb)/KEL6 (Jsa), KEL11/KEL17, and KEL14/KEL24. The others have no known antithetical partner and are called para-Kell antigens. To date, 23 Kell antigens have been defined (3Redman C.M. Lee S. Cartron J.-P. Rouger P. Blood Cell Biochemistry.

Some Kell antigens exhibit ethnic specificity, for example, the K and Jsa antigens are characteristics of Europeans and Blacks, respectively. The former is found among the populations of European countries and varies in frequency from 4 to 9%, but is virtually absent in Orientals. Jsa, a low frequency antigen in general, has a high incidence of about 20% in Blacks. The Kell blood group antigens are potent immunogens aside from the A and B antigens of the ABO system and the D antigen of the Rh system. Anti-K antibody has been identified as causing severe hemolytic disease of the newborn and severe hemolytic transfusion reactions. The Kell system antibodies have been further shown to suppress erythropoiesis, and recently they were also demonstrated to suppress megakaryopoiesis (8Wagner T. Bernaschek G. Geissler K. N. Eng. J.

Thus, in the field of transfusion medicine, Kell system is considered to be most important after the ABO and Rh systems, especially in Western countries. The Kell and para-Kell antigens are located on a single transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 93 kDa (9Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P.

TheKEL cDNA sequence predicts a 732-amino acid polypeptide with a single type II transmembrane domain (residues 48–67) and a cytoplasmic region made up of the N-terminal 47 amino acids. The extracellularly located C-terminal 665-amino acid segment is where all of the known positions responsible for characterizing different Kell phenotypes are found. The coding region of the KEL gene is spread over 19 exon regions spanning more than 20 kilobase of genomic DNA and is on chromosome 7q33. The entire transmembrane region is encoded by exon 3. The Kell polypeptide has been shown to possess sequence and structural similarity to a family of mammalian neutral endopeptidases, and recently, it has been further shown to have proteolytic activity (21Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and process the big endothelin-3 to yield endothelin-3, a potent bioactive peptide with multiple biological roles. However, the physiological role of Kell protein is still obscure, although the protein is distributed wider than was previously thought, not only in erythroid tissues but also in nonerythroid tissues, such as testis, skeletal muscle, etc. (22Russo D. Wu X. Redman C.M. Lee S. Blood. 2000; 96: 340-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the Kell antigens can be depressed in certain instances, such as in the McLeod (23Redman C.M.

In 1957, Chown et al. (25Chown B. Lewis M. Kaita K. Nature. 1957; 180: 711Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) first described an unusual Kell-null (Ko) phenotype, which is defined as the complete lack of all known Kell antigens on the red cells. Although it is very rare, the Ko phenotype is widely distributed and has been identified in Europeans, Japanese, Africans, and Indians (3Redman C.M. Lee S. Cartron J.-P. Rouger P. Blood Cell Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 227-242Google Scholar). The absence of the Kell antigens on these Ko cells was shown to be due to lack of the protein on the red cell membrane, because polyclonal antibodies against the Kell protein failed to detect any Kell protein on the Ko red cell membrane by Western blotting (23Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Scarborough A. Johnson C.L. Rabin B.I. Overbeeke M. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 68: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Jaber A. Loirat M.-J. Willem C. Bloy C. Cartron J.-P. Blanchard D. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although there have been molecular studies on this phenotype, the molecular basis for this mutation is still unknown. In this paper we analyze the molecular basis of the Ko phenotype of a Chinese individual. A G to C substitution at the splice donor site (5′ splice site) of intron 3 of the KEL gene was found to be present as a homozygote in the Ko individual and demonstrated to be responsible for the complete lack of all Kell antigens in the Ko red cells. A Chinese individual with a group O phenotype and a negative direct antiglobulin test was noticed because he carried an alloantibody against a high frequency antigen during a pretransfusion test. The serum gave a positive reaction with all cells tested, including the panel cells of the DiaPanel (DiaMed, lot number 1621.70), 30 group O Taiwanese donor cells, Di(a+b−) cells and Vel negative cells, either by the manual Polybrene method or the LISS (low ionic strength saline) antiglobulin test. Blood group typing of the red cells of this individual was R1r (or R1R0), K−, k−, Kpa−, Kpb−, Jsa−, Jsb−, Fya+, Fyb−, Jka+, and Jkb+ (tested by FDA-approved commercial antisera except for anti-Jsa, which was a gift from Dr. J. Molds of Ortho Diagnostic Systems). The red cells showed a negative reaction with two anti-Ku sera obtained through the Serum Cells and Rare Fluids International Immunohematological Exchange Group. These two sera were from group A, Ko persons in the United States and Germany. Genomic DNAs of the Ko and other normal individuals were prepared from peripheral white blood cells using the QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen). The 19 exon regions of the KEL gene of the Ko individual were divided into nine segments and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).1 PCR primers used in this study were designed based on the papers of Lee et al. (12Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Lee S. Zambus E. Green E.D. Redman C. Blood. 1995; 85 (; Correction (1998) 87, 4922): 1364-1370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are listed in TableI. 100 ng of genomic DNA and 15 pmol of each primer were combined in 25 μl of PCR buffer containing 0.2 mm of dNTP and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). The PCR program consisted of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Sequences were directly determined from the PCR products using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The KEL gene sequence of the exon 3 to exon 4 region, amplified by the primer set, inF3 and inR4, of an individual with a normal KEL2 (KEL:−1,2 or K−k+) phenotype was also analyzed to inspect the exon 3-intron 3 junction and to allow comparison with that of the Ko individual.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR and RT-PCR amplificationEncompassing regionName1-aF and R represent forward and reverse primers, respectively, in and ex indicate the intron and exon sequences, respectively.SequencePrimers for PCR amplification of 19 exon regions ofKEL gene from genomic DNAexon 1 to exon 2inF1GTCACAGTGCAAGACAAAAGGAGCinR2AGACCCAGGAGAGGAGGCCACexon 3 to exon 4inF3TTTCACCTCTTGGTTCCTCCCACinR4GCATCTTCCACCCTGCTTTCCTCexon 5 to exon 6inF5GTCCTCAACTCCCATGCTTCCTTTCinR6GTGTCTTCGCCAGTGCATCCCTCexon 7 to exon 9inF7TCTCTCCAGTCTCTCTTGTGCCCinR9CTCCCCAATCCCACCTGCGGCGAexon 10inF10GTGTGGGTCTCTTTTGTCTCCATinR10CAAATACACCCGCTCCTCTCCTCexon 11inF11ACTCATTCCAGCTTTGTCTCCinR11TGGGAAGAGCTCTCACATexon 12 to exon 14inF12CTGTCCCTGGACCTCACTCCCACinR14GCCTGTGTCTCCCCTGCTGTCAexon 15 to exon 18inF15GAGTTCACATGTCCTCTTCCCACinR18TGGCGGGAGGTGGCCGCTGCCTexon 19inF19TTCAATGACCTCTCTTCCTGCTCexR19CGGAAGCCAAGTGCCAGCTTPrimers for RT-PCR amplification ofKELcDNA from total RNAexon 1 to exon 19exFgGTTTCCTGGACCCCAGTCCTCCGAATCAGCexRaCCATGGATGTGACCAGGGAGGTGTTGGTCGexon 2 to exon 8exFdCAAAGTGAGGAAGAGCCGAGGGAACGCAGCexReCTTGAGCTGGTCGATAGTGACCATCTGGexon 1 to exon 19exFbCTAGAGTGGAACCAGGAAGGATTCTGGAGCexRfAACCAAGTTACCAGAGCTGGCAGCGGCTGG1-a F and R represent forward and reverse primers, respectively, in and ex indicate the intron and exon sequences, respectively. Open table in a new tab The G to C nucleotide substitution identified at the splice donor site of intron 3 of the Ko gene creates aDdeI recognition sequence (CTNAG). PCR-based RFLP analysis was carried out to analyze this nucleotide position. The exon 3 to exon 4 region of the KEL gene was amplified by inF3 and inR4 primers as above, and the 624-bp PCR product was digested by theDdeI restriction endonuclease and then analyzed using a 3.0% agarose gel. In addition to the DNAs from Ko and the normal KEL2 individuals, another 66 genomic DNAs obtained from randomly selected individuals were also subjected to the PCR-RFLP analysis to measure the incidence of this G to C mutation in the KEL genes of the general population. Total RNA were isolated from peripheral blood cells using the QIAamp Mini RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen). The One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was employed. 0.4 μg of total RNA and 15 pmol of each primer, exFg and exRa (Table I), which anneal to sequences within exon 1 and exon 19 regions, respectively, were combined in a total volume of 25 μl containing 0.4 mm of dNTP and the RT-PCR enzyme mix, following the manufacturer's instructions. The RT-PCR program consisted of 30 min at 50 °C for RT and then 15 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Nested PCR using primer sets of exFd and exRe or exFb and exRf (Table I) was then performed to sample from exon 2 to exon 8 or from exon 1 to exon 19 cDNA regions, respectively, using 1 μl of the RT-PCR product as a template. The program for the nested PCRs consisted of 5 min at 94 °C and then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C and 2.5 min at 72 °C. The exon 2 to exon 8 product was analyzed by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The nested amplified exon 1 to exon 19 products from three normal individuals were analyzed to reveal the general KEL transcript structure. The 19 exon regions of the KELgene were divided into 9 segments and amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, as described above. The amplified products were directly sequenced to analyze the coding regions. The entire coding sequence of theKEL gene of the Ko individual was shown to be identical with that of a normal KEL2/KEL4/KEL7 gene. No substitution, deletion, or insertion was identified. However, a nucleotide substitution, G to C, was found at the splice donor site of the intron 3 (Fig. 1, right panel). The mutation destroys the consensus sequence (GT) for the splice donor site, and the sequencing result suggests a homozygous state for the mutation in the Ko individual. Other splice donor and acceptor sites of the KEL gene of the Ko individual were demonstrated to have the conserved GT and AG sequences, respectively. A parallel sequencing analysis on the exon 3-intron 3 junction of theKEL gene of an individual with a normal KEL2 phenotype demonstrated the consensus GT sequence (Fig. 1, left panel). Because the G to C substitution created a DdeI restriction site (Fig. 1, right panel), a PCR-RFLP analysis was used to study this nucleotide position. DdeI digestion of the 624-bp PCR product, encompassing the exon 3 to exon 4 region of theKEL gene amplified from the normal KEL2 individual, yielded 330-, 219-, and 75-bp fragments (Fig. 2,A and B, lane 1). The 330-bp fragment generated from the Ko individual was further cleaved into 170- and 160-bp fragments (Fig. 2, Aand B, lane Ko). The pattern in the lane Ko also suggested that the Ko individual is homozygous for the G to C mutation and agrees with the result from the direct sequencing. However, another possibility that he has a haploid mutant genotype at the KEL locus cannot be excluded. Genomic DNAs from another 66 randomly selected individuals were subjected to the PCR-RFLP analysis. The results (data not shown) demonstrated that no other KEL allele possessed this nucleotide substitution in the individuals tested, suggesting that the mutation is rare in the general population. To reveal the effect on the KEL transcript structure exerted by the mutated splice donor site in the Kogene, the KEL mRNA of the Ko individual was analyzed by RT-PCR and compared with mRNA obtained from 11 randomly selected common individuals. The first RT-PCR sampled the exon 1 to exon 19 region of theKEL cDNA, and the following nested PCR amplified the exon 2 to exon 8 region. All of the 11 normal individuals generated a product with expected size of 909 bp (six of them are shown inlanes 1–6 of Fig. 3), and direct sequencing demonstrated the complete exon 2 to exon 8 structure. The 909-bp fragment was shown to be the major product in all of the 11 samples, except for one individual shown in lane 2, where it was minor. Nevertheless, the 909-bp fragment was absent when the RNA of the Ko individual was amplified, but a major product with a smaller size of 767 bp was obtained instead (Fig. 3, lane Ko). Sequencing analysis showed the DNA fragment consisting of sequence from exon 2 to exon 8 but without the 142-bp sequence of the exon 3 region. The result proved the complete lack of the correct KELmRNA transcript and the presence of a major transcript with the exon 3 region skipped in the Ko individual. Obviously the transcript without exon 3 results from the mutation of G to C present in theKo gene, which destroys the splice donor consensus of intron 3. The 620-bp minor product obtained from the Ko RNA was shown to have a structure lacking exon 3 and exon 6; other minor bands were found to be artifacts (Fig. 3, lane Ko). In addition to the complete KEL transcript, a 767-bp product devoid of the exon 3 region was also found in four of the 11 normal individuals (two of the four are in lanes 2 and 6of Fig. 3). Further studies showed that several forms of theKEL transcripts, in addition to the complete structure, could be demonstrated in the peripheral blood cell RNA of these normal individuals. These different transcripts are believed to result from alternative splicing. The Kell epitopes are located on the single Kell polypeptide made up of 732 amino acid residues. The amino acid positions responsible for 18 of the known 23 antigens, among which 11 belong to five antithetical sets, have been revealed, and have been shown to localize extracellularly. All of the molecular bases have been shown to result from point mutations leading to amino acid substitution in theKEL gene. The positions of the remaining five epitopes have not yet been identified but are believed to lie in the Kell glycoprotein too. The Kell-null or Ko phenotype, which represents the complete lack of the expression of all Kell antigens, although known for more than 40 years, has not had its molecular basis elucidated up to the present. The entire coding sequence of the KEL gene of our Ko case demonstrated a normal KEL2/KEL4/KEL7gene sequence, but a nucleotide substitution of G to C identified at the splice donor site of intron 3 was found in the Ko individual. The results of the sequencing and PCR-RFLP analyses suggested that he is most likely homozygous for the mutation; however, the possibility that he has a haploid mutant genotype at the KEL locus should not be excluded without further analysis. The substitution destroys the conserved sequence of a splice donor site. RT-PCR analysis further proved that exon 3 was absolutely absent in the transcripts from theKo gene. Thus, the destroyed donor splicing consensus makes the exon 3 region become a pseudoexon and results in the removal of exon 3 during KEL mRNA processing (Fig.4). Three different consequences of aberrant mRNA splicing because of splice junction mutations have been observed: exon skipping, utilization of cryptic splice site, and intron retention. Data bases of aberrant splicing mutations in human (26Krawczak M. Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) and mammalian (27Nakai K. Sakamoto H. Gene. 1994; 141: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) genes show that exon skipping is most frequently observed in aberrant splicing resulting from splice site mutation, whereas intron retention seldom occurs. The “exon definition model” proposed by Robberson et al. (28Robberson B.L. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) gives a possible explanation for the skipping of exon adjacent to mutated splice site. Following the model to describe the normal mRNA maturation, the initial step of splicesome formation is exon definition, in which factors, including a variety of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and associated proteins, binding to the splice acceptor site (3′ splice site) followed by a search for and then the binding of factors to a downstream splice donor site. Factors at splice sites communicate across exons to define exon regions. After exon recognition, the splicing machinery cleaves introns and religates the coding sequences. In the absence of the consensus splice donor site, the splicing machinery searches for a neighboring best fit site, a cryptic site. If no acceptable site can be found in the vicinity of the authentic splice site, the splicesome complex becomes unstable resulting in insufficient preservation of exon region, and exon skipping seems to occur (28Robberson B.L. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of suitable cryptic splice site in the vicinity is an important factor in determining which event, skipping or cryptic site usage, occurs (26Krawczak M. Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). As for the Ko gene, the splice donor site of intron 3 is destroyed, and obviously possible neighboring cryptic splice sites are not recognized. Thus, the whole exon 3 is skipped. Many examples of aberrant splicing in human genes and thus leading to genetic diseases have been demonstrated (26Krawczak M. Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 29Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.-P. Seldman J.G. Seidman C.E.

However, some cases represent combinations of different events, exon skipping and cryptic splice site usage (29Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.-P. Seldman J.G. Seidman C.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 37Okubo M. Horinishi A. Suzuki Y. Murase T. Hayasaka K. Am. J. Med.

Genet. 1999; 65: 336-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A KEL mRNA with the exon 3 skipped results in a reading frameshift, and the predicted polypeptide has an altered amino acid sequence and is truncated at C-terminal end by a premature stop codon (Fig. 5). The transmembrane segment of the Kell glycoprotein (residues 48–67, underlined in Fig.5), which anchors the protein appropriately to the cell membrane, is encoded by exon 3, and of the 732-amino acid residues of Kell polypeptide, only the cytoplasmic N-terminal 27 amino acids are expressed correctly from the Ko gene (Fig. 5, right panel). The C-terminal segment is lost, and this is where all of the known Kell epitope positions are found. This explains the loss of all the Kell antigens in the Ko individual. Previous investigations using Western blotting analysis indicated the absence of Kell protein on the Ko red cells (23Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Scarborough A. Johnson C.L. Rabin B.I. Overbeeke M. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 68: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Jaber A. Loirat M.-J. Willem C. Bloy C. Cartron J.-P. Blanchard D. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), giving rise to the absence of all Kell epitopes. The molecular basis of the Ko phenotype presented here meets the observation. The correct KEL mRNA is absent, and instead, a transcript devoid of exon 3 region is the major form in the RNA of Ko cells. However, the form without exon 3 region was also present in four of the 11 normal individuals tested, although none of them had the G to C substitution in their KEL genes. Structures of theKEL transcripts of three of these normal individuals were further analyzed by sequencing the nested amplified RT-PCR products that encompassed the exon 1 to exon 19 cDNA region. In addition to the complete exon 1–19 transcript, KEL transcripts without exon 3, without exons 3 and 6, and without exons 3, 6, 7, and 9 were identified. The results suggest that there is frequent alternative splicing during the processing of the KEL mRNA, and exon 3 and exon 6 seem to be most commonly skipped. Some mutations in the KEL gene can result in the weakening of Kell antigen expression. The Kpa phenotype has been known to be associated with a weakened expression of other Kell antigens. The missense mutation responsible for Kpaphenotype has been shown to cause aberrant transport of the Kell glycoprotein in Golgi compartment and consequently a reduction of the total amount of the protein at cell surface (38Yazdanbakhsh K. Lee S., Yu, Q. Reid M.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 310-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reduced quantity of Kell glycoprotein has also been demonstrated at the surface of Kmod cells, a rare phenotype with very weak Kell antigens. A different amino acid change was suggested to connect with the phenotype (39Uchikawa M. Onodera T. Tsuneyama H. Enomoto T. Ishijima A. Yuasa S. Murata S. Tadokoro K. Nakajima K. Juji T. Vox Sang. 2000; 78 (abstr.): O011Google Scholar). Other missense mutations in the KEL gene produce the polymorphic antigens of the Kell blood group system. However, no nonsense mutation, deletion, or insertion in the KEL gene resulting in loss of part or all of the Kell antigens has been reported in the literature. This study shows that the abolition of the expression of all Kell antigens in the Ko phenotype is due to a base change at a splice site rather than the above changes. However, it appears that different Ko cases might be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Lee et al.(19Lee S. Russo D. Redman C. Transfus. Med. Rev. 2000; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) 2S. Lee, D. Russo, and C. Redman, unpublished observation. have identified two unrelated Ko individuals who are heterozygous with one KELallele possessing either a mutation at a consensus splice junction (which may be similar to our Ko case) or a nonsense mutation and with the other allele having point mutations leading to amino acid change."
https://openalex.org/W1543703735,"We previously reported that a helical trigger segment within the GCN4 leucine zipper monomer is indispensable for the formation of its parallel two-stranded coiled coil. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic secondary structure of the trigger site is largely stabilized by an intrahelical salt bridge. Removal of this surface salt bridge by a single amino acid mutation induced only minor changes in the backbone structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper dimer as verified by nuclear magnetic resonance. The mutation, however, substantially destabilized the dimeric structure. These findings support the proposed hierarchic folding mechanism of the GCN4 coiled coil in which local helix formation within the trigger segment precedes dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2006365898,"The Rho family GTPase Rac1 mediates a variety of signal transduction processes leading to activation of NADPH oxidase, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, transcription activation, and stimulation of DNA synthesis. In this study, Rac1 was found to form a reversible monomer and oligomer in both the GDP- and GTP-bound statesin vitro and in cells. Mutational analysis and peptide competition experiments showed that the unique C-terminal domain of Rac1 consisting of six consecutive basic residues (amino acids 183–188) is required for the homophilic interaction. Oligomerization of Rac1-GTP led to a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, resulting in a significantly enhanced intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Rac1-GTP. Deletion or mutation of the polybasic residues drastically decreased its intrinsic GTPase activity and resulted in a loss of the self-stimulatory GAP activity. In the oligomeric state, Rac1 became insensitive to the RhoGAP stimulation, albeit maintaining the responsiveness to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The ability of the Rac1 C-terminal mutants to activate the effector p21cdc42/rac-activated kinase-1 correlated with their oligomerization states, suggesting that oligomer formation potentiates effector activation. Furthermore, the oligomer-to-monomer transition of Rac1-GDP could be driven effectively by interaction with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. Building on previous characterizations of Rac1 interaction with regulatory proteins and effectors, these results suggest that Rac1 may employ yet another means of regulation by cycling between the monomeric and oligomeric states to effectively generate a transient and augmented signal. The Rho family GTPase Rac1 mediates a variety of signal transduction processes leading to activation of NADPH oxidase, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, transcription activation, and stimulation of DNA synthesis. In this study, Rac1 was found to form a reversible monomer and oligomer in both the GDP- and GTP-bound statesin vitro and in cells. Mutational analysis and peptide competition experiments showed that the unique C-terminal domain of Rac1 consisting of six consecutive basic residues (amino acids 183–188) is required for the homophilic interaction. Oligomerization of Rac1-GTP led to a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, resulting in a significantly enhanced intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Rac1-GTP. Deletion or mutation of the polybasic residues drastically decreased its intrinsic GTPase activity and resulted in a loss of the self-stimulatory GAP activity. In the oligomeric state, Rac1 became insensitive to the RhoGAP stimulation, albeit maintaining the responsiveness to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The ability of the Rac1 C-terminal mutants to activate the effector p21cdc42/rac-activated kinase-1 correlated with their oligomerization states, suggesting that oligomer formation potentiates effector activation. Furthermore, the oligomer-to-monomer transition of Rac1-GDP could be driven effectively by interaction with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor.

They regulate a wide spectrum of cellular functions, ranging from cell growth and cytoskeletal organization to secretion (1Hall A.

The physiological significance of Rho family GTPases is highlighted by increasing evidence for their involvement in human diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and inflammation (5Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 6Zohn I.M.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2947-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple biological functions of Rho family proteins are mediated through a tightly regulated GTP-binding/GTP-hydrolyzing cycle (8Mackay D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 9Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Three classes of regulatory proteins are known to be involved in the regulatory process. The guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, resulting in activation of the GTPases, whereas the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by Rho GTPases, leading to the rapid conversion to the GDP-bound inactive state. The Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) preferentially bind to the GDP-bound form of Rho proteins and prevent both spontaneous and GEF-catalyzed release of the nucleotide. In addition, RhoGDI recognizes the isoprenoid moiety of the GTPases and is capable of solubilizing the membrane-associated proteins. In the GTP-bound form, the Rho proteins interact with their specific effector or target molecules to trigger diverse cellular responses. Among a growing panel of the small G-protein targets, the serine/threonine protein kinases p21cdc42/rac-activated kinases (PAKs) were found to be activated upon binding to the GTP-bound form of Rac1 and Cdc42 (10Bishop A. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar,36Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and they have been implicated in a number of signaling pathways downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and cytoskeletal reorganization (36Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Among the Rac subfamily, the Rac1 GTPase shares >90% amino acid identity with its closest relatives, Rac2 and Rac3, and much functional redundancy has been expected among the three Rho GTPase members (11Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, both Rac1 and Rac2 can be substituted in vitroeffectively as a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. In addition to differences in tissue distributions (Rac1 and Rac3 are ubiquitous, whereas Rac2 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells) (11Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Moll J. Sansig G. Fattori E. van der Putten H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 863-866PubMed Google Scholar), however, two lines of evidence suggest that Rac1 may play a distinct role in cells. Neutrophils from Rac2 knockout mice are defective in many actin-based functions as well as in cell proliferation and survival even though Rac1 expression remains high (13Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A. Pollock J.D. Borneo J.B. Bradford G.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In vitro, Rac1 is able to bind to and stimulates the kinase activity of PAK1 ∼4–5-fold better than Rac2 (14Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These functional differences are reflected in their structures, which differ significantly only at the C termini. Most notably, Rac1 contains a unique C-terminal domain consisting of six consecutive basic amino acids, whereas this domain is disrupted by three neutral amino acids in the Rac2 and Rac3 sequences. This region of the molecule is not structured in the tertiary model of available Rho GTPases (28Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E.

Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and in interaction with effector proteins (14Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). How the unique feature of this region in Rac1 might contribute to the distinct function of Rac1 remains unclear. Besides the interaction with regulatory proteins and effector molecules, a few Rho GTPases have been found to interact homophilically among themselves. We have previously shown that Cdc42 and Rac2 may form homodimers and that the dimerization event elicits a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating activity of the GTPases similar to the RhoGAP effect (16Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An arginine residue in the C-terminal domain of these GTPases was shown to confer the catalytic GAP activity (17Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that certain small GTPases may involve self-association as an additional mode of regulation. Similar suggestions have been made for other small and large G-proteins. For example, ADP-ribosylation factor-1 has been shown to exist in a functional dimeric or tetrameric form (18Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunnen J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A recent study with Ras suggests that dimerization at the plasma membrane is essential for Raf-1 activation (19Inouye K. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3737-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In analogy, homodimerization or oligomerization in large GTPases of the Mx family, which are interferon-induced GTPases (76 kDa) responsive to viral infections, has been known to regulate their GTP-binding and GTP-hydrolyzing cycle, yielding a highly efficient self-regulatory large GTPase complex (20Paolo C. Hefti H. Meli M. Landis H. Pavlovic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32071-32078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whether a similar homophilic interaction occurs between Rac1 GTPases and how such an interaction would affect the regulatory cycle of Rac1 are of particular interest to us. In this study, we present evidence that Rac1 forms a reversible monomer and oligomer under physiologically relevant conditions and that its C-terminal polybasic domain is an essential determinant for oligomer formation. The biochemical results reported here, combined with our previous knowledge of Rac1 regulation, lead to a model in which the Rac1 oligomeric state may contribute to the generation of a transient and augmented signal. GDP, GTP, GTPγS, and bacterial purine-nucleotide phosphorylase were purchased from Sigma. All radiolabeled nucleotides were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2-Amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) was synthesized as described previously (22Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The polypeptides corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of Rac1 and Cdc42 (PVKKRKRKCLLL and PEPKKSRRCVLL, respectively) were custom-synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, IN), respectively. The Rac1 C-terminal mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis using internally derived oligonucleotides encoding the desired sequences. Rac1−8 represents a truncated form of Rac1 with deletion of the last eight residues of the C terminus. The Rac1-5Q mutant contains five Gln residues substituted for the polybasic residues (amino acids 183–187) of Rac1. The Rac1-Cdc42 mutant contains amino acids 183–188 of Cdc42 substituted for the corresponding residues of Rac1 in the Rac1 backbone. The mutant cDNAs were sequence-proofed and subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector, pET28a vector, pVL1392-His6, pCMV6-Myc vector, or pKH3 vector to be expressed as the GST, His6, Myc, or (HA)3fusions in Escherichia coli cells, Sf9 insect cells, or mammalian cells. The pKH3-Cdc42 and pKH3-RhoA constructs were as previously described (46Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pCMV6-Myc-PAK1 construct was a kind gift from Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). The preparation of recombinant GTPases was performed as described (23Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The E. coli-expressed proteins were in GST- or His6-tagged form and were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose or Ni2+-agarose beads. The insect cell expression of His6-Rac1 was carried out by previously described procedures (24Zheng Y. Fisher D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The N-terminal GST- or His6-tagged sequences were cleaved by thrombin digestion when necessary. The post-translationally modified form of Rac1 was purified from the membrane fraction of the Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus encoding His6-Rac1. RhoGDI and the GAP domain of p50RhoGAP containing amino acids 205–439 were expressed as GST fusions in E. coli as described. The quality of the proteins used in all assays was judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels and/or by using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). For transient expression in COS-7 cells, the pCMV6-Myc and pKH3 constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells grown to ∼80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum using LipofectAMINE regent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested for the complex formation assays. A Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (10 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to analyze the homophilic interactions of the small GTPases in combination with a Bio-Rad biologic liquid chromatography system as previously described (16Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mmMgCl2 and was calibrated with molecular mass standards containing thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were loaded in a volume of 0.1 ml, and elutions were performed at the indicated buffer conditions. The radioactive filter binding assays measuring the retention of [γ-32P]GTP-bound Rac1 were carried out as described (25Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Shinjo K. Evans T. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24629-24634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Rac1 was preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm EDTA for 10 min at ambient temperature before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm. An aliquot of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was mixed with reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmMgCl2. At different time points, the reaction was terminated by filtering the reaction mixture through nitrocellulose filters, followed by washing with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 10 mmMgCl2. The radioactivity retained on the filters was then subjected to scintillation counting. The MESG/phosphorylase system monitoring the free γ-Pireleased from the GTP-bound proteins was based on the method described by Webb and Hunter (26Webb M.R. Hunter J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and has been applied to the measurement of Rho GTPases (17Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.8-ml solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm MESG, 10 units of purine-nucleotide phosphorylase, 200 μm GTP, and the indicated amount of GTP-preloaded recombinant GTPase was mixed in a 4-mm width, 10-mm path length cuvette, and the time courses of the absorbance change at 360 nm were recorded. The concentration of Pi in the solution released from the G-protein-bound GTP is proportional to the net absorbance change by a factor of the extinction coefficient ε360 nm= 11,000 m−1cm−1 at pH 7.6 (26Webb M.R. Hunter J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The kinetic data analysis was carried out as described previously (23Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with the Myc-Rac1, HA-Rac1, HA-Cdc42, HA-RhoA, or Myc-PAK1 construct alone or in combination were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin; and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting of the cell lysates. For the immunoprecipitation assay, HA-tagged Rac1 was precipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from the lysates after a 2-h incubation under constant agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and subjected to anti-Myc or anti-HA Western blotting. To carry out the PAK1 kinase assay (14Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the anti-Myc-PAK1 immunoprecipitates were incubated in a 60-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of various Rac1 mutants preloaded with GTPγS for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography/phosphorimaging analysis. To examine the effect of RhoGDI on the homophilic interaction of Rac1, the isoprenylated forms of His6-Rac1 and HA-Rac1 were generated from the membrane fraction of Sf9 insect cells and COS-7 cells, respectively, by extraction with 0.5% CHAPS. Immobilized His6-Rac1 was incubated with HA-Rac1 in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% CHAPS, and various doses of GST-RhoGDI. After three washes with the incubation buffer, the His6-Rac1 coprecipitates were then subjected to anti-HA Western blot analysis. We have previously described the dimerization properties of a few Rho family GTPase members, including RhoA, Rac2, and Cdc42 (16Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These Rho proteins contain two or more positively charged basic residues in the C-terminal region that were found to be essential for dimer formation (17Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a distinct member of the Rho family, Rac1 contains six consecutive basic residues (183KKRKRK188) in this region. Initially, we were interested to test whether Rac1 would conform to the similar dimer-forming property of Rac2 and Cdc42. The gel filtration profile of purified Rac1 shows that Rac1 was eluted in two peak fractions that correspond to estimated molecular masses of ∼25 and ∼600 kDa, respectively (Fig.1A), suggesting that Rac1 could exist in a mixture consisting of a monomer and higher order oligomer under the physiologically relevant buffer conditions. Both the GDP- and GTPγS-bound Rac1 proteins yielded similar gel filtration profiles, indicating that the nucleotide-binding state of Rac1 does not affect the monomer-oligomer distribution. When the gel filtration pattern of Rac1 was compared with that of other small GTPases such as Ras and Cdc42, it became clear that the oligomerization property is unique to Rac1 since both Ras and Cdc42 (Fig. 1A), as well as the Rho GTPases including RhoA, RhoB, Rac2, and TC10 (data not shown), were detected exclusively in the monomeric form or in a mixture of monomer and dimer. To rule out the trivial explanation that oligomer formation was due to irreversible aggregation of Rac1, we performed further gel filtration analysis at varying salt and/or Mg2+concentrations. Increasing the NaCl concentration from 50 to 300 mm resulted in a gradual shift of the overall population of Rac1 from oligomer to monomer, whereas the divalent Mg2+ion also appeared to have a dramatic effect on the monomer-oligomer distribution such that >70% Rac1 oligomer was disassembled into monomer when the Mg2+ concentration was raised from 0.2 to 30 mm as exemplified in two such conditions in Fig.1A. Moreover, the monomer-to-oligomer transition was dependent on the initial Rac1 concentrations (submicromolar) (data not shown). These results indicate that the oligomer and monomer of Rac1 exist in a reversible equilibrium. To further establish that Rac1 is capable of oligomerization, a complex formation assay was performed using immobilized GST-Rac1-GTPγS in an incubation with purified His6-tagged Rac1-GTPγS, Cdc42-GTPγS, or RhoA-GTPγS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of GST-Rac1 coprecipitates revealed that whereas GST-Rac1 bound to Cdc42 or RhoA at a barely detectable level, it was capable of a tight interaction with His6-Rac1 (Fig. 1B). The binding affinity between GST-Rac1 and His6-Rac1 was sensitive to the buffer ionic strength since the amount of His6-Rac1 coprecipitates was markedly reduced at increasing concentrations of NaCl or MgCl2. These results confirm that Rac1 is capable of forming an oligomer and further suggest that oligomerization is mostly homophilic in nature. To determine whether Rac1 oligomerization could occur in a cellular background, we coexpressed two N-terminal tagged forms of Rac1, HA-Rac1 and Myc-Rac1, in COS-7 cells. As a comparison, HA-Cdc42 or HA-RhoA was also coexpressed with Myc-Rac1 in these cells. Cellular HA-Rac1, HA-Cdc42, or HA-RhoA was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads, and the presence of associated Myc-Rac1 was detected by anti-Myc Western immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, the HA-Rac1 immunoprecipitates readily associated with Myc-Rac1 under the condition that no nonspecific binding of Myc-Rac1 to the anti-HA antibody complex was visible. In contrast, HA-RhoA did not appear to associate with Myc-Rac1 under similar conditions, whereas HA-Cdc42 displayed weaker binding to Myc-Rac1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, cellular Rac1 may form a stable homo-oligomer, raising the possibility that this feature of Rac1 may be involved in its regulation. The polybasic motif located immediately upstream of the isoprenylation CAAX box at the C terminus appears to be conserved among the Rho family GTPases (Fig.2A). The recently available three-dimensional structures of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, however, do not provide clues as to how this region is folded with regard to the overall structural backbone because truncation of this region was necessary for the crystallization conditions or NMR data collection process (28Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our previous sequence analysis revealed that the presence of two or more Lys or Arg residues in this region correlates with the homophilic interaction of the Rho family members RhoA and Cdc42 (16Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine whether this region is involved in Rac1 oligomerization, two different experimental approaches were taken. First, a pair of polypeptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of Rac1 and Cdc42 (amino acids 180–191), respectively, were synthesized and used in a competition assay. Incubation of the Rac1-derived polypeptide (PVKKRKRKCLLL) with Rac1 caused a concentration-dependent disassembly of the Rac1 oligomer, and at 300 μm, the oligomer was completely shifted to monomer (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues of Cdc42 (PEPKKSSRRCVLL) displayed only a marginal effect on the oligomer-monomer distribution of Rac1 at the similar concentrations (data not shown), suggesting that the Rac1 polypeptide effect is specific for the Rac1 homophilic interaction. Second, a set of C-terminal mutants of Rac1 were constructed and tested for their effects on oligomerization (Fig. 2A). The Rac1/Cdc42 chimera (Rac1-Cdc42 mutant), which contains the Rac1 backbone with the C-terminal eight residues substituted with those of Cdc42, suffered a partial loss in the ability to form an oligomer, whereas the removal of the last eight residues from Rac1 (Rac1−8) or the substitution of the C-terminal five basic residues of Rac1 with Gln (Rac1-5Q) completely abolished oligomer formation (Fig. 2C). The combined results from these two independent approaches indicate that the C-terminal polybasic domain of Rac1 directly participates in oligomer formation. The requirement of the C-terminal domain for Rac1 oligomerization was also tested in vivo. Although Myc-tagged Rac1 was readily co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Rac1 from the lysates of COS-7 cells coexpressing the two Rac1 species, Myc-Rac1−8 failed to associate with HA-Rac1−8 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, Myc-Rac1 was found to remain capable of forming a stable complex with HA-Rac1−8 in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the oligomerization is likely to adopt an asymmetric configuration. These results confirm that the C-terminal domain of Rac1 is intimately involved in the oligomerization. To examine the biochemical properties of different forms of Rac1, the eluent fractions corresponding to the oligomer and monomer from the Superdex 200HR gel filtration column were isolated. We first compared the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activities of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of Rac1. In a filter binding assay, each of the separated species at 2 μm was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Single turnover GTP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Rac1 oligomer was active in binding and hydrolyzing GTP and exhibited a significantly higher intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity compared with the monomer. The apparent reaction rates were determined to be 0.16 and 0.02 min−1 for the oligomer and monomer pools, respectively. Similar rate constants were obtained by a"

Here, we show that FBPase import is independent of vacuole functions and proteasome degradation. However, FBPase import required the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc1p. A strain containing a deletion of the UBC1 gene exhibited defective FBPase import. Furthermore, FBPase import was inhibited when cells overexpressed the K48R/K63R ubiquitin mutant that fails to form multiubiquitin chains. The defects in FBPase import seen for the Δubc1 and the K48R/K63R mutants were attributed to the Vid vesicle fraction. In the Δubc1 mutant, the level of the Vid vesicle-specific marker Vid24p was reduced in the vesicle fraction, suggesting that UBC1 is required for either Vid vesicle production or Vid24p binding to Vid vesicles. However, the K48R/K63R mutant did not prevent Vid24p binding to Vid vesicles, indicating that ubiquitin chain formation is dispensable for Vid24p binding to these structures.

These proteins are sorted to this organelle by several mechanisms and require the assistance of numerous genes. For example, targeting of the vacuole lumenal protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY)1 from the late Golgi requires more than 40 VPS genes (1Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Microbiol.

Regulation of the autophagic process can have important consequences on cellular physiology. For example, the tumor suppresser gene beclin-1 is homologous to APG6/VPS30 and induces autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells. Therefore, a decrease in autophagic protein degradation may contribute to the development or progression of human malignancy (13Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H.

Furthermore, this pathway also overlaps with the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway for targeting aminopeptidase I from the cytoplasm (5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Under normal growth conditions, aminopeptidase I is targeted to the vacuole by cytoplasm to vacuole targeting vesicles. When cells are starved of nitrogen, however, aminopeptidase I is delivered to the vacuole by the macroautophagy pathway (11Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway also shares components with the peroxisome microautophagy pathway (15Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), the key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis in S. cerevisiae, is induced when yeast cells are grown in medium containing poor carbon sources (18Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When fresh glucose is added to the medium, however, FBPase is targeted to the vacuole and degraded (19Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Hamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9934-9941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This redistribution of FBPase to the vacuole has been observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation, and electron microscopy (19Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Hamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9934-9941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently, FBPase targeting to the vacuole has been reconstituted in vitrousing permeabilized yeast cells incubated with purified radiolabeled FBPase in the presence of ATP, an ATP regenerating system and cytosolic proteins (21Shieh H.-L. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FBPase is imported into a novel type of Vid (vacuole import and degradation) vesicle prior to its uptake by the vacuole (22Huang P.-H. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These vesicles have been purified to near homogeneity from wild-type cells (22Huang P.-H. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The identification of Vid vesicles in the FBPase degradation pathway suggests that this pathway can be divided into at least two steps. The first step is the targeting and sequestration of FBPase into Vid vesicles. The second step is the delivery of FBPase from Vid vesicles to the vacuole for degradation. Since Vid vesicles do not contain markers from known organelles, they may represent a novel transport structure, although it is possible that Vid vesicles are derived from existing structures. Thus far, the heat shock protein Ssa2p is the only molecule that has been shown to play a role in the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles (23Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To identify more molecules involved in this process, we analyzed the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles using various inhibitors and mutants. We found that FBPase import was not affected by inhibitors or mutants that block vacuole acidification, vacuole proteolysis, or proteasome degradation. However, FBPase import did require ubiquitin chain formation and the ubiquitin conjugation enzyme Ubc1p. The Δubc1 mutant contained defective vesicles, but competent cytosol. Furthermore, FBPase import was inhibited when cells overexpressed a ubiquitin mutant (K48R/K63R) that prevents the formation of multiubiquitin chains. The defect of the K48R/K63R mutant was associated with Vid vesicles, indicating that ubiquitin chain formation is required to produce competent Vid vesicles. In the absence of the UBC1 gene, the level of the Vid vesicle-specific marker Vid24p was reduced in the Vid vesicle pellet fraction, suggesting that UBC1 is required for Vid vesicle production. Alternatively, Vid24p binding to Vid vesicles may be compromised in the absence of ubiquitination. However, overproduction of the K48R/K63R mutant did not prevent Vid24p binding to Vid vesicles. Since ubiquitin chain formation is necessary for Vid vesicle function, but is dispensable for Vid24p binding to Vid vesicles, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that Vid vesicle formation is regulated by ubiquitin conjugation and ubiquitin chain formation. Thus, our work complements previous studies in which ubiquitin conjugation is important for peroxisome biogenesis (24Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), mitochondrial inheritance (25Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J.

S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. For the in vitroexperiments, the endogenous FBP1 gene was deleted and a known quantity of purified FBPase was added to the reaction. To produce the fbp1 null strain, the FBP1 gene was cloned into pBR322 to yield the plasmid pJS31. The fbp1 deletion construct was generated by removing 90% of the FBP1 gene from pJS31 with StuI and religating with a LEU2containing fragment which was produced by digestion of the YEP13 plasmid with BglII. The deletion construct was then digested with BamHI and HindIII and transformed into yeast strains using the standard lithium acetate method. The deletion ofFBP1 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-FBPase antibodies.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourcesHLY001Mata his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 isel::URA3HLY208Matα ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 lys2–801 ise1::URA3 fbp1::LEU2HLY227Mata his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 lys2–801 vid24::TRP1HLY232Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 lys2–801 vid24::TRP1 fbp1::LEU2HLY247Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 ise1::URA3 pep4::TRP1 fbp1::LEU2HLY233Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 vid24::TRP1 pep4::URA3 fbp1::LEU2HLY193Matα leu2–3,112 his3 trp1–1 ura3–52 fbp1::LEU2HLY195Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 trp1 pep4::TRP1HLY223Mata leu2–3,112 his3 trp1–1 ura3–52 lys2–801vma3-Δ1Mata ade6 ura3–52 leu2,3–112 pep4–3 gal2 vma3-Δ1::URA3Ref. 39Kane P.M.

Mouse and rabbit anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co. Mouse anti-β-galactosidase antibodies were purchased from Promega. The FBPase import assay was performed according to Shieh and Chiang (21Shieh H.-L. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 3 A600 nm units of semi-intact cells, 11 μg of35S-FBPase, an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mmATP, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 40 mm creatine phosphate), and 0.5 mg/ml cytosolic proteins. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times, after which 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K was added to identify the fraction of FBPase that was sequestered in a proteinase K-resistant compartment. Samples were processed and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-loading buffer. The proteins (15 μl) were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a Fuji FUJIX BAS 1000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems). Isolation of Vid vesicles by differential centrifugation was performed as described (23Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lysates were subjected to differential centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h. The distribution of Vid24p in the high speed pellet (200,000 ×g pellet) and the high speed supernatant (200,000 ×g supernatant) was determined by Western blotting with anti-Vid24p antibodies. The biosynthesis of CPY was studied using the protocol described by Graham et al. (35Graham T.R. Scott P.A. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The exponentially grown Δise1, Δise1Δpep4, Δvid24, and Δvid24Δpep4 strains were labeled with Tran35S-label for 10 min at 30 °C and then chased for 40 min at 30 °C. To examine the effect of brefeldin A on CPY processing, an ise1 strain was preincubated in the presence or absence of brefeldin A (75 μg/ml) at 22 °C for 10 min. Cells were pulsed for 10 min, chased for 40 min, and then harvested. Total lysates were immunoprecipitated with CPY antiserum, subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed with a Fuji Bioimaging Analyzer. The degradation of short-lived and long-lived proteins was examined using the protocols described by Lee and Goldberg (36Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To biochemically analyze FBPase import into Vid vesicles, we used an in vitro system that reproduces the defects seen for mutants affecting the FBPase degradation pathway. For example, both the Δvid1 (Δise1) and Δvid24 mutants inhibit the degradation of FBPase in vivo (Fig.1 A). However, these mutations affect different steps in the FBPase degradation pathway. The Δvid24 mutant strain imports FBPase into Vid vesicles normally, but this mutation blocks the trafficking of Vid vesicles to the vacuole. As such, this mutation results in the accumulation of FBPase in Vid vesicles (37Chiang M.-C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a mutation of theVID1 gene (a gene that is identical to the ISE1or ERG6 gene)2 blocks FBPase import into Vid vesicles (38Hoffman M. Chiang H-L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and serves as a negative control for in vitroimport. To examine FBPase import in the Δise1 and Δvid24 strains, the endogenous FBP1 gene was deleted so that a known quantity of radiolabeled, purified FBPase could be added and followed in the in vitro system. Each strain was glucose starved and then shifted to glucose containing medium prior to their conversion to semi-intact cells. Purified FBPase was incubated with semi-intact cells in the absence or presence of ATP, an ATP regenerating system and cytosol. At selected times, proteinase K was added to digest the FBPase that was not protected in a membrane-sealed compartment. In the absence of both ATP and cytosol, FBPase import into the Δvid24 semi-intact cells was minimal (Fig.1 B). In the presence of ATP and cytosol, however, FBPase import increased in a time-dependent manner. When quantitated, ∼25–35% of the total added FBPase was proteinase K protected after 30 min of import. In contrast, the Δise1mutant had background levels of FBPase import either in the presence or in the absence of ATP and cytosol (Fig. 1 B). The defect of FBPase import seen for the Δise1 mutant could result from an inability of cytosol to stimulate FBPase import or an inability of Vid vesicles to take up FBPase. To determine the site of this defect, we performed an in vitro assay using various combinations of semi-intact cells and cytosol from the Δise1 and Δvid24 mutants. When the Δise1 semi-intact cells were used, FBPase import was defective regardless of whether the cytosol was isolated from the Δise1 (Fig.2, lane 1) or the Δvid24 mutants (lane 3). By contrast, FBPase import into the Δvid24 semi-intact cells was observed when cytosol was prepared from either the Δvid24 mutant (lane 2) or the Δise1 mutant (lane 4). This experiment suggests that the Δise1 mutant strain has competent cytosol that can stimulate FBPase import into competent Vid vesicles. However, the Δise1 mutant contains defective vesicles that cannot support FBPase import, even when combined with import-competent cytosol. Next, we utilized our in vitro assay to investigate whether FBPase import into Vid vesicles was dependent on other cellular processes such as vacuole proteolysis or vacuole acidification. The PEP4 gene is required for the maturation of several major vacuolar proteinases including CPY. Hence, the deletion of the PEP4 gene renders cells defective in vacuolar proteolysis (1Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In wild type cells, CPY is synthesized as prepro-CPY and then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum where it is glycosylated to p1-CPY in the endoplasmic reticulum (1Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Int. Rev.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CPY is further modified in the Golgi to p2-CPY and finally processed to the mature form in the vacuole (1Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Int. Rev.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, the deletion of thePEP4 gene resulted in the accumulation of p2-CPY in the Δise1Δpep4 and Δvid24Δpep4 strains (Fig.3 A). When FBPase import was measured, the level was low in the Δise1 single mutant (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) and there was no significant increase in the FBPase import in the Δise1Δpep4 double mutant (lane 2). Likewise, there was no significant change in FBPase import in the Δvid24Δpep4 double mutant (lane 4) as compared with the Δvid24single mutant (lane 3). Since uptake of FBPase by Vid vesicles is independent of the PEP4 gene, this supports our model that FBPase import into Vid vesicles occurs prior to trafficking to the vacuole. As is shown in Fig. 1, the addition of ATP and cytosol stimulates FBPase import into Vid vesicles. This suggests that ATPases and/or ATP hydrolysis (see below) may play some role in FBPase import. TheVMA3 gene, which encodes the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the membrane sector of the V-ATPase (1Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has previously been shown to play a role in autophagy (40Nakamura N. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, when FBPase import was measured in the vma3 deletion mutant, there was no significant defect (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). Therefore, V-ATPase is not essential for FBPase import into Vid vesicles. Ubiquitination plays an important role in distinct biological functions including DNA repair, protein degradation, organelle biogenesis, and protein trafficking (41Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar,42Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For example, the ubiquitin protein ligase Rsp5p is essential for mitochondrial inheritance and mitochondrial import (25Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Zoladek T. Tobiasz G. Vaduva M. Boguta N. Martin C. Hopper A.K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 595-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rsp5p is also involved in receptor-mediated internalization of Ste2p, Ste3p, and other cell surface proteins (31Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc10p plays a critical role in peroxisomal biogenesis (24Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Ubc10p is one of 13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes found in"

D49531 adenylyl cyclase guanylyl cyclase glutathioneS-transferase polymerase chain reaction open reading frame Adenylyl cyclase (AC),1which synthesizes the signaling molecule cAMP, plays an important role in regulating various cell processes. So far, many genes encoding ACs have been isolated from a number of organisms. ACs can be separated into three classes according to the primary structure of the catalytic domains (1Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar). Class I ACs are mainly composed of enterobacterial ACs. Class II ACs have been found in pathogenic bacteria and are activated by the eukaryotic cofactors calmodulin (2Wolff J. Cook G.H. Goldhammer A.R. Berkowitz S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3841-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Leppla S.H. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 189-198PubMed Google Scholar) and an as yet unidentified factor (4Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13899-13904Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Class III ACs are widely distributed from bacteria to mammals and form the biggest family of ACs. Recently, novel ACs showing a unique primary structure have been found in archaebacteria. These are proposed to represent a fourth class of ACs (5Sismeiro O. Trotot P. Biville F. Vivares C. Danchin A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3339-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No sequence homology can be found among all four AC classes. cGMP also functions as an important signaling molecule and is synthesized by guanylyl cyclase (GC). A large number of GC genes have been isolated from eukaryotes. However, only one GC gene has been reported in prokaryotes (6Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to the divergent nature of the catalytic domains of ACs, the catalytic domains of all GCs identified are homologous to those of Class III ACs. Thus, Class III ACs and GCs are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor. Crystal structures of the catalytic domains of mammalian Class III ACs have been solved (7Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 8Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Based on these structures and modeling studies, essential residues required for substrate binding (ATP or GTP) have been identified (9Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that form hydrogen bonds with adenine and guanine are conserved among Class III ACs and GCs (9Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By exchanging these residues, GCs can be converted to ACs (10Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,11Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similarly, an AC has been converted to a nonselective purine nucleotide cyclase (11Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions next to the catalytic domain (∼50 amino acid residues) are conserved among GCs, but not among Class III ACs. These regions are predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix and to function as a dimerization domain (12Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Besides the importance for dimerization, this domain has also been shown to play an important role in stimulating human retinal GC-1 catalytic activity by GC-activating proteins (13Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9039-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have isolated six AC genes from the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis by functional screening using Escherichia coli defective in its AC gene (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We previously characterized two AC genes, cyaA and cyaC (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ThecyaA gene encodes a putative membrane-bound AC, whereas thecyaC gene encode an AC that is activated in response to autophosphorylation (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Kasahara M. Ohmori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15167-15172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the characterization of a third AC gene from S. platensis,cyaG. The amino acid sequence of the putative catalytic domain of CyaG was found to be homologous to those of the catalytic domains of Class III ACs and GCs. Interestingly, the upstream regions next to the catalytic domain of CyaG are homologous to the dimerization domain of GCs. We investigated the catalytic activity of CyaG by generating wild-type and mutant recombinant proteins. We found that CyaG, a strict adenylyl cyclase, was transformed to a guanylyl cyclase by replacing three key amino acid residues within the substrate-binding site. Based on the results, the evolution of Class III ACs and GCs is discussed. The E. coli strains JM109 (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi, hsdR17(rK−, mK+), supE44, relA1, Δ(lac-proAB)/F′ (traD36, proAB, lacIq, lacZΔM15)) and TP2339 (aroB + , crpΔ39, ilv − , cyaΔ) were used for cloning and expression of recombinant proteins, respectively. Bacteria were grown in LB medium. When required, ampicillin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol was added at 100, 25, or 30 μg/ml, respectively. Plasmid preparations, restriction enzyme digestions, and ligations were performed as described by Maniatiset al. (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The genomic library of S. platensis was screened by functional complementation of the mutant of E. coli MK1010 defective in AC activity. The positive clone pCYA68 was isolated as described in our previous report (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To isolate overlapping fragments, the genomic library of S. platensis was produced with a phage vector (15Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant phages were screened for the presence of the desired insert using theBlnI-BamHI fragment (∼0.5 kilobase pair) of pCYA68 as a probe. Following secondary screening, positive recombinant phages were converted to pBK-CMV plasmids by in vivo excision using the Stratagene protocol. A 2.6-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the 2.0-kilobase pair DNA insert of S. platensis was excised from pCYA68 with HindIII andSalI digestions and subcloned into theHindIII-SalI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). A 2.0-kilobase pair fragment was excised from pBKG1 with BlnI and DraI, treated with the Klenow fragment to fill the ends, and subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Deletions were constructed using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using a DNA sequencer (Model 373A) and aTaq dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (both from Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence were analyzed with DNASTAR software. Data base searches for similarity to other proteins were performed using the GenBankTM BLAST server. A BamHI restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the G1249 base (the second letter of the codon encoding Ser380), and anEcoRI restriction site was introduced 75 base pairs downstream of the stop codon using PCR. The PCR product was ligated into the pGEX-3X vector digested with BamHI andEcoRI. The resulting plasmid, pGEX-CyaG-CD (where CD is catalytic and dimerization domains), contained a portion of thecyaG gene fused to the GST tag sequence from pGEX-3X, which is placed under the control of the tac promoter. The portion of pGEX-CyaG-CD derived from the PCR fragment was sequenced. We found that the A1610 base was altered to C by PCR error. However, this replacement was fortunately a silent mutation, which did not result in the replacement of this amino acid residue. The transformants (TP2339 cells harboring pGEX-CyaG-CD) were grown at 27 °C in LB medium (1.5 liter) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The recombinant gene was expressed by inducing cells (A600 = 0.8) with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after 24 h by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, resuspended in 80 ml of TEG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mNaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 80 mg of lysozyme, and disrupted by sonication. The cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min. The 150,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with TEG buffer. The column was washed with TEG buffer, and then the protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in TEG buffer. The GST-CyaG-CD-K533E mutant was constructed with mismatch oligonucleotides and PCR using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). PCRs were performed with primers P1 (5′-AAGAAGTCACTATTTTATTTG-3′) and P3 (5′-CATAAACTCGAGAAGATTGAAAC-3′) or primers P2 (5′-GTTTCAATCTTCTCGAGTTTATG-3′) and P4 (5′-GATCGTCAGTCAGTCAC-3′). The resulting PCR products were mixed, and PCR was repeated with primers P1 and P4. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI (partial) and ligated into pGEX-CyaG-CD digested with EcoRI and BamHI (partial). The resulting construct, pGEX-CyaG-CD-E, contained thecyaG gene with the CyaG K533E mutation. The GST-CyaG-CD-K533E/I603R/D605C mutant was constructed with mismatch oligonucleotides and PCR using ExTaq DNA polymerase. PCRs were performed with primers P1 and P5 (5′-CCCCATAAACAGTATCTGAATTTTTTAAT-3′) or primers P4 and P6 (5′-ATTAAAAAATTCAGATACTGTTTATGGGG-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) to make pCRERC. The EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pCRERC (500 base pairs) was ligated into pGEX-CyaG-CD-E digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The resulting construct, pGEX-CyaG-CD-ERC, contained the cyaG gene with the CyaG K533E, I603R, and D605C mutations. The portions of pGEX-CyaG-CD-E and pGEX-CyaG-CD-ERC derived from the PCR fragments were sequenced to ensure that no other mutations had arisen. Unless otherwise stated, thein vitro AC or GC reaction was performed in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP or GTP, respectively. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by addition of 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After trichloroacetic acid was removed from each reaction mixture by extraction with ethyl ether, samples were lyophilized. cAMP or cGMP content was measured by an enzyme immunoassay system (EIA system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213923) Google Scholar) as described in the instructions of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS was carried out following the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206194) Google Scholar). The genomic library ofS. platensis was screened by functional complementation of the E. coli strain MK1010, which is defective in AC activity and therefore lacks cAMP. Seven distinct positive clones were isolated (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A significant level of cAMP was detected in cells transformed with pCYA68, one of the positive clones, suggesting that pCYA68 contains an AC gene of S. platensis (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the insert region of pCYA68. An ORF was found in the sequence, but the N terminus of the ORF was absent in pCYA68. To isolate an overlapping clone, we screened an S. platensisgenomic library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A positive clone (pBKG1) was isolated, and restriction mapping confirmed that this clone contained the N terminus of the ORF (data not shown). A nucleotide sequence (2449 base pairs) was determined by sequencing the insert region of pCYA68 and aDraI-BlnI fragment of pBKG1 (Fig.1). An ORF that encodes a polypeptide of 671 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 75,365 Da was identified in this sequence. The C-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence was homologous to the catalytic domains of Class III ACs and GCs. The ORF was therefore named cyaG. A hydropathy profile shows that CyaG contains two hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1, underlined). One (Met1–Gly31) is near the N-terminal end, and the other (Ile351–Ile376) is located in the central region of the protein. The N-terminal hydrophobic region is closely related to the signal peptides of bacteria required for the targeting of proteins to membranes (20Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 22Mackle M.M. Zilinskas B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter hydrophobic region probably represents a membrane-spanning region. The amino acid sequence of CyaG exhibited similarities to the catalytic domains of Class III ACs and GCs. Fig. 2 A shows the alignment of the C-terminal region (Val487–Gly663) of CyaG with the catalytic domains of various Class III ACs and GCs. The putative catalytic domain of CyaG has 29–44% identity to those of Class III ACs and 35–48% identity to those of GCs. Asterisks in Fig. 2 Aindicate essential amino acid residues required for interacting with the adenine or guanine substrate ring (9Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The complete genome sequence of a filamentous cyanobacterium,Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, has recently been determined. In addition to those five AC genes that have already been isolated fromAnabaena 7120 (23Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found a novel AC gene by searching the database at the Kazusa DNA Institute and named this genecyaE. Among the six Anabaena ACs, the catalytic domain of CyaG is more similar to that of the novel AnabaenaAC, CyaE (Fig. 2 A). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domains of the Class III ACs and GCs. The catalytic domain of CyaG was found to be more closely related to those of eukaryotic Class III ACs and GCs than to those of cyanobacterial and bacterial ACs (Fig. 2 B). We detected a unique amino acid sequence homologous to the so-called dimerization domain of GCs in the N-terminal region next to the catalytic domains of CyaG andAnabaena CyaE (Fig. 3). The dimerization domain is present in all GCs except two exceptional GCs (6Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E.

Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The domain is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix, a feature that is associated with mediating protein-protein interactions. A helical diagram of the putative dimerization domain of CyaG using DNASTAR software showed that this region could form an amphipathic α-helix (data not shown). Hydrophobic amino acid residues that form a cluster at one side of the helix are shown in Fig. 3 (asterisks). Three mutations are identified in conserved amino acid residues in the dimerization domain of human retinal GC-1, RetGC-1, in patients with cone-rod dystrophy (Fig. 3, arrowheads) (25Kelsell R.E. Gregory-Evans K. Payne A.M. Perrault I. Kaplan J. Yang R.B. Garbers D.L. Bird A.C. Moore A.T. Hunt D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Perrault I.

By characterizing a mutant RetGC-1 protein with Arg substituted for Cys in the conserved amino acids, Tucker et al. (13Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9039-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that mutant RetGC-1 had altered responses to GC-activating proteins and Ca2+. They concluded that the mutation in the dimerization domain stabilized the active form of RetGC-1. The corresponding amino acid residues were also found to be conserved in the dimerization domain of CyaG. Fig. 4 shows domain organizations of CyaG, Spirulina CyaC, rat AC2, rat soluble GC (GC-S) α1, and rat GC-A. It is worth noting that CyaG contains a dimerization domain like those of GCs. To investigate whether CyaG exhibits AC and/or GC activity, we purified the C-terminal domain of CyaG, which contains both the catalytic and dimerization domains, as a GST fusion protein (GST-CyaG-CD). We failed to construct the expression vector encoding the GST-CyaG-CD protein (pGEX-CyaG-CD) when using an E. coli strain, JM109 (cya + , crp +), for cloning. This was probably due to an inhibitory effect of the high concentration of cAMP on the growth of E. coli (27De Jr., R.E. Judewicz R.D. Torres H.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By using strain TP2339 (cya - , crp −), which is defective in AC and the cAMP receptor protein, we were able to construct pGEX-CyaG-CD. This method may be useful for expressing ACs in E. coli cells. The transformants (TP2339 cells harboring pGEX-CyaG-CD) were grown at 27 °C and induced for the production of the GST-CyaG-CD protein by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The majority of the GST-CyaG-CD protein formed was found to be in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). Nevertheless, the 150,000 × gfraction, in which we detected the GST-CyaG-CD protein by immunoblotting against GST (data not shown), was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column, and the GST-CyaG-CD protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione (Fig.5, lane 4). A main band with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa was recognized. The size was consistent with the predicted theoretical value for the GST fusion protein. The effects of divalent cations on the AC activity of the GST-CyaG-CD protein were measured. The specific activities, Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent activities (1 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2), were 0.036 and 11 nmol of cAMP formed per min/mg in the presence of 10 μm ATP, respectively. The observation that Mn2+ stimulates CyaG catalytic activity is similar to results found for Class III ACs and GCs from S. platensisand eukaryotes (15Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Londos C. Preston M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5957-5961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). AC and GC activities were assayed in the presence of Mn2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Significant AC activity was detected, but no GC activity was detected (Fig. 6). The cyclase catalytic consensus sequence is conserved among the Class III AC and GC families (30Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G. Science. 1989; 244: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Residues interacting with the ribose and triphosphate of ATP or GTP and the metal ion are conserved between Class III ACs and GCs. However, interactions with the purine ring are different between the ATP- and GTP-binding sites of Class III ACs and GCs (9Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the substrate of CyaG could be changed from ATP to GTP by site-directed mutagenesis of the purine ring-binding site. Liu et al. (9Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) identified amino acid residues involved in recognizing the purine ring of the substrate by a modeling study based on the three-dimensional structure of a mammalian AC (8Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Lys533, Ile603, and Asp605 of CyaG correspond to the amino acid residues related to purine ring binding. A mutant CyaG protein (GST-CyaG-CD-K533E) in which Lys533 was replaced by glutamate was produced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lys533 is replaced by glutamate in all GCs (1Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar). We found that GST-CyaG-CD-K533E lost AC activity completely, and no GC activity was detected (data not shown). Next, we changed two more amino acid residues of GST-CyaG-CD-K533E, Ile603 and Asp605, to arginine and cysteine, respectively. The resultant mutant protein, GST-CyaG-CD-K533E/I603R/D605C, has triple mutations. GST-CyaG-CD-K533E/I603R/D605C lost AC activity, but obtained significant GC activity (Fig. 6). CyaG as an AC was therefore changed to GC by the site-directed mutations. In this study, we isolated a novel AC gene, cyaG, from the cyanobacterium S. platensis. The CyaG protein contains a catalytic domain homologous to the Class III ACs and GCs at the C-terminal region. It contains a dimerization domain conserved among GCs at the N-terminal side of the catalytic domain and two hydrophobic regions, one at the N terminus and the other in the middle of the protein. The N-terminal hydrophobic region has characteristics of a bacterial signal sequence for localizing the protein to the membrane and would be digested after targeting. CyaG is thought to be a single transmembrane protein. When we performed the BLAST search to find homologies using the amino acid sequence of the cyaG gene product, we found that the protein sequences most closely related to the C-terminal regions of CyaG were those of GCs rather than ACs. Since we previously showed that the pCYA68 clone containing a sequence of part ofcyaG produced cAMP (14Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we speculated that CyaG may exhibit GC activity as well as AC activity. Furthermore, investigating the CyaG sequence carefully, we found the dimerization domain highly conserved among all GCs. Wilson and Chinkers (12Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) predicted that the dimerization domain formed an amphipathic α-helix and showed that GC activity was lost upon the deletion of the dimerization domain. The dimerization domains of both soluble and membrane-bound GCs are located on the N-terminal side next to the catalytic domain. To our knowledge, the dimerization domain exists in all GCs except two GCs recently found (6Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but not in ACs. Tucker et al. (13Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9039-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that point mutations within the dimerization domain of human RetGC-1 result in reduced catalytic activity of RetGC-1 and reduced stimulation by GC-activating protein-2. These findings indicate that the dimerization domain is essential for the catalytic activity of GCs. CyaG contains the dimerization domain (Fig. 3), but cannot form cGMP; and thus, CyaG represents a unique AC with a characteristic structure of GCs. To investigate the catalytic activity of CyaG, we produced a recombinant protein (GST-CyaG-CD) containing the catalytic and dimerization domains of CyaG. GST-CyaG-CD showed Mn2+-stimulated AC activity, but not GC activity. We then investigated whether CyaG could obtain GC activity after exchanging certain amino acid residues. First, we changed Lys533 to Glu since the Lys residue is highly conserved in ACs, but the same position contains Glu in GCs (1Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar). GST-CyaG-CD-K533E showed no AC activity. GC activity was also not detectable. We therefore concluded that additional replacements were required to obtain GC activity. In addition to the K533E substitution, we replaced two other amino acid residues, Ile603 and Glu605, with Arg and Cys, respectively. Ile603 and Glu605 are conserved within the purine ring-binding site. The triple mutant GST-CyaG-CD-K533E/I603R/D605C was found to exhibit significant GC activity (Fig. 6), but no AC activity. Therefore, CyaG, an AC, was converted to a GC by replacing these three amino acid residues. The primary structure of the catalytic domain of CyaG is more closely related to those of eukaryotic transmembrane ACs and GCs than to those of other cyanobacterial ACs (Fig. 2 B). The catalytic domains of cyanobacterial ACs are divided into two groups. The first group includes CyaG and Anabaena CyaE (group I), and the second includes the remaining cyanobacterial Cya proteins (group II). These two groups might have evolved independently just like mammalian soluble AC and transmembrane AC (31Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian transmembrane ACs and a soluble AC are related to the cyanobacterial group I and II ACs, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Thus, CyaG-type ACs may possibly share a common ancestor with the transmembrane ACs and GCs. Class III ACs and GCs are thought to be evolutionarily related to each other because of the similarity in the primary structures of their catalytic domains. Two GCs that have the unusual property of lacking the dimerization domain were recently found in Paramecium(24Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Synechocystis (6Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain ofParamecium GC has a topology identical to that mammalian membrane-bound ACs (Fig. 4, rat AC2) and thus was proposed to be evolved from a eukaryotic transmembrane AC. Synechocystis GC (Fig. 2 B, Cya2) is the first example of a prokaryotic GC whose catalytic domain is more similar to those of bacterial ACs than to those of eukaryotic GCs. Thus, it is likely thatSynechocystis GC has evolved from a bacterial AC. The other GC members that contain the dimerization domain seem to have an ancestor other than Paramecium GC andSynechocystis GC. CyaG is a unique AC in that it contains the dimerization domain essential for GC activity. Also, the catalytic activity of CyaG is changed to a GC by replacing only three amino acid residues. Based on these findings, it seems likely that most eukaryotic GCs, with the exception of Paramecium GC, have evolved from an AC such as CyaG that contains the dimerization domain.

This response was lipopolysaccharide binding-protein (LBP)-dependent and involved Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Here we show that secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α induced by Treponema culture supernatants and extracted LTA was paralleled by an LBP-dependent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p42 and p44, and p38, as well as the stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2. Phosphorylation of p42/44 correlated with an increase of activity, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels were significantly reduced by addition of inhibitors of p42/44 and p38, PD 98059 and SB 203580, respectively. Treponeme LTA differed from bacterial lipopolysaccharide regarding time course of p42/44 phosphorylation, exhibiting a prolonged activation of MAPKs.

We were able to chemically characterize these preparations by gas liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy as lipoglycans due to the presence of a diacylglycerol lipid anchor in TM, and the presence of repeating carbohydrate units in both strains (22Schröder N.W.J.

Another family of proteins closely related to MAPKs are the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), a member of which is the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). They are involved in a range of cellular responses, including UV irradiation (56Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar), as well as LPS activation (57Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar). These three groups of kinases lead to cytokine production by activating a number of transcription factors, including c-Jun (activated by JNK), ATF 2 (activated by p38 and JNK), and Elk-1 (activated by p42/44) (58Liu F.

In this study, we show that treponeme LTA share the ability of parallel activation of multiple tyrosine-kinase cascades with LPS. Furthermore, involvement of TLR-2 and -4 in activation of these pathways, employing the neutralizing anti-murine TLR-4 antibody MTS 510 and the TLR-2-negative human astrocytoma cell line U373, was investigated. Frozen stocks of a suspension of TB and TM (300 μl, stored at −80 °C) were inoculated in 3 ml of a culture medium (OMIZ-Pat) as described previously (19Wyss C. Choi B.K. Schupbach P. Guggenheim B. Göbel U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and cultured under anaerobic conditions (Anaerogen, Oxoid, Germany) at 37 °C for 3–4 days. The cultures were then transferred to 20–100 ml of OMIZ-Pat and incubated for another 1–2 days. For phenol/water extraction of whole cells, these cultures were transferred to 500 ml of OMIZ-Pat. Viability of the treponemes and the exclusion of contaminating bacteria were assessed by dark field microscopy (400-fold magnification; BH2-RFCA microscope, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Sterility controls of the medium preparation were performed by incubating OMIZ-Pat medium under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 1 week. The pH value of the culture medium was measured repeatedly, and the cultures were stopped at pH 6.0. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined employing the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 μg/ml (TB), and from 0.4 to 0.6 μg/ml (TM), respectively. Cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and passed through 0.2-μm sterile filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). For some studies, culture supernatants were heat-inactivated at 100 °C for 20 min and passed again through 0.2-μm sterile filters. OMIZ-Pat medium, treated similarly, served as control. For an extraction of treponeme whole cells, aqueous suspensions of treponeme cells were digested with RNase (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), DNase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and proteinase K (Merck). These suspensions were dialyzed and further extracted employing a hot phenol/water extraction method (61Westphal O. Jann K. Whistler R.L. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. 5th Ed. Academic Press, New York1965: 83-92Google Scholar). In brief, the phenol/water extraction was performed by mixing the cell suspension with an equal volume of 90% phenol and stirring at 68 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 0 °C, and the upper phase was collected. This procedure was repeated twice; combined phases were dialyzed and lyophilized. A mock extract, including all enzymes and chemicals used, but no bacteria, was also prepared. To assess induction of TNF-α, 5 × 104 cells/well of RAW 264.7 cells were cultured overnight in 96-well tissue culture plates using RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. After two washing steps with RPMI 1640, stimulation was performed in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml recombinant murine LBP in a total volume of 100 μl. Supernatants were harvested after 4 h of incubation, and cells were stained with trypan blue. For some experiments, cells were incubated with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 (Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany), or the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (Alexis, Läufingen, Switzerland) at 37 °C for 1 h prior to stimulation. In other experiments, as indicated, the inhibitory monoclonal anti-TLR-4 antibody MTS510 (62Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Miyake (Saga, Japan), was added 30 min prior to stimulation. To investigate phosphorylation and activity of tyrosine kinases, 1.6 × 106 cells/well were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates over night in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. After two washing steps with RPMI 1640, cells were starved for 3 h in the absence of serum. Stimulation was done in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml rmLBP. After 20 min, supernatants were removed and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4, followed by addition of 150 μl of lysis buffer, containing 1% Triton X-100 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm leupeptin, and 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin. After 15 min of incubation at 4 °C, cells were scraped off the plates and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. The postmitochondrial supernatant was recovered, protein content was determined employing the Bio-Rad protein assay, and the remaining lysates were stored at −80 °C. For some experiments cells were stimulated for a longer period, as indicated. The previously described lack of TLR-2 on U373 cells (34Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed in our laboratory by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. For stimulation experiments, U373 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) containing 10% FCS. For studies on activation of p42/44, 3 × 105 cells/well or 6 × 104 cells/well were cultured overnight in 6- or 24-well tissue culture plates, respectively. Prior to stimulation, cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS for 2 h, followed by stimulation and lysis as described above. For studies on interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, 1 × 104 cells/well were cultured overnight in 96-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C followed by stimulation. After incubating for 24 h, supernatants were assayed for IL-6 content as described below. For detection of murine TNF-α, MaxiSorp enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with 3 μg/ml anti-mTNF-α Ab (PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany) in 100 mmNa3PO4, pH 6.0. Samples and recombinant mTNF-α standard (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and detection was performed employing a biotin-conjugated anti mTNF-α Ab (PharMingen), and streptavidin-peroxidase with ortho-phenylene diphosphate as substrate. The detection limit was ∼15 pg/ml. For quantification of IL-6 plates were coated with anti-human IL-6 antibody (R & D Systems). Samples and recombinant human IL-6 (R & D Systems) were detected employing a biotin-labeled monoclonal anti-human IL-6 antibody (R & D Systems). The detection limit was 16 pg/ml. Shown are mean values ± S.D. Samples of 50 μg/ml protein were mixed with sample buffer to obtain a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and separated employing a Tris buffer system. After electrophoresis, gels were immersed in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mglycine, and 20% methanol, and transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) by semidry blotting (Hölzel GmbH, Dorfen, Germany). For detection of phosphorylated p42/44 and p38 (pp42/44, pp38) membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, blots were incubated either with rabbit anti-pp38 mAb (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) or rabbit anti-pp42/44 mAb (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany), diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.05% Tween 20 for 3 h. After washing, membranes were further incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ab, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Biogenes, Berlin, Germany), diluted 1:5000 in PBS, 5% BSA), 0.05% Tween 20 for 90 min. After a final washing step, blots were detected employing the ECL-system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and visualized on Hyperfilm ECL-films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stripped by incubation with 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 2.5, for 30 min at room temperature, and reprobed. For detection of phosphorylated JNK, membranes were incubated with a mouse mAb directed against phosphorylated JNK1 and JNK2 (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% BSA, 1% skim milk, and 0.05% Tween 20, for 3 h. Blocking of membranes and incubation with a goat anti-mouse IgG Ab conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000, for 90 min, was achieved applying the same buffer. Blots were visualized as described above employing the ECL system. Cell lysates were investigated for p42/44 activity using the Biotrak system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In brief, cell lysates were incubated with a peptide derived from epidermal growth factor receptor highly selective for p42/44, in the presence of 50 mm[γ-33P]ATP (3, 7 × 103 Bq/test) for 30 min at 36 °C. After separating the peptide from unincorporated activity, incorporated ATP was measured in a scintillation counter. Shown are mean values ± S.D. Murine LBP was expressed in a baculovirus system as described (63Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schröder N.W. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine LBP-cDNA was inserted into the baculovirus expression vector pAcGHLT-B (PharMingen) containing the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter for high level expression in insect cells, and the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene for purification of the resulting fusion protein. Sf-9 insect cell culture, virus amplification, and expression of recombinant murine LBP (rmLBP)-GST fusion protein were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and bound fusion protein was incubated with thrombin (ICN Biochemicals, Eschwege, Germany) to release mLBP. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that lipoglycans from TB and TM are released by treponemes during cell growth. Culture supernatants exhibited a similar stimulation pattern in comparison to phenol/water extracts of whole cells. To assess whether the stimulation observed involves phosphorylation of MAPKs, we incubated RAW 264.7 cells with the supernatants and analyzed the cell lysates for phosphorylation of these kinases. We observed an LBP-dependent phosphorylation and activation of p42/44 (Fig. 1, A and B), as well as phosphorylation of p38 (Fig.2 A). Involvement of the SAPK pathway was analyzed by assessment of JNK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). Here also, an LBP-dependent phosphorylation induced by the culture supernatants was observed. However, phosphorylation caused by TM-derived culture supernatants was clearly stronger as compared with TB, although TNF-α induction was similar. Activity of p42/44 was related to the state of phosphorylation as revealed by the Biotrak p42/44 activity assay (Fig. 1 A).Figure 2Phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1/2 by treponeme culture supernatants. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with 10% treponeme culture supernatants, 10% culture medium alone, or 10 ng/ml LPS (E. coli 0111:B4) for 20 min with or without rmLBP as indicated. Cell lysates (50 μg for p38, 100 μg for JNK1/2) were blotted, and detection of phosphorylated p38 (A) and JNK1/2 (B) was performed employing antibodies against their phosphorylated isoforms as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antibodies against unphosphorylated p38 and JNK1/2 served as loading controls. Shown is one representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we performed experiments with LTA extracted from whole treponeme cells employing a hot phenol/water method. Cells were stimulated either with treponeme compounds or with LPS in the presence or absence of recombinant murine LBP for 20 min. Immunoblotting of the cell lysates revealed a strong phosphorylation of p42/44 caused by both treponeme LTA and LPS. These reactions were clearly LBP-dependent (Fig.3 B"
https://openalex.org/W2050463283,"Copper ions are essential at a proper level yet toxic when present in excess. To maintain a proper intracellular level, cells must be able to sense the changes in copper ion concentrations. The yeast transcription factor Mac1p plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of CTR1 and CTR3, both encoding high affinity copper ion transporters. Here we report that the Mac1p binding of the copper ion-responsive elements (CuREs) in the promoters of CTR1 and CTR3 is affected by copper ions. On one hand, the Mac1p DNA binding is Cu+coordination-dependent, and on the other hand, exogenous Cu+ and isoelectronic Ag+ ions disrupt the DNA binding of Mac1p. These results suggest that the Mac1p is able to sense two different levels of copper ions. These two levels are probably the physiological and toxic copper levels in yeast cells. Furthermore, we found that Mac1p undergoes posttranslational phosphorylation modification in yeast and that the phosphorylation is required for the Mac1p to become DNA-binding active. Nonphosphorylated Mac1p is unable to bind the CTR1 promoter DNA. The data support the model of intradomain interactions and indicate further that the phosphorylation probably prevents the inhibition of DNA-binding domain activity by the activation domain of Mac1p. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Mac1p functions critically in maintaining a proper intracellular concentration of copper ions.

TheCTR1 and CTR3 transcription is enhanced by copper starvation (addition of chelator bathocuproinedisulfonate (BCS)1 in the growth medium) and inactivated by even a slight increase in the copper ion concentrations (of picomolar range) (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The transporter Ctr1p is induced to undergo degradation by toxic copper levels (of 10 μm or higher), which is thought to further inhibit copper uptake under toxic conditions (6Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study (33Peña M.M.O. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reports that the Ctr3p, unlike the Ctr1p, does not undergo degradation in response to toxic copper levels. This latest finding may explain the earlier report that CTR3 is disrupted by a transposon element in most yeast laboratory strains (5Knight S.A.B. Labbé S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These concentration-dependent responses noted above indicate that cells are able to sense and differentiate the physiological from toxic levels of copper ions. How the degradation of Ctr1p is controlled is currently unknown. The transcription of CTR1 andCTR3 is regulated by the copper-sensing factor Mac1p through the cis-acting CuREs in the promoters (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

However, how the copper ion signal, particularly that of physiological and toxic levels, is propagated to the promoters of CTR1 and CTR3 is currently poorly understood. The primary sequence indicates that the Mac1p may sense copper ions through direct copper ion coordination (7Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Welch J. Fogel S. Buchman C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Szczypka M.

Biochemical studies show that the separated DNA-binding domain and the activation domain of Mac1p expressed in the Escherichia coli both bind Cu+ ions (15Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The bacteria-expressed DNA-binding domain was also found to coordinate Zn2+; a zinc-module was then postulated to also exist in the Mac1p DNA-binding domain (15Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of Amt1p expressed in the bacteria was the first copper-sensing factor found to be Zn2+-coordinated (16Thorvaldsen J.L. Sewell A.K. Tanner A.M. Peltier J.M. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9566-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, this Zn2+ coordination was not required for the Amt1p to bind DNA (16Thorvaldsen J.L. Sewell A.K. Tanner A.M. Peltier J.M. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9566-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA binding activities at the CuREs in the promoters of CTR1 and CTR3 have been detected in the yeast extracts prepared from the cells expressing various forms of the truncated Mac1 protein (17Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The purified truncate of Mac1p(1–159), which lacks the activation domain, was also found able to bind the CuREs (15Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vitro translated Mac1p has also been shown to be able to bind the CTR1 promoter (8Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that Mac1p is able to bind the CuREs. However, whether or not copper affects Mac1p DNA binding has yet to be resolved. In vivo footprinting showed that upon CuSO4 treatment, the CuREs in the CTR3 promoter became more accessible to the methylation reagent (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), indicative of possible dissociation of Mac1p. The DNA binding activities of the yeast extracts, prepared from the cells expressing the truncated Mac1p(1–194) and grown in the medium containing either BCS or CuSO4, exhibited no difference (15Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is no report on the copper effect on Mac1p DNA binding by the addition of CuSO4 to the binding reactions using yeast cell extracts or purified proteins. The previous study using Mac1 fusion proteins with Gal4p (either DNA-binding or activation domain) and VP16 provided indirect evidence that there are interactions between the DNA-binding and activation domain of the Mac1p (17Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is postulated that copper-induced intramolecular interactions inhibit both DNA binding and transactivation activities of the Mac1p (17Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A more recent study using one- and two-hybrid methods also suggests that the intramolecular interaction negatively modulates Mac1p activity (19Serpe M Joshi A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29211-29219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the finding that the Mac1p undergoes posttranslational phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation is required for the Mac1p to bind to the CuRE in the CTR1promoter. The dephosphorylated Mac1p is unable to bind the DNA. We also found that the Mac1p DNA binding, on one hand, is dependent on Cu+ coordination and, on the other hand, is disrupted by the addition of copper ions. These studies indicate that Mac1p is able to sense two different copper levels and that the posttranslational phosphorylation of Mac1p is probably a key event in the regulation of copper transport. A high copy plasmid pGPD-Mac1HA(opt) was constructed by cloning aBamHI-XhoI fragment of an artificialMAC1 into the p423GPD vector at the same sites (20Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). The artificial MAC1 has optimal codons and is tagged with a single copy of HA epitope at the carboxyl terminus. The DNA was synthesized in vitro (GeneMed). A single copy plasmid pRSMac1(3HA) was constructed essentially the same as pRSMac1(HA) as described previously (10Zhu Z. Labbé S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To introduce 3 × HA epitopes in the MAC1 coding region, a NarI site was generated by silent mutations at the DNA encoding residues Gly-222 and Ala-223. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized for a DNA fragment encoding three copies of the nine amino acids of the HA epitope with flanking NarI sites. The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the NarI site of theMAC1. Plasmids were transformed into the SLY2(mac1Δ) cells as described previously (10Zhu Z. Labbé S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in the copper ion-depleted medium treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad) (6Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared using the previously described method (6Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or by using the glass bead disruption method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the extracts were determined using the Bradford protein assay (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol. The protein extracts were treated with λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs). After the treatment, proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid, fractionated on 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses were then carried out using a polyclonal anti-HA antibody, Y11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) (10Zhu Z. Labbé S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SLY2 cells transformed with pRSMac1(3HA) or control plasmid pRS313 were used to carry out in vivo 32P-labeling (22Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were pre-grown overnight in the copper-depleted selective medium synthetic complete medium lacking histidine without phosphate and reinoculated into 5 ml of synthetic complete medium lacking histidine medium of 0.02 of the normal phosphate level with a starting OD650 of 0.4. 32P-Inorganic phosphate (ICN) was added to a final concentration of 200 μCi/ml. Cells were grown until the OD650 reached ∼1.5 and then harvested. Cell pellets were washed with H2O, and whole cell extracts were prepared using the method described previously (6Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The proteins were dissolved in buffer A (50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.0, 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 3 m urea, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF). Protein concentrations in the extracts were measured as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 250 μg of total proteins in 100 μl of buffer A was mixed with 700 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1 mm EDTA), and 5 μl of anti-HA antibody 12CA5 was added. The reactions were incubated on a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were added with 10 μl of 100 mm bovine serum albumin, and the reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm and washed five times with the buffer B. The complexes were eluted in 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer by heating at 80 °C for 10 min. Twenty microliters of elutes were analyzed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and dried and exposed to Kodak Biomax film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. The exposure time that was required for autoradiographic detection of Mac1p phosphorylation was 2–4 days. Yeast extracts were prepared from cells of SLY2 harboring pGPD-Mac1HA(opt) or vector p423GPD grown in copper-depleted medium, using the glass bead disruption method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar), in lysis buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. 32P-Labeled CTR1 promoter DNA fragment was generated by polymerase chain reactions using [32P]dATP. The primers used for the wild type DNA were 5′-CATGTATTGATGCAA-3′ and 5′-CTTGAAAAGTGCTC-3′, and primers used for the mutant probe were 5′-CATGTATTGATGCAAATCATGGGATAGGGATGAAAGACGACGGTAAAA-3′ and 5′-CTTGAAAAGTGCTCTTTTCAGGATCGTGCCATTGGGATGAATTTTACCGTC-3′. The radioactive DNAs were purified by the agarose gel electrophoresis. Because of the observed interference of the Mn2+ on Mac1p DNA binding, calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was used to dephosphorylate the Mac1p in the protein extracts. The phosphatase inhibitors, glycerol phosphate (40 mm), NaF (50 mm), and okadeic acid (2 μm), were used as previously described (24Lu P-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M.H. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 325-328Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The binding reactions were carried out as described previously (23Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Probably because of the low physiological level of Mac1p in the yeast cells, our repeated efforts to detect the CuRE binding activity of Mac1p in the yeast extracts did not produce conclusive results. An artificial MAC1 of optimized codons, tagged with a single copy of HA epitope at the carboxyl terminus, was then synthesized in vitro, and the Mac1-HA protein was expressed in the SLY2 cells carrying the synthetic gene on a high copy plasmid pGPG-Mac1HA(opt) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.1 A, three proteins (two labeled with p-Mac1-HA and one with Mac1-HA) were detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-HA antibody Y11 and found only in cells harboring the plasmid pGPD-Mac1HA(opt). Compared with theE. coli-expressed Mac1-HA, the two proteins had higher molecular masses. Upon protein phosphatase treatment, the two proteins collapsed to the protein Mac-HAp, which migrated at 57 kDa. The E. coli-expressed Mac1-HA also migrated at 57 kDa. Protein phosphatase treatment did not change the E. coli-expressed Mac1-HA (data not shown). This result indicates that the Mac1-HAp when overexpressed undergoes phosphorylation modification in the yeast cells but not in the bacteria. We observed that the overexpression causes hyperphosphorylation of the Mac1-HA protein (data not shown). In SLY2 cells transformed with the single copy plasmid pRSMac1(HA) (10Zhu Z. Labbé S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the level of the phosphorylated Mac1-HAp was found to be very low and hardly detectable (Fig.1 B). To enhance immunological detection, the plasmid pRSMac1(3HA) was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in which three copies of the HA epitope were inserted in Mac1p between the Gly-222 and Ala-223 residues. The Mac1-3HAp was functional in the activation of CTR1 and CTR3transcription, judging from the growth on nonfermentable carbon source yeast medium containing the non-fermentable carbon source ethanol plate (Fig. 1 D). As shown in Fig.1 B, in SLY2 cells harboring pRSMac1(3HA) plasmid, two specific protein bands were detected with one band significantly more abundant than the other, corresponding to nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Mac1-3HAp, respectively. We then carried out metabolic labeling with 32P-inorganic phosphate and subsequent immunoprecipitation. In Fig. 1 C, a32P-radioactive protein of the Mac1-3HAp molecular weight was detected from 32P metabolically labeled cells expressing Mac1-3HAp but not from the 32P-labeled control cells. These results together have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Mac1p also occurs at a physiological level. Based on the findings described above, we speculate that our prior failure to detect the DNA binding activity of Mac1p in the yeast extracts is possibly due to the observed very low abundance of the phosphorylated Mac1p. We then conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether or not the Mac1p DNA binding was affected by copper ions. To conduct this experiment, we used yeast whole cell extracts, prepared from the SLY2 containing the pGPD-Mac1HA(opt) plasmid and 32P-labeled wild typeCTR1 promoter DNA fragment, and a mutant fragment in which both CuREs are mutated (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The yeast cells were grown in copper-deficient medium, and extracts were prepared as described above. As shown in Fig. 2, a shifted complex was detected in the reactions between 32P-labeled wild typeCTR1 promoter DNA and the extract prepared from cells expressing Mac1-HA (lanes 3 and 4) but not from control cells (lane 2). The addition of CuSO4 at both 1 μm and 100 μm concentrations (lane 5 and 6) disrupted the complex. In the reaction containing the mutant CTR1 promoter DNA, no such complex was detected (lane 7), confirming previous genetic analysis and in vivo footprinting that the CuREs serve as the copper-responsive elements in the CTR1 andCTR3 promoters (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the anti-HA antibody in the reaction (lane 10) caused a supershift of the complex, indicating that Mac1-HAp is present in the complex. Competition reactions (lanes 8 and 9) show that Mac1-HA formed a specific complex with the wild type CTR1promoter DNA. Our data then demonstrate that the Mac1p DNA binding is copper ion-responsive, suggesting that the copper ion-triggered disruption of Mac1p DNA binding probably results in the transcriptional inactivation of CTR1 and CTR3. We next characterized the effect of Mac1p phosphorylation on its DNA binding by performing the electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the same yeast extracts, both treated and not treated with protein phosphatase (as shown in Fig. 3). Consistent with the data in Fig. 2, the Mac1-HAp-containing complex was detected (lanes 3 and 4), and the complex was disrupted by copper (lanes 5 and 6) and by the isoelectronic Ag+ as well (lane 7). Ag+ represses the CTR1 and CTR3 transcription in a manner indistinguishable to Cu+ (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These data further substantiate our finding that Mac1p DNA binding is copper ion-responsive. Also shown in the Fig. 3, the addition of BCS (lane 8), the Cu+-specific chelator, disrupted the complex, but EDTA (lane 9), a mainly divalent metal ion chelator, had no effect. These results indicate that the Mac1p DNA binding is also Cu+ coordination-dependent, much like the Ace1p and Amt1p, suggesting that the DNA-binding active Mac1p is likely to be Cu+-bound even under copper-limiting conditions. Inlane 10, the phosphatase treatment almost completely abolished the DNA binding activity of the Mac1-HAp in the extract sample showing that the phosphorylation of Mac1p is required to bind the CTR1 promoter. Interestingly, the addition of the phosphatase inhibitors (lane 11) did not prevent copper ions from disrupting Mac1-HA DNA binding in vitro, implying that copper disrupts the DNA binding of Mac1p probably through a mechanism other than dephosphorylation. These results together show that the two, phosphorylation and Cu+ coordination, are both required for the Mac1p to bind the CuREs in the promoters of CTR1 andCTR3. In this report, we have demonstrated that Mac1p undergoes phosphorylation modification in yeast cells but not in bacteria and that the phosphorylation is required for Mac1p to bind to its target gene, the CTR1 promoter (and presumably the CTR3promoter as well). The nonphosphorylated Mac1p failed to bind DNA at all. A previous report, however, has shown that the separated DNA-binding domain is able to bind the CTR1 promoter (15Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our lab has also found that the purified DNA-binding domain of Mac1p is able to bind CTR1 promoter eventhough the DNA-binding domain protein is not phosphorylated (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activity of the DNA-binding domain is inhibited in the nonphosphorylated Mac1p and that the inhibition is abolished upon phosphorylation of Mac1p. Consistent with this notion, two earlier studies (17Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that there are probably intermolecular interactions between the DNA-binding and activation domains of Mac1p and that the activation domain negatively may regulate the activity of the DNA-binding domain (19Serpe M Joshi A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29211-29219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, in Mac1p, the activation domain regulates the activity of the DNA-binding domain possibly in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Supporting this mechanism, our preliminary studies indicate that the phosphorylation occurs within the activation domain of Mac1p, not in the DNA-binding domain. 2Z. Zhu, M. Crooks, M. Depaz, and J. Heredia, manuscript in preparation. The activation domain of Mac1p clearly plays an active role in the regulation of CTR1 and CTR3 transcription in response to changes in copper ion concentrations. The phosphorylation of proteins is a general mechanism for cells to respond to extracellular signaling (25Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). This report indicates that regulation of copper ion uptake most likely involves a phosphorylation-based signal transduction mechanism. A recent study (26Casaa C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) has also indicated that Aft1p, the iron-sensing factor, undergoes possible phosphorylation modification. Therefore, the phosphorylation modification may represent a new yet common mechanism by which cells sense metal ions. Our finding that copper ions affect the DNA binding of Mac1p represents important progress in the understanding of the mechanism by which Mac1p functions in the regulation of CTR1 and CTR3transcription. The sequence homology among Mac1p, Ace1p, and Amt1p within their NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain suggests that these factors may function similarly in sensing copper ions (7Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A recent study (27Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 51: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has reported that Cuf1, a critical factor in the regulation of copper and iron uptake in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, also shares this homology. It is a known fact that for the Ace1p and Amt1p to activate the transcription of MT genes, both proteins have to bind copper ions first and then become DNA-binding active (28Buchman C. Skroch P. Welch J. Fogel E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4091-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Evans C. Engelke D. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This mechanism is clearly suited to assure that this detoxifying response is only activated in cells exposed to toxic levels of copper ions, not under physiological conditions because MTs inhibit the copper acquisition by other copper-dependent enzymes, such as Cu,Zn-SOD (30Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ace1p and Amt1p are sensors for the toxic level of copper ions. Our studies have shown that the Mac1p DNA binding is also Cu+ coordination-dependent, eventhough the deficiency of copper ions triggers the Mac1p to activate the transcription of CTR1 and CTR3. Equally important, we have also demonstrated that the exogenous copper ion and isoelectronic Ag+ disrupt the Cu+coordination-dependent DNA binding of Mac1p. Our results are seemingly contradictory, yet they unmistakably indicate that the Mac1p is able to sense two different copper levels, reflecting the very nature of copper in living organisms, essential yet toxic depending on its concentrations. We speculate that the dependence of Mac1p DNA binding on Cu+ coordination probably represents the ability of Mac1p to sense the physiological copper level, whereas the copper disruption of Mac1p DNA binding may exemplify its ability to sense the toxic level of copper ions. Mac1p contains two clustered metal ion binding motifs of typical CXC and CXXC nature located within the DNA-binding and the activation domains, respectively (7Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding and the activation domains are the possible structural basis for the sensing of the two copper levels by Mac1p. An important question is how Mac1p can detect these two different copper levels? And equally important, under the copper-limiting condition, why is the Mac1p able to bind copper ions and activate the CTR1 and CTR3 transcription but not the Ace1p, eventhough Mac1p and Ace1p share an almost identical Cu+ binding motif within their DNA-binding domains? One plausible model is that the copper ion binding motifs within the DNA-binding and activation domains of Mac1p may have different affinities to copper ions and that Mac1p DNA-binding domain has much higher affinity to copper ions than does the Ace1p DNA-binding domain. Biochemical studies currently underway in our laboratory will shed light on this possible mechanism. The transcription of CTR1 and CTR3 has been shown previously to be extremely sensitive to increases in exogenous copper ion (9Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our data have provided a framework for understanding how Mac1p may activate the transcription under copper-limiting conditions. However, the mechanism by which the increase in copper ion concentrations triggers the inactivation of CTR1 andCTR3 transcription is still poorly understood. We have reported here that copper triggers the repression of CTR1and CTR3 transcription possibly by disrupting the DNA-binding of Mac1p. Because the phosphatase inhibitors did not prevent copper from disrupting Mac1p-binding DNA (Fig. 3), this suggests that copper disrupts Mac1p DNA binding potentially by a means other than triggering dephosphorylation of Mac1p (10Zhu Z. Labbé S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).2 The new features of how Mac1p functions as reported in this work, particularly the ability to sense the two different levels of copper ions, are consistent with its regulatory role in copper ion transport. Further studies are warranted to determine the precise molecular mechanism by which cells differentiate the physiological from toxic levels of copper ions. This is particularly true because Menkes' and Wilson diseases are caused by copper ion deficiency and excess copper ion toxicity, respectively (for review see Refs. 31Harris Z.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 836S-841SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar and 32Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We thank other members in the Zhu lab for critically reading the manuscript and for valuable suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1992614239,"Octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) is a member of the POU (Pit-1, Oct-1,unc-86) family of transcription factors and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of gene expressions related to cell cycle regulation, development, and hormonal signals. It has been shown that Oct-1 acts not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a transcriptional repressor for certain genes. The mechanism of the repressive function of Oct-1 has not been well understood. Here we demonstrate by using the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays that the POU domain of Oct-1 directly interacts with a silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT). The interaction surfaces are located in the C-terminal region of SMRT, which are different from previously described silencing domains I and II or receptor interacting domains I and II. In transient transfection assays in COS1 cells, overexpression of SMRT attenuated the augmentation of Oct-1 transcriptional activity by OBF-1/OCA-B, activator for Oct-1. In pull-down assays, increasing amounts of SMRT could compete the binding of OCA-B to Oct-1 POU domain. The activity of Oct-1 could be determined by a regulated balance between SMRT and OCA-B. Furthermore, cotransfected unliganded thyroid hormone receptor enhanced the transactivation by Oct-1, and addition of 3,3′,5-tri-iodo-l-thyronine obliterated the stimulatory effects. Consequently, in the presence of cotransfected thyroid hormone receptor, the octamer response element acts as an element negatively regulated by 3,3′,5-tri-iodo-l-thyronine. The results suggest that the transcriptional activity of Oct-1 can be modulated by interaction through its POU domain by a silencing mediator SMRT resulting in the cross-talk between Oct-1 and nuclear receptors. Octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) is a member of the POU (Pit-1, Oct-1,unc-86) family of transcription factors and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of gene expressions related to cell cycle regulation, development, and hormonal signals. It has been shown that Oct-1 acts not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a transcriptional repressor for certain genes. The mechanism of the repressive function of Oct-1 has not been well understood. Here we demonstrate by using the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays that the POU domain of Oct-1 directly interacts with a silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT). The interaction surfaces are located in the C-terminal region of SMRT, which are different from previously described silencing domains I and II or receptor interacting domains I and II. In transient transfection assays in COS1 cells, overexpression of SMRT attenuated the augmentation of Oct-1 transcriptional activity by OBF-1/OCA-B, activator for Oct-1. In pull-down assays, increasing amounts of SMRT could compete the binding of OCA-B to Oct-1 POU domain. The activity of Oct-1 could be determined by a regulated balance between SMRT and OCA-B. Furthermore, cotransfected unliganded thyroid hormone receptor enhanced the transactivation by Oct-1, and addition of 3,3′,5-tri-iodo-l-thyronine obliterated the stimulatory effects. Consequently, in the presence of cotransfected thyroid hormone receptor, the octamer response element acts as an element negatively regulated by 3,3′,5-tri-iodo-l-thyronine.

Oct-1 is a member of a family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a bipartite DNA-binding domain (POU domain). The POU domain consists of two conserved regions, a POU-specific domain and a POU homeodomain (4Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G.

The both subdomains have a helix-turn-helix motif, acting not only as a DNA-binding domain but also as a protein-protein interaction domain. A number of transcription factors have been identified to interact with the POU domains of Oct-1 such as TBP, TFIIB, HMG2, and Oct-binding factor 1 (OBF-1) also referred to as Oct-1-associated coactivator (OCA-B) (6Zwilling S.

Silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and the nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (N-CoR) were identified as interacting proteins for unliganded nuclear receptors that repress the basal transcriptional activity of target genes (17Chen J.D.

In this study, we have shown that SMRT physically interacts with POU domain of Oct-1 and is involved in transcriptional repression by Oct-1. Our results illustrate a novel mechanism by which Oct-1 regulates genes both negatively and positively.

COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.25 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2. Transfection was done in COS1 cells using the standard calcium phosphate procedure. Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates 6 h prior to transfection. Luciferase reporter (0.25 μg) was cotransfected with 0.1 μg of the indicated expression vectors. After 12 h of incubation, the medium on the cells was replaced with fresh medium. 10−7m of TSA (see Fig. 4) or 10−7m of T3 (see Fig. 5) was added to the medium when indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h for reporter assays. Luciferase activity was determined by the PicaGene Luciferase Assay System (Toyo Inki, Tokyo) using Lumat LB9501 (Berthold Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as relative light units normalized to the amounts of protein.

Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 carrying the recombinant GST fusion or GST control plasmid was diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5–6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h of induction, bacteria were collected and washed with PBS. Pellets were suspended in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein or the GST control protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and extensively washed with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Matrix-bound proteins were used for interaction experiments. In vitro translated35S-labeled proteins (1–2 μl) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with glutathione-Sepharose (10 μl) beads containing 2–5 μg of GST recombinant proteins in 250 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin). Ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) was included in the binding reaction. After extensive washing with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE 10%). The results of the in vitro reactions and the amount of35S-labeled proteins bound by GST fusions were visualized and quantified using a Phosphor Imager (Fuji BAS 1500). COS1 cells were plated in 10-cm plates 6 h prior to transfection at a density of 2 × 106/plate. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant (20 μg) by addition of appropriate amounts of the parental empty expression vector. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression vectors for SMRT along with Oct-1 or control vector using standard calcium-phosphate method. 12 hours later, cells were washed with PBS and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method previously described (36Miyamoto T. Ichikawa K. Hashizume K. Nishii Y. Takeda T. Kobayashi M. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed by adding 5 ml of ice-cold SMT buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) to the plates. After nuclear fractions were recovered by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100), followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were spun down at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Immunoprecipitations were then performed with the anti-Oct-1 antibody for 2 h at 4 C on a rotator, followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A. The bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to PVDF (Millipore Immobilon-P) at 100 mA for 1 h at 4 C with a MiniTransblot system (Bio-Rad). Sheets of PVDF containing transferred protein from entire gels were incubated first in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1–3 h to block nonspecific binding of antibody, followed by 2 h of incubation in primary antibody (anti-SMRT antibody). The sheets were then washed in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in TBS-T. After washing two times in TBS-T, bound antibody was detected with the ECLTM system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. PVDF blots were reprobed with additional primary antibodies after stripping away the first antibody. This was accomplished by incubating the PVDF sheets in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmTris, pH 6.9, for 60 min at 70 C. To examine the interaction between Oct-1 and SMRT, we used the matrix-bound fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase with Oct-1 (GST-Oct-1) forin vitro pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.1 A, [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated SMRT interacted with GST-Oct-1 POU domain (lane 3) but not GST alone (lane 2), and GST-Oct-1 did not retain any of thein vitro-translated control luciferase protein (lane 7–10). The matrix-bound GST-POU-specific domain (lane 4) and GST-POU homeodomain (lane 5) retained considerable amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled SMRT. Because the binding mixture included ethidium bromide to destroy the nonspecific DNA-protein interaction, it was concluded that the association of SMRT to matrix-bound Oct-1 was not due to the presence of contaminating DNA. Reciprocal pull-down experiment was performed to confirm the interaction between Oct-1 and SMRT. We examined the specific domains in SMRT that interact with Oct-1. Series of deletion mutants of GST fusion proteins representing overlapping portions of SMRT (Fig. 1 B) were expressed in bacteria, purified, and used to bind 35S-labeled full-length Oct-1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the third domain of SMRT (SMRT III) was required for the interaction. The interacting surface of SMRT with Oct-1 is distinct from the nuclear receptor interacting domains (RID) or silencing domains (SD-1 and SD-2), which are known to interact with mSin3. As control experiments, the nuclear receptor interactions with SMRT were also determined. [35S]Methionine-labeled TR was incubated with matrix-bound GST fusions of SMRT (lanes 8–12). In agreements with previous reports (17Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), significant associations of TR were detected with GST-SMRT-IV and GST-SMRT-III+IV, whereas no association with GST-SMRT-III was observed. To further confirm the interaction between Oct-1 and SMRT within the cells, coimmunopresipitation experiments were performed using COS1 cells cotransfected with SMRT and/or Oct-1 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 2, SMRT was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Oct-1-specific antibody in the presence of transfected Oct-1, suggesting the physical interaction between Oct-1 and SMRT within the cells. In the absence of transfected Oct-1, because of the limiting amounts of endogenous Oct-1, interaction with SMRT could not be detected in this assays.Figure 2In vivo association between SMRT and Oct-1 proteins. COS1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression vectors for SMRT along with Oct-1 or control vector using standard calcium-phosphate method. Nuclear cell extracts (50 μg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with monoclonal antibody (Ab) directed against Oct-1 protein, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF filter, and probed with polyclonal antibody directed against SMRT proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the possible role of SMRT in Oct-1 transcriptional activity, we performed transient transfection experiments in COS1 cells. Full-length Oct-1 expression vectors or empty expression vectors were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing eight copies of the Oct-1 response element (8xOcta) into COS1 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, cotransfection of SMRT repressed the Oct-1-activated reporter activity by ∼50%. When OCA-B/OBF-1 was cotransfected, significant stimulation of the Oct-1-dependent transcription was observed in agreement with previous reports (10Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 11Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Even in the presence of cotransfected OBF-1/OCA-B, SMRT still repressed the transcriptional activation by Oct-1. In contrast, expression of Oct-1 and/or SMRT did not affect the mutant reporter activity, suggesting that repression by SMRT was mediated through Oct-1 element. Next we examined the effects of SMRT on a naturally occurring Oct-1 response element using Ig heavy-chain (BCL1 IgH) promoter in COS1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, coexpression of Oct-1 and OBF-1/OCA-B stimulated the BCL1 IgH promoter. The expression of SMRT inhibited the Oct-1 transcriptional activity on IgH promoter in either the presence or absence of OBF-1/OCA-B but had no effect on the control reporter. These results strongly suggested that SMRT could function as a corepressor for Oct-1-dependent transcription, indicating physiological relevance of the interaction of SMRT with Oct-1. SMRT has been shown to recruit histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) through direct interaction with mSin3. These histone deacetylases are thought to be involved in the trans-repression function of unliganded nuclear receptors. To clarify whether HDACs mediated the trans-repression by Oct-1 through SMRT, we next examined the effects of TSA, a specific HDAC inhibitor, on the transcriptional activity of Oct-1 (37Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, treatment of COS1 cells with 10−7m TSA abolished the trans-repression by cotransfected Oct-1 and SMRT. Because of the presence of endogenous Oct-1 and SMRT, TSA increased the promoter activity in some degree even in the absence of cotransfected Oct-1 and SMRT. In contrast, TSA had no effect on the control promoter. These results suggested that histone deacetylase system would be involved in the Oct-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Because SMRT interacts with TR and acts as a nuclear receptor corepressor, we assume that coexpression of TR may enhance the transcriptional activity of Oct-1 by sequestration of the limiting amount of SMRT from Oct-1. If this is the case, ligand-induced dissociation of SMRT from TR increases the amounts of SMRT that can be recruited to Oct-1, resulting in the transcriptional repression of Oct-1 element. Therefore, we next examined the effects of overexpression of TR and addition of T3 on Oct-1 function. As shown in Fig. 5 A, as we assumed, unliganded TR enhanced the transcriptional activation of 8xOcta by Oct-1 and addition of T3 obliterated the enhancement, indicating that the promoter regulated by Oct-1 might act as a negative T3-responsive promoter through the mechanism that involves SMRT. To further confirm the mechanism that unligand TR can sequester SMRT from Oct-1, we next performed the pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 5 B, unliganded TR decreased the amount of SMRT that interacted with Oct-1 POU domain. Addition of T3, which releases the SMRT from TR and increases the number of SMRT available for the interaction with Oct-1, restored the intraction between SMRT and Oct-1. SMRT and OCA-B interacts with the same POU domain; therefore the balance of the amounts of SMRT and OCA-B may regulate the bifunctional transcriptional activity of Oct-1. To determine whether SMRT and OCA-B/OBF-1 bound to Oct-1 competitively, the effect of SMRT on the interaction between Oct-1 and OCA-B were analyzed using pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 6, addition of increasing amounts of SMRT results in diminished binding of OCA-B to Oct-1. These data suggested that SMRT and OCA-B/OBF-1 actually compete for binding to Oct-1 POU domain. In this study, we have examined the interaction between SMRT and POU domain of Oct-1. Our results indicated that Oct-1 interacted with SMRT by direct protein-protein interaction and led to the recruitment of histone deacetylases complex to the promoter, resulting in the transcriptional repression. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6, SMRT and coactivator OCA-B/OBF-1 could competitively interact with Oct-1 POU domain. When Oct-1 recruits OCA-B/OBF-1, it activates the transcription of Oct-1 response element. Dominant recruitment of SMRT switches the Oct-1 from transcriptional activator to repressor. It was previously reported that the POU transcription factor Pit-1 or the homeobox proteins Pbx-Pdx can interact with both CREB-binding protein containing coactivator complex and N-CoR/SMRT containing corepressor complex and regulate the transcriptional activity by balance between these complexes. Similarly we proposed the hypotheses that the activity of Oct-1 is also determined by a regulated balance between SMRT and OCA-B/OBF-1. The SMRT interaction surface was located in POU domain of Oct-1. The POU domain has been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction as well as sequence-specific DNA binding. A number of transcription factors have been identified to interact with the POU domains of Oct-1, e.g. TBP, TFIIB, HMG2, OBF-1/OCA-B, and nuclear hormone receptors such as TR, retinoid X receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor (6Zwilling S.

Various transcription factors interact with Oct-1 POU domain and influence mutually divergent actions of Oct-1. SMRT, which was originally cloned as a factor mediating the transcriptional repression of unliganded nuclear receptors, directly interacts with hinge domain of receptors through its C-terminal region called RID resulting in the recruitment of the histone deacetylases (HDAC1/Rpd3) to the receptors. This RID was also reported to be involved in the interaction with homeodomain transcription factors, Pit-1 and Pbx-1 (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T.

However, our results demonstrated that SMRT uses a different domain than the RID for the interaction with Oct-1, suggesting the possibility that there might be certain interface in SMRT for each interacting factors. In this study we showed that coexpression of unliganded TR led to the enhancement of transactivation by Oct-1, and this effect was abolished by addition of T3, supporting the hypothesis that SMRT recruited to the DNA-bound Oct-1 could be competed by unliganded TR. The pull-down assays demonstrated that limiting amounts of SMRT were titrated from Oct-1 by unliganded thyroid hormone receptors, and addition of T3 redelivered the SMRT to Oct-1. These data indicated that the Oct-1 element might work as a negative TRE when TR coexist with Oct-1. Previously we and others have reported that nuclear receptors such as TR, retinoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor interact with POU domain of Oct-1 and modulate the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (12Kutoh E.

Antiretroviral therapy directed against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 is currently increasing the life expectancy of infected individuals. To replicate in infected cells, HIV relies on reverse transcriptase (RT), an essential RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase encoded by the viralpol gene (1Lightfoote M.M. Coligan J.E. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Martin M.A. Venkatesan S. J. Virol... 1986; 60: 771-775Google Scholar). RT is a major target for drugs acting as inhibitors of retroviral replication. Because dNTPs are natural substrates for RT, more than 20 nucleoside analogues are currently usedin vitro, in clinical trials, and in the clinic to inhibit retroviral replication (2Balzarini J. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1999; 58: 1-27Google Scholar, 3Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News.. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). To act as specific RT inhibitors, nucleoside analogues must be converted into 5′-triphosphate nucleosides upon phosphorylation by intracellular nucleoside/nucleotide kinases. Most nucleotide analogues do not possess a 3′-OH group required for phosphodiester bond formation during DNA synthesis. Therefore, they act as DNA chain terminators once incorporated into the nascent viral DNA. The efficacy of antiretroviral chemotherapy is limited by at least three factors. First, nucleoside analogues have to cross the cellular membrane to be activated to the 5′-triphosphate form by cellular kinases. This series of phosphorylation reactions is generally not efficient enough to produce adequate levels of the active nucleoside 5′-triphosphate able to compete efficiently with natural dNTPs. Second, RT incorporates nucleotide analogues with, at best, equal efficiency to that of their natural counterparts, i.e. dTTP for both AZTTP and d4TTP. The consequence of these two points is that retroviral replication is not completely suppressed. Third, mutant viruses escaping replication inhibition arise and are resistant to nucleoside analogues due to amino acid substitutions in the polgene. AZT has been the first approved drug used in antiretroviral therapy (4Mitsuya H. Weinhold K.J. Furman P.A. St. Clair M.H. Lehrman S.N. Gallo R.C. Bolognesi D. Barry D.W. Broder S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 7096-7100Google Scholar). In cultured cells infected by HIV-1, AZT is a potent drug active in the nanomolar range. In the cell, AZT is efficiently converted into AZTMP. The intracellular concentration of AZTMP is in the millimolar range, whereas AZTTP levels are in the micromolar range (5Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. Barry D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1986; 83: 8333-8337Google Scholar). Both thymidylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase represent a “bottleneck” in the activation of AZTMP and AZTDP, respectively. AZTMP and AZTDP are 2 × 102- and 104-fold less efficient substrates for thymidylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase than their thymidine counterparts, respectively (6Schneider B. Xu Y.W. Sellam O. Sarfati R. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11491-11497Google Scholar, 7Lavie A. Vetter I.R. Konrad M. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 601-604Google Scholar). d4T is another thymine analogue showing antiretroviral properties similar to those of AZT, but unlike AZT, it is poorly converted into d4TMP by thymidine kinase (8Balzarini J. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 6127-6133Google Scholar). Consequently, intracellular levels of d4TMP are low (8Balzarini J. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 6127-6133Google Scholar, 9Ahluwalia G.S. Gao W.Y. Mitsuya H. Johns D.G. Mol. Pharmacol... 1996; 50: 160-165Google Scholar). The activation of d4TMP into d4TDP by thymidylate kinase is poorly characterizedin vitro. At the following step of activation toward the triphosphate, the presence of an intramolecular CH···O bond in d4TDP makes this nucleotide a 10-fold better substrate for nucleoside diphosphate kinase than AZTDP. However, d4TDP is still converted 103-fold less efficiently than its natural counterpart dTDP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (6Schneider B. Xu Y.W. Sellam O. Sarfati R. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11491-11497Google Scholar, 10Schneider B. Biondi R. Sarfati R. Agou F. Guerreiro C. Deville-Bonne D. Veron M. Mol.

This 10-fold enhancement relative to AZTDP does not compensate for the low levels of d4TMP; d4TTP levels are even lower (about 20-fold) than those observed for AZTTP (8Balzarini J. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 6127-6133Google Scholar). The comparison of the activation properties of AZT and d4T illustrates well that the chemical nature of the modifications in the ribose moiety is critical for antiretroviral potency. For example, ddTTP is a potent inhibitor of RT in vitro (12Reardon J.E. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Google Scholar), but ddT has limited therapeutic value. Interestingly, ribose modifications also specify their own pattern of nucleoside resistance in the viral pol gene. Indeed, when AZT is given as the sole drug, a pattern of up to 6 amino acid changes involving M41L/D67N/K70R/L210W/T215F/T215Y/K219Q is observed in RT and confers a >100-fold AZT resistance to HIV-1 (3Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News.. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar,13Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1992; : 205-222Google Scholar). The resistance pattern is different for d4T. First, moderate (<10-fold) resistance to d4T is observed in the clinic as well as in cultured cells infected by HIV-1 (14Lacey S.F. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother... 1994; 38: 1428-1432Google Scholar, 15Lin P.F. Gonzalez C.J. Griffith B. Friedland G. Calvez V. Ferchal F. Schinazi R.F. Shepp D.H. Ashraf A.B. Wainberg M.A. Soriano V. Mellors J.W. Colonno R.J. Antiviral Ther... 1999; 4: 21-28Google Scholar). Unlike AZT, d4T does not induce a specific pattern of mutations in the pol gene. In the clinic, the most important d4T resistance mutations are in fact AZT resistance mutations such as those described above (15Lin P.F. Gonzalez C.J. Griffith B. Friedland G. Calvez V. Ferchal F. Schinazi R.F. Shepp D.H. Ashraf A.B. Wainberg M.A. Soriano V. Mellors J.W. Colonno R.J. Antiviral Ther... 1999; 4: 21-28Google Scholar, 16Moreno S. Casado J.L. Hertogs K. Antela A. Dronda F. Perez-Elias M.J. Moreno A. Larder B. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 19Google Scholar). These mutations have thus been termedthymidine-associated mutations (TAMs). It is, however, important to note that the use of AZT in the clinic has predated that of d4T, thus facilitating the diffusion, selection, and persistence of these mutations among HIV-1 isolates. Second, the d4T therapeutic usefulness is not short lived, and the definition of d4T resistance is elusive (17Soriano V. Dietrich U. Villalba N. Immelmann A. Gil-Aguado A. Echevarria S. Clotet B. Ocana I. Santamaria J.M. Bouza E. Barona V. Gatell J.M. Gonzalez-Lahoz J. AIDS.. 1997; 11: 696-697Google Scholar). A single substitution seems to be associated specifically to the use of d4T, however. When d4T is given as the sole drug in cultured cells infected by HIV-1, RT bearing a valine to threonine substitution at position 75 can be selected (14Lacey S.F. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother... 1994; 38: 1428-1432Google Scholar). This substitution confers a 2–3-fold increase in IC50 for d4T to HIV-1, and this level of resistance is generally considered close to the limit of significance. In the clinic, the V75T substitution is observed at low frequency (up to 10%) following d4T therapy, the highest frequency being on AZT naive patients (18Brun-Vezinet F. Race E. Descamps D. Dam E. Telles F. Obry V. Collin G. Vray M. Clavel F. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 78Google Scholar, 19Coakley E.P. Gillis J.M. Hammer S.M. AIDS.. 2000; 14: 9-15Google Scholar, 20Ross L.L. Fisher R. Scarsella A. Henry K. Becker S. Liao Q. St. Clair M. Graham N. Hernandez J. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 38Google Scholar). The V75T substitution does not appear on RT having a pre-existing AZT resistance background (20Ross L.L. Fisher R. Scarsella A. Henry K. Becker S. Liao Q. St. Clair M. Graham N. Hernandez J. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 38Google Scholar). These results give to d4T a very favorable profile in terms of avoiding the drug resistance problem. However, a number of questions need to be addressed to use the full therapeutic potential of d4T. Why does d4T elicit only a moderate (<10-fold) resistance as compared with AZT (>100-fold)? What is the molecular mechanism by which V75T would confer d4T resistance? The V75T substitution comes from a 2-base pair mutation involving a GTN → ACN codon change. Although a 2-base pair mutation occurs at a lesser frequency than a single mutation, the classical AZT resistance-associated T215Y change also involves a 2-base pair mutation and is found at a greater frequency than V75T. T215Y confers a <2-fold resistance to d4T, but subsequent AZT resistance mutations provide a higher level of resistance than V75T alone (3Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News.. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar), explaining why V75T does not occur in an AZT resistance background. Recently, Ross et al. (20Ross L.L. Fisher R. Scarsella A. Henry K. Becker S. Liao Q. St. Clair M. Graham N. Hernandez J. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 38Google Scholar) have found a certain degree of exclusion between AZT resistance and d4T resistance mutations since an increased phenotypic resistance to d4T was observed in a group of patients who had either at least one TAM or the V75T substitution. This observation suggests that the mechanism by which V75T mediates d4T resistance might be different from that of AZT resistance. The main AZT resistance mechanism involves repair of the AZTMP-terminated primer either by ATP (21Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 35-43Google Scholar) or pyrophosphate (PPi) (22Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Google Scholar). These repair reactions have in common the nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl group from either the γ-phosphate of ATP or the PPi on the terminal phosphodiester bond of the AZTMP-terminated DNA primer. The molecular mechanism underlying d4T resistance in general is poorly defined. In the case of V75T, Lennerstrand et al. (23Lennerstrand J. Hertogs K. Stammers D.K. Larder B. Antivir. Ther... 2000; 5 Suppl. 3: 14Google Scholar) found that ATP had no effect on the repair of d4TMP-terminated primer. They concluded d4TTP might be discriminated against dTTP or in other words that the V75T substitution might be involved in the decreased binding of RT to d4TTP independently from ATP-mediated repair. In this paper, we examine the effects of the V75T substitution in RT on d4T resistance. We show that V75T changes both nucleotide selectivity and repair of the d4TMP-terminated DNA chain by PPi but not by ATP. The wild-type RT gene construct p66RT7 has been described (24Canard B. Chowdhury K. Sarfati R. Doublié S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35768-35776Google Scholar). This plasmid was further modified and used to construct the mutant RT gene at codon 75 (V75T) and the double mutant V75T/Y146F using synthetic oligonucleotides and a strategy described previously (24Canard B. Chowdhury K. Sarfati R. Doublié S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35768-35776Google Scholar). The same RT gene mutated at codon 75 was used in conjunction with the recombinant HIV-1 proviral AD8 DNA (HIV-1AD8 (25Theodore T. Englund G. Buckler-White A. Buckler C.E. Martin M.A. Peden K.W.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses.. 1996; 12: 191-194Google Scholar)) to construct V75T HIV-1AD8. The latter recombinant infectious clone differs from wild-type AD8 DNA only at codon 75 (V75T). The construction of V75T HIV-1AD8 will be described elsewhere. 2J. Boretto, S. Longhi, J. M. Navarro, B. Selmi, J. Sire, and B. Canard, manuscript in preparation. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing. All recombinant RTs were expressed and purified as p66/p51 heterodimers. Briefly, p66 subunits carrying a His6 tag at the C terminus were coexpressed with the HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli, and the resulting p66/p51 heterodimer was purified to homogeneity.2 DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). All32P-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate, 3′-deoxy- and 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (ddNTPs and dNTPs) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Both d4TTP and α-borano-(Rp)-2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (α-BH3-d4TTP) were synthesized and purified as described (11Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3520-3529Google Scholar). Wild-type and V75T RT were titrated so as to determine the proportion of active enzyme using active-site titration as described (26Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 25988-25997Google Scholar) and the primer/template system described previously (11Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3520-3529Google Scholar). Active-site titrations yielded higher values when the p66 subunit was coexpressed with the HIV-1 protease than when the p66/p51 heterodimer was obtained by mixing E. colisupernatants containing p66 and p51 subunits expressed separately.2 Thus, RT was prepared following the former protocol exclusively. The concentration of RT was determined using UV spectroscopy and the extinction coefficients used previously (26Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 25988-25997Google Scholar). For both wild-type and V75T RT, the value of active enzyme was 55% of the value determined using UV. All RT concentrations are expressed as active-site concentrations. Standard RT activity was assayed using poly(rA)/oligo(dT)19 or poly(rC)/oligo(dG)19and DE81 ion-exchange paper discs as described (24Canard B. Chowdhury K. Sarfati R. Doublié S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35768-35776Google Scholar). To determine theKM for a dNTP, the primer/template was kept at a saturating concentration of 200 nm, and the concentrations of the corresponding dNTP were varied from 2 to 50 μm. The RT concentration was 10 nm. Filter paper discs were washed three times for 10 min in 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, 2 times in ethanol, and dried. The radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The rate of DNA polymerization was measured using a 5′-32P-labeled oligo(dT)21 primer annealed to poly(rA). Extension products were analyzed using a gel assay. The template average length was 612 nucleotides and was annealed to primer using a 1:1 molar ratio calculated using nucleotide concentration. The primer/template (25 nm, 15 μl) was incubated with RT (50 nm) in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 μl of 500 μm dTTP in 6 mmMgCl2 at 37 °C, and quenched at various times by 80 μl of 0.3 m EDTA using a fast-quench apparatus (KinTek Austin, TX). The quenched reaction was diluted with 300 μl of gel loading buffer made of 90% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol. Electrophoretic analysis was performed on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was analyzed using an imaging plate and a FujiImager. The inhibition of reverse transcription was measured as described previously (11Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3520-3529Google Scholar, 24Canard B. Chowdhury K. Sarfati R. Doublié S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35768-35776Google Scholar). Inhibition was expressed as the concentration of inhibitor producing a 50% inhibition (IC50) using the standard reverse transcription assay described above. Each aliquot was spotted in duplicate, and the values of IC50 are the average from at least two independent experiments. Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using d4TTP, α-BH3-d4TTP, and dTTP in conjunction with wild-type and V75T RT as described (11Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C.

The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst Equation 1(26), (P)=A·(1−exp(−kapp·t))+kSStEquation 1 where A is the amplitude of the burst;kapp is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond; and kSS is the kinetic constant of the steady state, linear phase.

Curve fitting was performed using the Kaleidagraph software. The primer/template system used for both pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated repair assays was a 5′-32P-enlabeled 21-mer DNA primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCC-3′) annealed to a 35-mer (5′-GGTCCGTTGCATGCGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA template. The single template A specifying a single thymidine insertion site four bases away from the 3′ end of the primer is shown in bold. DNA polymerization was initiated by the addition of wild-type or V75T RT (100 nm) and nucleotides (25 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 5 μm analogue TP (d4TTP)) for 15 min at 37 °C in RT buffer. The repair reaction was started by adding dTTP to reach a final concentration of 25 μm in the presence of either PPi or ATP, as indicated. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (11Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3520-3529Google Scholar). The percent repair of blocked primer is the ratio × 100 of extension products larger than 25 nucleotides over those larger than 24 nucleotides. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The C8166R5 cell line (a gift from M. Malim) stably transfected with CCR5 coreceptor was used to monitor the replication of the macrophage-tropic AD8 viral strain. Cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 1 μg/ml of puromycin to select for the CCR5 coreceptor expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from a normal donor sample that was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (Difco) and cultivated in RPMI supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Three days after stimulation, interleukin-2 (Chiron) was added in the medium at a final concentration of 0.01 μg/ml, and cells were allowed to grow for 3 days before being infected. To obtain wild-type and V75T viral stocks, HeLa cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell-free supernatant containing viruses were titrated by assaying the fusogenic properties on C8166 cells (29Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology.. 1983; 129: 51-64Google Scholar) infected with serial 5-fold dilutions to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose of viral stocks. Virus stocks from transfected cells were calibrated either to infect 1.5 × 106 primary cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.02 and 0.002 or to infect 2 × 106 C8166R5 cells at an m.o.i. of 0.01, 0.0025, and 0.0005. Virus production was monitored by measuring twice a week RT activity in infected cell-free supernatant. C8166R5 cells (1 × 106 cells) were pretreated for 24 h with different amounts of d4T or PFA before being infected. Cells were then infected for 3 h with wild-type or V75T viruses calibrated for similar m.o.i., washed twice in serum-free RPMI, and then incubated for 15 min with 15 μg of trypsin type XIII (Sigma) per ml at room temperature to remove viral particles bound at the membrane surface. Cells were then washed in serum-free RPMI before being grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of inhibitors. One day post-infection, cells were again washed in serum-free RPMI and then allowed to grow in the presence of inhibitors. Day two post-infection, cell-free supernatant was removed and monitored for RT activity. Media were then replaced by fresh inhibitor-containing media, and infected cells were then incubated for 2 additional days. On day 4 post-infection, RT activity was measured in the cell-free supernatant. The coordinates of RT in complex with DNA and nucleotide were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. Their Protein Data Bank accession numbers are indicated in the text and the legend of Fig. 1. The crystal structure models were displayed using INSIGHT II and the TURBO graphics program (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of the V75T substitution observed in HIV-1 RT. This substitution is associated with viruses isolated from patients under stavudine treatment. The low level of resistance conferred by V75T suggests that the changes in biochemical properties of stavudine 5′-triphosphate incorporation by V75T RT relative to wild-type RT might be subtle. To date, two types of mechanisms of nucleoside resistance observed using purified RT and the corresponding 5′-triphosphate analogue have been reported. In the first type, substitutions leading to drug resistance can affect binding of the triphosphate analogue by the resistant RT. In this case, a decrease in binding affinity of RT for the analogue can be measured, such as for the M184V substitution and 3TC triphosphate (31Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wohrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Google Scholar). In the second type, the analogue can be incorporated without being significantly discriminated against its natural counterpart but be repaired preferentially by the drug-resistant RT. This is the case for AZT resistance mutations, where the terminal AZT-MP of the chain-terminated primer is excised by either ATP or PPi (21Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 35-43Google Scholar, 22Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Google Scholar). We investigated these two possibilities for the V75T substitution. Polymerases share a common fold to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation during synthesis of RNA or DNA. Their most salient feature is the presence of three domains called the thumb, fingers, and palm because they resemble a right hand. This right hand holds the double-stranded nucleic acid in the palm between fingers and thumb. The 3′-OH of the primer is positioned in the palm, but the template makes a sharp turn upon encountering the basis of the fingers and does not extend between fingers and thumb (32Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science.. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar). Valine 75 is located at the basis of the fingers subdomain of RT, >6 Å away from the catalytic triad of the polymerase active site. Valine 75 is located where the single-stranded templates makes its sharp turn but does not contact directly the template (Fig.1 A). Instead, the Val-75 amino acid side chain is directed away from the solvent, toward the inner part of the fingers. A change from valine to threonine involves replacing either one of the methyl groups of the Val-75 side chain by a hydroxyl group. The neighboring side chains located less than 4 Å away from these two methyl groups (labeled 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 B) are listed in TableI. We examined the potential loss and gain of interaction with these neighboring amino acid side chains (Fig.1 B and Table I). If an OH substitutes methyl group 1, four hydrophobic interactions involving Val-60 and Phe-77 are potentially lost with no compensating interactions brought by the presence of the OH (Table I). If an OH substitutes methyl group 2, one hydrophobic interaction is lost with Val-60, but two new hydrogen bonds are potentially created with Lys-73 and Tyr-146. The ε-NH2- of Lys-73 and the para OH-group of Tyr-146 are located 3.70 and 3.71 Å away from the modeled hydroxyl group of threonine 75, respectively. Given that the resolution of the crystal structure is 3.2 Å and the typical distance involved into a hydrogen bond is 2.7 Å, the possibility of such new hydrogen bonds can be neither confirmed nor excluded using structural models. Gln-151 is another amino acid found in the vicinity of Val-75. Although Gln-151 is located slightly more than 4 Å away from methyl group 2, Q151M is an important substitution found in multidrug resistance for which a biochemical characterization has been described (33Ueno T. Shirasaka T. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 23605-23611Google Scholar). Gln-151 interacts directly with the 3′-group of incoming nucleotides, and the Q151M substitution might provide discrimination of nucleotide analogues relative to their natural counterparts (33Ueno T. Shirasaka T. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 23605-23611Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that minor conformational modifications induced by V75T had an indirect effect on Gln-151 that would increase discrimination against d4TTP relative to wild-type RT.Table IStructural analysis of the Val-75 side chain environmentAmino acid residueDistanceInteraction1-aΦ,hydrophobic interaction; H bond, hydrogen bond.Interaction if OH1-bThe interaction mentioned in this column is the putative interaction if the corresponding methyl group 1 or 2 is replaced by an OH group, such as in the V75T substitution.ÅMethyl group 1 of Val-75 side chainVal-603.90Φ−Phe-773.79"

In this study, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of theble gene product, designated BLMT, uncomplexed and complexed with Bm at 1.7 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. The structure of BLMT is a dimer with two Bm-binding pockets composed of two large concavities and two long grooves.

The axial ligand, which binds a metal ion, seems to be the primary amine in the β-aminoalanine moiety. This report, which is the first with regard to the x-ray crystal structure of Bm, shows that the bithiazole moiety of Bm is far from the metal-binding domain.

Although Bm has not been used as an antibacterial agent, almost all strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, isolated in Hiroshima University Hospital, were resistant to the drug. A Bm resistance gene, designated blmS, has been cloned from chromosomal DNA isolated from methicillin-resistantS. aureus and sequenced (11Bhuiyan M.Z.A. Ueda K. Inouye Y. Sugiyama M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The gene product, designated BLMS, is also a Bm-binding protein (9Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. Matsuo H. Bhuiyan M.Z.A. Ueda K. Mochizuki H. Nakamura N. Davies J.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The transposon Tn5, expressed in Escherichia coli, carries Bm resistance together with kanamycin and streptomycin resistances (12Berg D.E. Davies J. Allet B. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nucleotide sequence analysis of the Bm resistance gene, designated ble, has suggested that it encodes a protein consisting of 126 amino acids with a molecular mass of 14,058 daltons (14Mazodier P. Cossart P. Giraud E. Gasser F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as the Bm resistance determinant, a ble product confers survival advantage to E. coli (15Blot M. Meyer J. Arber W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9112-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Blot M. Hauer B. Monet G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the ble gene product, designated by us as BLMT (17Kumagai T. Nakano T. Maruyama M. Mochizuki H. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), shares sequence homology with the BLMA protein (21%) and the Shbleprotein (25%). BLMT has been determined to be a Bm-binding protein (17Kumagai T. Nakano T. Maruyama M. Mochizuki H. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Adam E. Volkert M.R. Blot M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of BLMA at a high resolution of 1.5 Å by the single isomorphous replacement method including the anomalous scattering effect (19Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Another group has determined the crystallographic analysis of the Shble protein at a 2.3 Å resolution (20Dumas P. Bergdoll M. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2483-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both groups have independently provided a model that suggests that dimeric formation of the protein generates two pockets for binding to Bm. However, because the crystallization of BLMA and the Shble protein, which are complexed with Bm, has been unsuccessful until now, the precise binding mode between the protein and Bm has not been determined. In this study, we successfully crystallized BLMT uncomplexed and complexed with Bm; the former and latter structures were determined at 1.7 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. We describe the conformational differences of BLMT in the Bm-free and Bm-bound form. Although a structural model of Bm bound to an oligonucleotide, determined by two-dimensional NMR analysis, has been proposed (21Wu W. Vanderwall D.E. Turner C.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem.

BLMT, overproduced using an E. coli host vector system, was purified according to the methods described previously (17Kumagai T. Nakano T. Maruyama M. Mochizuki H. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Kumagai T. Maruyama M. Matoba Y. Kawano Y. Sugiyama M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1095-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For crystallization, BLMT was adjusted to a final concentration of 21 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 25 °C using the hanging-drop method (24McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals , 1st ed., 96–97. John Wiley, New York1982Google Scholar) with the mother liquor of 25% PEG 6000 (polyethylene glycol), 0.1 mcalcium acetate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.0. These crystals belong to the orthorhombic space groupC2221 with unit cell dimensionsa = 81.3 Å, b = 85.0 Å, andc = 78.8 Å. The crystal volume per unit of mass,VM (25Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), is 2.42 Å3/Da with 2 BLMT monomers in the asymmetric unit, which corresponds to a solvent content of 49%. For crystallization of BLMT complexed with Bm, the protein was incubated at a final concentration of 14 mg/ml for 1 h at room temperature with a 3-fold molar excess of Bm A2 sulfate (Fig. 1). The molar ratio of Bm A2 was suitable for complete binding to BLMT. The crystals of the BLMT·Bm complex were obtained by vapor diffusion at 25 °C using the hanging-drop method with the mother liquor of 15% PEG 6000, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.02 m magnesium chloride, and 0.05 mMES-NaOH at pH 5.0. These crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 115.3 Å, b = 117.0 Å, and c = 79.9 Å. The VM is 2.14 Å3/Da with four 2:2 complexes (2:2 = two monomeric BLMT molecules complexed with two Bm molecules) in an asymmetric unit. The value corresponds to a solvent content of 42.5%. Diffraction data for the Bm-free BLMT crystals were collected with synchrotron radiation (1.0 Å wavelength) at beam line 18B of the Photon Factory, the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan. The data collection was done with three crystals. Three sets of high resolution data up to 1.7 Å resolution were recorded on Fuji imaging plates (400 × 800 mm) using a Sakabe's Weissenberg camera (26Sakabe N. Ikemizu S. Sakabe K. Higashi T. Nakagawa A. Watanabe N. Adachi S. Sakaki K. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 1276-1281Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The diffraction images were processed to intensity data with the program WEIS (27Higashi T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1989; 16: 542-547Google Scholar). The intensity data from each imaging plate were scaled to each other by the Fox and Holmes method (28Fox G.C. Holmes K.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1966; 20: 886-891Crossref Google Scholar) and were then merged. The diffraction data for a crystal of BLMT complexed with Bm was collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC imaging plate detector system using the mirror monochromated CuKα radiation produced by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The crystal-to-detector distance was set to 95 mm. Each frame of the 1.5° crystal oscillation was collected for 10 min. The diffraction spots in a rotation range of 90° were recorded on a total of 60 frames. The data processing was accomplished at 2.5 Å resolution with the R-AXIS IIC data processing software package. The number of reflections having adequate intensities was small; this may be because of the noncrystallographic translational symmetry causing the systematic weakness of the intensities.

X-PLOR Version 3.1: a system for x-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The start model was a dimeric BLMA structure previously determined at 1.5 Å resolution (19Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal Met1 and Val2 and the C-terminal Gly121 and Glu122 residues in BLMA were omitted from the model, together with four turn regions (Val20–Trp23, Arg52–Ile57, Trp78–Ala81, and Glu99–Gly103). Atomic coordinates, obtained by the molecular replacement method, were refined against the data from 10 to 4.0 Å for 20 cycles with the entire monomer as a rigid body, resulting in a crystallographicR-factor of 56.4%. Atomic refinement of the model was performed with the combination of simulated annealing (30Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and conventional restrained refinement methods (31Konnert J.H. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1980; 36: 344-350Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar) using the program X-PLOR. In lower resolution refinement, strict noncrystallographic symmetry restraint was imposed. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraint, gradually weakened according to the progress of refinement, was finally ignored. A subset of 10% of the reflections was used to monitor the free R-factor (Rfree) (32Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Individual B-factors were refined by starting with a mean B-factor of 22 Å2 estimated from the Wilson plot (33Wilson A.J.C. Nature. 1942; 150: 152Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The refinement was started with data from 10 to 3.5 Å resolution and finished at 2.0 Å resolution. Positional parameters and refinement for individual isotropic B-factors were included in each refinement cycle. The program Xfit in the XtalView suite (34McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) was used for the visualization and building of the model. In the final stage of the X-PLOR refinement, Rfree and theR-factor were improved to 23.8 and 20%, respectively, against the 18,250 reflections with F > 2 ς from 10 to 2.0 Å resolution. Further refinement was performed with the data set from 5.0 to 1.7 Å resolution using the program SHELXL-97 (35Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R.

The current model contains two protein monomers in the asymmetric unit, together with 111 water molecules, two tetraethylene glycol moieties, and one calcium ion. Because Met1 and Leu122–Ser126 were invisible on the electron density due to their higher flexibility, they were excluded from the current model. All side-chain atoms of the residues from Thr2 to Leu121, except Glu98, are included in the model. The side-chain atoms of Glu98 were completely invisible and, above the Cβ, the atoms of the Glu98 side-chain are excluded from the model. A Luzatti plot (36Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that the mean coordinate error was ∼0.2 Å. No residues except Trp99 are in the acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot (37Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar, 38Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

The r.m.s. deviations from the ideal values are 0.007 Å in bond length, 2.0° in bond angle, and 1.23° in improper angle (Table I). The averageB-factors are 26.3 Å2 and 39.5 Å2for 1892 all-protein atoms and for 138 non-protein atoms, respectively. Pseudo-precession photographs indicate that the reflection intensities (I (hkl)) were systematically weak ifk was an odd number. When calculated using the reflections from 10.0 to 4.0 Å resolution, the second highest peak, which is 6% lower than the origin peak, was present at (x, y,z) = (0, 0.5, 0) on the Patterson map. This suggests that the noncrystallographic translational symmetry parallel to theb-axis is present in the crystal. To obtain the solutions of the rotation and the translation functions by decreasing the number of independent molecules per asymmetric unit, we made modifications as follows: the cell length of b-axis was halved. The axis transformation of the crystalline lattice was performed to satisfy the international rule for orthorhombic crystals (b >a > c). In other words, we assumed that this crystal belongs to the space groupP21212 with the unit cell dimensionsa = 79.9 Å, b = 115.3 Å, andc = 58.5 Å having two 2:2 complexes in an asymmetric unit. Simultaneously, the data set of the structure factor amplitude (F (hkl)) was transformed as follows: whenk is an odd number, the reflection was ignored. Otherwise, if k was an even number, the Miller indices of F(hkl) were transformed as (h′k′l′) = (l h k/2), where (h′k′l′) are the transformed Miller indices and (hkl) are the original ones. Initially, we solved the structure by the molecular replacement method and refined the atomic parameters using the transformed structure factor amplitudes and cell parameters with the programs in X-PLOR. The Bm-free form of dimeric BLMT was provided as a search model. The atomic coordinate, obtained by the molecular replacement method, was refined against the data from 10.0 to 4.0 Å with F> 2 ς for 20 cycles with the entire monomer as a rigid body, resulting in a crystallographic R-factor of 32.8%. The atomic refinement of the model was performed in the combination of the simulated annealing and the conventional restrained refinement methods, imposing strict noncrystallographic symmetry restraint. The refinement was started with data having 10.0–3.5 Å resolution, and the upper limit was raised to 2.5 Å resolution. The noncrystallographic symmetry restraint was weakened using the Rfree value as an indicator. The program Xfit was used for visualizing and rebuilding the model. In the course of the refinement, because theFo − Fc map showed that Bm was present in the crystal, we constructed the model of Bm into the difference electron density and included it in the subsequent refinement cycles. Several cycles of X-PLOR refinement resulted in decreasing both theR-factor and Rfree to 18.6 and 24.5%, respectively, for the reflections from 10.0 to 2.5 Å resolution with F > 2 ς. For refinement using the original cell parameters, the refined atomic coordinate of two 2:2 complexes was transformed as (x′, y′, z′) = (y, z, x +1/4), where (x, y, z) is the atomic coordinate in the halved crystalline lattice as (x′, y′, z′) is in the original one. The translational term (1/4) is necessary to correct the positional shift of the crystal origin. The atomic coordinates of the adjacent molecules, which are related by the crystallographic translational symmetry parallel toc-axis in the halved crystalline lattice, were transformed according to the above formula. The atomic coordinates of four 2:2 complexes were refined against the data between 10.0 and 3.5 Å withF > 2 ς for 20 cycles considering the entire 2:2 complex as a rigid body, resulting in a crystallographicR-factor of 21.7%. Because the number of reflections with adequate intensities was smaller when compared with the number of refined parameters, we paid attention to the following points: the noncrystallographic symmetry restraint imposing on the proteins and Bm was strongly set and decreased according to theRfree value. After the bulk solvent correction (39Jiang J.S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) was done, reflections at low resolution together with weak reflections with F < 2 ς were used for the refinement. Further cycles of atomic refinement yielded the current model. The R-factor and the Rfreewere improved to 22.1 and 30.2%, respectively, against all reflections from 30.0 to 2.5 Å resolution. When limited to the reflections withF > 2 ς, the final R-factor and theRfree were 19.0 and 26.4%, respectively. In the present study, we prepared the original topology and parameter files of the Bm molecule. The metal-binding domain in the Bm A2 molecule is composed of the β-aminoalanine, pyrimidinyl propionamide, and β-hydroxyhistidine moieties. The binding domain for DNA is composed of the γ-aminopropyl dimethylsulphonium and bithiazole moieties (Fig.1). The parameters used for construction of a three-dimensional model of the former and latter moieties were obtained from the x-ray crystal structures of the P-3A·Cu(II) complex (40Iitaka Y. Nakamura H. Nakatani T. Muraoka Y. Fujii A. Takita T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 31: 1070-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and 3-(2′-phenyl-2,4′-bithiazole-4-carboxamide)propyl dimethylsulfonium iodide (41Kuroda R. Neidle S. Riordan J.M. Sakai T.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4753-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), respectively. The parameters for threonine and methyl valerate in the linker moiety and for gulose and mannose in the sugar moiety of the Bm molecule were prepared using the energy minimization structure, which is calculated by the program CAChe. The current model contains 8 monomeric BLMT molecules, 8 Bm molecules, and 48 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The monomeric BLMT molecule in the current model consists of the Thr2–Glu120 residues, because both terminal residues, Met1 and Glu121–Ser126, were invisible in the electron density. All of the side-chain atoms of the Thr2–Glu120 residues are included in the model. In the electron density, the γ-aminopropyl dimethylsulphonium and the β-aminoalanine moieties of Bm are almost invisible and poorly defined, respectively. The mean coordinate error was estimated from a Luzzati plot to be 0.32 Å. The Ramachandran plot indicates that the backbone torsion angles for 67.9% of the nonglycine residues are in the favor region, whereas those for 95.9% are in the acceptable region. Most of the remaining residues, which fall outside of the acceptable region, have poorly defined electron densities and may have large errors in the parameters. The r.m.s. deviations from the ideal values are 0.007 Å in bond length, 1.2° in bond angle, and 0.57° in improper angle (Table I). The averageB-factors are 28.1 Å2 for 7544 all-protein atoms and 44.2 Å2 for the 768 atoms of the Bm molecule. Bm A2 sulfate was added at a range of 0.05 to 0.5 μm to 2 ml of 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.4 μm BLMT. Experiments were done at 25 °C using a spectrofluorophotometer (model RF-5000, Simadz, Japan) under the condition of λ excitation = 280 nm, λ emission = 350 nm, slit width at excitation = 10 nm, and slit width at emission = 10 nm. To estimate the concentration of protein contained in solution, the molar absorptivity (ε = 19,800), calculated from the number of Trp and Tyr residues in the BLMT molecule, was employed. The dissociation constant of BLMT for Bm was calculated as described previously (19Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The monomeric BLMT molecule consists of two α-helices and two β-sheets (β2–β5 and β6–β9), in addition to a short N-terminal β1-strand (Fig.2 A). The BLMT monomer exhibits two very similar domain structures connected to a long loop from Pro51 to Trp59. The first domain consists of the α1-helix and four β-strands (β2, β3, β4, and β5). The β2-strand is parallel to the β5-strand, and other pairs of β-strands (β3 and β4, β4 and β5) are in an anti-parallel configuration. The α1-helix plays a role as a linker connecting the β2- and β3-strands. Similar topology (βαβββ) is found in the second domain (α2-helix and β6–β9 strands). The hydrogen bonding networks of the β3- and β7-strands to each partner's β-strand generate an atypical anti-parallel β-sheet because they are disordered (Fig. 2 B). Two monomeric BLMT molecules are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 3 A). The β1-strand interacts with the partner's β6-strand, suggesting that the former strand plays a key role for the dimeric formation. The topology of BLMT is almost the same as BLMA (19Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the Shble protein (20Dumas P. Bergdoll M. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2483-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The dimer formation of BLMT, generated by the alternate arm exchange of two monomeric BLMT molecules, results in two large concavities and two long grooves. Although a noncrystallographic symmetry restraint is not imposed in the final refinement, one monomeric BLMT molecule is almost the same as the partner's monomer. The superposition of main-chain atoms on each BLMT monomer is shown in Fig. 3 B. The r.m.s. positional differences between two monomeric BLMT molecules are 0.41 Å for main-chain atoms and 0.79 Å for all-protein atoms. Structural deviations occur at two turn regions, Ala49–Ser58 and Leu96–Thr102, and at a long loop composed of the Gln82–Gly87 residues. The conformational deviations may be generated because of the flexibility of these regions. The overall structure of BLMT complexed with Bm is almost the same as that of the Bm-free BLMT (Fig. 4). The current model shows with accuracy that two Bm molecules bind to two Bm-binding pockets formed by the alternate arm exchange of two monomeric BLMT molecules. The bithiazole moiety of Bm is inserted into the long groove running along the dimer interface (Fig.5 A). The first thiazolium ring, which is interacted by the hydrophobic effect with the Phe30B benzene, is also interacted by the polar effect with the Arg65A guanidino group (Fig. 5 B). The second thiazolium ring is tightly stacked with two indole rings from Trp35B and Trp99A (Fig. 5 B). This stacking effect contributes to stabilization of the Bm molecule. The Trp35B indole ring is interacted by a hydrogen bond with the Glu46B carboxylate. The Glu46Bcarboxylate, interacted by two salt bridges with the Arg65Aguanidino group, is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the Thr6B hydroxyl oxygen (Fig. 5 B). That is, a hydrogen bonding network is extended from Trp35B to Arg65A. In addition, the Arg65A and Trp35B are interacted with the first and second thiazolium rings, respectively. The large concavity is formed mainly by the residues from one monomer. One side of the concavity has the hydrophobic residues. The linker, metal-binding, and sugar domains of Bm are buried in the large concavity (Fig. 5 A) and stabilized by a large number of hydrogen bonds to the protein atoms. In the metal-binding domain of Bm, an amino group attached to the pyrimidine ring is interacted by a hydrogen bond with two backbone carbonyl oxygens of Phe60A and Gly111A (Fig.6). The carbonyl oxygen of the pyrimidinyl propionamide moiety of Bm forms a hydrogen bond with the Arg90A guanidino group (Fig. 6). The terminal amide group of the pyrimidinyl propionamide moiety forms three hydrogen bonds: its oxygen atom with the Arg115A guanidino group, its nitrogen atom with the Ser61A hydroxyl oxygen, and the Trp59A carbonyl oxygen (Fig. 6). However, β-aminoalanine and β-hydroxyhistidine for the metal binding make no polar interactions with the protein atoms. Because the β-aminoalanine moiety is poorly defined in the electron density, the conformation may be unstable. However, its amide group orients parallel to the Trp59A indole ring and seems to be stacked by the apolar interaction. In fact, the Trp59A side-chain is flexible in the Bm-free form but rigid in the complexed form because the side-chain is stacked with the imidazole rings of His50B and the amide group of the β-aminoalanine moiety of Bm. Only mannose, but not gulose, in the sugar moiety of Bm is involved in the binding to the protein. The carbamoyl group, attached"

Thus the dynein/dynactin system is believed to be the main motor for nuclear migration in these fungi. Some of the nud genes of A. nidulans encode proteins that are not immediately recognizable as components of dynein or dynactin. Of these the NUDF protein is particularly interesting, because it closely resembles a human protein, LIS1, required for development of the cerebral cortex (10Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J.

It also has a short predicted coiled coil region near its N terminus and seven WD-40 repeats in the C-terminal half of the molecule, as does LIS1. NUDF and LIS1 interact either genetically or physically with theA. nidulans and mammalian homologs of two other proteins, NUDC and NUDE (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12Efimov V.P. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa M. Umezu M.

The close sequence similarity between NUDF and LIS1 and the fact that NUDF and LIS1 interact with homologous proteins suggest that they may have a similar biochemical function. Genetic evidence from A. nidulans has linked NUDF to cytoplasmic dynein. Loss of function mutations in components of either dynein or its activator complex, dynactin, in A. nidulans, N. crassa, and other filamentous fungi inhibit nuclear migration through the fungal mycelium. As a consequence growth of the mycelium is severely inhibited. This dynein-related mutant phenotype is phenocopied by loss of function mutations in the nudF gene, suggesting that NUDF protein is required for dynein to mediate nuclear migration. Strains doubly mutant for NUDF and the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain are no more severely affected than their singly mutant parental strains, and mutations causing loss of NUDF function are suppressed by mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (15Willins D.A. Liu B. Xiang X. Morris N.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data mean that NUDF and dynein are on the same biochemical pathway, and they imply that NUDF and the dynein heavy chain interact in some way. Similarly, perturbing LIS1 concentration, either by deletion or overexpression, phenocopies effects caused by perturbation of dynein and dynactin function in both mammalian cells and Drosophila melanogaster (16Lei Y. Warrior R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 226: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Liu Z. Xie T. Steward R. Development ( Camb. ). 1999; 126: 4477-4488PubMed Google Scholar, 18Liu Z. Stewart R.

LIS1 colocalizes in developing brain with components of cytoplasmic dynein and also coimmunoprecipitates from mammalian extracts with components of dynein and dynactin (20Faulkner N.E. Dujardin D.L.

Wynshaw-Boris A. Tsai L.-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Like LIS1 cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chains have an N-terminal predicted coiled coil domain and seven C-terminal WD-40 domains. Although they are about 25 kDa larger than LIS1, this similarity has raised the possibility that LIS1 could be a variant cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (22Vallee R.B. Faulkner N.E. Tai C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There appear to be two cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chains in each cytoplasmic dynein complex (23Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8769-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration data have shown that LIS1 synthesized in vitro has a molecular mass of almost twice the molecular mass predicted from its amino acid sequence. These results suggested that LIS1 might be a dimer (24Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our preliminary physical data suggested that NUDF might also be a dimer, as it sedimented faster from crude extracts of A. nidulans than expected from its calculated molecular mass of 49 kDa (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the purification of NUDF and its characterization as a homodimer. We then provide evidence that NUDF functions as a dimer in the living cell by showing that dimer formation is required for NUDF to mediate normal growth and nuclear migration. A DNA sequence encoding a 15-amino acid S-tag peptide (Novagen) from the small subtilisin fragment of RNase A was added to the 3′-end of the coding region of the nudF gene. The nudF cDNA and its 3′-untranslated region were used as templates in PCR1 reactions using the following primer sets: 5′-CCGCTCTAGATCACATCGCTCGCATCCG-3′ (P1) and 5′-CTGCTGTCCATGTGCTGGCGTTCGAATTTAGCAGCAGCGGTTTCTTTGAACACCCGTACAGAGT-3′ (P2), 5′-CAAAGAAACCGCTGCTGCTAAATTCGAACGCCAGCACATGGACAGCAGCTAAGTCGCGATCTTC-3′ (P3) and 5′-CCCCGGTACCCCTTGAGAACCTCAGATTTAG-3′ (P4). P1 and P2 (carrying the S-tag sequence) were used to add the S-tag to the 3′-end of the nudF coding region, and P3 (carrying the S-tag sequence) and P4 were used to introduce the S-tag at the 5′-end of the 900-nucleotide downstream sequence. The two PCR products were then annealed to be used as template in a second PCR reaction with P1 and P4. The second PCR product was cloned into theXbaI-KpnI sites of a vector pRG to generate a plasmid pCA1 containing the truncated nudF-S-tag, the DNA sequence of which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pCA1 was transformed into competent nudF6 mutant cells (XX20) and integrated into the chromosomal nudF gene. A transformant complementing thenudF6 and pyrG89 mutations was selected on plates lacking uracil and uridine, then grown on a medium containing fluoroorotic acid to remove the DNA carrying thenudF6 mutation and the pyr4 gene. The final strain (named CA1) with the S-tagged nudF(nudF-S) gene incorporated into the normal nudFchromosomal locus was confirmed by PCR reactions using the template of the extracted chromosomal DNA with the primer corresponding to 5′-untranslated region and the P2, P3, and P4 primers. A strain in which nudF-S was put under the control of the inducible alcA promoter (26Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) on a high copy number plasmid was constructed as follows: a SphI-BamHI DNA fragment containing the alcA promoter and the 5′-end of the coding region of nudF gene was cloned into theSphI-BamHI site of pCA1 to make a new plasmid pCA2. The promoter, the coding and 3′-downstream region ofnudF (a SphI-EcoRI fragment) from pCA2, was then cloned into the SphI-SmaI site of a multicopy plasmid pAID. The resulting plasmid, named pAAFS, was then transformed into the CA1 strain. Three transformants were cultured in minimal medium containing methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and the expression levels of NUDF-S protein were examined on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels without a stacking gel followed by Western blotting. The transformant that expressed the highest level of NUDF-S was selected and named CA1[pAAFS]. A 0.7-kb DNA sequence containing the S-tag, a stop codon, and the nudF 3′-untranslated region was made by a PCR reaction using pCA1 as a template. This 0.7-kb fragment was cloned between the MunI and BamHI sites of pAAFS (within the coding region of the nudF gene) to produce pAATFS1. To produce the S-tagged C-terminal fragment, a 0.5-kb DNA fragment containing the alcA promoter, the nudF5′-untranslated region, and the start codon (both ends carrySphI and MunI sites) was made by PCR using pCA2 as a template. 0.8 kb of DNA between SphI andMunI sites of pAAFS was replaced by the 0.5-kb PCR fragment to generate pAATFS2. To introduce mutagenized DNA bases in the region encoding the coiled coil domain of NUDF, PCR reactions were used with the following oligonucleotide sets: TTCGGCCTCTGCATCATTTGCTCTTCTTTGCGCTCGGGCAGCTCCCGTCCATTTTTTCTCCAA (MP1) and AAATGATGCAGAGGCCGAAGCCCGTAGTGCTCAAGCTGAAGCTGAAGCCTCCCCGTCAGCA (MP2), ACTACGGACTTCGGCCTCTTCATCATTTATTCTTCTTTGCAGTCGGGC (MP3) and GAAGAGGCCGAAGTCCGTAGTCTT (MP4), ATAAGTTTGCATGCGGAACC (P5) and GAAGGCGACACGTCTCGGATCC (P6). To make a mutant NUDF in which the amino acids in the “a and d” position of the coiled coil domain were replaced by alanine (Alaa+d), the MP1/P5 and MP2/P6 primer sets were used. The resulting two PCR products were annealed and subjected to a second PCR. The second PCR product was digested withSphI/MunI and used to replace theSphI-MunI DNA fragment of pAAFS to generate pAAMFS1. The MP3/P5 and MP4/P6 primer sets were used to make the mutant NUDF in which amino acid residue 72 in the coiled coil motif was replaced by glutamic acid (L72E). The same procedure was used to generate pAAMFS2. To obtain DNA constructs that overexpress the coiled coil domains carrying the Alaa+d and L72E mutations, the same procedure was used as described above. The 0.7-kb PCR fragment containing the S-tag construct, stop codon, and nudF 3′-untranslated region was cloned between the MunI and BamHI sites of pAAMFS1 (Alaa+d), pAAMFS2 (L72E) to generate pAAMTFS1 and pAAMTFS2, respectively. The S-tagged NUDF protein was purified from CA1 and CA1[pAAFS] by binding to S-protein (the large subtilisin subunit of RNaseA) attached to agarose beads. CA1 cells were grown in YGUU medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% glucose) supplemented with uridine and uracil (0.12% of each) for 18 h at 37 °C. The inducible strain CA1[pAAFS] was grown in YG for 14 h at 37 °C, then switched to fresh medium containing 4 mm glucose, and where appropriate, 50 mm MEK to induce the alcApromoter, and grown for an additional 24 h. This yielded ∼10 g of mycelium/liter. S-tagged NUDF protein was purified from CA1 or CA1[pAAFS] cells by binding to and elution from S-protein-agarose beads. Cells were disrupted by blending with liquid nitrogen for 5 min, then mixed and extracted with 3 volumes of buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 detergent (Sigma)). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The protein extract was either loaded on an S-protein-agarose column, washed with buffer A, and eluted with the same buffer containing the S-tag 15 amino acid peptide at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml or divided into small portions, adsorbed batchwise to the S-protein-agarose, washed with buffer A containing 0.6 m NaCl, and eluted with the same buffer containing the S-tag peptide. The eluted fraction was dialyzed against either buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) or PEM buffer (0.1 mPIPES (pH 6.9), 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol) and, if necessary, concentrated using a 10-kDa cutoff Centricon filter. The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until used. The same method was used to purify the S-tagged NUDF protein domains. The purified NUDF protein was concentrated 10-fold and applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column, which had been equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and calibrated with apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). The column was eluted using the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Aliquots (20 μl) of each fraction were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated S-protein. The density of the NUDF-S protein bands was measured using an ImagemasterTM(Amersham Phamacia Biotech) densitometer. Cross-linking was performed at room temperature in an 11-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 30 ng of the purified NUDF, and 2 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate. The reaction was started by adding a freshly made solution of disuccinimidyl suberate to a reaction mixture containing all other components and, after various times, was stopped by adding ethanolamine to 0.36 m. Cross-linked products were analyzed in a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (with no stacking gel) followed by silver staining. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with an interference optical system and an An-60Ti rotor. The molecular mass of NUDF protein was estimated at 4 °C using short column techniques at four different loading concentrations (0.16, 0.32, 0.4, and 0.48 mg/ml) and at three different rotor speeds: 20,000, 26,000, and 34,000 rpm using the program NONLIN. NUDF was purified to homogeneity by S-protein affinity chromatography using the S-tag/S-protein system (25Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We first made a strain (CA1) in which the wild-type chromosomalnudF gene was replaced by a C-terminally S-taggednudF gene (Fig. 1 A) and demonstrated that this strain grew as well as the wild-type strain, indicating that the S-tagged NUDF protein was functional in vivo (Fig. 1 B). Because only very small amounts of protein could be purified from this strain, we engineered a second strain (CA1[pAAFS]) to overexpress the S-tagged NUDF from a high copy number plasmid. CA1[pAAFS] was grown under inducing conditions, fragmented frozen by grinding in liquid nitrogen, and a cell-free extract was prepared. The S-tagged NUDF protein was then purified to homogeneity in a single step directly from the extract by adsorption to S-protein linked to agarose beads (Novagen), followed by elution with an excess of the S-peptide (Fig. 1 C). Nothing was eluted when the same purification procedure was applied to a wild-type strain that did not contain any S-tagged NUDF protein. We have previously shown by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation that the molecular mass at which wild-type NUDF protein sedimented was greater than its calculated molecular mass (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The protein from crude extracts had an S value consistent with a molecular mass of 120 kDa rather than with the molecular mass of 49 kDa calculated from the sequence (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The purified S-tagged NUDF protein also gave an apparent molecular mass of ∼140 kDa by gel permeation chromatography on Superdex G-200 (Fig. 2, A andB). These data suggested that it might be complexed with another protein(s). However, when the purified S-tagged material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis it gave only a single 50-kDa band (Fig. 1 C), indicating that it was a homopolymer. The molecular mass of LIS1, the mammalian homolog of NUDF, calculated from sedimentation and gel filtration data, is close to that expected for a dimer (24Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This led us to suspect that NUDF might also be a dimer. To determine whether NUDF was a dimer or was a trimer, as suggested by its migration on gel permeation chromatography, we cross-linked the purified S-tagged NUDF protein with disuccinimidyl suberate and analyzed the denatured, cross-linked protein by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The uncross-linked 50-kDa protein band seen at the start of the experiment was converted with time to a broad band migrating at an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa. The amounts of NUDF starting material and of the putative dimer band that was produced were approximately equal, and no aggregated protein was seen in the wells. If NUDF-S were a trimer we would have expected to see an intermediate band representing the dimer appear between the monomer and the 120-kDa band. No such intermediate band was detected, indicating that NUDF is a homodimer. The fact that the dimer gave a broad band is presumably due to the fact that different cross-linking between molecules causes a disperse set of cross-linked dimers that migrate differently on SDS gels after denaturation (Fig.3). The result of the cross-linking experiment was confirmed by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, which showed that the purified NUDF-S protein is a dimer with a monomer molecular mass of 48,154 kDa (±4.78% error) and a dissociation constant of 3.63 × 10−7m (Fig.4). As NUDF protein from crude cell extracts gave the same apparent native molecular mass as the S-tagged protein, we conclude that dimerization is a property of NUDF rather than an effect of the attached S-tag peptide. The fact that both NUDF and LIS1 appear to be dimeric adds an additional structural feature to the previously observed similarities between these proteins. The slower than expected migration of the NUDF dimer by sedimentation and gel permeation chromatography suggests that it is an extended molecule.Figure 3Time course of cross-linking of NUDF with disuccinimidyl suberate.

It seemed likely that this coiled coil region of the protein would be implicated in formation of the NUDF homodimer; however, WD-40 motifs are also believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions. To learn which parts of the molecule are involved in dimer formation, we asked whether overexpression of the coiled coil region or the WD-40 region interferes with NUDF function, whether either of these regions is sufficient to form the dimer, and whether the ability to form a dimer is required for NUDF function. We used a set ofalcA(p)::nudF chimeras to determine whether overexpression of the coiled coil region or the WD-40 region of NUDF affects NUDF function. NUDF is required for normal colony growth of A. nidulans. If formation of a NUDF dimer were required for function, overexpression of the domain of the molecule involved in dimer formation might be expected to act as a dominant negative and to interfere with dimer formation and function sufficiently to inhibit colony growth. We constructed a series of multicopy plasmids with either the whole coding sequence, the coiled coil region (amino acids 1–100), or the WD-40 region (amino acids 99–444) of NUDF under the control of the alcA alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, which is repressed on media containing glucose and up-regulated by growth on alcohols and other inducing agents, e.g. methyl ethyl ketone. We constructed the genes and gene fragments with an S-tag at their C termini, which we used for identification of the proteins by Western blotting and which also facilitated their purification on S-protein beads. The plasmids were then transformed into a wild-type strain (CA1) of A. nidulans, and growth of the strains (transformants) on repression and induction medium was examined. Under repressing conditions there was no effect on growth; the strains carrying either the full-length gene (pAAFS) or the N-terminal fragment (pAATFS1) or the C-terminal fragment (pAATFS2) grew as well as the wild-type strain carrying the vector (pAA) alone (Fig. 5 B). Under inducing conditions there was overexpression of the ectopic genes carried on the plasmids (Fig. 5 C). The colonies carrying either the full-length NUDF protein or the C-terminal fragment had the same area as the control carrying the empty plasmid; however, the area of the colony bearing the N-terminal fragment was diminished by 50% (Fig. 5 B). Since all the proteins overexpressed were labeled with the S-tag, this result also showed that the S-tag had no effect on growth. Neither the N-terminal fragment nor the C-terminal fragment complemented the temperature sensitivity of the nudF6 mutant strain (data not shown). The growth inhibition caused by overexpression of the coiled coil domain was less than expected, but this could be explained if not all the coiled coil fragment achieved the proper conformation to interact with the native NUDF protein or if the WD-40 also made a significant contribution to the interaction between monomers. The preceding experiment indicated that overexpression of the coiled coil region of NUDF had a significant effect on NUDF function as measured by colony growth. This suggested that the overexpressed coiled coil region was either competing with the endogenous coiled coil region on the full-length NUDF molecule and thereby inhibiting dimer formation or that it was interfering with an interaction between NUDF and some other protein whose interaction with NUDF was necessary for normal growth. To determine whether the isolated coiled coil domain of the molecule was able to participate in the dimerization of NUDF, we asked whether the coiled coil region would bind the full-length NUDF protein. We transformed the plasmid bearing the N-terminal fragment (pAATFS1) into a wild-type strain (GR5), overexpressed it by induction on methyl ethyl ketone, and purified it from a cell-free extract of an A. nidulans proteins on S-protein beads (Novagen) as described above for the full-length protein. Note that this strain (GR5) contains the full-length, endogenous, wild-type, non-S-tagged NUDF protein, which is necessary to sustain growth. SDS-PAGE analysis of the material eluted by the S-peptide showed that the N-terminal fragment was purified to homogeneity and one other protein copurified with it, the non-S-tagged, full-length, endogenous NUDF protein. That this protein was indeed NUDF and not another protein of similar molecular mass was verified using an antibody raised against NUDF (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A similar experiment using the C-terminal WD-40 region of NUDF resulted in very little copurification of the endogenous NUDF protein, suggesting that the WD-40 portion of the molecule plays little or no role in NUDF dimer formation (Fig. 6). As there was no NUDF protein seen in the gels of either the overexpressed full-length S-tagged protein or the S-tagged C-terminal fragment, NUDF was clearly binding to the coiled coil domain. This result indicated that the coiled coil domain fragment interacts strongly and specifically with NUDF protein, most probably with the coiled coil region of the full-length, wild-type protein. Interestingly, at least five other proteins that did not copurify with either the full-length protein or the coiled coil fragment bound to the S-tagged C-terminal fragment (Fig. 6). The coiled coil interaction takes place between hydrophobic portions of the interacting coils, specifically between leucines or isoleucines in positions “a” and “d” of the heptamer repeat (Fig. 7). We generated two types of mutations that we thought would interfere with NUDF coiled coil formation. In one, L72E, we replaced the d position leucine 72 in the coiled coil S-tagged fragment by glutamic acid. The strong negative charge repulsion between the opposed glutamic acid residues should destabilize the helix-helix interaction. In the second, Alaa+d, we replaced all the leucines and isoleucines in the a and d positions between amino acids 62 and 83 in the S-tagged coiled coil fragment with alanines. This was expected to have an even larger effect on formation of the coiled coil structure. We then tested the ability of the mutated S-tagged coiled coil fragments to interact with full-length NUDF protein directly. Plasmids containing the mutant coiled coil fragment genes were transformed into A. nidulans(GR5), and their S-tagged protein products were purified on S-protein beads and eluted with S-peptide as above. The amount of full-length NUDF protein that bound to the S-tagged proteins and protein fragments was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8). Even though the mutated fragments were overproduced in relation to the unmutated coiled coil fragment, they pulled down much less of the full-length NUDF protein than the unmutated fragment, and as expected, the Alaa+d fragment pulled down an even smaller amount of NUDF protein than the L72E fragment. This experiment together with the previous experiments suggest strongly that the coiled coil interaction is largely responsible for formation of the NUDF dimer.Figure 8SDS-PAGE of purified S-tagged NUDF native and mutant N-fragments. The top panel shows copurified native (untagged) NUDF, and the bottom panel shows the native protein and the mutant N-fragment. The strains involved were GR5[pAATFS1] (lane 1), GR5[pAAMTFS1] (lane 2), GR5[pAAMTFS2] (lane 3). The cells were grown in YG medium for 14 h followed by an induction medium (YG containing 4 mm glucose and MEK) for 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Presumably NUDF exists in vivo in an equilibrium between the monomer and the dimer forms. Since the coiled coil region is involved in dimer formation, if dimer formation were required for NUDF function, mutations that interfere with the coiled coil interaction might be expected to inhibit growth. Accordingly, we have mutagenized the coiled coil region in ways expected to interfere with dimer formation and have assayed the effect of these mutations on the ability of the mutated proteins to support growth in the absence of endogenous NUDF. Specifically we have asked whether full-length NUDF proteins bearing the Alaa+d and L72E mutations are able to complement the growth defect of the temperature-sensitive nudF6 mutation at restrictive temperature. When transformed into A. nidulansthe wild-type nudF gene fully complemented thenudF6 mutation (Fig. 9). In contrast neither the Alaa+d or the L72E mutantnudF genes were able to reverse the slow growth phenotype ofnudF6. These data suggest strongly that NUDF must be able to form a dimer to function. In this paper we describe the affinity purification of NUDF protein in one step from a crude cell-free extract of A. nidulans. We also show that the purified protein is a dimer. This finding agrees with prior sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments on crude extracts of A. nidulans, which showed that NUDF sediments more rapidly than expected from its predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa (11Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), indicating that dimer formation was not an artifact of purification. It is also consistent with a previous study of LIS1, the mammalian homolog of NUDF, which suggested, but did not demonstrate conclusively, that LIS1 is a dimer (24Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our data show not only that the predicted N-terminal coiled coil domain of NUDF is the primary determinant of dimer formation, but that dimerization is required for NUDF function. The evidence is 3-fold. We have shown that overexpression of the coiled coil region acts as a dominant negative, as would be expected if it interfered with the interaction between NUDF coiled coil domains during dimer formation. This experiment by itself is ambiguous as we cannot rule out the possibility that growth inhibition might result from an interaction between the coiled coil domain and some other protein required for growth. It nevertheless is consistent with the idea that NUDF functions as a dimer in vivo. We have also shown directly that the coiled coil domain is involved in the interaction between the NUDF monomers by demonstrating that it binds tightly to the full-length NUDF protein, whereas the WD-40 region does not. Finally, we have shown that mutations in the coiled coil region, which prevent the coiled coil interaction, fail to complement a temperature-sensitive loss of function nudF mutation. It is possible that preventing the N-terminal domain from forming a coiled coil blocks its interaction with some protein other than NUDF. It seems more likely, however, that the inability of the Alaa+d and L72E mutant proteins to support growth is the result of their inability to form a NUDF dimer. The identification of NUDF as a dimer adds additional support to the idea that NUDF and LIS1 are very similar proteins and strongly suggests that LIS1 may also need to dimerize to function, particularly in light of the evidence suggesting that LIS1 is also a dimer (24Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because LIS1 coimmunoprecipitates with components of dynein and its structure resembles that of the mammalian cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chains, it and NUDF could be variant intermediate chains (22Vallee R.B. Faulkner N.E. Tai C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fact that NUDF is a dimer is consistent with such a role, as there are two copies of the heavy and intermediate chains per cytoplasmic dynein complex. The intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein bind to the N-terminal region of the molecule, and they interact with dynactin (22Vallee R.B. Faulkner N.E. Tai C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that either LIS1 or NUDF interacts directly with the dynein heavy chain.

LFA-1 expression is leukocyte-specific and mediates adhesive interactions between cells. The β2 integrin LFA-1 consists of a common β2 subunit that is noncovalently associated with an αL subunit (1Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5851) Google Scholar). By binding to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, LFA-1 is important in mediating cellular interactions in the immune system such as cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, helper T lymphocyte responses, and leukocyte adhesion (2Krensky A.M.

LFA-1 has to be activated via outside-in or inside-out signals to efficiently bind ICAM-1. Outside-in signaling has been identified by LFA-1 activating antibodies (6Andrew D. Shock A. Ball E. Ortlepp S. Bell J. Robinson M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or immobilized ligands, resulting in cell spreading, rise in intracellular Ca2+ and pH, phosphorylation of proteins, and costimulatory signals (7Wacholtz M.C.

Inside-out signals are initiated upon triggering of specific cell surface molecules, generating intracellular signals that induce a high affinity and/or avidity state of LFA-1 (9Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Both conformational changes (affinity) in the presence of Mg2+ and altered surface distribution of LFA-1 into clusters (avidity) upon Ca2+binding result in strong ligand binding (8Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

Although the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains of LFA-1 are relatively short and do not contain any intrinsic kinase activity, they are important for affinity and avidity regulation. Previous studies have shown that LFA-1 adhesiveness is controlled by the cytoplasmic domain of the β2 subunit, since truncation of the cytoplasmic β2 domain, but not the αL domain, eliminates LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 (12Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1611-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Complete deletion of the β2 cytoplasmic domain results in clustering and spontaneous activation of LFA-1. This constitutively active LFA-1 deletion mutant strongly binds to ICAM-1. The phorbol ester PMA that activates PKC cannot further increase the adhesion to ICAM-1 of this constitutive active LFA-1, in contrast to wild type LFA-1 (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the αL cytoplasmic domain of LFA-1 is involved in post-ligand binding events, since deletion of the cytoplasmic αL domain does not affect binding to ICAM-1 (12Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1611-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Also, cytoskeleton restraints play a crucial role in regulating LFA-1 avidity, since clustering of LFA-1 is induced on resting PBLs after treatment with cytochalasin D (14Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is not the case for β1 integrins, indicating that β2 and β1 integrins differ in their ability to cluster into specialized lipidic membrane microdomains, also termed rafts (15Pande G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Replacement of the β2 cytoplasmic domain for that of β1(αL/β2/β1), creating a chimeric LFA-1 molecule containing a β1 cytoplasmic domain, provided us with additional evidence. The chimeric LFA-1 (αL/β2/β1) showed a clustered cell surface distribution when expressed in the erythroleukemic cell line K562. Furthermore, PMA activation of the chimeric LFA-1 molecule increased the adhesion to ICAM-1. This was in contrast to wild type LFA-1 that, when expressed in K562, is not clustered and is defective for PMA-induced activation (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several regions within the β2 cytoplasmic domain are thought to be important in regulating LFA-1. Alanine substitutions of conserved threonines (TTT) in the β2 cytoplasmic domain reduce ICAM-1 binding, and a serine residue is phosphorylated upon PKC activation by PMA (16Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). There are different consensus sequences known in the β2 cytoplasmic domain that can associate with intercellular components, such as cytohesin-1 (17Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), Rack1 (18Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol.

The observation that, despite their homology, β2 and β1 integrins are differently regulated by inside-out signals, prompted us to identify residues within the β2cytoplasmic domain that are involved in the PMA-induced LFA-1-mediated ligand binding. To this end, we substituted β2 amino acids for those of the β1 cytoplasmic domain that are critical for PMA-induced adhesion in K562 cells. We observed that a single β2/β1 amino acid substitution is sufficient to completely restore the PMA responsiveness by enhancing LFA-1 avidity but not the affinity. In addition, we observed that activation of LFA-1 by PMA is dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangements that seem to be mediated by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SPV-L7 (IgG1), NKI-L15 (IgG2a), and NKI-L16 (IgG2a) reactive with the α-chain of LFA-1 were raised as described previously (20Keizer G.D. Visser W. Vliem M. Figdor C.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1393-1400PubMed Google Scholar). The nonblocking mAb TS2/4 (IgG1) reactive with αL (21Sanchez-Madrid F. Krensky A.M. Ware C.F. Robbins E. Strominger J.L.

Martin P.J. Price T.H. Hansen J.A. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2913-2918PubMed Google Scholar), and mAb KIM185 (IgG1) used to activate β2 integrins (6Andrew D. Shock A. Ball E. Ortlepp S. Bell J. Robinson M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. E. Martz, N. Hogg, J. Harlan, and M. Robinson, respectively. The blocking mAb SAM-1 (IgG1) was directed against the α5-chain of VLA-5 (23Keizer G.D. te Velde A.A. Schwarting R. Figdor C.G. de Vries J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 4.2-kilobases α chain of LFA-1 was cloned in the XbaI site of the pCDM8 vector, which directs expression of αL from the CMV AD169 immediate early promoter (pCDL1). The 3′-end of β2 was cloned as anEcoRI–BglII fragment in the pRc/CMV vector (containing a neomycin resistance gene; Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Within this sequence is a unique ApaI site at position 1980. The C-terminal end was rebuilt from this site using 10 overlapping oligonucleotides and amplification by PCR to obtain the appropriate hybrids. For the β2/β1 chimeric protein, amino acid 752 of β1 cytoplasmic domain was joined to the amino acid 732 of β2. The deletion mutant of LFA-1 was made by truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain from amino acid 724 (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All point mutations in the β1 and β2 cytoplasmic domain were generated by the oligonucleotide-directed pAlter® mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the protocol. The following oligonucleotides were used: L732R-β2, CTGAGCGACCGCCGGGAGTAC; Y735F-β2, CTCCGGGAGTTCAGGCGCTTTG; S756C-β2, CCCCTTTTCAAGTGCGCCACCACGACG; T758V-β2, TTCAAGAGCGCCGTCACGACGGTCATGAAC; F766Y-β2, AACCCCAAGTATGCTGAGAG; R732L-β1, ATAATTCATGACCTAAGGGAGTTTGC. For the deletion mutants, the following oligonucleotides were used: Δ731-β2, CACCTGAGCGACTAACGGGAGTACAGG; Δ732R-β2, TGAGCGACCGCTGAGAGTACAGGC; Δ732L-β2, AGCGACCTCTGAGAGTACAGG. Both double mutants L732R,S756C-β2 and L732R,T758V-β2 were created using L732R-β2 as template and subsequent mutagenesis with the appropriate oligonucleotides for the S756C-β2 and T758V-β2 point mutation. All mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing of the region encoding the cytoplasmic domain. Stable LFA-1-expressing K562 transfectants were established by electroporation of 107cells in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 280 V and 960 microfarads with the wild-type αL (in pCDM8) together with wild type β2 subunit (in pRc/CMV), truncated β2 subunit, chimeric β2 subunit, or point-mutated β2 subunit (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). K562-LFA-1 transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, Scotland), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhitaker, Verviers, Belgium), 1% antibiotics/antimycotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the neomycin analogue, Geneticin (2 mg/ml; Life Technologies Ltd.) was added to the culture medium. The different transfectants were sorted three or more times to obtain a homogeneous population of cells expressing high levels of LFA-1. Positive cells were stained with FITC-conjugated TS2/4 mAb and isolated using a Coulter Epics Elite cell sorter (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Expression of LFA-1 on the transfectants was determined by immunofluorescence. Cells (2 × 105) were incubated (30 min, 4 °C) in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.01% sodium azide (10 mm; Merck) with appropriate dilutions of either an anti-integrin mAb or an isotype-matched control antibody, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured by FACScan analysis (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA). For cell adhesion to ICAM-1, cells were resuspended in TSA (TSM (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2), 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v)) (5 × 106 cells/ml). 50,000 cells were preincubated with or without LFA-1-blocking mAb (20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature in a 96-well V-shaped bottom plate. Carboxylate-modified TransFluoSpheres (488/645 nm, 1.0 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were coated with adhesion ligands (ICAM-1 Fc) as described earlier (24Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand-coated TransFluoSpheres (20 beads/cell) and different integrin stimuli (100 nm PMA (Calbiochem) or 10 μg/ml LFA-1-activating mAb KIM185) were added, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Optionally, cells were pretreated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin D (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C or with 20–100 μg/ml calpeptin (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with TSA and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with FITC-conjugated anti-TS2/4-antibody. The cells were washed with TSA and resuspended in 100 μl of TSA. The LFA-1 transfectants that expressed similar levels of LFA-1, as determined by staining for TS2/4-FITC (minimum 30% of the cells with a mean fluorescence intensity of 70–80), were gated and analyzed for LFA-1-mediated adhesion measured by flow cytometry using the FACScan. Values are depicted as integrin-specific adhesion (i.e. cell adhesion percentage minus cell adhesion percentage in the presence of an integrin-blocking mAb). Transfectants were resuspended in TSA (5 × 106 cells/ml). 50,000 cells were preincubated with or without LFA-1-blocking mAb (20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature in a 96-well V-shaped bottom plate. Different concentrations of purified soluble ICAM-1Fc were added together with medium or the LFA-1-activating mAb KIM185 (15 μg/ml), and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with TSA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Fc-specific antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The cells were washed with TSA and resuspended in 100 μl of TSA. The percentage of positive cells was measured by flow cytometry using the FACScan. Values are depicted as the percentage of positive cells (i.e. cell adhesion percentage minus cell adhesion percentage in the presence of an integrin-blocking mAb). Alternatively, the concentration of soluble ICAM-1Fc that gives half-maximal adhesion (ED50) is depicted. Cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with TS2/4 mAb (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, after which cell surface distribution of integrins was determined by Confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) at 488 nm with a krypton/argon laser (Bio-Rad; model 1000). The CLSM settings were as follows: lens, × 60; gain, 1300; pinhole, 1.5 μm; and magnification, × 2.0. The same instrument settings of the CLSM were used throughout the distinct experiments. LFA-1 is a cell adhesion receptor that is exclusively expressed on leukocytes. Activation of LFA-1 is required for efficient binding to its ligand ICAM-1. The addition of the phorbol ester PMA has been shown to activate LFA-1 on leukocytes (10Rothlein R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1132-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). When wild type LFA-1 is transfected into the erythroleukemic cell line K562 (K562-αL/β2) (Figs. 1 and 2), the β2-activating antibody KIM185 can activate LFA-1 and induce LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1; however, an inside-out activator of LFA-1, such as PMA, cannot activate LFA-1 (Fig.3 A) (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This lack of PMA responsiveness of LFA-1 is not caused by a general defect of intracellular signal molecules, since other endogenous expressed integrins like VLA-5 can be activated by PMA to bind its ligand fibronectin. Our finding that expression of chimeric LFA-1 containing the β1 cytoplasmic domain (αL/β2/β1) can completely restore the PMA responsiveness of LFA-1 in K562 cells prompted us to search for single amino acids that differ between the β1and β2 cytoplasmic domain.Figure 2Expression of LFA-1 on LFA-1-transfected K562 cells. K562 cells transfected with LFA-1 were stained with specific antibodies directed against CD11a (SPV-L7), CD18 (60.3), or an isotype-matching control antibody.

Amino acids of the β2 cytoplasmic domain were substituted for the residues present in the β1 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). K562 cells were transfected with αL-chain together with the β2-chain containing cytoplasmic domains of β1 or β2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression levels of K562 cells transfected with the LFA-1 chimeras and point mutants were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 antibodies (Fig. 2). The mutations in the β2cytoplasmic domain did not affect the α/β heterodimerization based on the expression of α/β heterodimer dependent MHM23 epitope, and immunoprecipitation of LFA-1 from all mutants confirmed that mutant LFA-1 was expressed as α/β heterodimers (data not shown). The capacity of the LFA-1 mutants to adhere to ICAM-1 was determined using an ICAM-1-coated fluorescent bead adhesion assay (24Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of PMA or the LFA-1-activating antibody KIM185 (Fig. 3 B). This adhesion assay allows analysis of only those cells that have similar expression levels of LFA-1. Only cells with a mean fluorescence of 70–80 were analyzed for ICAM-1-coated fluorescent bead binding. All LFA-1 mutants were able to adhere to ICAM-1 for at least 40% when activated by KIM185, indicating that the LFA-1 molecules are functionally expressed on the K562 cells. The level of LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 without any activation is low (<8%) except for the mutant αL/L732R-β2(18%). Mutation of potential tyrosine and serine phosphorylation sites within the β2-chain to β1 residues (αL/Y735F-β2 and αL/S756C-β2) do not restore the PMA responsiveness (Fig. 3 B). The same holds true for the threonine at position 758, which has been reported to be involved in cell spreading, and the phenylalanine at position 766, which affects ligand binding (16Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Of all mutants, only substitution of leucine for the β1 amino acid arginine (αL/L732R-β2) in the DLRE motif of the β2 cytoplasmic domain results in a significant increase in adhesion to ICAM-1 upon PMA stimulation. Since the adhesion of unstimulated αL/L732R-β2 cells is already high (18%), which might facilitate PMA activation, we investigated adhesion to decreasing ICAM-1 concentrations to a level in which the default adhesion of αL/L732R-β2 was similar to that of wild type LFA-1 (Fig. 3 B, inset). At low ICAM-1 concentration, PMA could still enhance the adhesion of mutant αL/L732R-β2, indicating that the PMA responsiveness is truly induced by the point mutation and not by inherent stronger adhesion. In addition, similar as αL/L732R-β2, mutant αL/S756C-β2 has also a default adhesion of 10% but does not respond to PMA. To investigate whether this single mutation is crucial for PMA responsiveness, we mutated in the β2/β1 chimera the arginine present in the DRRE motif of the β1 cytoplasmic domain to a leucine (αL/R732L-β1). However, in mutant αL/R732L-β1, the PMA responsiveness was not abolished, suggesting that this arginine residue within the full β1 cytoplasmic domain is not essential for PMA responsiveness and thus that the PMA activation of β1integrins is differently regulated than β2 integrins. The PMA-induced adhesion of the latter mutant seems somewhat lower than in mutant β2/β1 chimera. However, comparing the relative PMA inducibility between the PMA-responsive mutants demonstrates that there are no significant differences (TableI). Taken together, these results indicate that the created DRRE motif in the β2cytoplasmic domain is essential for PMA-mediated activation of β2 integrin LFA-1.Table IRelative PMA inductionK-αL/β2αL/β2/β1αL/L732R-β2αL/R732L-β1Exp. 1 1-aExp., experiment.1.8 1-bPercentage PMA induction calculated from absolute adhesion values: ((PMA − medium)/(KIM185 − medium)) ∗ 100%.67.366.059.1Exp. 22.236.542.554.8Exp. 34.369.251.253.0Exp. 410.857.444.881.3Exp. 52.257.537.315.5Exp. 611.920.325.035.5Exp. 721.959.735.750.7Exp. 812.149.236.845.5Mean1-cStudent's t test: K-αL/β2 p value < 0.0001.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether the restored PMA responsiveness of the αL/L732R-β2 mutant is due to a change in avidity and/or affinity, we performed confocal microscopy to detect avidity alterations and soluble ICAM-1 binding studies as affinity measurements. Analysis of the LFA-1 cell surface distribution by confocal microscopy shows that substitution of the β2cytoplasmic domain for the β1 domain leads to clustering of LFA-1 on the cell surface (13Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas wild type LFA-1 expressed in K562 cells shows homogeneous distribution of LFA-1 (Fig.4 A). All point mutants in the β2 cytoplasmic domain have a homogeneous LFA-1 distribution (Fig. 4, C and D, and data not shown), with the exception of the PMA-responsive LFA-1 mutant αL/L732R-β2 that exhibits clusters of LFA-1 (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, LFA-1 is clustered in all of the β1 cytoplasmic domain point mutants investigated, whereas the reversed mutation αL/R732L-β1 has a homogeneous LFA-1 distribution (data not shown) despite the fact that the mutant is able to bind to ICAM-1 upon stimulation by PMA. These results suggest that the clustered status of the β2integrin LFA-1 in αL/β2/β1and αL/L732R-β2 may facilitate the PMA responsiveness of LFA-1. Whether also the affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 is altered in the αL/L732R-β2 mutant that responds to PMA, we determined the concentration of soluble ligand (ICAM-1Fc) that yielded half-maximal direct ligand binding activity (ED50). High affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 results in a low concentration of ICAM-1Fc needed to obtain 50% of maximal binding. Strong binding of ICAM-1Fc was observed after stimulation of LFA-1 with the activating mAb KIM185 (TableII). Binding of ICAM-1Fc to the mutants was LFA-1-dependent, since LFA-1-blocking antibodies completely inhibited adhesion (data not shown). When the concentration of ICAM-1Fc that yielded half-maximal binding was calculated, we observed an ED50 of ∼2 μg/ml for soluble ICAM-1Fc binding to LFA-1 of K562-αL/β2, αL/β2/β1, αL/L732R-β2, αL/S756C-β2, and αL/T758V-β1. Mutant αL/Y735F-β2 has a slightly, but not significantly (p = 0.136), lower affinity (ED50 = 4.9 ± 0.14 μg/ml) compared with wild type LFA-1 (ED50 = 3.0 ± 1.53 μg/ml). Activation of αL/L732R-β2 with PMA (ED50 = 6.0 ± 1.63 μg/ml) does not significantly (p = 0.248) increases the affinity compared with unstimulated cells (ED50 = 4.5 ± 2.25 μg/ml) as shown in Fig.3 B (inset). Together, these findings indicate that not affinity but avidity changes are responsible for the PMA responsiveness of mutant αL/L732R-β2 to bind ICAM-1.Table IIAffinity of LFA-1 for soluble ICAM-1K562 transfectantsConcentration soluble ICAM-1FcED502-aHalf-maximum binding.2010210.20.10Mean2-bMean ED50 ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments.S.D.μg/mlμgK-αL/β232.02-cPercentage adhesion to soluble ICAM-1Fc.37.820.216.12.81.61.73.031.53αL/β2/β128.035.817.18.02.11.00.92.531.07αL/L732R-β232.947.730.917.03.73.44.42.501.21αL/Y735F-β227.222.03.61.00.60.81.14.900.14αL/S756C-β225.826.916.010.74.23.03.22.161.06αL/T758V-β224.922.212.94.82.51.92.22.100.36αL/L732R,S756C-β264.268.340.424.35.73.51.11.870.70αL/L732R,T758V-β276.669.429.910.42.71.11.13.321.792-a Half-maximum binding.2-b Mean ED50 ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments.2-c Percentage adhesion to soluble ICAM-1Fc.

Examples include cisplatin, doxorubicin (adriamycin), and specific alkylating agents. We focused on defining the molecular events that link adriamycin to mismatch repair-dependent drug resistance because adriamycin, unlike drugs that covalently modify DNA, can interact reversibly with DNA. We found that adriamycin, nogalamycin, and actinomycin D comprise a class of drugs that reversibly inhibits human mismatch repair in vitro at low micromolar concentrations. The substrate DNA was not covalently modified by adriamycin treatment in a way that prevents repair, and the inhibition was independent of the number of intercalation sites separating the mismatch and the DNA nick used to direct repair, from 10 to 808 base pairs. Over the broad concentration range tested, there was no evidence for recognition of intercalated adriamycin by MutSα as if it were an insertion mismatch. Inhibition apparently results from the ability of the intercalated drug to prevent mismatch binding, shown using a defined mobility shift assay, which occurs at drug concentrations that inhibit repair.

In response to cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) or alkylating agents such asN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine,N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and temezolomide, the tumor suppressor p53 becomes stabilized in MMR proficient but not in MMR-deficient cell lines, implying that there is lesion-dependent communication between MMR and a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (10Anthoney D.A.

It has also been shown that sensitivity to the alkylating agentN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine can exist in the absence of p53 in some cell lines yet still depend on a functional MMR pathway (13Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, mediation of cell cycle arrest or cell death subsequent to cisplatin exposure may involve MMR and the tumor suppressor p73, a p53-independent pathway (14Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). It may be that MMR functions as a “damage sensor” in this respect; it can recognize DNA lesions and initiate a series of events that result in cell cycle arrest and death (15Koi M. Umar A.

Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have argued that such damage sensing may be confined to specific types of lesions rather than operating as a general sensor of damage. Two prominent models have been proposed to explain the connection between the MMR pathway and the cytotoxic effects of specific anticancer drugs. The futile repair model (20Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick Jr., R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12462-12471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karran P. Bignami M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) posits that repeated, failed attempts at removal of DNA lesions can lead to apoptosis. In this model, DNA lesions are recognized and processed by the MMR pathway, but because MMR excises a tract from the newly incorporated strand, damage in the parental strand is not removed. Repeated processing attempts create persistent gaps that may trigger cell cycle arrest or cell death. Alternatively, a more direct signaling pathway could be responsible. Assembly of repair factors at the site of a lesion may trigger events that lead to apoptosis (16Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.H. Longley M.J. Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This could include binding of MutSα (MSH2/MSH6) and MutLα (MLH1/PMS2) at a lesion, perhaps in concert with other proteins, followed by signaling cascades that initiate apoptosis. Both models rely on initial damage recognition by MutSα with a later dependence on other repair and signaling proteins. Mutations that disrupt MutSα or MutLα activity may therefore cause drug resistance because this early component of an apoptotic signaling cascade is absent. The primary role of hMutSα, a heterodimer composed of hMSH2-hMSH6, (23Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

However, band shift experiments performed with purified MutSα and lesion-containing oligonucleotides (17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc.

Rev. 1987; 87: 1153-1181Crossref Scopus (977) Google Scholar) lesion caused by cisplatin is a 1,2-intrastrand cross-link between adjacent purines. MutSα binds this adduct (17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,22Yamada M. O'Regan E. Brown R.

Chem Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). At least one of the cytotoxic modifications caused byN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine,N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and temezolomide (O 6-methylguanine) is both recognized by MutSα (17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and processed by the MMR pathway (12Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although cisplatin and alkylators generate a range of DNA lesions, it appears that the suspected cytotoxic lesions are tightly bound by MutSα (17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), consistent with a requirement for lesion recognition by MutSα for drug-induced apoptosis. The futile repair and direct signaling models both depend on recognition of covalent DNA modifications. However, AD differs from drugs such as cisplatin and DNA alkylators because AD can reversibly bind DNA. Because this is a distinguishing feature among these anticancer drugs, we examined the effect of AD on the MMR pathway with the goal of defining the early steps in the MMR-mediated response to AD. By using an in vitro repair assay for human MMR activity (29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we have found that AD, nogalamycin, and actinomycin D inhibit the correction of DNA mismatches in vitro. We have exploited this assay to distinguish among several possible models that seek to explain how these drugs might interact with MMR to produce a cytotoxic response. All reagents, including those required for the human MMR assay and band shift experiments, were purchased from the Sigma. Stock solutions of daunomycin were prepared in water, whereas AD and actinomycin D were prepared in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and 110 mm KCl (buffer A). Etoposide (100 mm) and m-amsacrine (5 mm) were prepared in 100% Me2SO and working concentrations were made by diluting the Me2SO stock into buffer A. Nogalamycin was dissolved in 75% Me2SO and diluted into buffer A. Whenever Me2SO was used as a solvent, the final concentration did not exceed 2% in the assay, a level that does affect MMR in vitro (data not presented). Concentrations of AD, daunomycin, nogalamycin, actinomycin D, and ethidium bromide were determined spectroscopically using the following extinction coefficients: AD, ε495 = 13,000m−1 in methanol (30Vigevani A., W.M. Klaus F. Doxorubicin: Analytical profiles of drug substances. 9. Academic Press, New York1980Google Scholar); daunomycin, ε480 = 11,500 m−1 in water (31Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3933-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar); nogalamycin, ε258 = 24,755 m−1in water (Merck Index); ethidium bromide, ε480 = 5,600m−1 in water (Sigma); actinomycin D, ε443 = 24,400 m−1 in methanol (Sigma). Stock solutions were stored for short periods at −20 °C. G·T mispaired substrates with a single-strand break placed so that 128 bp intervene reading 5′ → 3′ from the nick were constructed using published protocols (29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 32Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare A·C heteroduplexes with 10, 128, or 808 bp between the mispair and nick, the replicative form of f1MR3 was linearized withXbaI, Sau96I, or HincII, respectively. Strand denaturation, followed by annealing with the appropriate f1MR1 single-strand phage DNA partner, which is complementary except for the mismatch site, generates the A·C mismatch and places the nick at the initial restriction site. All subsequent steps in substrate preparation and purification were as described. HeLa nuclear extract was prepared from cells obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) according to Ref. 29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar. MutSα was purified from HeLa extract as described in Ref. 23Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar.Drosophila DNA type II topoisomerase was a gift from Dr. Tao-hsieh Shih (Duke University) and was isolated as described in Ref.33Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The MMR assay was performed as described (29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Reactions (15 μl) contained 21 fmol of G·T nicked heteroduplex substrate, 45 μg of HeLa extract, 5 mm MgCl2, 110 mm KCl, 1 mm glutathione, 1 mm each of dNTP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 mm ATP. When possible, master mixes were made of all components except the drug under consideration and HeLa extract. To score for repair, the recovered substrates were digested with Bsp106 (1 unit/100 ng of DNA) to linearize the substrate and with HindIII (1 unit/100 ng of DNA) to score for G·T mispairs corrected to AT or XhoI to score A·C corrected to GC, respectively. Repaired molecules are present as bands of 3.1 and 3.3 kb, the products of Bsp106 and HindIII or XhoI digestion. The restricted DNA fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel in 1× (Tris-acetate ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, pH 8.8) for 300 V·h, stained with ethidium bromide and the image captured using a ChemiImager 4000 cooled CCD camera (Alpha Innotech). When agarose gels are presented in figures, the information is given as an inverted image, where the flourescence associated with stained DNA appears as a dark band on a light background. The NIH image software (version 1.62) was used to calculate the relative percentage of bands in a given lane. The MMR assays were carried out exactly as described above, except that the drug of interest and the HeLa extract were added to the side of a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing all the assay reagents and placed on ice. Reactions were initiated by pulse centrifugation to combine the components, briefly mixed by manual agitation, and then placed at 37 °C. Similar results were obtained when the drugs were premixed either with the extract or the assay mixture containing the heteroduplex substrate. Incubations were carried out in the MMR assay buffer described above using 21 fmol of G·T heteroduplex with a nick 128 bp 5′ of the mispair and performed in the presence or absence of 10 μm AD. In the pair of experiments, the DNA substrate and AD were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract as described for the MMR assay (above). In a parallel mock experiment, the HeLa proteins were omitted. After incubating the heteroduplex substrate for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm AD, the mock treated substrates (plus or minus AD) were precipitated from the assay by adding sodium acetate to 0.3 m and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, and the bulk of the AD remained in the supernatant, allowing recovery of the DNA. The precipitated substrates were then washed with absolute ethanol, air dried, and assayed under standard conditions with HeLa nuclear extract to test for the presence of covalent modifications that might inhibit mismatch correction. Band shift experiments were performed using protocols described in Ref. 17Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar. Oligonucleotides of the sequence: 5′-GAATTGCTAGCAAGCTTTCGAGTCTAGAAA-3′ (30-mer oligonucleotide 1), a homoduplex complement (30-mer oligonucleotide 2) and the heteroduplex complement: 5′-TTTCTAGACTCGAGAGCTTGCTAGCAATTC-3′ (30-mer oligonucleotide 3) were synthesized by GENOSYS. The site of the mispair is indicated in bold. Oligonucleotide 1 was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Unincorporated label was removed by size exclusion chromatography using a 0.75-ml Sephadex G25 micro-spin column. Homoduplex and heteroduplex oligonucleotides were made by annealing labeled oligonucleotide 1 with 3 or labeled oligonucleotide 1 with 2, respectively. Oligonucleotides were heated in a solution containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mmEDTA, and 50 mm NaCl for 5 min at 70 °C then allowed to anneal by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. The annealed oligonucleotides were then recovered from a 15% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TAE followed by electroelution into a dialysis membrane. Cold homoduplex competitor was made using the same protocol except that oligonucleotide 1 was not radiolabeled. Band shift experiments were performed with 4 fmol of labeled G·T heteroduplex or AT homoduplex oligonucleotide and 200 fmol of unlabeled AT homoduplex oligonucleotide competitor. Reactions were carried out on ice in a 15-μl volume containing 110 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes·KOH (pH 7.5), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 ng of (400 fmol) purified MutSα, and the duplex oligonucleotides. The drugs tested were diluted into the same buffer and added to the reaction prior to MutSα addition. Once MutSα was introduced into each experiment by pulse centrifugation, reactions were placed on ice for 10 min. After incubation, 1.5 μl of load buffer containing 50% sucrose and 0.05% bromphenol blue in 25 mm Hepes·KOH (pH 7.5) was added to each reaction and then immediately loaded onto a 6% acrylamide minigel (Bio-Rad). Gels were run at 12 V/cm for 15 min, and bands were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat film and Kodak MS intensifying screen. These experiments were also replicated in the presence of 21 fmol of homoduplex F1MR3 closed circular DNA instead of A·T oligonucleotide competitor to ensure that the base content and sequence for AD intercalation were the same between repair and bandshift assays. Our goal in this work was to establish how the anticancer agent AD interacts with the human MMR pathway at the molecular level. The biological basis for this putative interaction derives from the observation that human cells resistant to cisplatin by virtue of the loss of mismatch repair are also cross-resistant to other DNA-interacting drugs, a structurally diverse group that includes AD (10Anthoney D.A. McIlwrath A.J. Gallagher W.M. Edlin A.R. Brown R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1374-1381PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brown R. Hirst G.L. Gallagher W.M. McIlwrath A.J. Margison G.P. van der Zee A.G. Anthoney D.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A direct connection has been established for agents such as cisplatin or specific DNA alkylating agents, because they generate DNA lesions that are recognized by MutSα, the heterodimer primarily responsible for mismatch recognition (23Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, it is less clear how a drug that reversibly intercalates into DNA might trigger a MMR-dependent cytotoxic response. As a first step, we asked whether AD is capable of interfering with the repair of a 6.4-kb circular G·T heteroduplex by HeLa nuclear extract (Fig.1). The MMR assay is based on the nick-directed correction of the G·T heteroduplex, where the substrate DNA is recovered from extracts by SDS treatment, followed by phenol extraction and precipitation (29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Mismatch correction is scored using two restriction enzymes; Bsp106 linearizes all the molecules at a site remote from the mismatch, whereas HindIII scores for nick-directed G·T correction to A·T. DNA bands at 3.1 and 3.3 kb are diagnostic for site-specific mismatch correction. In the absence of digestion with restriction enzymes, the circular DNA was recovered as a high molecular weight species that barely enters the 1% agarose gel (see Fig. 1 at 1 μm AD). This species appears to represent catenated DNA circles, because HeLa nuclear extracts have been shown to catenate relaxed circular DNA into large networks that can be released upon linearization (35Holden J.A. Low R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14491-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimentally, two results strongly support the identification of the high molecular weight species as catenated DNA. First, the putative catenate yields a single, linear product upon digestion with the unique cutter Bsp106 (Fig. 1). Second, treatment of the large molecular weight species with purified type II topoisomerase fromDrosophila (33Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) yields a relaxed circular species that comigrates with the original substrate. 2J. T. Drummond, unpublished data. Third, as described below, the presence of the type II topoisomerase inhibitor adriamycin prevented formation of the high molecular weight species. Three related phenomena were apparent when the MMR assay was performed in the presence of low micromolar concentrations of AD. First, we observed a sharp decline in repair efficiency when AD was present at low micromolar concentrations (Fig. 1, panel I). Second, in the absence of digestion by Bsp106 and HindIII, a majority of the substrate was recovered from the assay as supercoiled molecules at an AD concentration of 8 μm (Fig. 1,panel II). The assignment is based on the facts that the DNA molecule comigrates with supercoiled DNA and that digestion with a restriction enzyme having a unique site yields a linear product. Formation of a supercoiled species requires ligation of the nicked circle into a covalently closed form, and the product is likely to be positively supercoiled because of ligation in the presence of the intercalating drug (36Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 783-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Third, using AD concentrations that inhibit MMR (e.g. 8 or 30 μm), catenated substrate was not observed (Fig. 1, panel II). This indicates that concomitant with MMR inhibition, AD blocked the catenation activity in the nuclear extract. Furthermore, it shows that inhibition occurred prior to the long patch strand excision. If AD had inhibited the strand excision or resynthesis step, a relaxed, gap-containing product would result instead of supercoiled substrate. Correcting mispairs requires the coordinated effort of several independent protein activities prior to strand excision (5Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Multiple steps may therefore be envisioned as sites where AD might interfere with mismatch recognition or processing (Fig.2). We have tested five models that address potential molecular mechanisms for this in vitroinhibition: 1) MutSα may recognize intercalated AD as a frameshift mispair. This could titrate MutSα away from binding legitimate mispairings, represented by G·T or A·C in the case of the in vitro MMR assay. 2) AD could prevent mispair binding, either by interacting directly with MutSα or by intercalation proximal to the mismatch site. 3) AD could cause covalent DNA damage that is capable of sequestering MMR components away from the G·T mispair. 4) Intercalated AD molecules could physically hinder the movement of proteins required for early steps in MMR, such as MutSα, along the DNA contour. 5) AD is known to inhibit type II topoisomerase activity (37Tewey K.M. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Halligan B.D. Liu L.F. Science. 1984; 226: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), which could directly or indirectly impact MMR. In addition to reversibly intercalating into DNA, the anthracycline AD can be reducedin vivo to generate reactive semiquinone species or reduced oxygen radicals capable of damaging or cross-linking DNA strands (reviewed in Ref. 38Arcamone F. Doxorubicin. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). The cytotoxic action of AD has also been correlated with its ability to form DNA cross-links in vivo(39Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although similar reactions were not observed in cell free extracts (39Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether incubation of the substrate DNA with AD produced DNA damage capable of preventing correction of the G·T mispair. Heteroduplex substrate was incubated with AD under conditions identical to the MMR assay, except that HeLa nuclear proteins were absent (see “Materials and Methods”). The DNA substrate was recovered by ethanol precipitation, which lowers the AD concentration to levels undetectable by visible absorbance, well below those having a measurable effect on MMR. Precipitation is not expected to affect covalent DNA modifications or cross-links. We found that the G·T heteroduplex, whether treated with 0 or 10 μm AD and reisolated by precipitation, was repaired with equal efficiency in each case (Fig. 1, panel III). Covalent damage that can block repair in vitro, therefore, is not inflicted on the DNA by AD under the assay conditions in the absence of HeLa proteins. In parallel experiments, concentrated HeLa nuclear nuclear extract was incubated with 5 μm AD in the absence of G·T substrate DNA. This experiment was intended to test the possibility that the extract can reductively activate AD. The mixture was then diluted into a MMR assay containing substrate DNA to achieve an AD concentration below that found to substantially inhibit repair (1.3 μm). Under these conditions, the mismatch was corrected with ef"

To further explore the role of sulfation, hypersulfated LA-LMWH was synthesized (sLA-LMWH). sLA-LMWH is not only a 32-fold more potent inhibitor of intrinsic tenase than LA-LMWH; it also acquires prothrombinase inhibitory activity. A direct correlation between the extent of sulfation of LA-LMWH and its inhibitory activity against intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase is observed. In plasma-based assays of tenase and prothrombinase, sLA-LMWH produces similar prolongation of clotting times in plasma depleted of antithrombin and/or heparin cofactor II as it does in control plasma. In contrast, heparin has no effect in antithrombin-depleted plasma. When the effect of sLA-LMWH on various components of tenase and prothrombinase was examined, its inhibitory activity was found to be cofactor-dependent (factors Va and VIIIa) and phospholipid-independent. These studies reveal that sLA-LMWH acts as a potent antithrombin-independent inhibitor of coagulation by attenuating intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase.

Tissue factor binds factor VII/VIIa (f.VII/VIIa),1 forming the extrinsic tenase complex that activates f.X (1Broze G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). f.Xa generates sufficient thrombin through prothrombinase, the phospholipid membrane-bound complex of f.Xa and f.Va, to induce local aggregation of platelets and activate f.V and f.VIII (2Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). f.Xa generated via extrinsic tenase is insufficient to sustain hemostasis because tissue factor pathway inhibitor rapidly inactivates tissue factor-bound f.VIIa in a f.Xa-dependent fashion (1Broze G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Broze G.J. Miletich J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1886-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, additional f.Xa is generated by intrinsic tenase, the phospholipid membrane-bound complex of f.IXa and f.VIIIa. f.IX can be activated by extrinsic tenase or by f.XIa, generated by thrombin cleavage of f.XI (1Broze G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The critical role of intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase in coagulation makes these enzyme complexes attractive targets for inhibition. Prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase share similar properties, with each complex consisting of a vitamin K-dependent serine protease and a nonproteolytic cofactor protein. The reactions are calcium-dependent and require a negatively charged phospholipid surface for optimal expression of activity (4Mann K.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 229-233Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev.

Surv. Synth. Path. Res. 1984; 3: 219-232PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) act as anticoagulants by activating antithrombin, which inactivates f.Xa and thrombin (8Rosenberg R.D. Bauer K.A. in..in: Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. J. B. Lipincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 837-860Google Scholar). In buffer systems, heparin and LMWH also inhibit intrinsic tenase activity in an antithrombin-independent fashion (9Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Barrow R.T. Healey J.F. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 593-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plasma systems, however, the antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant effects of heparin and LMWH predominate. The purpose of this study was to investigate methods for modifying heparin so as to maximize its antithrombin-independent effects. Starting with a size-restricted LMWH to capitalize on its decreased propensity to bind to plasma proteins, a property that endows it with pharmacokinetic advantage over unfractionated heparin (11Hirsh J. Levine M.N. Blood. 1992; 79: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Weitz J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), LMWH was chemically modified to reduce its affinity for antithrombin 1700-fold (from a Kd value of 25 nm to 43 μm) by periodate oxidation (13Weitz J.I. Young E. Johnston M. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like LMWH, this low affinity LMWH (LA-LMWH), which we termed Vasoflux, inhibited intrinsic tenase but had no effect on prothrombinase, thereby confirming that its ability to inhibit intrinsic tenase is not dependent on its affinity for antithrombin. When LA-LMWH was N-desulfated, however, most of its activity was lost, suggesting that its ability to inhibit intrinsic tenase is charge-dependent. To explore this possibility, LA-LMWH was progressively hypersulfated, and the inhibitory activities of these hypersulfated LA-LMWH (sLA-LMWH) compounds against intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase were examined. Herein, we demonstrate that upon sulfation, LA-LMWH becomes a more potent inhibitor of intrinsic tenase and acquires the ability to inhibit prothrombinase. Human f.V, f.Va, and f.IXa were obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT), whereas f.X, f.Xa, prothrombin, and α-thrombin were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant f.VIII (Kogenate) was from Bayer Inc. (Etobicoke, Canada). Albumin-free plasma-derived f.VIII, a gift from Dr. E. Saenko (Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD), was used in some experiments. The purity of f.V and f.VIII preparations were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207500) Google Scholar). l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (Type III-E from egg yolk),l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (from bovine brain), tosyl-d-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (tGPR-pNA), bovine cephalin, and dextran sulfate (molecular weight average 5000; catalogue number D7037) were obtained from Sigma.

S-2444 (l-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide-hydrochloride) and S-2222 (N-benzoyl-l-isoleucyl-l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride) were obtained from Chromogenix A.B. (Molndal, Sweden). Pefachrom-IXa (CH3SO2-d-CHG-Gly-Arg-p-nitoranilide hydrochloride) was obtained from Pentapharm Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) was purchased from Aldrich. Unilamellar phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine (PCPS; 75%/25%, w/w) vesicles were prepared using a modification of the methods of Barenholz et al. (15Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and others (16Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and assayed using an inorganic phosphate assay (17Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; VIII: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). For glycosaminoglycans, unfractionated grade 1 sodium heparin (184 units/mg) from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Sigma, whereas the LMWH enoxaparin was from Rhône-Poulenc-Rorer Canada (Montreal, Canada). A series of low affinity low molecular weight heparins (LA-LMWH) and hypersulfated LA-LMWH derivatives (sLA-LMWH) were used in this study (see Table I). A LMWH fraction (mean molecular weight 5000) was prepared from unfractionated heparin by nitrous acid depolymerization, and its affinity for antithrombin was reduced by sodium periodate oxidation, as previously described (13Weitz J.I. Young E. Johnston M. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resultant LA-LMWH was subjected to ultrafiltration using a 3000-Da cut-off membrane and lyophilized. The LA-LMWH was O-sulfated using a modification of the method described by Nagasawa et al. (18Nagasawa K. Uchiyama H. Wajima N. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 158: 183-190Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 mg of LA-LMWH dissolved in 5 ml of water was converted into acid form by ion exchange at 0 °C. After neutralization with tributylamine and lyophilization, the sample was dissolved in 20 ml of dry N,N-dimethylformamide. With constant stirring, 2 g of trimethylamine sulfur trioxide was added, and the mixture was incubated for varying times and temperatures to obtain the hypersulfated LA-LMWH derivatives (sLA-LMWH) listed in Table I. At the end of each reaction, 50 ml of double distilled water was added, and the solution was dialyzed three times (12 h each) against 1000 ml of 5% NaCl and then three times against 1000 ml of double distilled water. After lyophilization, each sample was subjected to elemental analysis, and the number of sulfate residues/disaccharide was calculated based on the percentage of carbon relative to sulfur. Five sLA-LMWH derivatives were prepared and are designated sLA-LMWH-S1 to -S5. LA-LMWH was N-desulfated (N-DS-LA-LMWH) using the solvolytic desulfation method described by Inoue and Nagasawa (19Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Table IInfluence of variably sulfated LA-LMWH derivatives on intrinsic tenase and prothrombinaseCompoundSulfates per disaccharideIC50ProthrombinaseIntrinsic tenaseμg/mlN-Desulfated LMWH1.7>1000166 ± 25LMWH (Enoxaparin)2.3>100013.2 ± 7LA-LMWH2.4>100016.3 ± 6sLA-LMWH-S12.4560 ± 227 ± 3sLA-LMWH-S22.8550 ± 1484 ± 1sLA-LMWH-S33.0250 ± 404.25 ± 2sLA-LMWH-S43.879 ± 110.25 ± 0.1sLA-LMWH-S53.930 ± 160.47 ± 0.2The series of LA-LMWH derivatives used in this study are listed.

To examine the effects of glycosaminoglycans on the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex, the rate of thrombin generation was assayed using a modification of the method of Barrow et al. (9Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol (TSP buffer). Two times concentrated stock solution A was made in TSP buffer so as to give final reaction concentrations of 24 μm PCPS vesicles, 0.24 nm f.Va, 1.2 μm prothrombin, and 4 mm CaCl2. 50 μl of stock A was mixed with 30 μl of TSP and 10 μl of glycosaminoglycan at final concentrations ranging from 1–1000 μg/ml. Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μl of 1 nm f.Xa. Control samples lacking glycosaminoglycan were run in parallel. 10-μl aliquots were removed at 30-s intervals into the wells of a 96-well microtitre plate containing 10 μl of 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, to quench the activation reaction. At the end of the time course, the activity of thrombin in each well was determined by adding 190 μl of 200 μm tGPR-pNA containing 0.1 mg/ml polybrene. Chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm at 10-s intervals for 5 min at 23 °C in a Spectramax 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The effects of glycosaminoglycans on the activity of intrinsic tenase were determined in a similar fashion. Two times concentrated stock B was prepared so as to contain final reaction concentrations of 300 nm f.X, 4 mmCaCl2, 24 μm PCPS, 4 nm f.IXa, and 0.4 nm f.VIII. f.VIII was activated to f.VIIIa in stock B by incubation with 10 nm thrombin for 1 min. 50 μl of stock B was mixed with 30 μl of TSP containing glycosaminoglycan at final concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 μg/ml. Reactions in each well were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 8 nmf.IXa, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at 30-s intervals as described above. f.Xa activity was assayed using S-2222 or Chromozym.X. Individual components of the prothrombinase complex were systematically removed or substituted to examine their susceptibility to inhibition by sLA-LMWH. In all cases, the rate of prothrombin activation was examined in the absence or presence of sLA-LMWH-S5 (S5), the most potent of the sLA-LMWH derivatives. The final reactant conditions were as follows: (a) absence of f.Va (1.2 μm prothrombin, 100 nm f.Xa, 24 μm PCPS, and 4 mm CaCl2), (b) absence of phospholipid (1.2 μmprothrombin, 4 mm CaCl2, 12 nmf.Va, and 10 nm f.Xa), (c) absence of cofactor, phospholipid, and calcium (1.2 μm prothrombin and 100 nm f.Xa), (d) substitution of f.Va with f.V (1.2 μm prothrombin, 4 mm CaCl2, 24 μm PCPS, 8 nm f.V, and 0.2 nmf.Xa), and (e) chromogenic activity of f.Xa (1 nm f.Xa and 200 μm S-2222). Assays were performed as described above except for reactions with conditions b and c. Because the rate of generation of thrombin in these systems was slow, even with increased reactant concentrations, subsampling was performed at 15- and 30-min intervals, respectively. In an analogous series of assays, the effect of S5 on various components of intrinsic tenase also was examined. The final reactant conditions were as follows: (a) absence of cofactor (4 mm CaCl2, 400 nm f.X, 24 μm PCPS, and 1 μm f.IXa), (b) absence of phospholipid (4 mm CaCl2, 300 nm f.X, 16 nm f.VIIIa, and 1 μmf.IXa), (c) absence of phospholipid and cofactor (4 mm CaCl2, 400 nm f.X, and 1 μm f.IXa), (d) substitution of f.VIIIa with f.VIII (4 mm CaCl2, 300 nm f.X, 24 μm PCPS, 16 nm f.IXa, and 20 nmf.VIII), and (e) chromogenic activity of f.IXa (0.1 μm f.IXa with 1 mm Pefa-IXa in the presence of 30% ethylene glycol). Rates of chromogenic substrate cleavage were obtained from the slope of the linear portion of theA405 versus time plot. Standard curves of thrombin or f.Xa activity, with the respective chromogenic substrate, were used to convert slopes to enzyme concentration. The rates of activation were calculated by linear regression analysis of thrombin or factor Xa concentration versus time (Quattro Pro, version 5.0, Borland International Inc. Scott's Valley, CA). Comparison with control reactions performed in the absence of glycosaminoglycan, run in parallel, gave a rate relative to the control. The concentration of glycosaminoglycan that produced 50% inhibition of the f.X or prothrombin activation rate (IC50) was calculated to compare the different glycosaminoglycans. All reactions were performed in duplicate and means from three to six experiments were calculated for each analysis. Glycosaminoglycan was added to 50-μl aliquots of control plasma, plasma immunodepleted of antithrombin, or plasma immunodepleted of both antithrombin and heparin cofactor II (Affinity Biologicals Inc., Hamilton, Canada). 50 μl of Thrombosil (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) was added, and the sample was incubated for 5 min. Clotting was initiated with 50 μl of 20 mm CaCl2, and the time to clot formation was determined on a ST4 coagulometer (Stago Diagnostica, Parsippany, NJ). 100 μl of 1 nm f.Xa in 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% cephalin, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.8 was added to 50 μl of plasma containing varying concentrations of glycosaminoglycan, and the time for clot formation was monitored using an ACL 30000 centrifugal coagulation analyzer (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Assays were performed in normal plasma, plasma immunodepleted of antithrombin, or plasma immunodepleted of both antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. Fluorescein labeling was performed by incubating 10 mg of S5 with 15 mg of 5′-fluorescein isothiocyante (Sigma) in 2.5 ml of 1.0 m Na2CO3, pH 9.0, for 5 h at 23 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, 1 ml of the supernatant was applied to duplicate PD-10 columns (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), equilibrated with H2O, and eluted with H2O under gravity. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, frozen, and lyophilized. Recovered material was pooled, weighed, and dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TS), to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The affinity of fluorescein-sLA-LMWH-S5 (Fl-S5) for f.IXa and f.Xa was determined by monitoring fluorescence of Fl-S5 upon titration with f.IXa or f.Xa. 50 nm of Fl-S5 in TS containing 2 mm CaCl2 was stirred with a microstirbar in a 1-ml cuvette and maintained at 23 °C with a circulating waterbath. Fluorescence was monitored in an LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) in time drive with λex of 492 nm, λem of 535 nm (slit widths of 5 and 20 nm, respectively), and a 515-nm cut-off filter in the emission beam, as 1–10-μl aliquots of f.IXa or f.Xa were added to the cuvette. Additions were made at 1–2-min intervals, allowing the fluorescence signal to stabilize between additions. At the end of the titration, intensity values were determined from the time drive profiles. The ratio I/Io was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity after each addition (I) by the initial intensity (Io). Plots ofI/Io versus titrant concentration were analyzed by nonlinear regression fit to a binding isotherm equation, which yielded values for Kd and maximal fluorescence change (20Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The affinities of other heparin derivatives for f.IXa and f.Xa were determined in competition experiments by monitoring displacement of Fl-S5 from each enzyme. A solution of 50 nm Fl-S5 and 80 nm f.IXa or 100 nm f.Xa was titrated with unlabeled S5 or LA-LMWH. Using Imax, the change in fluorescence intensity between fully bound and unbound Fl-S5, the corrected intensity values after each addition were used to calculate the concentration of bound fluorescein-S5 (PL1) using I/Imax × [Fl-S5]i, where [Fl-S5]i is the initial concentration of the fluorophore. Likewise, the free enzyme concentration (P) was determined using the equation,Kd × I/(Imax −I), where Kd is the dissociation constant determined above. By the mass action relationship,PL2, the concentration of the unlabeled heparin/enzyme complex, is given by Po −PL1 − P, wherePo is the total concentration of the enzyme. A plot of L2/PL2 versus 1/P has a slope of Ki, the dissociation constant for the unlabeled heparin (L2) with the enzyme. Values for IC50 were calculated based on the means of three to six experiments, each performed in duplicate. Means and standard deviations were determined using Quattro Pro. The correlation between the degree of sulfation of LMWH and mean IC50 values for prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase was determined using a test of rank correlation (Pearson) and by one-way analysis of variance using Minitab (Release 11.11, Minitab Inc., State College, PA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To examine the antithrombin-independent effect of LMWH on intrinsic tenase, a LA-LMWH was prepared as previously described (13Weitz J.I. Young E. Johnston M. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LA-LMWH produced 50% inhibition of the initial velocity of f.X activation (IC50) of 16.3 ± 6.1 μg/ml (Fig.1 A). A commercial LMWH (enoxaparin) with normal antithrombin affinity, inhibited intrinsic tenase with an IC50 value of 13.2 ± 7.7 μg/ml (Table I), a value comparable with the IC50 value of 6 μg/ml reported for LMWH by other investigators (9Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of sulfation of LA-LMWH on inhibition of tenase activity, LA-LMWH was N-desulfated by solvolysis. N-DS-LA-LMWH had 12-fold lower inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 166 ± 25 μg/ml. These findings suggest that the ability of LMWH to inhibit intrinsic tenase is independent of its affinity for antithrombin but dependent on its charge. To further investigate the importance of charge, progressively hypersulfated LA-LMWH derivatives were synthesized, and their inhibitory activity was compared with that of the starting material (Table I). The most highly sulfated LA-LMWH, designated S5, was 32-fold more potent than LA-LMWH, inhibiting intrinsic tenase with an IC50 value of 0.47 ± 0.2 μg/ml. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, increasing the sulfation of LA-LMWH produces a progressive reduction in IC50 values. When a plot of the number of sulfate residues/disaccharide versusIC50 is subjected to regression analysis (not shown), the correlation coefficient is −0.86, a value that on one-way analysis of variance is highly significant (p < 0.001), supporting the concept that the potency of LMWH derivatives is dependent on their degree of sulfation. A dextran sulfate, which contained 3.9 sulfate residues/disaccharide, inhibited intrinsic tenase with an IC50 value of 0.4 μg/ml, a value similar to that of S5. This observation provides further evidence that the extent of sulfation is an important determinant of potency in this system. The inhibitory effect of the series of hypersulfated LA-LMWH derivatives on prothrombinase activity was examined to determine whether increased inhibitory activity against intrinsic tenase conferred inhibitory properties against prothrombinase (Fig. 1 B). At concentrations up to 1000 μg/ml, unfractionated heparin had no effect on prothrombinase function, consistent with the results of Barrowet al. (9Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, neither enoxaparin nor LA-LMWH had inhibitory activity against prothrombinase at these concentrations. In contrast, sLA-LMWH inhibited prothrombinase in a concentration-dependent fashion, and its inhibitory activity increased with progressive sulfation, as reflected by a reduction in IC50 values (Table I). Maximum inhibition was effected by S5, which inhibited prothrombinase with an IC50 value of 30 ± 16 μg/ml. Linear regression analysis of a plot of the number of sulfate residues/disaccharideversus IC50 values yielded a correlation coefficient of −0.92 (not shown), which on one-way analysis of variance was highly significant (p < 0.001). Dextran sulfate inhibited prothrombinase with an IC50 value of 35 μg/ml, further highlighting the importance of sulfation for expression of this activity. The IC50 values against prothrombinase were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for intrinsic tenase, indicating that all of the hypersulfated carbohydrates have greater inhibitory activity against intrinsic tenase than prothrombinase. As the intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase complexes are composed of multiple components, various reactants could serve as targets for modulation by sLA-LMWH. To reveal the susceptible component(s), the influence of S5 on partially reconstituted activation complexes was examined. S5 was used in these experiments because it exhibited the most potent inhibitory effects (Table I). When all components were present, S5 produced dose-dependent inhibition of both intrinsic tenase (Fig. 2) and prothrombinase (Fig. 3). Similar inhibitory effects were evident in assays devoid of phospholipid. Thus, the IC50 values for S5 on intrinsic tenase in the presence or absence of phospholipid were 0.47 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.7 μg/ml, respectively. Comparable IC50 values for inhibitory activity of S5 against prothrombinase also were found in the presence or absence of phospholipid (30 ± 16.3 and 68 ± 22 μg/ml, respectively). In contrast, in systems devoid of cofactor (f.Va/f.VIIIa), S5 had no inhibitory effect, suggesting that S5 interferes with the cofactor activity of f.Va and f.VIIIa in their respective enzyme complexes. S5 also had no inhibitory activity in prothrombinase systems devoid of cofactor and phospholipid or of cofactor, phospholipid, and calcium. For intrinsic tenase, despite increases in reactant concentrations, rates of activation remained slow in a system lacking f.VIIIa and PCPS and were unmeasurable in a system devoid of f.VIIIa, PCPS, and calcium (data not shown). The data obtained in partially reconstituted systems support the concept that the cofactor-enzyme interaction is the predominant target of S5 in both prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase.Figure 3Influence of sLA-LMWH-S5 on fully and partially reconstituted prothrombinase. The influence of varying concentrations of S5 on prothrombin activation was determined in series of reactions where the constituents of prothrombinase were selectively omitted or replaced. The reactions were f.Xa, f.Va, and PCPS (▪), f.Xa, f.V, and PCPS (●) f.Xa and PCPS (♦), f.Xa and f.Va (▾), f.Xa (○), and f.Xa chromogenic activity (▴). Final reactant conditions are given under “Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When f.V or f.VIII was substituted for f.Va or f.VIIIa, an initial lag phase was seen on plots of thrombin or f.Xa generationversus time, reflecting the positive feedback effect of thrombin or f.Xa on f.V or f.VIII activation. When the linear part of the curve was analyzed to give an apparent rate of activation, S5 had a similar inhibitory effect in systems using f.V and f.VIII as it did in those using their activated counterparts, suggesting that S5 has no effect on cofactor activation. The effect of S5 on the chromogenic activity of f.Xa and f.IXa also was examined. The hydrolysis of S-2222 by f.Xa is unaffected by S5. Although S5 produced some inhibition of f.IXa-mediated hydrolysis of Pefa IXa, this assay is of limited value because f.IXa has almost no activity against chromogenic amide substrates (21Brandstetter H.

To begin to explore why S5 has greater activity against intrinsic tenase than prothrombinase, its affinity for f.IXa and f.Xa was determined and compared with that of LA-LMWH, which only has inhibitory activity against intrinsic tenase. Binding affinities were determined from competition experiments where fluorescein-labeled sLA-LMWH-S5 was displaced from f.IXa or f.Xa by unlabeled S5 or LA-LMWH (Fig.4). LA-LMWH displaced Fl-S5 from f.IXa and f.Xa with Ki values of 1000 and"

External application of membrane impermeable [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonatebromide (MTSET) and sodium(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) did not inhibit the transport activity in whole cells. Following reconstitution, however, of RBE-2 transfected cell proteins into proteoliposomes, external application of MTSET and MTSES led to a decrease in transport activity to 42.7 (S.D. = 9.1) and 51% (S.D. = 10.14), respectively. Similar results were obtained also when the rat heart isoform RHE-1 (NCX1.1) or the rat brain isoform RBE-1 (NCX1.4) was expressed. NEM and MTSEA inhibited Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake also in HEK 293 cells expressing RBE-2/C14A/C20S/ C122S/C780S (numbering corresponds to RBE-2), a mutant in which all putative extracellular cysteines were exchanged. To study the accessibility of different cysteines to covalent modification, surface biotinylation of cells expressing the wild type exchanger and its mutants was carried out using 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin. Surface biotinylation revealed immunoreactive protein derived from the wild type Na+-Ca2+ exchanger only if the transfected cells were exposed to the reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. No reduction was needed when the single cysteine mutants of RBE-2, C14A, C20S, and C780S, were expressed. Treatment of the cells expressing these mutants with MTSET before biotinylation, led to a decrease in the amount of exchanger protein that was revealed. No immunoreactive protein was detected when the quadruple mutant RBE-2, C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S, was biotinylated, suggesting that no additional cysteines are accessible directly from the extracellular face of the membrane. Permeabilizing the cells expressing RBE-2/C14A/C20S/ C122S/C780S with streptolysin O resulted in biotinylation of the exchanger protein.

Ward R. Philipson K.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which suggested that ion binding or translocation sites were involved. Yet examination of the effects of different methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents in conjunction with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, which was carried out to study the membrane topology of the dog heart Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1.1 (5Nicoll D.A.

MTSET sometimes stimulated Na+-Ca2+ exchange (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In CCL39 cells expressing the cloned dog cardiac Na+-Ca2+exchanger only MTSET was tested, but it also did not modulate transport activity. (7Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, based on differences in electrophoretic mobility of the dog cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in the presence and absence of reducing reagents and on site-directed mutagenesis, it was suggested (8Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that disulfide bonds form between cysteine 792 and either cysteine 14 or 20 in the extracellular (9Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) N terminus of the protein. The existence of these disulfide bonds could potentially restrict access of different reagents to some residues at the extracellular face of the membrane. The possibility that the oxidation-reduction state of these bonds might differ in the different experimental preparations might explain some of the apparent differences between the various studies using sulfhydryl reagents. In this work, we report that the membrane permeable reagents NEM and MTSEA inhibited Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ influx in HEK 293 cells expressing the cloned rat brain exchangers RBE-1 (NCX1.4) and RBE-2 (NCX1.5) and the rat heart isoform RHE-1 (NCX1.1). As reported previously in oocytes (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu J. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the membrane impermeant reagents MTSET and MTSES also did not inhibit transport activity in HEK 293 cells when applied from the outside. These reagents did, however, inhibit transport activity when proteins derived from cells expressing RBE-1, RBE-2, or RHE-1 were reconstituted into proteoliposomes. We show that in the wild type exchanger the putative external cysteine residues were not directly accessible to covalent modification. Reduction, however, of the protein by Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), or exchange of one of the three cysteine residues Cys-14, Cys-20, and Cys-780 with either alanine or serine, resulted in surface biotinylation with 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MB). Pretreatment of the cells expressing C14A, C20S, or C780S 2The numbering corresponds to the amino acid sequence of RBE-2 (NCX1.5). with MTSET considerably reduced surface biotinylation by MB but did not result in inhibition of the transporter. Permeabilizing the cells expressing a mutant in which all putative extracellular cysteines were exchanged revealed that cysteines facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger are biotinylated by the reagent. The amount of the biotinylated Na+-Ca2+ exchanger was considerably reduced when NEM treatment of cells expressing this mutant preceded biotinylation. Based on these and other results, we suggest that cysteines accessible from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane can be modified covalently by sulfhydryl reagents, which in turn might be responsible for the impaired transport activity. Some of the preliminary results were reported in a previously published abstract (10Ren X. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 54: S34Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK 293 cells and determination of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was done exactly as described (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were preloaded with a solution containing 0.16 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02 m MgCl2, 25 μmnystatin, and 1 mm ouabain for 10 min. The Na+preloading solution was replaced by a solution of identical composition except that it did not contain nystatin. When added, NEM (dissolved in Me2SO) and MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.) (dissolved in H2O) at 10–50× concentrations were added directly to this solution and kept at 25 °C for 30 min. The concentration of Me2SO was kept below 1%, which by itself had no effect on the transport assays. The cells were washed with the same solution (without the sulfhydryl reagents) twice, and [Na+]-dependent45Ca2+ uptake was measured as described (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In some control experiments, the MTS reagents were added to the cells expressing the transporter in buffered choline chloride prior to the Na+ preloading procedure. The change in the ionic composition of the solution in which the reagents were presented to the cells expressing the transporter had no effect on the results. All measurements were done in triplicates, and each experiment was repeated with three to six different preparations of transfected cells. The method of Kunkel (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the different cysteine mutants. Antisense oligonucleotides that contained the desired mutation flanked by about 15 upstream and downstream bases corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the cloned exchanger were used. All of the primers except that which was used to generate C14A also contained a silent mutation to introduce restriction sites for selection of mutants. Insertion of the Flag epitope instead of Asn-9 has been described (9Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Usually a segment of about 600–1000 base pairs containing the desired mutation was excised from the mutant plasmid and subcloned into a vector derived from the parent clone. The entire insert containing the mutation and parts of the vector containing the ligation sites where it was subcloned were sequenced (Dr. Mira Korner, Sequencing Service, Hebrew University). Brain phospholipids in CHCl3 were dried under N2, suspended in 0.2 m NaPi, pH 7.4, and dispersed by sonication to form liposomes. Transfected cells were solubilized in 1% cholate in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the liposomes for 30 min at 37 °C. For confluent transfected cells grown in a 60-mm culture dish (about 0.75 mg of protein), 2.7 mg of brain phospholipds were used. Reconstitution and determination of transport activity was carried out as described (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Barzilai A. Rahamimoff H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of surface membrane proteins of transfected HEK 293 cells in situ was done with 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (Molecular Probes) essentially as described for surface biotinylation with NHS-SS-biotin (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In most of the experiments FN-tagged RBE-2 and its cysteine mutants were used for transfection. Unless otherwise stated, cells from a single well of a 12-well plate were used for surface biotinylation. When pretreatment with MTS reagents preceded biotinylation, a single well of a 6-well plate was used. At the end of the biotinylation reaction, an excess of MB was quenched with PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline also containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 ,1 mm MgCl2) to which 2% β mercaptoethanol was added. Surface biotinylation with NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce, catalog no. 21331), was carried out exactly as described (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), and 0.02 mmleupeptin (Sigma). The SDS concentration was lowered by a 10-fold dilution of the lysate with a solution of identical composition to that used to lyse the cells except that it did not contain SDS loaded on streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and was gently shaken for 4 h at 4 °C. Washing of the beads was done as described (14Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by heating for 10 min at 85 °C with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western analysis was carried out as described below. Permeabilization of HEK 293 cells with streptolysin O (Sigma) was done as described previously (15Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of biotinylated proteins released from streptavidin beads and total cell extracts was carried out by standard procedures (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For analysis of total cell extracts, 40 μg of cell protein derived from the entire contents of a single well of a 12-well plate was used. The transfection of cells used for biotinylation and for detection of total immunoreactive protein was done in parallel. To detect protein derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger AbO-8, a polyclonal antibody directed against a pentadecapeptide, corresponding to the amino acids 649–663 of the rat heart exchanger, was used. (9Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Preparation, testing, and purification of the antibodies was done as described (9Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19120-19127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used to detect antigen-antibody complexes using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fig.1 shows the effects of membrane permeable MTSEA (panel A) and NEM (panel B) on Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake in HEK 293 cells transfected with RBE-2. It can be seen that the inhibition with both reagents is concentration-dependent. Exposure of cells expressing RBE-2 to 2.5 mm MTSEA reduces Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake to about 25% relative to that measured in untreated cells, and 50% inhibition is obtained at about 1 mm MTSEA. A higher concentration of NEM is required to inhibit the transporter. Although the inhibition of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake is detectable already at 0.5 mm NEM and 5 mm NEM reduces Na+ gradient dependent Ca2+ uptake to below 20% relative to that of the untreated cells, 50% inhibition is reached when cells are exposed to 1.65 mm NEM. The inhibition of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake with the membrane permeable reagents is obtained both when the WT exchanger is expressed (black squares in Fig. 1) and when the glycosylation mutant FN-RBE-2, in which the Flag epitope replaces Asn-9, the single glycosylation site of the protein (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (black triangle in Fig. 1 Aand black circle in Fig. 1 B), is expressed. Transport activity of the FN-tagged RBE-2 was similar to the WT exchanger bearing no tag. The membrane impermeant reagents MTSET and MTSES (Fig.2) did not inhibit Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake when added to transfected cells in situ (Fig. 2 A). In some experiments, as reported by Nicoll et al. (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), addition of the reagents led to stimulation of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Because membrane permeable reagents inhibited Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity in whole cells and membrane impermeant reagents applied from the outside did not, we solubilized transfected cell proteins and reconstituted them into proteoliposomes. Fig. 2 B shows the inhibition by 2 mm MTSET and 10 mm MTSES of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in proteoliposomes derived from RBE-2-transfected HEK293 cells. The addition of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm MTSET and 3 and 5 mm MTSES to the reconstituted preparation inhibited Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. However, increasing the concentration of MTSET to 2 mm and above (2–10 mm) and MTSES to 5 mm and above (5–15 mm) did not further increase the extent of inhibition that was reached in each preparation, which was between 40 and 60% relative to the transport activities measured in the absence of the sulfhydryl reagents. Because none of the sulfhydryl reagents had a significant effect on the transport activity of the dog sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1.1 expressed in oocytes (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and because the dog heart isoform has an extra cysteine in position 879 instead of a serine in the corresponding rat isoform, we prepared a mutant of RHE-1, RHE-1/S879C. RHE-1/S879C was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity of this mutant was determined in the absence and in the presence of the sulfhydryl reagents. Inhibition of transport activity was obtained by the membrane permeable reagents NEM and MTSEA added to whole cells from the outside and by MTSET and MTSES only following reconstitution, in a manner similar to the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 for the rat isoforms. To further examine the functional and structural implications that the effects of membrane permeable and impermeable sufhydryl reagents had on the Na+-Ca2 exchanger, we determined the accessibility of the different cysteines to covalent modification. This was done by surface biotinylation of adherent cells expressing the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and some of its cysteine mutants with MB directly or following the permeabilization of these cells in situ with SLO. Biotinylated proteins were isolated from lysed cells on immobilized streptavidin; Western analysis of the proteins released from the beads was carried out to detect the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger or its mutants. To examine whether glycosylation of the exchanger played a role in determination of accessibility of the protein to covalent modification, transfection was carried out both with glycosylated and nonglycosylated (FN-tagged) RBE-2 and its cysteine mutants. As also seen with transport activity (see Figs. 1 and 2), no differences in surface expression were detected between the glycosylated and nonglycosylated exchangers. Fig. 3 A shows the location of the different cysteines. Because the topology of the protein has not been fully established, we based the model in Fig. 3 A on a combination of the hydropathy analysis model and possible changes suggested by the neural network algorithm-based analysis of secondary structure of the protein and experimental data based on immunocytochemistry (9Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We exchanged the 14 cysteines of the rat isofoms of NCX1 with either alanine or serine alone or in different combinations. Each one of the single cysteine mutants was functional. Based on the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we have studied in this work the accessibility of the four putative extracellular cysteines to surface biotinylation by MB. The location of these cysteines is marked by an arrow in Fig.3 A. Fig. 3 B shows the relative transport activities of the different putative extracellular single and multiple cysteine mutants that were generated. It can be seen that although relative transport activities of these mutants varied, all were functional. Fig. 4 shows an immunoblot of surface biotinylated FN-RBE-2 (panel A) and some of its FN-tagged cysteine mutants (panels B and C). Biotinylation was carried out with MB, which botinylates cysteine residues. The amount of “total” immunoreactive protein derived from transfected cell extracts is also shown. It can be seen (Fig. 4 A), that in the surface membrane, only traces of immunoreactive protein were detected when cells expressing the FN-RBE-2 were biotinylated. To examine whether disulfide bonds block the access of the biotinylating reagent MB to extracellular cysteines and thereby prevent the isolation of exchanger protein from FN-RBE-2-transfected cells, we used the reducing agent TCEP. TCEP, unlike dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, can be added together with MB without quenching it (19Shafer D.E. Inman J.K. Lees A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Ruegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7185-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for the reduction of disulfide bonds. The addition of an equimolar concentration (500 μm) of TCEP to the biotinylating reaction mixture led to detection of immunoreactive exchanger protein. The addition of an excess of TCEP (750 μm) over the concentration of MB (500 μm) that was used led to detection of higher amounts of exchanger protein. Biotinylation of cells expressing the single cysteine mutants FN-RBE-2/C14A, FN-RBE-2/C20S, and FN-RBE-2/C780S (Fig. 4 B) resulted in detection of immunoreactive exchanger protein without any reduction. No immunoreactive protein was detected when mutant FN-RBE-2/C122S was biotinylated, although the mutant was functional and protein derived from it was detected in total cell extracts. Fig. 4 C shows the immunoblot derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins that were detected when cells expressing the double mutants FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S and FN-RBE-2/C20S/C122S, the triple mutant FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S, and the quadruple mutant FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S were biotinylated. Immunoreactive protein was revealed when each of these mutants was biotinylated except for the quadruple mutant FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S. Because no immunoreactive exchanger protein was revealed by surface biotinylation of cells expressing FN-RBE-2/C122S (Fig. 4 B) and FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S (Fig. 4 C) with MB and because both mutants exhibited Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake in whole transfected cells (Fig. 3 B), we carried out surface biotinylation of cells expressing these mutants with NHS-SS-biotin. This membrane impermeable reagent covalently labels free amino groups such as N-terminal amines and ε-amino lysines (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that biotinylated protein derived from cells transfected with both RBE-2/C122S and RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S is detected in the surface membrane (lanes A) and not only in total cell extracts (lanes B). The surface expression and total cell expression of exchanger protein derived from RBE-2 is also shown. The addition of MTSET to cells expressing FN-RBE-2 (Fig. 2 A) or its mutants FN-RBE-2/C14A, FN-RBE-2/C20S, FN-RBE-2/C122S, and FN-RBE-2/C780S from the outside (Fig.6 A) did not inhibit Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity; this could result either from insensitivity of the FN-RBE-2 exchanger and the different cysteine mutants to covalent modification by MTSET or the fact that the cysteines were inaccessible to the reagent. To distinguish between these possibilities, we determined the cross-reactivity between MTSET and MB. Cells expressing FN-RBE-2 and the different cysteine mutants were biotinylated directly or incubated first with 5 mmMTSET for 30 min and biotinylated after appropriate washes with PBSCM. Because protein derived from cells expressing FN-RBE-2 was not revealed by biotinylation without reduction (Fig. 4 A), 1 mm TCEP was included in the biotinylating reaction mixture of cells expressing this protein. Fig. 6 B shows the results of these experiments. It can be seen that pretreatment of the cells with MTSET considerably reduced the amount of biotinylated protein that was revealed. suggesting that MTSET and MB bind to the same site. These experiments also suggest that MTSET binds to the remaining cysteine(s) after the mutation of the single cysteine in each mutant, but this binding does not result in inhibition of their transport activity. To determine whether intracellular cysteines are accessible to covalent modification, we expressed mutant FN-RBE-2/RBE-2C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S, in which all the cysteines that could potentially be biotinylated by external addition of the reagent were exchanged. Biotinylation of cells expressing this mutant with MB (Fig. 4 C) did not lead to detection of immunoreactive Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein. Fig. 7 A shows an experiment in which cells expressing FN-RBE-2/RBE-2C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S were permeabilized with SLO and then biotinylated with MB. Following cell lysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) and isolation of the biotinylated proteins on streptavidin beads, Western analysis was carried out. It can be seen, that immunoreactive protein derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger was revealed. Treatment of the cells with either 5 mm MTSEA (not shown) or 5 and 10 mm NEM prior to the biotinylation reduced the amount of biotinylated immunoreactive exchanger protein that was detected. Fig.7 B shows a parallel experiment in which the effect of NEM on the transport activity of this mutant was examined. It can be seen that Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake was reduced when cells expressing the mutant were treated with 5 mm NEM. A similar inhibition was obtained when 2.5 mm MTSEA was added to cells expressing FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122SC780S. In this work we have shown that the transport activity of the rat isoforms of the NCX1 gene expressed in HEK 293 cells is inhibited by membrane permeable sulfhydryl reagents such as NEM and MTSEA applied to adherent cells from the outside and with the membrane impermeable reagents MTSET and MTSES, following reconstitution. We used reconstitution of transfected cell proteins to gain access to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, because this procedure “scrambles” the topology of membrane proteins and at least some of the transporters might assume “inside-out” orientation and undergo covalent modification with membrane impermeable reagents added from the outside. Applying the membrane impermeable sulfhydryl reagents to the reconstituted preparation resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake up to about 2 mm MTSET and 5 mm MTSES. At these concentrations, a 40–60% inhibition of the transport activity was obtained, which did not increase with a further increase in the concentration of the reagents. This finding suggests that in our preparation of the reconstituted proteoliposomes, about half of the transporters have an “inside-out” orientation and only these transporters are amenable to covalent modification by membrane impermeable reagents. When all of the externally accessible cysteines are covalently modified, a further increase in the concentration of the membrane impermeable reagents cannot lead to further inhibition. To study further the effects of sulfhydryl reagents on Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake, we monitored the accessibility of different cysteines of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to covalent modification. This was done by surface biotinylating transfected cells that express the protein with MB and detection of immunoreactive biotinylated Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Our studies show that only traces of immunorective protein derived from the FN-RBE-2 could be revealed by biotinylation with MB directly, although the transporter was functional. This result is puzzling for the following reasons. First, our previous studies indicated that surface-expressed FN-tagged Na+-Ca2+ exchanger of similar transport activity is detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-Flag antibody and also by surface biotinylation with NHS-SS-biotin, which reacts with the free N-terminal and ε-amino lysines (11Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, MB was successfully used to monitor extracellular cysteines in different expression systems and with different transporters (15Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I.

Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Cys-14 and Cys-20 are in the extracellular N terminus of the protein (Fig. 3 A) and should be accessible to surface biotinylation. Fourth, Santacruz-Toloza et al. (8Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggested that, in addition to Cys-14 and Cys-20, Cys-780 also is extracellular and Cys-780 is connected by a disulfide bond to either Cys-14 or Cys-20. Yet, if this disulfide bond alternates between Cys-14 and Cys-20 to Cys-780, one of these three cysteines (or a fraction from each at a time) that is not involved in sulfhydryl bond formation should be free for biotinylation. Because exposure of the cells expressing the transporter to the reducing agent TCEP led to detection of biotinylated immunoreactive RBE-2, it is possible that an additional cysteine might be involved in disulfide bond formation, which together with Cys-14, Cys-20, and Cys-780 prevents free access to the extracellular cysteines. The existence of an additional cysteine that participates in disulfide bond formation is also consistent with the finding that immunoreactive protein was detected without reduction when Cys-14 alone, Cys-20 alone, or Cys-780 alone (Fig. 4 B) was exchanged with either Ala or Ser. From current topological models, cysteine 122 could have been an appropriate candidate to interact with Cys-14 or Cys-20. Yet mutation of this residue alone did not result in detection of immunoreactive protein (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that it was not involved in disulfide bond formation and it was not responsible for blocking the access of the biotinylating reagent to the WT exchanger. The inhibition with membrane permeable reagents persisted also when all of the putative external cysteines were mutated. Taken together with the effects of the membrane impermeable reagents in the reconstituted preparation, our results suggest that covalent modification of intracellular cysteines was involved. Support for this proposal comes from the experiment shown in Fig. 7 in which we incubated cells expressing FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S without and with NEM, permeabilized them with SLO, and then exposed them to MB. Permeabilization of cells expressing FN-RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S before biotinylation resulted in detection of biotinylated immunoreactive protein derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Pretreatment of the cells with NEM led to a considerable decrease in the amount of immunoreactive protein that was revealed. These results suggest that intracellular cysteines are accessible to covalent modification by membrane permeable sulfhydryl reagents. Because these sulfhydryl reagents impair transport activity not only of the WT transporter but also of its RBE-2/C14A/C20S/C122S/C780S mutant, which has no cysteines accessible from the extracellular face of the membrane, we suggest that the covalent modification of intracellular cysteines is responsible for the impaired Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Further studies are required to identify which and how many of the intracellular cysteines are sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagents. We thank Doron Rozenzweig for his assistance with some of the experiments and for preparation of some of the figures and Dr. Arie Dagan for his suggestion to use TCEP."
https://openalex.org/W2082398147,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric member of a family of cystine knot-containing proteins that contain the consensus sequences Cys-X(1)-Gly-X(2)-Cys and Cys-X(3)-Cys. Previously, we characterized the contributions that cystine residues of the hCG subunit cystine knots make in folding, assembly, and bioactivity. Here, we determined the contributions that noncysteine residues make in hCG folding, secretion, and assembly. When the X(1), X(2), and X(3) residues of hCG-alpha and -beta were substituted by swapping their respective cystine knot motifs, the resulting chimeras appeared to fold correctly and were efficiently secreted. However, assembly of the chimeras with their wild type partner was almost completely abrogated. No single amino acid substitution completely accounted for the assembly inhibition, although the X(2) residue made the greatest individual contribution. Analysis by tryptic mapping, high performance liquid chromatography, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that substitution of the central Gly in the Cys-X(1)-Gly-X(2)-Cys sequence of either the alpha- or beta-subunit cystine knot resulted in non-native disulfide bond formation and subunit misfolding. This occurred even when the most conservative change possible (Gly --> Ala) was made. From these studies we conclude that all three X residues within the hCG cystine knots are collectively, but not individually, required for the formation of assembly-competent hCG subunits and that the invariant Gly residue is required for efficient cystine knot formation and subunit folding."

Thus, aPKCs apparently regulate effector proteins at multiple intracellular locations. Mechanisms by which aPKCs are activated and targeted to specific microenvironments are poorly understood. All PKCs have C-terminal catalytic domains and N-terminal pseudosubstrate sites and Cys-rich regions (C1 domains) (1Nishizuka Y.

However, aPKCs do not bind Ca2+, DAG, or phorbol esters (which mimic DAG) and are not activated or translocated by these molecules (19Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Unlike other PKC isoforms, aPKCs escape endosome-mediated degradation when cells are incubated chronically with hormones, DAG analogs, or phorbol esters (19Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J.

Thus, the paradigm of DAG-mediated membrane translocation/activation and subsequent degradation cannot explain targeting and regulation of aPKCs.

Neurosci. 1998; 21: 279-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). PKC3 is (a) the sole aPKC encoded in the C. elegansgenome (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), (b) is activated by phosphatidylserine, and (c) possesses catalytic, pseudosubstrate, and C1 domains that share >55% sequence identity with corresponding regions of PKCs ζ and ι (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ablation of PKC3 function in vivo revealed that this kinase is essential for normal progression of embryogenesis and viability of the organism (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1-cell embryos PKC3 apparently binds with the Par-3 protein at the cell periphery, and this complex (in concert with proteins named Par-1, Par-2, and Par-6) establishes cell polarity, controls asymmetric cell divisions, and determines cell fates (17Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hung T.J. Kemphues K.J. Development. 1999; 126: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms by which PKC3 influences these processes are currently unknown. PKC3 is tightly associated with particulate fractions derived from post-embryonic (larvae and adult) C. elegans. The kinase accumulates at inner apical surfaces of intestinal and pharyngeal cells 2S. L. Wu, D. Hall, and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations.2S. L. Wu, D. Hall, and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. and along the cortical cytoskeleton/plasma membrane border of other cells (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells of larval and adult C. elegans that exhibit polarized enrichment of PKC3 are highly differentiated, nonmitotic, and not destined for apoptosis. Thus, anchored PKC3 in larvae and adult animals evidently subserves functions that differ from those mediated by PKC3 in rapidly dividing embryonic cells. The distinctive DAG independence and constitutive activity of aPKCs, the propensity of aPKCs to engage in protein-protein interactions, and the asymmetric localization of aPKCs in cells in vivo suggest that these kinases are adapted for multiple functions by binding with docking proteins. To verify this concept, it is essential to (a) characterize adapter proteins that avidly bind aPKCs; (b) demonstrate that candidate adapters ligate aPKCs in intact cells and target the bound kinase to a specific location; (c) map domains and individual amino acids in the adapter and cognate aPKCs that govern complex formation; and (d) establish the structural basis for attachment of adapter-bound aPKCs to membranes or cytoskeleton. We now report the discovery and characterization of novel PKC3-docking proteins named C kinase adapter-1 (CKA1) and CKA1S that satisfy criteria elaborated above. We also demonstrate a new role for a conserved, PTB domain in CKA1, ligation of a PKC isoform. A cDNA encoding C. elegans PKC3 was cloned as described previously (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA encoding amino acids 1–233 in PKC3 (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was synthesized via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the yeast “bait” plasmid pAS1-CYH2. The fusion gene encodes a protein in which the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain is linked to the N terminus of the PKC3 regulatory region. AC. elegans cDNA library in the yeast expression plasmid pACT (provided by R. Barstead, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) was screened via the two-hybrid interaction assay (30Fields S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Growth of auxotrophic yeast on medium lacking Trp, His, and Leu and β-galactosidase assays were used to isolate cDNAs encoding PKC3-binding proteins. A novel 1.9-kbp cDNA, which contains an open reading frame for 535 amino acids and a translation termination codon, was selected for detailed characterization. The cDNA insert was excised from recombinant pACT by digestion with XhoI and was cloned in the plasmid pBluescript SKII. This recombinant plasmid was named pCKA. Alignment of the DNA sequence of the 1.9-kbp insert from pCKA with sequences in the C. elegans EST Data Base (DNA Data base of Japan and NCBI/NIH) identified an overlapping partial cDNA (GenBankTM accession number C09238) that contained a 159-bp extension at the 5′ end. Sequences of the 159-bp extension and the 1.9-kbp insert are joined in the DNA sequence reported for cosmid T03D8 in the C. elegans Genome Project (GenBankTM accession number Z92838). A cDNA (clone yk158f8) encoding the 159-bp 5′ extension was provided by Dr. Y. Kohara (Gene Network Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). Further analysis of the sequence of genomic DNA in cosmid T03D8 revealed that yk158f8 cDNA lacked an initiator ATG and 4 additional codons that are predicted to constitute the extreme 5′ end of theCKA1 structural gene. A cDNA that encodes amino acids 1–193 in CKA1 was generated by PCR, using yk158f8 cDNA as a template. The 5′ primer contained a NotI restriction site which preceded codons for predicted amino acids 1–5 (MSASQ) and 22 nts that matched nts 1–22 in yk158f8 cDNA. The 3′ primer sequence corresponded to the inverse complement of nts 387–406 in pCKA (nts 546 to 565 in yk158f8 cDNA) and includes the unique PstI site. The PCR product was cleaved with NotI andPstI and cloned into pCKA, which was cut with the same restriction enzymes. This resulted in assembly of a full-length cDNA (pCKA1) that encodes a protein composed of 593 amino acids. cDNA inserts, including full-length CKA1 cDNA, were sequenced as described previously (31Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using programs provided by the NCBI Server at the National Institutes of Health and the SMART website (32Altschul S.F.

Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated, size-fractionated in a denaturing gel, and transferred to a Nytran membrane as described previously (35Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled cDNA probe was generated by random priming, using the 1.9-kbp CKA cDNA (excised from pCKA) as a template. CKA1 mRNA·32P-cDNA hybrids were detected by autoradiography on XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −75 °C. Complementary DNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase (RT), using 2 μg of C. elegans poly(A)+ RNA as a template (35Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with a 5′ primer (5′-GAATCTAGAGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG- 3′) that contained the spliced leader 1 (SL1) sequence (see “Results”) downstream from anXbaI restriction site. A series of nested 3′ primers corresponded to a variety of proximal and distal portions of the cDNA sequence for the insert in pCKA1. Nucleotides 5–10 of the 3′ primers constituted an XhoI recognition sequence. PCR products were digested with XbaI and XhoI, cloned into the plasmid pBluescript SKII, and sequenced. The same RT-PCR methodology and strategy were employed to synthesize full-length CKA1 cDNA. 35S-Labeled CKA1 and CKA1S were generated by the TNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.) as described previously (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A segment of cDNA encoding amino acids 232–368 of CKA1 was synthesized via PCR and cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-KG as described previously (36Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal.

This placed cDNA encoding the partial CKA1 polypeptide downstream from and in-frame with the 3′ terminus of an inducible glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in the vector. GST-CKA1 fusion polypeptide was produced whenEscherichia coli DH5α was transformed with recombinant pGEX-KG plasmid and then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (37Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested and disrupted as previously reported (35Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble GST-CKA1 (232) protein was purified to near-homogeneity by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (35Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of CKA1-(232–368) fusion protein were injected into rabbits (0.4-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of four booster injections) at Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) at 3-week intervals. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals after the first injection. After antiserum was passed over a column of GST-Sepharose 4B, anti-CKA1 IgGs were affinity-purified on a column of GST-CKA1-(232–368)-Sepharose 4B as described in previous papers (35Land M.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Albumin was used as a standard. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown randomly or synchronously at 20 °C as described previously (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particulate and cytosolic fractions were isolated from L1–L4 larvae and young adultC. elegans as described by Hu and Rubin (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cell line (AV-12) derived from a hamster subcutaneous tumor and LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MDCKII cells were provided by Dr. M. Lisanti, Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 8% CO2 and 92% air. Full-length CKA1 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). This placed the CKA1 cDNA downstream from a strong, constitutively active CMV promoter and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. Cells were transfected with recombinant pRc/CMV plasmid via calcium phosphate precipitation, as described previously (39Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and homogenized in buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 as previously reported (40Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and samples of the supernatant solution (0.3 mg of protein) were incubated with either 10 μl of affinity purified IgG directed against CKA1 or PKC3 (1:5 relative to serum) or 2 μl of preimmune serum for 16 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were collected and washed five times (1 ml per wash) with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Proteins (40 μg) from C. elegans, fractions from transfected cells, or immunoprecipitates were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (37Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BenchMarkerTM prestained proteins (9–182 kDa) (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as standards for estimation of molecular weight values. Western blots, prepared on Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp.), were blocked, incubated with IgGs directed against CKA1 (1:4000) or PKC3 (1:2000) (8Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and washed as described previously (40Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-IgG complexes were visualized by an indirect chemiluminescence procedure (40Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signals were recorded on x-ray film. Transgenic nematodes were created to investigate in vivo activity of theCKA1 gene promoter. A segment of genomic DNA, which includes 1.4 kbp of contiguous 5′-flanking DNA, exon I, intron I, and 51 codons of exon II from the CKA1 structural gene, was synthesized via PCR, using cosmid T03D8 as a template. This 2-kbp genomic DNA insert was cloned into the C. elegans expression vector pPD95.67 (provided by Dr. A. Z. Fire, Carnegie Institute, Baltimore, MD). CKA1 exon II was fused in-frame with DNA encoding a nuclear localization signal and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. C. elegans were transformed by microinjection, selected, fixed, and stained as reported previously (41Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of GFP in nuclei was monitored by capturing fluorescence signals using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope equipped with Nikon 40× NA 1.4 planapo optics and an FITC filter. Deletion mutagenesis was performed on CKA1 cDNA via PCR, as described previously (31Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,42Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For C-terminal deletions, each 5′ primer contained anEcoRI restriction site followed by nts 175–194 of CKA1 cDNA. Each 3′ primer contained a 3′-terminal XhoI site and created a stop codon after the desired C-terminal residue of the truncated protein. The remaining 21 nts in the 3′ primer complement the last 7 codons of the truncated protein. For N-terminal deletions, the 5′ primer had an EcoRI restriction site that preceded 20 nts that encoded residues at the desired N terminus of CKA1. The 3′ primer consisted of the inverse complement of nts 689–707 of CKA1 cDNA preceded by an XhoI restriction site. Product DNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the yeast vector pACT II that was cleaved with same enzymes. The same strategy was used to generate deleted CKA1 cDNAs that were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV. These mutants encoded CKA1 proteins that contained amino acids 45–593, 59–593, or 74–593 (see Fig. 1 C below). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the PTB domain by a PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis protocol (QuickChangeTM kit, Stratagene) using CKA1S/pACT II and CKA1S/pRcCMV as templates. Mutagenesis reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. All CKA1 mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. C. elegans embryos were fixed, permeabilized, washed, and incubated sequentially with affinity purified anti-CKA1 IgGs (1:100), and FITC-tagged goat IgGs directed against ra"

Thus, elucidation of alternative mechanisms that enable aPKCs to encounter and control effector proteins in discrete microenvironments is an important goal. Recent investigations (reviewed in our companion paper (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) suggest that aPKC functions are diversified and specialized via interactions with adapter proteins (6Sanz L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Candidate adapter proteins possess two fundamental features: a tethering domain that ligates an aPKC, and a distinct targeting region that routes the adapter·aPKC complex to intracellular sites enriched in substrate-effector proteins and/or regulatory molecules that modulate phosphotransferase activity. The aPKC “recruitment” model further suggests that systematic characterization of aPKC adapter proteins will ultimately yield novel insights into regulatory properties, substrate specificities, and precise physiological roles of atypical PKCs. The nematode C. elegans is an attractive model system for studies on aPKC adapter proteins. C. elegans physiology is regulated by signaling molecules, mechanisms and pathways that are operative in mammals (21Bargmann C.I. Kaplan J.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 279-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Only one aPKC (PKC3) is encoded by theC. elegans genome (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKC3 is expressed and anchored at all developmental stages (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This Ca2+- and diacylglycerol (DAG)-independent kinase is essential for the progression of embryogenesis, asymmetry in early cell divisions, and overall viability of the organism (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1-cell embryos, ∼25% of PKC3 associates with Par-3, a multi-PDZ domain protein that is crucial for generating intracellular polarity (11Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hung T.J. Kemphues K.J. Development. 1999; 126: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms governing formation of PKC3·Par-3 complexes, the identity of targets for bound PKC3, and the precise biochemical/physiological function of the complex remain to be defined. Association of >90% of PKC3 with cytoskeleton/membranes in embryos indicates that additional adapter proteins are expressed during early phases of C. elegansdevelopment (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In post-embryonic C. elegans, PKC3 accumulates in a highly asymmetric fashion in intestinal, pharyngeal, and other cells (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Polarized enrichment of PKC3 in nondividing cells that will not undergo apoptosis suggests that anchored PKC3 plays distinct roles in terminally differentiated cells. By using knowledge of the established properties of C. elegans PKC3 and reagents derived from PKC3 cDNA and protein (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it should be possible to discover and characterize a cohort of adapter proteins that collectively diversify aPKC functions from birth to death. A yeast two-hybrid interaction screen yielded a unique C. elegans cDNA that encodes two novel PKC3-binding proteins (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These proteins, which were named protein kinase C adapter 1 (CKA1) and CKA1S, are expressed throughout the life span of C. elegans and accumulate near the inner surface of plasma membranesin vivo and in transfected cells (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In highly polarized epithelial cells, CKA1 and CKA1S are differentially targeted to the lateral plasma membrane surface (near tight junctions). CKA1 (593 amino acids) contains a positively charged N-terminal region (residues 1–89) that precedes a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (residues 90–231) and a unique central/C-terminal segment (residues 232–593). The minimal fragment of CKA1 polypeptide that tethers PKC3 corresponds to the intact PTB domain (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis-transfection experiments indicate that the N-terminal region of CKA1 governs routing of the PKC3 adapters to the cell periphery (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two distinct, exceptionally basic clusters of amino acids (residues 11–25 and residues 61–77) seem to play important roles in targeting and anchoring CKA1. The composition and arrangement of amino acids within the clusters generate sequence motifs that resemble classical phosphorylation site domains (PSDs) of the ubiquitous MARCKS protein and MARCKS-related proteins (29Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 30Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilization of an alternative initiation codon in CKA1 mRNA results in the synthesis of CKA1S (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this adapter isoform is identical with residues 45–593 in CKA1. Therefore, CKA1S lacks the first PSD but retains all other structural and functional features of CKA1. Our current model proposes that a PTB domain and PSDs in CKA1/CKA1S collaborate in a novel manner to achieve the targeting, tethering, and functional diversification of an atypical PKC. Structural and biochemical mechanisms that govern the formation, destination, and functions of CKA1·PKC3 complexes are not thoroughly understood. In particular, we lack knowledge of (a) properties of PKC3 that promote interactions with CKA1 and (b) mechanisms by which the CKA1 N-terminal region (including PSDs) routes the adapter protein to the cell periphery. To address these topics, we attempted to answer a series of fundamental questions. (a) What structural features enable PKC3 to engage the CKA1/CKA1S PTB domain? (b) Does PKC3 contain a phosphotyrosine that is essential for formation of a stable complex with CKA1 or CKA1S? (c) Are the adapter proteins candidate substrates (or substrate-effectors) for PKC3 and/or DAG-activated PKCs? (d) Are Ser and Thr residues within the N-terminal regions of CKA1 and CKA1S phosphorylated? (e) If so, what is the functional significance of N-terminal phosphorylation? We now report the results and conclusions from experiments designed to answer the questions posed above. Deletion mutagenesis was performed on PKC3 cDNA via the polymerase chain reaction, as previously described (31Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For N- or C-terminal deletions of the regulatory region of PKC3 (nucleotides 1–699), the 5′ and 3′ ends of cDNAs encoding desired segments of PKC3 were extended withNotI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into the yeast expression vector pAS1. In separate reactions, SpeI and NotI restriction sites were appended at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of cDNAs encoding desired fragments of PKC3. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEBG (33Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). This enabled expression of GST partial PKC3 fusion proteins in hamster AV-12 cells (see “Results and Discussion” for details). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into full-length CKA1 and partial PKC3 polypeptides by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChangeTM kit, Stratagene). Mutagenesis reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Hamster AV-12 cells were grown as described previously (35Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with GST partial PKC3 transgenes (inserted in recombinant pEBG vectors) via calcium phosphate precipitation as reported previously (34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The same methodology was used to introduce wild type and mutant CKA1 and CKA1S transgenes (inserted in recombinant pRc/CMV vectors (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) into AV-12 cells. Stable transfectants were obtained by selection with 1 mg/ml G418 for 14 days (34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AV-12 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding various GST partial PKC3 fusion proteins. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm benzamidine HCl, 100 μg/ml pefabloc, and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. GST-PKC3 proteins (from one 10-cm plate) were isolated and purified by incubation with 35 μl of GSH-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the beads were pelleted (3,000 × g) and washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer. One-third of the beads were mixed with protein (250 μg) extracted from AV-12 cells that were transfected with a CKA1 or CKA1S transgene. Various concentrations (0.05 μm to 2 mm) of peptides (SGGGIDNGAFHEHEI or AHNIFGISGEHGEDG, see “Results and Discussion”) were included at this step in competition binding experiments. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were pelleted at 3,000 × g, and the supernatant solution was removed. Next, the beads were washed 5 times by suspension in 1 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, and centrifugation at 3,000 × g. Bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 25 μl of SDS gel loading buffer, fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis, and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane as described previously (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were probed with anti-CKA1 IgGs, and antigen-IgG complexes were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure as reported previously (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs encoding PSD1 (residues 1–63) and PSD2 (residues 59–108) from CKA1 were synthesized via PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-KG (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). This enabled synthesis in Escherichia coli of two fusion proteins, GST-PSD1 (designated PSD1′) and GST-PSD2 (PSD2′), that contain potential PKC phosphorylation sites. The soluble fusion proteins were purified to near-homogeneity by affinity chromatography as described previously (38Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PKC3 (10 ng, Ref.3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was mixed with various amounts of GST-PSD fusion proteins in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100–200 cpm/pmol), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine). After a 4–6-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 0.2 volume of 5× gel loading buffer and proteins were size-fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis (10% gel) (36Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated PSD1′ and PSD2′ proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled proteins were excised from the gel, and32P radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter.Km and Vmax values for PSD1′ and PSD2′ were calculated from measurements of the rate of incorporation of 32P radioactivity into the fusion proteins (see legend for Fig. 6). Mutant PSD1′ and PSD2′ proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E. coli, purified, and phosphorylated as described above. Descriptions of production and affinity purification of antibodies, yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assays, denaturing electrophoresis, Western immunoblot analysis, DNA sequencing, immunoprecipitations, and immunofluorescence analysis of the intracellular distribution of wild type and mutant CKA1 and CKA1S proteins are provided in the accompanying paper (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). N- and C-terminal boundaries of the segment of PKC3 that engages the PTB domain of CKA1 were mapped by employing deletion mutagenesis in concert with yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assays. Both full-length PKC3 and a large N-terminal fragment of the kinase (residues 1–233, designated PKC3-N233) avidly bound the PTB domain (Fig. 1, A andB). In contrast, a segment of PKC3 that encompasses amino acids 234–597 was not a PTB ligand (data not shown). Thus, the catalytic domain (residues 250–515, Ref. 3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and C-terminal region (residues 516–597) of PKC3 (Fig. 1 C) do not mediate binding with CKA1/CKA1S. Elimination of sequences corresponding to the pseudosubstrate site (residues 109–121), the Cys-rich regulatory region (residues 128–177), and/or the unique N-terminal portion (residues 1–89) of PKC3 failed to disrupt coupling with the CKA1 PTB domain (Fig. 1 A, Δ6, Δ7, Δ9, Δ10, Δ12, andΔ13 and Fig. 1 B, 111–233, 175–233,and 212–233). Only mutations that deleted all or part of a segment of PKC3 bounded by Gly212 and Ile224abolished tethering with the PTB module (Fig. 1 A,Δ8–Δ11 and Fig. 1 B, compare 212–233, 111–227, and 212–224 with175–210 and 111–218). Thus, amino acids within a contiguous 13-residue segment of PKC3 (Fig. 1 D) (3Wu S.L. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) apparently promote formation of adapter protein·PKC3 complexes. Mammalian cells were used to directly and independently test conclusions drawn from assays performed in the yeast two-hybrid system. The expression plasmid pEBG contains a multienzyme cloning site that is preceded by the strong, constitutive elongation factor 1α promoter and a GST gene. This enables expression of GST fusion proteins in transfected cells. Complementary DNAs encoding amino acids 111–218, 111–227, or 111–233 from PKC3 were cloned into the pEBG vector. Each recombinant pEBG construct and a CKA1S transgene were then introduced into hamster AV-12 cells. Transfected cells accumulated similar amounts of each GST partial PKC3 fusion protein (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4) and CKA1S (not shown). PKC3 fusion proteins were isolated and purified from cell extracts by binding with GSH-Sepharose 4B beads. The CKA1S adapter polypeptide (apparent Mr = 64,000) (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was coisolated with partial PKC3 proteins that contain residues 212–227 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). However, GST-PKC3, which lacks amino acids 219–224, and GST alone failed to complex CKA1S (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). If residues 212–224 independently generate a binding site for the CKA1 PTB domain within the intact PKC3 protein, then a 15-mer peptide (designated CBSP for CKA1-BindingSite Peptide) that contains the same sequence of amino acids (210SGGGIDNGAFHEHEI224) might efficiently inhibit formation of PKC3·adapter protein complexes. CBSP proved to be a potent inhibitor of the tethering of PKC3 by CKA1 (apparent Mr = 75,000) and CKA1S (Fig.3, A and B). Binding of PKC3 with the CKA1/CKA1S PTB domain was reduced 90–99% by 50–500 μm CBSP (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, 0.5 μm CBSP blocked sequestration of PKC3 by CKA1/CKA1S by slightly more than 50% relative to a scrambled peptide with the same amino acid composition as residues 210–224 of PKC3 (Fig.3 B). Thus, the CBSP sequence module in PKC3 appears to be necessary and sufficient for tethering the kinase to an adapter-targeting protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to characterize individual amino acids that govern tethering of PKC3 by CKA1/CKA1S. Key results are presented in Fig. 4 A. Substitution of either Ile214, Asn216, or Phe219 with Ala abrogated the ability of PKC3 to bind with CKA1 and CKA1S. Mutation of other residues (as typified by His222 to Ala) had no effect on association of PKC3 with its cognate PTB domain. The data suggest that (a) a 6-residue core region (214IDNGAF219) contains several amino acids that are critical for ligation of PKC3 by a PTB domain, (b) large aliphatic, neutral, and aromatic side chains of Ile214, Asn216, and Phe219 cooperatively produce a binding surface that complements (in part) an apolar surface created by Phe175and Phe221 in CKA1/CKA1S (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and (c) neither Pro nor Tyr are essential for the binding of PKC3 with a PTB domain. The ability of the CBSP module to engage the PTB domain in vivo was tested in competition assays. CKA1 and CKA1S route tethered PKC3 to the periphery of transfected AV-12 cells (45Zhang L. Wu S.-L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10463-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, cotransfection with an additional highly expressed transgene encoding GST partial PKC3 (residues 111–227) protein, elicited dispersion of the full-length aPKC throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.4 C, panel 1). In contrast, neither GST alone nor a mutant GST partial PKC3 (residues 111–227) that contains an Asn216 to Ala substitution affects CKA1-mediated targeting of intact aPKC to the cell surface (Fig. 4 C, panels 2 and 3). Thus Asn216, a critical core component of the CBSP module (Figs. 3 and 4 A), is essential for competitive docking of fusion protein ligand with membrane-associated CKA1 in situ. Results in Fig.4 C strongly support the idea that the CBSP region of PKC3 (initially identified by in vitro binding assays) is a ligand for the CKA1 PTB domain in the context of intact cells. Recent studies prompted a revision of concepts regarding the binding of ligands by PTB domains (25Margolis B. Trends Endocrinol.
