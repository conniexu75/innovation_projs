However, 3D genome structures of single brain cells have not been solved; little is known about the dynamics of single-cell transcriptome and 3D genome after birth. Here, we generated a transcriptome (3,517 cells) and 3D genome (3,646 cells) atlas of the developing mouse cortex and hippocampus by using our high-resolution multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics (MALBAC-DT) and diploid chromatin conformation capture (Dip-C) methods and developing multi-omic analysis pipelines. In adults, 3D genome “structure types” delineate all major cell types, with high correlation between chromatin A/B compartments and gene expression. During development, both transcriptome and 3D genome are extensively transformed in the first post-natal month. In neurons, 3D genome is rewired across scales, correlated with gene expression modules, and independent of sensory experience. Finally, we examine allele-specific structure of imprinted genes, revealing local and chromosome (chr)-wide differences. These findings uncover an unknown dimension of neurodevelopment.

Two intimately related dimensions of the mammalian genome—gene transcription and three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture—are both crucial for the development of nervous systems. The dynamic interplay between cell-type-specific gene expression, chromatin structure, sensory experience, and other factors (e.g., epigenetic marks) underlies our brain’s immense plasticity and functions. Dysregulation of transcription and chromatin structure leads to debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism (Satterstrom et al., 2020Satterstrom F.K. Kosmicki J.A. Wang J. Breen M.S.

Recent progress has been made to characterize transcriptome and 3D genome of the brain; however, existing studies have 3 limitations. First, 3D genome structures of single brain cells have not been resolved. For example, bulk chromatin conformation capture (3C/Hi-C) assays can only measure ensemble-averaged maps of 3D genome. They also lump together the diverse sub-types of neurons (and/or glia), masking cell-type-specific features (Lu et al., 2020Lu L. Liu X. Huang W.K. Giusti-Rodríguez P. Cui J. Zhang S. Xu W. Wen Z.

So far, bulk Hi-C only revealed 3D genome refolding in neurons that are either differentiated in vitro (Bonev et al., 2017Bonev B. Mendelson Cohen N. Szabo Q. Fritsch L. Papadopoulos G.L. Lubling Y.

Single-cell 3C/Hi-C has been achieved in adult human brains (Lee et al., 2019Lee D.S. Luo C. Zhou J. Chandran S. Rivkin A. Bartlett A. Nery J.R. Fitzpatrick C. O’Connor C. Dixon J.R. Ecker J.R.

Second, the post-natal dynamics of single-cell transcriptome has not been comprehensively studied in the mammalian brain. Although transcriptional diversity has been characterized in adult and embryonic brains (Di Bella et al., 2020Di Bella D.J. Habibi E. Yang S.-M. Stickels R.R. Brown J. Yadollahpour P. Chen F.

Furthermore, most of these studies used low-sensitivity methods, detecting few transcripts per cell. Third, no existing methods offer in-depth, integrative analysis of single-cell 3D genome data in conjunction with other omic datasets. For the above-mentioned reasons, existing studies can neither address the true relationship between the brain’s diverse transcriptional cell types and their underlying 3D genome “structure types” nor trace their interplay during development in vivo. Here, we fill in this long-standing technological and knowledge gap. Using our highly sensitive and accurate multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics (MALBAC-DT) method (Chapman et al., 2020Chapman A.R. Lee D.F. Cai W. Ma W. Li X. Sun W. Xie X.S.

Using a streamlined version of our diploid chromatin conformation capture (Dip-C) method (Tan et al., 2018Tan L. Xing D. Chang C.H. Li H. Xie X.S.

Three-dimensional genome structures of single sensory neurons in mouse visual and olfactory systems.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we created a 3D genome atlas, encompassing ∼2,000 single-cell contact maps and ∼800 3D structures from 2 brain regions and 6 time points. We further analyzed 3D genome in the visual cortex of sensory-deprived mice, with ∼1,700 single cells from 5 time points. Finally, we developed multi-omic data visualization and analysis methods. We directly addressed several fundamental questions in developmental biology. On the transcriptome side, we observed a major transformation around post-natal day (P) 14 in all 3 main cell lineages: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In neurons, the primary source of transcriptome variation was 2 developmentally regulated, correlated gene modules. On the 3D genome side, we found that cell-type identity was encoded in the 3D wiring of the genome, because 3D genome structure alone could separate single cells into 13 “structure types.” Between structure types, differential chromatin A/B compartmentalization correlated well with cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed a major 3D genome transformation between P7 and P28 in all 3 cell lineages. The 6 adult neuron sub-types only emerged during this transition; neonatal neurons, in contrast, adopted a more primordial 3D genome state that resembled embryonic neurons and neurons cultured/differentiated in vitro. We gained mechanistic insights into this transformation. We revealed large-scale, neuron-specific radial reconfiguration, which could be linked to global non-CpG DNA methylation (Lister et al., 2013Lister R. Mukamel E.A. Nery J.R. Urich M. Puddifoot C.A.

Biol. 2019; 26: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We also observed local and long-range 3D rewiring of developmental and/or disease-implicated genes and their enhancers. Changes in single-cell chromatin A/B (scA/B) compartments correlated with developmentally regulated gene modules, although many genes displayed discordant or temporally shifted changes in expression and 3D structure. Furthermore, sensory deprivation had little effect on 3D genome in the visual cortex, suggesting that 3D transformation was genetically predetermined. Finally, we report a genome-wide, allele-specific survey of imprinted genes. We found parent-of-origin-specific structure for at least 7 of the 29 known imprinted loci (Perez et al., 2015Perez J.D. Rubinstein N.D. Fernandez D.E. Santoro S.W. Needleman L.A. Ho-Shing O. Choi J.J. Zirlinger M. Chen S.K. Liu J.S. Dulac C. Quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain.eLife. 2015; 4: e07860Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In an extreme case, allelic difference could be seen extending tens of Mbs from the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) locus. We performed MALBAC-DT on 3,517 single cells from the mouse cortex and hippocampus at 7 different ages: P1, P7, P14, P21, P28, P56, and P180 (Figures 1A and 1B , top). Dense sampling ensured weekly resolution in the first post-natal month—a critical period for cognitive plasticity. To minimize stress (Lacar et al., 2016Lacar B. Linker S.B. Jaeger B.N. Krishnaswami S.R. Barron J.J. Kelder M.J.E. Parylak S.L. Paquola A.C.M. Venepally P. Novotny M. et al.Nuclear RNA-seq of single neurons reveals molecular signatures of activation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), cells were rapidly isolated from dissected tissues as individual nuclei (Krishnaswami et al., 2016Krishnaswami S.R. Grindberg R.V.

Protoc. 2016; 11: 499-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (STAR methods). Note that we still referred to them as “cells.” MALBAC-DT allowed us to measure single-cell transcriptome with high sensitivity and accuracy (Chapman et al., 2020Chapman A.R. Lee D.F. Cai W. Ma W. Li X. Sun W. Xie X.S. Correlated Gene Modules Uncovered by Single-Cell Transcriptomics with High Detectability and Accuracy.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.31.892190Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We detected an average of 12.8 k mRNA molecules (also known as unique molecule identifiers [UMIs]; SD = 8.4 k, minimum = 1.7 k, maximum = 49.8 k) and 3.4 k genes (SD = 1.3 k, minimum = 1.0 k, maximum = 7.8 k) per cell. This was an order of magnitude higher than previous studies that probed post-natal cortical development in mice (Kalish et al., 2020Kalish B.T. Barkat T.R. Diel E.E. Zhang E.J. Greenberg M.E.

Chen W. et al.Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding.Science. 2018; 360: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We visualized transcriptional diversity with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Hafemeister and Satija, 2019Hafemeister C. Satija R.

Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data.Cell. 2019; 177: 1888-1902.e1821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar). Cells clearly separated into clusters, each with distinct age and tissue patterns (Figure 1C). We referred to these clusters as “transcriptome types” to distinguish from 3D genome analysis in later sections. Louvain clustering identified 4 major cell types: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and other cells (“microglia, etc.”: microglia and a small number of vascular cells) (Figure 1C, left; Figures 1D and 1E, top), each expressing specific marker genes (Figure S1; Table S1). A fundamental question in developmental biology is to what extent post-natal cells continue to mature in their gene expression profile. This is especially important for neurons in the brain—most of which have become postmitotic at this point, and must last a lifetime. On our UMAP plot, within each major type, cells segregated primarily by age, with the clearest visual distinction between P7 and P14 (Figure 1C, middle). This suggested a major transcriptome transformation after birth. We first examined oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Oligodendrocytes segregated into 3 distinct sub-types: oligodendrocyte progenitors (Pdgfra+), newly formed oligodendrocytes (Tns3+), and mature oligodendrocytes (Mal+) (Figure 1C, left), consistent with previous studies (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J.

Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Starting from a single transcriptome type (oligodendrocyte progenitors) on P1, post-natal development led to the emergence of 2 new types over time: newly formed oligodendrocytes on P7 and mature oligodendrocytes on P21 (Figure 1E, bottom). Similarly, transcriptome transformation in astrocytes led to the emergence of a more mature type (“adult astrocytes”; Gjb6+) on P14 in addition to the neonatal type (Tnc+) (Figure 1E, middle), consistent a previous study (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). We now focus on neurons. Different functional sub-types of neurons, such as excitatory and inhibitory neurons, are known to carry out different computations. Neurons in different brain regions, and/or at different developmental stages, can also exhibit different properties. To investigate the transcriptomic basis of such diversity, we separately analyzed the 2,277 neurons. On the UMAP plot, neurons formed complex clusters according to their ages, brain regions, and functions (Figure 2A). For most sub-types, a prominent age gradient could be seen—usually with the clearest visual separation between P7 and P14 (Figure 2A, second to the right). Louvain clustering classified neurons into 20 transcriptome types (Figure 2A, second to the left; Figure 2B). Here, we merged different developmental stages of the same sub-type when possible, leading to 16 main types and 4 immature types. Among the 16 main types, 8 were excitatory: 4 cortical pyramidal cell types based on their cortical layers (L2/3: Camk2d+; L4: Rorb+; L5: Tshz2+; L6: Tle4+, among which a small sub-cluster of Ctgf+ L6b cells were visible), 2 hippocampal pyramidal cell types of the cornu ammonis (CA) region (CA1: Gm2115+; CA3: Grik4+), hippocampal granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) region (Prox1+), and Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells (Nhlh2+) (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1; Table S1). The other 8 were inhibitory: 5 known interneuron types (SST: Sst+; PV: Pvalb+; VIP: Vip+; LAMP5: Lamp5+ [Tasic et al., 2018Tasic B. Yao Z. Graybuck L.T. Smith K.A. Nguyen T.N. Bertagnolli D. Goldy J.

The remaining 4 types were immature neurons that corresponded to multiple adult types: neonatal cortical L2–L5 pyramidal cells (mostly P1–P7), intermediate cortical L2–L4 pyramidal cells (P14), neonatal hippocampal pyramidal cells (P1–P7), and neonatal SST/PV interneurons (P1–P7) (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1). We used principal-component analysis (PCA) to dissect the distinct sources of cell-to-cell heterogeneity (Figure 2C). Despite neurons’ well-known transcriptional specialization based on functions and regions, the first principal component (PC)—explaining 3.6% of the total variance—corresponded to developmental progression at different ages. By comparison, the next 2 PCs, which distinguished major sub-types (granule and pyramidal cells), explained 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Neurons were positioned along the first PC primarily based on age (Figure 2D). Note that the hippocampus harbored more adult cells on the negative (neonatal) side, partly because of adult neurogenesis of DG granule cells (Figure 2A). Genes underlying transcriptome maturation were identified from PC 1 loadings (Figure 2E; Tables S2 and S3) (Figure 2E). As an independent confirmation, we identified correlated gene modules (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (7397) Google Scholar). The 2 largest modules—termed “neonatal” and “adult”—corresponded well with PC 1 loadings. Among the 3,000 genes in PCA, the 75 genes in the neonatal module ranked between the 1st and the 123rd most negative (mean rank = 44), while the 72 genes in the adult module ranked between the 1st and the 148th most positive (mean rank = 53) (Figure 2E, left; Table S2). A less stringent list from the top 10,000 (rather than 3,000) variable genes yielded 122 genes in the neonatal module and 151 in the adult module (Table S3). We visualized the expression patterns of the 2 modules with their eigengenes (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (7397) Google Scholar). The neonatal eigengene was highly expressed on P1 and P7, sharply declined on P14, and remained low from P21 onward (Figure 2F, top). By contrast, the adult eigengene steadily increased over time until plateauing around P56 (Figure 2F, bottom). The 2 modules therefore represented 2 distinct modes of transcriptome transformation. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (Thomas et al., 2003Thomas P.D. Campbell M.J. Kejariwal A. Mi H. Karlak B. Daverman R. Diemer K. Muruganujan A. Narechania A. PANTHER: a library of protein families and subfamilies indexed by function.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2129-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) revealed enriched gene functions among the 2 modules. Genes in the neonatal modules were enriched in neurogenesis (36 genes; false discovery rate [FDR] = 6 × 10−17), cellular developmental process (43; 4 × 10−13), neuron projection development (22; 7 × 10−13), axon development (17; 8 × 10−12), structural constituent of cytoskeleton (5; 4 × 10−3), and polymeric cytoskeletal fiber (12; 4 × 10−4) (Tables S2 and S3). Neonatal genes included cytoskeleton genes (e.g., Tuba1a/b2a/b2b/b3/b5, Stmn1/2, Syne2), axon guidance molecules (e.g., Gap43, Nrp1, Dpysl3/5, Plxnb1, Sema3c), and transcription factors (e.g., Lhx2, Sox4/11, Tcf4, Nfib, Nrep, Rcor2, Ctnnb1). Some functional enrichments were consistent with a bulk microarray study (Lyckman et al., 2008Lyckman A.W. Horng S. Leamey C.A. Tropea D. Watakabe A. Van Wart A. McCurry C. Yamamori T. Sur M.

https://openalex.org/W3123888857,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are released from most cell types encapsulating specific molecular cargo. Exosomes serve as mediators of cell-to-cell and tissue-to-tissue communications under normal and pathological conditions. It has been shown that exosomes carrying muscle-specific miRNAs, myomiRs, are secreted from skeletal muscle cells in vitro and are elevated in the blood of muscle disease patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the secretion of exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs from skeletal muscle tissues and to assess their role in inter-tissue communication between neighboring skeletal muscles in vivo. We demonstrate, for the first time, that isolated, intact skeletal muscle tissues secrete exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs, miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206. Notably, we show that the sorting of the four myomiRs within exosomes varies between skeletal muscles of different muscle fiber-type composition. miR-133a and miR-133b downregulation in TA muscles caused a reduction of their levels in neighboring skeletal muscles and in serum exosomes. In conclusion, our results reveal that skeletal muscle-derived exosomes encapsulate the four myomiRs, some of which enter the blood, while a portion is used for the local communication between proximal muscle tissues. These findings provide important evidence regarding novel pathways implicated in skeletal muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W3124120955,"Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is characterized by dense stroma that hinders treatment efficacy, with pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) being a major contributor to this stromal barrier and PaCa progression. Activated PSCs release hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) that induce PaCa proliferation, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrate for the first time that the metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), is a potent inhibitor of the PaCa-PSC cross-talk, leading to inhibition of HGF and IGF-1 signaling. NDRG1 also potently reduced the key driver of PaCa metastasis, namely GLI1, leading to reduced PSC-mediated cell migration. The novel clinically trialed anticancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC), which upregulates NDRG1, potently de-sensitized PaCa cells to ligands secreted by activated PSCs. DpC and NDRG1 also inhibited the PaCa-mediated activation of PSCs via inhibition of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. In vivo, DpC markedly reduced PaCa tumor growth and metastasis more avidly than the standard chemotherapy for this disease, gemcitabine. Uniquely, DpC was selectively cytotoxic against PaCa cells, while “re-programming” PSCs to an inactive state, decreasing collagen deposition and desmoplasia. Thus, targeting NDRG1 can effectively break the oncogenic cycle of PaCa-PSC bi-directional cross-talk to overcome PaCa desmoplasia and improve therapeutic outcomes."

PPP2R5D-related disorder is an early childhood onset condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism-spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. The disorder is caused by de novo single nucleotide changes in PPP2R5D, which generate heterozygous dominant missense variants. PPP2R5D is known to encode a B’-type (B’56δ) regulatory subunit of a PP2A-serine/threonine phosphatase. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered in PPP2R5D-related disorder, we used a CRISPR-single-base editor to generate HEK-293 cells in which a single transition (c.1258G>A) was introduced into one allele, precisely recapitulating a clinically relevant E420K variant. Unbiased quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of endogenously expressed proteins revealed heterozygous-dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling. These data combined with orthogonal validation studies revealed a previously unrecognized interaction of PPP2R5D with AKT in human cells, leading to constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling, increased cell size, and uncoordinated cellular growth in E420K-variant cells. Rapamycin reduced cell size and dose-dependently reduced RPS6 phosphorylation in E420K-variant cells, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR1 can suppress both the observed RPS6 hyperphosphorylation and increased cell size. Together, our findings provide a deeper understanding of PPP2R5D and insight into how the E420K-variant alters signaling networks influenced by PPP2R5D. Our comprehensive approach, which combines precise genome editing, isobaric tandem mass tag labeling of peptides generated from endogenously expressed proteins, and concurrent liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS3), also provides a roadmap that can be used to rapidly explore the etiologies of additional genetic disorders.

To date, seven pathogenic variants of PPP2R5D have been reported (Fig. S1A and Table S1). All introduce a variant PPP2R5D protein harboring a single amino acid change in a highly conserved region. The molecular mechanisms that are affected by pathogenic PPP2R5D variants remain to be elucidated. PPP2R5D encodes a B’-type subunit (B’56δ) of the phosphoprotein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. To date, upward of 72 PP2A-holoenzymes has been described. Nearly all are heterotrimeric protein complexes contain one of 18 unique B-type regulatory/targeting proteins and a ubiquitously expressed core dimer (Fig. 1A). The shared dimer is composed of a catalytic subunit (C-subunit) that functions as a serine/threonine protein phosphatase and a structural/scaffolding protein (A-subunit) that tethers the regulatory and catalytic subunits together. The B-subunits provide substrate specificity, affect intracellular localization, and regulate the catalytic activity of holoenzymes (6Virshup D.M. Shenolikar S.

In humans, two genes (PPP2CA and PPP2CB) encode nearly identical catalytic subunits and two genes (PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B) encode highly similar A-subunits. Each of the 18 known B-subunits is encoded by a distinct gene, with additional diversity generated by alternative splicing. After translation, the subunits do not simply coalesce with the core dimer to form a functional enzyme. Rather, holoenzyme biogenesis occurs through poorly characterized assembly and recycling mechanisms that pair a unique B-subunit with the common core dimer through organized and regulated processes (7Janssens V.

However, in a biological setting, individual holoenzymes are likely regulated independently, recognize limited specific substrates, and function in a limited number of intracellular processes (6Virshup D.M.

The challenge before the field is to decipher regulatory mechanisms and biological substrates of the >70 PP2A-holoenzymes. To explore the biological role of PPP2R5D holoenzymes and decipher molecular mechanisms associated with a clinically relevant PPP2R5D variant, we used a CRISPR single base editor to generate HEK-293 cell lines in which a transition (c.1258G>A) introduced the E420K missense variant in PPP2R5D. The E420K variant was chosen for study because it is a reoccurring pathogenic variant (2Shang L. Henderson L.B. Cho M.T. Petrey D.S. Fong C.T. Haude K.M. Shur N. Lundberg J. Hauser N. Carmichael J. Innis J. Schuette J. Wu Y.W. Asaikar S. Pearson M. et al.De novo missense variants in PPP2R5D are associated with intellectual disability, macrocephaly, hypotonia, and autism.Neurogenetics. 2016; 17: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the gene encoding PPP2R5D (PPP2R5D) contains an endogenous protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) ideally suited for single base editing of the target purine with BE4-Gam. Genomic editing allowed for cell-based studies of endogenously expressed proteins, and tandem mass tag (TMT) quantification and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS3) enabled unbiased quantitative global proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of wild-type (WT), E420K-heterozygous, and E420K-homozygous cells. Our studies reveal heterozygous dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling in E420K variant cells, providing a foundation to help decipher the etiology of PPP2R5D-related developmental disorder. To gain insight into how variants in PPP2R5D alter biological processes at a molecular level, we used BE4-Gam, a fourth-generation genomic base editor, to create stable HEK-293 cell lines containing a pathogenic E420K variant (Fig. 1B). To recapitulate the missense variant, we introduced a single base-pair change (c.1258G>A) in only one of the two alleles (Fig. 1C). Base editing was facilitated by a well-positioned endogenous PAM in PPP2R5D and the development of gRNA that positioned the cytidine deaminase precisely over the C:G target (Figs. 1D and S1B) while simultaneously positioning the nCas9 to nick the DNA strand containing the unedited guanine. Nicking the unedited DNA strand favors repair of the edited DNA using the uracil-containing strand as a template by endogenous mismatch repair mechanisms (25Komor A.C. Kim Y.B. Packer M.S. Zuris J.A. Liu D.R. Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage.Nature. 2016; 533: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). The fusion of inhibitors of base excision repair (BER) helps prevent removal of the uracil generated by the deamination of cytidine, which increases efficiency of correct base editing (26Komor A.C. Zhao K.T. Packer M.S. Gaudelli N.M. Waterbury A.L. Koblan L.W. Kim Y.B. Badran A.H. Liu D.R. Improved base excision repair inhibition and bacteriophage Mu Gam protein yields C: G-to-T: A base editors with higher efficiency and product purity.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3eaao4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were single-cell sorted 48 h after transfection to allow time for replication, after which the base edit becomes a permanent change in the genome. By Sanger sequencing, we confirmed the genotype of cell lines containing the desired E420K heterozygous (HET) variant (Fig. 1E). We also developed cells in which the E420K variant was introduced into both alleles (HOMO). To ensure the cell lines were homogeneous, each clonal-derived line was single-cell sorted three times, prior to further analysis (Fig. S1C). Complete genomic sequencing of the parental, E420K HET, and E420K HOMO variant cell lines was performed to characterize the genomic background, detect any off-target editing, and ensure that the repetitive single-cell sorting did not introduce spontaneous somatic mutations. Cell lines with off-target or spontaneous mutations in protein-coding regions were discarded. Having established that the cell lines were homogeneous and contained the desired zygosity of the PPP2R5D c.1258G>A variant allele, we examined the expression and assembly of the endogenously expressed variant protein into a holoenzyme. Immunoprecipitates (IPs) of endogenous PPP2R5D were Coomassie-blue stained (Fig. 1F) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS revealing peptides containing Glu420 or Lys420 in the HET extracts (Fig. 1, G and H). As expected, only the Glu420 peptide was identified in extracts generated from WT, and only the Lys420 peptide was identified in HOMO extracts. Detection of C-terminal peptides indicates that the E420K mutation does not compromise the production of full-length PPP2R5D protein. Orthogonal validation of the LC-MS/MS data was obtained through western analysis, which revealed similar levels of PPP2R5D in both total cell extracts and IPs generated from all three cell lines (Fig. 1I). Proteins that participate in PP2A biogenesis, including LCMT1, PME1, alpha4, TIPRL, and PTPA, were similarly expressed in all three cell lines (Table S2). Western and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of both catalytic (Fig. 1, I–K) and scaffolding (Fig. 1K) subunits in PPP2R5D IPs of WT and E420K variant cells. This observation indicates that the E420K variant does not prevent the biogenesis of holoenzymes containing PPP2R5D. Our studies also revealed that both WT and E420K variant PPP2R5D assemble with either isoform of the catalytic (PPP2CA/PPP2CB) or scaffold (PPP2R1A/PPP2R1B) subunits, suggesting that PPP2R5D can be incorporated into four distinct holoenzymes. It should be noted that reduced levels of PPP2CA/B and PPP2R1A/B were found in PPP2R5D IPs of E420K variant cells, suggesting the partial loss of PPP2R5D-holoenzyme formation or decreased stability. We next tested the E420K variant containing holoenzymes for phosphatase activity using an established fluorescent (DiFMUP) assay (27Ni L. Swingle M.S. Bourgeois A.C. Honkanen R.E.

In this assay, PPP2R5D was immunoprecipitated using an antibody that recognizes a near C-terminal epitope that is unique to PPP2R5D, and the phosphatase activity of the associated PP2A-holoenzyme was measured in the IP (Fig. 1L). To adjust for minor technical variation inherent in IP-based assays, the activity associated with WT and variant immunoprecipitated PPP2R5D-phosphatase complexes was normalized to total levels of PPP2R5D detected in the IPs by immunoblotting analyses. Currently, this approach represents the only viable method to measure the activity of endogenously expressed PPP2R5D-harboring holoenzymes without contaminating activity from one of the other B’-family members that share considerable homology (PPP2R5A, PPP2R5B, PPP2R5C, and PPP2R5E) (Fig. S2A and Table S3). We observed the dephosphorylation of DiFMUP in all samples, with less activity in the IPs generated from E420K variant cells, which is consistent with observed reduced levels of immunoprecipitated catalytic subunit. When the data was normalized to the amount of catalytic subunit in the IP, the activity was similar in WT and E420K variants (Fig. S2B), suggesting that the specific activity of the variant holoenzymes was not reduced. From these studies, we concluded that the E420K variant is expressed and translated. Future studies will be needed to determine if the reduced catalytic activity in the E420K variants reflects partial assembly, altered recycling, or decreased stability of PP2A-variant holoenzymes. A major hurdle to determining how the E420K mutation alters the biological functions of PPP2R5D is that only a few studies have explored the “normal” action(s) of PPP2R5D at a cellular level (31Kruse T. Gnosa S.P. Nasa I. Garvanska D.H. Hein J.B. Nguyen H. Samsoe-Petersen J. Lopez-Mendez B. Hertz E.P.T. Schwarz J. Pena H.S. Nikodemus D. Kveiborg M. Kettenbach A.N. Nilsson J.

Therefore, we chose a global unbiased approach, employing TMT labeling for relative and absolute quantitation with LC-MS3, to obtain proteomic (Fig. 2A) and phosphoproteomic (Fig. 2B) data sets comparing WT and E420K variant cells. Overall, we reproducibly quantified 26,731 phosphopeptides on 5926 proteins in the phosphoproteomic analysis and 9178 proteins in the proteomic analysis (Table S2 and Fig. S2C). Most proteins did not change in abundance (Fig. 2, C and D). Only 2.6% of all proteins quantified were significantly increased or decreased by twofold or more in E420K HET compared with WT cells. Notably, large changes in the abundance of PP2A catalytic, scaffolding, regulatory, or other PPP-subunits were not detected. However, approximately twofold changes in some PP1R-subunits were observed (Table S4). In contrast, 8.8% of phosphopeptides were significantly increased or decreased by twofold or more in E420K HET compared with WT cells (Table S2) suggesting that the E420K variant alters global protein phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous reports indicating that PPP2R5D acts as a regulator of PP2A-holoenzyme function (6Virshup D.M.

To help distinguish changes in phosphopeptide abundance resulting from changes in protein levels versus changes in protein phosphorylation, we further filtered the data set, correcting for changes in protein abundances. This reduced our data set to 24,307 reproducibly identified and quantified phosphopeptides (Fig. 2, E and F), of which 7% were significantly increased or decreased in E420K HET compared with WT cells. Compared with WT, E420K HET cells had more phosphopeptides increasing phosphorylation occupancy than phosphopeptides decreasing phosphorylation occupancy (1.9-fold). Correlation analyses of the E420K HOMO and HET proteomics and phosphoproteomics data sets revealed a strong positive correlation for both HET and HOMO samples (Fig. 2, G and H) indicating that the data sets were highly similar. This observation is consistent with the heterozygous variant acting as a dominant condition in humans. To identify signaling cascades altered in the variant cell lines, we investigated the possibility that specific kinases might differentially oppose PPP2R5D WT and E420K-variant cells. Overrepresentation analysis identifying consensus sequences either enriched or deselected, revealing an enrichment of an R-x-R-x-x-S/T-B motif (Fig. 3A) where x represents any amino acid and B represents amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This motif is a protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) consensus sequence, which is shared by PKCα, PKCß, and RSK1 (37Rust H.L. Thompson P.R. Kinase consensus sequences: A breeding ground for crosstalk.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also observed a strong deselection of proline-directed motifs in phosphorylation sites differentially regulated in the E420K variant compared with WT cell lines (Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent with both the phosphorylation site consensus motif preferences and the phosphorylation site consensus motif disfavors we observed for the PPP2R5-holoenzymes families (31Kruse T.

Mutation of the human TRPM3 gene (TRPM3) has been linked with inherited forms of early-onset cataract with or without other eye abnormalities. Here, we have characterized the ocular phenotypes of germline “knock-in” mice that harbor a human cataract-associated isoleucine-to-methionine mutation (p.I65M) in TRPM3 (Trpm3-mutant) compared with germline “knock-out” mice that functionally lack TRPM3 (Trpm3-null). Despite strong expression of Trpm3 in lens epithelial cells, neither heterozygous (Trpm3+/−) nor homozygous (Trpm3−/−) Trpm3-null mice developed cataract; however, the latter exhibited a mild impairment of lens growth. In contrast, homozygous Trpm3-M/M mutants developed severe, progressive, anterior pyramid-like cataract with microphthalmia, whereas heterozygous Trpm3-I/M and hemizygous Trpm3-M/- mutants developed anterior pyramidal cataract with delayed onset and progression–consistent with a semi-dominant lens phenotype. Histochemical staining revealed abnormal accumulation of calcium phosphate-like deposits and collagen fibrils in Trpm3-mutant lenses and immunoblotting detected increased αII-spectrin cleavage products consistent with calpain hyper-activation. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of Trpm3-M/M mutant lenses revealed fiber cell membrane degeneration that was accompanied by accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin positive (α-SMA+ve) myofibroblast-like cells and macrosialin positive (CD68+ve) macrophage-like cells. Collectively, our mouse model data support an ocular disease association for TRPM3 in humans and suggest that (1) Trpm3 deficiency impaired lens growth but not lens transparency and (2) Trpm3 dysfunction resulted in progressive lens degeneration and calcification coupled with pro-fibrotic (α-SMA+ve) and immune (CD68+ve) cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W3121489082,"The full-body ownership illusion exploits multisensory perception to induce a feeling of ownership of an entire artificial body. Although previous research has shown that synchronous visuotactile stimulation of a single body part is sufficient for illusory ownership of the whole body, the effect of combining multisensory stimulation across multiple body parts remains unknown. Therefore, 48 healthy adults participated in a full-body ownership illusion with conditions involving synchronous (illusion) or asynchronous (control) visuotactile stimulation to one, two, or three body parts simultaneously (2×3 design). We used questionnaires to isolate illusory ownership of five specific body parts (left arm, right arm, trunk, left leg, right leg) from the full-body ownership experience and sought to test not only for increased ownership in synchronous versus asynchronous conditions but also for potentially varying degrees of full-body ownership illusion intensity related to the number of body parts stimulated. Illusory full-body ownership and all five body-part ownership ratings were significantly higher following synchronous stimulation than asynchronous stimulation ( p -values &lt; .01). Since non-stimulated body parts also received significantly increased ownership ratings following synchronous stimulation, the results are consistent with an illusion that engages the entire body. Furthermore, we noted that ownership ratings for right body parts (which were often but not always stimulated in this experiment) were significantly higher than ownership ratings for left body parts (which were never stimulated). Regarding the effect of stimulating multiple body parts simultaneously on explicit full-body ownership ratings, there was no evidence of a significant main effect of the number of stimulations ( p = .850) or any significant interaction with stimulation synchronicity ( p = .160), as assessed by linear mixed modelling. Instead, median ratings indicated a moderate affirmation (+1) of an illusory full-body sensation in all three synchronous conditions, a finding mirrored by comparable full-body illusion onset times. In sum, illusory full-body ownership appears to be an ‘all-or-nothing’ phenomenon and depends upon the synchronicity of visuotactile stimulation, irrespective of the number of stimulated body parts."
https://openalex.org/W3122963284,"Background High numbers of violence incidents against physicians are reported annually in both developing and developed countries. In Jordan, studies conducted on healthcare workers involved small number of physicians and showed higher percentages of violence exposure when compared to other investigations from the Middle East. This is a large study aiming to comprehensively analyze the phenomenon in the physicians’ community to optimize future strategies countering it. Methods The study has a cross sectional, questionnaire-based design. It targeted 969 doctors from different types of healthcare Jordanian institutions in Amman, between May to July, 2019. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate properties of reported abuse cases in terms of abusers, timing, and type of abuse, in addition to the consequences of this abuse. Results Prevalence of exposure to violence in the last year among doctors was 63.1% (611 doctors). 423 (67.2%) of male doctors had an experience of being abused during the last 12 months, compared to 188 (55.3%) of females (p&lt; 0.001). Governmental centers showed the highest prevalence. Among 356 doctors working in governmental medical centers, 268 (75.3%) reported being abused (p&lt; 0.001), and they were more abused verbally (63.5%) and physically (10.4%) compared to other medical sectors (p &lt;0.001). The mean score of how worried doctors are regarding violence at their workplace from 1 to 5 was 3.1 ± 1.3, and only 129 (13.3%) believed that they are protected by law. Conclusions The study emphasized on the higher rate of violence against physicians in the governmental sector, in addition to the negative effect of abuse on their performance. Moreover, male physicians had higher incidence of workplace abuse. Therefore, strategies that ease and promote the real application of anti-violence policies should become our future target."

No small molecule drugs targeting CHIKV nsP3 have been identified to date. Here we report small fragments that bind to nsP3MD which were discovered by virtually screening a fragment library and X-ray crystallography. These identified fragments share a similar scaffold, 2-pyrimidone-4-carboxylic acid, and are specifically bound to the ADP-ribose binding site of nsP3MD. Among the fragments, 2-oxo-5,6-benzopyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid showed anti-CHIKV activity with an IC 50 of 23 μM. Our fragment-based drug discovery approach provides valuable information to further develop a specific and potent nsP3 inhibitor of CHIKV viral replication based on the 2-pyrimidone-4-carboxylic acid scaffold. In silico studies suggest this pyrimidone scaffold could also bind to the macrodomains of other alphaviruses and coronaviruses and thus, have potential pan-antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W3125872644,"Lipid flipping in the membrane bilayers is a widespread eukaryotic phenomenon that is catalyzed by assorted P4-ATPases. Its occurrence, mechanism, and importance in apicomplexan parasites have remained elusive, however. Here we show that Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite with high clinical relevance, can salvage phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) but not phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) probes from its milieu. Consistently, the drug analogs of PtdCho are broadly ineffective in the parasite culture. NBD-PtdSer imported to the parasite interior is decarboxylated to NBD-PtdEtn, while the latter is not methylated to yield PtdCho, which confirms the expression of PtdSer decarboxylase but a lack of PtdEtn methyltransferase activity and suggests a role of exogenous lipids in membrane biogenesis of T. gondii. Flow cytometric quantitation of NBD-probes endorsed the selectivity of phospholipid transport and revealed a dependence of the process on energy and protein. Accordingly, our further work identified five P4-ATPases (TgP4-ATPase1-5), all of which harbor the signature residues and motifs required for phospholipid flipping. Of the four proteins expressed during the lytic cycle, TgP4-ATPase1 is present in the apical plasmalemma; TgP4-ATPase3 resides in the Golgi network along with its noncatalytic partner Ligand Effector Module 3 (TgLem3), whereas TgP4-ATPase2 and TgP4-ATPase5 localize in the plasmalemma as well as endo/cytomembranes. Last but not least, auxin-induced degradation of TgP4-ATPase1-3 impaired the parasite growth in human host cells, disclosing their crucial roles during acute infection.

In conclusion, we show selective translocation of PtdEtn and PtdSer at the parasite surface and provide the underlying mechanistic and physiological insights in a model eukaryotic pathogen. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular pathogen of the protozoan phylum Apicomplexa, which has a marked ability to infect, reproduce, and persist in almost all homeothermic organisms including humans. The parasite inflicts acute and chronic toxoplasmosis that is mostly asymptomatic in healthy individuals, but its opportunistic infection can be fatal in people with weak or compromised immunity (1Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O. Toxoplasmosis.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1965-1976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Tissue necrosis is caused by rapid asexual reproduction of its acute (tachyzoite) stage in a wide range of nucleated host cells. Tachyzoites undergo a reversible stage switching between infectious extracellular and replicative intracellular phases during the lytic cycle, which comprises the serial events of invasion, replication, and egress (2Lyons R.E.

After invasion, the parasite dwells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is originally derived from the host plasma membrane but profoundly modified to enable its asexual reproduction by endodyogeny (3Sinai A.P.

For instance, PtdSer- and PtdEtn-specific flippases ensure enrichment of these lipids on the cytoplasmic leaflet of specific organelle membranes and thereby promote the binding of cytoskeletal components, adapter proteins, or enzymes to the subcellular membranes, which are vital for signaling cascades, catalytic regulation, metabolism, vesicle trafficking, and cell motility (37Keranen L.M.

Evenly, certain P4-ATPases can transport lyso-PtdEtn and lyso-PtdCho (e.g., ScDnf1/ScDnf2 in S. cerevisiae) and subsequently facilitate the regeneration of PtdEtn and PtdCho to fuel a rapid cell growth (30Riekhof W.R.

Given the dynamic lipid and ionic milieu that apicomplexan pathogens encounter inside and outside their respective host cells, lipid flipping is anticipated to be important during the extracellular and intracellular parasitic stages. In accord, genomes of these parasites also harbor several putative P4-ATPases (www.EuPathDB.org); however, in notable disparity to their mammalian host cells, let alone other eukaryotes, little to none is known about phospholipid flipping in apicomplexan parasites. Here we deployed T. gondii, a model intracellular pathogen, to examine the occurrence, mechanisms, and importance of aminoglycerophospholipid flipping in its acutely infectious tachyzoite stage. To determine whether extracellular tachyzoites can import aminoglycerophospholipids, we incubated them with nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-conjugated PtdEtn, PtdSer, PtdCho, and SM (negative control) (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence imaging of the probe-labeled parasites showed import of PtdSer and PtdEtn, as evident by the punctate intracellular NBD signal distributed throughout the parasite body. In contrast, the intracellular fluorescence of NBD-PtdCho was notably poor and comparable with the background fluorescence of NBD-SM (Fig. 1A). Quantification by flow cytometry confirmed the microscopy data, revealing a marked internalization of NBD-PtdEtn and NBD-PtdSer (Fig. 1B). Uptake of PtdEtn and PtdSer probes was four to eight times more than PtdCho as well as SM, and the relative import of specified probes was comparable with our microscopic observation. In extended work, we tested the drug analogues of PtdCho (miltefosine and edelfosine) in plaque assays to examine their effect on the parasite growth (Fig. S1). None of the two drugs exerted a notable effect as increasing doses (1–100 μM) resulted in only a modest impairment of the lytic cycle. A maximum of 45% inhibition was seen at the highest 100 μM concentration of drugs (100–200× more amount than NBD-probes used here), which echoes well with a poor import of NBD-PtdCho. In brief, the data disclosed a selective uptake of lipid analogues across the plasma membrane of tachyzoites. Next, we examined whether the fluorescent signal in labeled extracellular tachyzoites originated from the intact NBD-lipids and was not simply due to the degradation of probes in the extracellular or intracellular milieu. Indeed, thin layer chromatography (TLC) of total lipids extracted from the labeled tachyzoites identified NBD-PtdCho and NBD-SM in related samples (Fig. 1C), whose low intensity correlated with the microscopy and flow cytometry data. In contrast, a strong band of NBD-PtdEtn was detected in the corresponding parasite sample. Equally, tachyzoites incubated with NBD-PtdSer displayed a distinct band for NBD-PtdSer beside NBD-PtdEtn. The fact that PtdSer decarboxylation can occur in the mitochondrion, in dense granules, and in the PV when intracellular (9Hartmann A. Hellmund M. Lucius R. Voelker D.R. Gupta N.

In none of the two samples, however, NBD-PtdEtn was methylated to yield NBD-PtdCho, confirming the lack of a PtdEtn methyltransferase in tachyzoites (8Gupta N. Zahn M.M. Coppens I. Joiner K.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to specified lipids in their intact form, we also detected fluorescent fatty acids, probably as a result of lipolytic degradation. Formation of NBD-PtdEtn in extracellular tachyzoites incubated with NBD-PtdSer can be attributed to the presence of PtdSer decarboxylase (PSD) enzymes in the mitochondrion and dense granules, the latter of which is ultimately secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (9Hartmann A. Hellmund M. Lucius R. Voelker D.R. Gupta N. Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in the parasite mitochondrion is required for efficient growth but dispensable for survival of Toxoplasma gondii.J.

We tested the notion by NBD-PtdSer labeling of parasites in the presence of hydroxylamine (Fig. S2A), which is known to inhibit PSD activity (41Carson M.A. Emala M. Hogsten P. Waechter C.J. Coordinate regulation of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity and phospholipid N-methylation in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6267-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, TLC analysis revealed that the conversion of NBD-PtdSer to NBD-PtdEtn was nearly ablated by the addition of the drug. The ratio of NBD-PtdEtn to NBD-PtdSer was about 60% to 40% in the untreated sample, whereas this proportion was changed to 15% versus 85% in the presence of hydroxylamine (Fig. S2A). To test the extent of decarboxylation occurring before or during NBD-PtdSer transport, we collected the secreted fraction (secretome), as described earlier (9Hartmann A. Hellmund M. Lucius R. Voelker D.R. Gupta N. Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in the parasite mitochondrion is required for efficient growth but dispensable for survival of Toxoplasma gondii.J. Biol.

Indeed, consistent with our earlier work, we noticed the decarboxylation of PtdSer by TgPSD1pv discharged in the secretome; however, the degree of PtdEtn formation was much lower under the indicated labeling conditions when compared with the intact parasites, which harbor TgPSD1mt in the mitochondrion in addition to TgPSD1pv in dense granules (9Hartmann A.

These results, taken together, suggest that tachyzoites are competent in salvaging PtdSer that is subsequently metabolized to PtdEtn. To examine whether the uptake of lipid probes by extracellular parasites is an active process driven by ATP and proteins, we set up experiments under varying conditions (Fig. 2). In the first assay, we compared internalization of NBD-conjugated PtdCho, PtdEtn, PtdSer, and SM either at physiological (37 °C) or at low (4 °C) temperature by quantifying the fluorescence of each probe via flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Parasites labeled with NBD-PtdCho or NBD-SM displayed a low (background) fluorescence at 37 °C that was further quenched at 4 °C. By contrast, cells incubated with NBD-PtdEtn and NBD-PtdSer displayed a notably higher signal and incurred a nearly complete loss of lipid salvage at low temperature. In a similar experiment when tachyzoites were incubated at 37 °C in ATP-replete and depleted media (Fig. S2C), we scored a marked decline in internalized fluorescence of NBD-PtdEtn and NBD-PtdSer but not of NBD-PtdCho and NBD-SM in energy-depleted tachyzoites (Fig. 2B). Finally, we incubated parasites with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfydryl reagent that covalently alters the cysteine residues and thereby blocks disulfide cross-link in proteins (42Smyth D.G. Blumenfeld O.O. Konigsberg W. Reactions of N-ethylmaleimide with peptides and amino acids.Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), prior to the import assays (Fig. 2C). Once again, we recorded a specific decline in the uptake of NBD-conjugated PtdEtn and PtdSer of drug-treated tachyzoites. In conclusion, these experiments indicate the presence of ATP-dependent PtdSer and PtdEtn transporter proteins in the plasma membrane of tachyzoites. In continuation of the above-mentioned findings, we searched the genome database of T. gondii for P4-ATPase proteins, which are known to transport phospholipids in other organisms. Our BLAST search using the well-studied lipid-translocating P4-ATPases (HsATP8A1 and ScDrs2) identified five putative lipid transporters of variable length (1261–2427 aa, Table 1). These proteins, termed TgP4-ATPase1-5 herein, comprise P4-ATPase domains at their N and C termini, flanking a haloacid dehydrogenase-like hydrolase domain (P-type ATPase superfamily) (Fig. 3A). All five TgP4-ATPases harbor ten potential transmembrane (TM) helices (Fig. S3), as described in their human and yeast homologs. The first four TMs occur at the N terminal of proteins, whereas the subsequent six TMs are systematically positioned within the C-terminal P4-ATPase domain (Fig. 3A). Besides, the N and C termini of all flippases are predicted to face the cytoplasmic leaflet (Fig. S3). In a parsimonious cladogram, TgP4-ATPase1 and TgP4-ATPase5 paired with each other and branched off the HsATP11 family (P4A class, Fig. 3B), while the TgP4-ATPase2-4 proteins formed own clades diverging off the mainstream P4B-type flippases (HsATP9A, HsATP9B, CeTAT-5, ScNeo1).Table 1Major features of Toxoplasma P4-ATPases identified in this studyProtein nameNCBI accession (ToxoDB ID)Amino acids (size in kDaaPredicted molecular weight without any epitope.)Growth scorebBased on genome-wide CRISPR screen in tachyzoites (58).Transcript (FPKM)cTranscript level of fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (57).Special featuresdSpecial features of shown P4-type proteins (see Discussion).Partner protein (ToxoDB ID)eThere are four predicted Cdc50/Lem3-like proteins encoded by parasite genome (see Discussion).Protein expression in tachyzoitesfDeduced by 3′-insertional epitope tagging of TgP4-ATPase1-5 genes.P4-ATPase1MT268297 (TGGT1_247690)1860 (205)−1.5042.00GYAFS (R domain)---Apical plasmalemmaP4-ATPase2MT268298 (TGGT1_245510)2427 (266)−3.7626.36GFAFA (R domain)---Plasma membrane & endo/cytomembranesP4-ATPase3MT268299 (TGGT1_224190)1261 (140)−5.2421.43---TgLem3gBased on localization of TgLem3 and TgP4-ATPase3 in the Golgi network.

https://openalex.org/W3124007595,"Suicide is a global health problem affecting both normative and clinical populations. Theoretical models that examine mechanisms underlying suicide risk across heterogeneous samples are needed. The present study explored core characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a sub-population at high risk of suicide, as well as two dimensional cognitive constructs, as potential transdiagnostic predictors of suicidal ideation in a clinically diverse sample. Participants ( n = 1851, 62% female) aged 18 to 89 years completed online questionnaires assessing: social communication difficulties; insistence on sameness; cognitive control; and rumination. Forty-three percent of participants reported the presence of at least one neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorder. One third of the sample reported some suicidal ideation (SI), and 40 percent met the threshold for concern for depression. All hypothesized constructs were associated with SI and depression and, with the exception of rumination, contributed significantly to SI. Participants reporting SI returned significantly higher social communication difficulties and insistence on sameness, and lower levels of cognitive control than those reporting no-SI. The study was limited by the use of a cross-sectional sample assessed with self-report measures. All diagnoses were self-reported and the study was additionally limited by the use of a single item indicator of suicidal ideation. These findings support a role for constructs associated with the ASD phenotype and associated broad cognitive domains as potential risk factors underlying suicidal ideation in a large clinically diverse sample. Our findings suggest directions for future longitudinal research studies, along with specific targets for suicide prevention and clinical practice."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the level of adiponectin increased the pathogenesis of retinal edema and neovascularization in the retina of progressive ocular vascular diseases. We examined the role played by adiponectin in two types of cells and animal models which are retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. Our results showed that an injection of anti-adiponectin antibody ameliorated the retinal edema and ischemia through the depression of the expression level of VEGF-related factors and tight junction-related proteins in the retina of RVO mice. The intravitreal injection of anti-adiponectin antibody also decreased the degree of retinal neovascularization in an OIR mice. In addition, exposure of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells and human brain microvascular pericytes in culture to adiponectin increased both the vascular permeability and neovascularization through the increase of inflammatory factor and the dropout of the pericytes. These findings indicate that adiponectin plays a critical role in retinal edema and neovascularization, and adiponectin is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and RVO."
https://openalex.org/W3123072019,"ZAP-70 is a tyrosine kinase essential for T cell immune responses. Upon engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR), ZAP-70 is recruited to the specialized plasma membrane domains, becomes activated, and is released to phosphorylate its laterally segregated targets. A shift in ZAP-70 distribution at the plasma membrane is recognized as a critical step in TCR signal transduction and amplification. However, the molecular mechanism supporting stimulation-dependent plasma membrane compartmentalization of ZAP-70 remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified previously uncharacterized lipidation (S-acylation) of ZAP-70 using Acyl-Biotin Exchange assay, a technique that selectively captures S-acylated proteins. We found that this posttranslational modification of ZAP-70 is dispensable for its enzymatic activity. However, the lipidation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 failed to propagate the TCR pathway suggesting that S-acylation is essential for ZAP-70 interaction with its protein substrates. The kinetics of ZAP-70 S-acylation were consistent with TCR signaling events indicating that agonist-induced S-acylation is a part of the signaling mechanism controlling T cell activation and function.

ZAP-70 (“CD3ζ-chain-associated protein kinase 70”) is one of the first proteins activated upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement by the peptide/major histocompatibility complex on the surface the antigen-presenting cell (1Brownlie R.J. Zamoyska R. T cell receptor signalling networks: Branched, diversified and bounded.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the TCR leads to activation of the Src-family kinase Lck, which then phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of TCR-associated CD3ζ-chain (1Brownlie R.J. Zamoyska R. T cell receptor signalling networks: Branched, diversified and bounded.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Salmond R.J. Filby A. Qureshi I.

Double phosphorylation of ITAMs creates a high-affinity docking site for Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of ZAP-70 resulting in its recruitment to the TCR–CD3 complex. Binding to ITAMs triggers conformational changes that make ZAP-70 more accessible to phosphorylation by Lck and subsequently leads to ZAP-70 autophosphorylation and full activation (3Wang H.

Activated ZAP-70 is released from ITAMs and proceeds to target its effectors, primarily membrane-bound scaffolding proteins LAT and SLP-76 (6Su X. Ditlev J.A. Hui E. Xing W. Banjade S. Okrut J.

Phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 nucleates the assembly of the multiprotein signaling complex, which further propagates the downstream TCR signaling cascade resulting in activation of the phospholipase PLC-γ1, cytoplasmic calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum, and, ultimately, transcriptional responses associated with T cell activation and clonal expansion (6Su X.

Thus, the signaling function of the ZAP-70 kinase relies on two temporally and spatially segregated events. During the first step, the phosphorylated TCR–CD3 complex amplifies the initial antigenic signal through repeated cycles of ZAP-70 recruitment, activation, and release (9Katz Z.B. Novotná L.

This compartmentalization of early phosphorylation events not only ensures rapid TCR signal amplification and distribution but can also help to avoid premature or unspecific T cell activation. It is not clear, however, what mechanism prevents activated and decoupled ZAP-70 from being dispersed back into the cytoplasm and promotes its prompt translocation to the laterally segregated downstream targets. It has been proposed that both plasma membrane anchoring and lateral distribution of proteins within the plasma membrane can be mediated by S-acylation—reversible lipidation of cysteine thiols with long-chain fatty acids (12Chamberlain L.H. Shipston M.J. The physiology of protein S-acylation.Physiol. Rev. 2015; 95: 341-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Levental I. Grzybek M. Simons K.

In particular, this posttranslational modification (also referred to as palmitoylation) was found to be essential for biological activity of two immediate ZAP-70 effectors, Lck and LAT (14Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C.

It has been shown that, although the acylation-deficient mutant of Lck was still catalytically active, it was unable to phosphorylate ITAMs and failed to activate ZAP-70, thus leading to abrogated TCR signaling (14Kabouridis P.S.

Palmitoylation of either Cys-3 or Cys-5 is required for the biological activity of the Lck tyrosine protein kinase.Microbiology. 1995; 15: 6914-6922Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous study demonstrated that initiation of the Fas receptor signaling pathway in T cells relies on rapid agonist-induced changes in Lck S-acylation levels and inhibition of this modification rendered T cells completely resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (18Akimzhanov A.M.

Correspondingly, S-acylation of LAT was found to be essential for its correct targeting to the TCR signaling assemblies and propagation of downstream signaling events, including phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, calcium influx, and activation of transcription factors (15Levental I.

In this study, we report previously unknown S-acylation of ZAP-70. We found that this posttranslational modification is TCR dependent and identified the cysteine in position 564 as the primary site of ZAP-70 S-acylation. Mutation of this cysteine residue did not affect the catalytic ability of the kinase but led to extended interaction of ZAP-70 with its activator kinase Lck, resulting in significantly increased ZAP-70 phosphorylation levels. However, the acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 failed to phosphorylate its downstream targets, adaptors LAT and SLP-76, causing disruption of the TCR signaling chain. Overall, our study describes a previously uncharacterized posttranslational modification of ZAP-70 that serves as a critical regulator of its signaling function in T cell activation. We first identified ZAP-70 as an S-acylated protein in our initial experiments aimed at the detection of novel lipidated proteins in the proximal TCR signaling pathway. To survey T cell protein lipidation, we employed the Acyl-Biotin Exchange (ABE) assay, a method that allows for rapid and highly sensitive detection of S-acylated proteins (23Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. Labeling and quantifying sites of protein palmitoylation.Biotechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, free thiol groups in proteins in Jurkat T cell lysate were blocked with methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), followed by cleavage of thioester bonds with neutral hydroxylamine (HA). The newly exposed thiol groups were then biotinylated and pulled down using streptavidin beads, and the captured proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. This approach, in combination with a candidate-based screening of the proximal TCR signaling components, allowed us to detect previously uncharacterized S-acylation of several key TCR signaling proteins, including adaptor protein GRB2, phospholipase PLC-γ1, and tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 in both Jurkat cell line and primary human CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings suggested that this posttranslational modification is more widespread than initially thought and prompted us to investigate a possible role of S-acylation in the regulation of the ZAP-70 signaling function. Our next goal was to determine the site of ZAP-70 S-acylation. To identify the modified cysteine residues, we analyzed ZAP-70 protein sequence using CSS-Palm 4.0 software (24Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. CSS-Palm 2.0: An updated software for palmitoylation sites prediction.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Based on the CSS-Palm 4.0 prediction, two cysteine residues at positions 560 and 564 had an increased probability of being S-acylated. Owing to the limited accessibility of C560, we hypothesized that C564 in the C-terminal part of the protein is the main site of S-acylation (Fig. 2A). The hypothesis was further supported by a study reporting that a homozygous ZAP70 mutation of this residue (c.1690T>C; p.C564R) was associated with severe combined immunodeficiency in a human patient (25Turul T. Tezcan I. Artac H. De Bruin-Versteeg S. Barendregt B.H. Reisli I. Sanal O. Van Dongen J.J.M. Van Der Burg M. Clinical heterogeneity can hamper the diagnosis of patients with ZAP70 deficiency.Eur. J. Pediatr. 2009; 168: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To experimentally validate S-acylation of C564, we used ZAP-70–deficient P116 Jurkat T cells to generate T cell lines stably expressing ZAP-70 mutants carrying either single or combinatorial substitutions of cysteines in positions 560 and 564. Using the ABE assay, we found that the substitution of the cysteine 564 by an arginine (C564R) or serine (C564S) resulted in loss of ZAP-70 S-acylation (Fig. 1, C and D and S1), indicating that C564 is indeed required for this posttranslational modification. S-acylation of ZAP-70 was initially detected in resting Jurkat T cells. Considering the highly dynamic nature of early TCR signaling, we hypothesized that stimulation of the TCR can trigger very rapid changes in ZAP-70 S-acylation levels. To test this hypothesis, we treated Jurkat T cells with anti-CD3 antibody to activate the TCR signaling pathway and assessed the kinetics of ZAP-70 lipidation using the ABE assay. We found that T cell stimulation resulted in a robust but transient increase in S-acylation of ZAP-70, peaking at approximately 2 min after TCR engagement (Fig. 1, E and F). Of interest, another proximal signaling kinase, Lck, showed different kinetics with more sustained S-acylation lasting up to 5 min post stimulation, possibly indicating distinct enzymatic control of its lipidation. In addition, to determine whether transient increase in S-acylation of ZAP-70 depends on elevations in cytoplasmic calcium, we performed a similar experiment using J.gamma1 (PLC-γ1 null) Jurkat T cells deficient in TCR-mediated calcium release (26Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Pleiotropic contributions of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) to T-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling: Reconstitution studies of a PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat T-cell line.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found that loss of calcium signaling did not affect basal levels of ZAP-70 S-acylation, but the TCR-induced changes in ZAP-70 lipidation were completely absent in this cell line (Fig. S2). Overall, we found that the transient increase in ZAP-70 S-acylation upon TCR stimulation closely matched the phosphorylation pattern of ZAP-70 and other TCR signaling proteins (Fig. 1E, input) suggesting that similar to phosphorylation, dynamic protein S-acylation can be regulated by TCR engagement and subsequent calcium release. A substitution of ZAP-70 cysteine in position 564 to arginine was associated with a case of severe combined immunodeficiency in a human patient (25), however, the molecular mechanism underlying this inborn error of immunity remained unresolved. The C564R mutation occurred within the C-terminal part of the ZAP-70 kinase domain (Fig. 2A), suggesting that introduction of a positively charged amino acid residue in the vicinity of the ZAP-70 catalytic core could negatively affect its kinase function. To address this possibility, we set up an in vitro kinase assay to ascertain whether the C564R mutation can disrupt the ability of ZAP-70 to phosphorylate its protein substrate, SLP-76. To test the phosphorylation efficiency, ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from P116 cells stably expressing either wildtype or C564R ZAP-70 and incubated with recombinant SLP-76 protein. Although negative controls showed no detectable phosphorylation of SLP-76, we found that the C564R mutation did not cause any apparent loss of ZAP-70 kinase activity as evident from robust phosphorylation of SLP-76 at Y128 (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, these data confirmed that the acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 is catalytically active. Since the acylation-deficient C564R mutant of ZAP-70 retained the ability to efficiently phosphorylate its substrate, we argued that loss of protein lipidation could still affect ZAP-70 activation by preventing its recruitment from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and subsequent interaction with Lck. To evaluate the effect of S-acylation on plasma membrane localization of ZAP-70, we utilized total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We transfected Jurkat P116 cells with mCherry-tagged ZAP-70 constructs and assessed the presence of fluorescent proteins in the TIRF plane of resting and stimulated T cells. We found that both wildtype and C564R ZAP-70 demonstrated similar localization patterns by forming laterally mobile puncta at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A), suggesting that S-acylation is not required for ZAP-70 translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. To further confirm the plasma membrane association of the acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70, we performed the subcellular fractionation assay. Consistent with our previous observations, the C564R ZAP-70 mutant demonstrated a strong association with the membrane fraction in both resting and activated cells (Fig. 3B). The presence of the C564R mutant of ZAP-70 at the plasma membrane indicated that the acylation-deficient ZAP-70 can still interact with its upstream effector, Lck. To test whether S-acylation of ZAP-70 influences the interaction with its activator kinase, we immunoprecipitated Lck from P116 Jurkat cells stably expressing wildtype or C564R ZAP-70. Wildtype ZAP-70 became detectable in the Lck immunoprecipitate after 2 min of the TCR ligation by anti-CD3 antibody, but the association between these proteins rapidly decreased upon prolonged cell stimulation (Fig. 3C). It is surprising that we observed that loss of S-acylation resulted in a more sustained interaction between ZAP-70 and Lck. As shown in Figure 3C, we found markedly increased coimmunoprecipitation of Lck and C564R ZAP-70 in both resting and activated cell lysates. TCR-induced recruitment of ZAP-70 to the plasma membrane and subsequent binding to Lck facilitates phosphorylation of the ZAP-70 tyrosine residues Y319 and Y493 within the interdomain B and the tyrosine residues Y492 and Y493 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain (27Brdicka T. Kadlecek T. a Roose J.P. Pastuszak A.W. Weiss A. Intramolecular regulatory Switch in ZAP-70: Analogy with receptor tyrosine kinases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test whether more continuous interaction of ZAP-70 with Lck affects its phosphorylation, we used anti-CD3 antibody to stimulate P116 Jurkat cells stably expressing ZAP-70 variants and assessed the phosphorylation of Y319 and Y493 by immunoblotting. Consistent with more stable association of C564R ZAP-70 with Lck, phosphorylation of the acylation-deficient ZAP-70 mutants was increased by almost 250-fold compared with wildtype (Figs. 3, D and E and S3). Of importance, we also observed that, despite being phosphorylated at both Y319 and Y493 sites, the acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 failed to propagate the TCR signaling pathway as evident from the abolished phosphorylation of proximal TCR signaling proteins PLC-γ1 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that S-acylation of ZAP-70 could mediate its stimulus-dependent partitioning into the specific plasma membrane domains where it can interact with its downstream targets. To further investigate the ability of C564R ZAP-70 to mediate TCR signal transduction, we stimulated P116 Jurkat cells stably rescued with ZAP-70 expression vectors with anti-CD3 antibody and examined early signaling events leading to T cell activation. As shown in Figure 4A and B, expression of wildtype ZAP-70 rescued TCR-dependent phosphorylation of ZAP-70 substrates, LAT and SLP-76, leading to subsequent activation of downstream mediators of the proximal TCR pathway, PLC-γ1 and ERK1/2. In contrast, we found that the acylation-deficient C564R mutant of ZAP-70 failed to phosphorylate its targets, resulting in disruption of the TCR signaling cascade (Fig. 4A and B). Of note, expression of the C564R ZAP-70 did not affect activation of upstream Src-family kinases Lck and Fyn. Similarly, disruption of TCR signaling was also observed in P116 Jurkat cells stably expressing acylation-deficient C564S mutant of ZAP-70 (Fig. S4A). Initiation of the T cell signaling events strongly depends on PLC-γ1-mediated calcium release from the ER stores (28Oh-hora M. Rao A. Calcium signaling in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 29Akimzhanov A.M. Wang X. Sun J. Boehning D. T-cell receptor complex is essential for Fas signal transduction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 15105-15110Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with compromised activation of PLC-γ1, we did not detect TCR-induced cytoplasmic calcium influx in P116 cells expressing either C564R or C564S mutant of ZAP-70 (Figs. 4, C and D and S4B). Based on these observations, we concluded that S-acylation of ZAP-70 is essential for the activation of the proximal TCR signaling pathway. We next aimed to determine whether disruption of the early TCR signaling events observed in P116 Jurkat cells expressing acylation-deficient ZAP-70 leads to impaired T cell activation. To test the T cell transcriptional responses, we stimulated P116 Jurkat cells stably expressing ZAP-70 variants with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody for 24 h and used ELISA to measure secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a proinflammatory cytokine essential for T cell activation and proliferation. We found that, in contrast to wildtype ZAP-70, expression of C564R ZAP-70 in P116 cells resulted in suppressed production of IL-2 in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. 5A). Consonantly, our flow cytometric analysis revealed that loss of ZAP-70 S-acylation led to significantly reduced expression of CD25 and CD69T cell activation markers on the surface of stimulated cells (Fig. 5, B–E). Likewise, we observed loss of IL-2 production and CD69 expression in P116 Jurkat cells stably expressing the C564S acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 (Fig. S4, C and D). The observed deficiency in T cell activation in C564R-expressing cells was overridden by a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin treatment, indicating that the signaling components downstream of ZAP-70 were not affected (Fig. S5). Together, these findings demonstrate that S-acylation of ZAP-70 is essential for T cell activation. A homozygous cysteine mutation (c.1690T>C; p.C564R) of ZAP-70 gene was reported to be associated with severe combined immunodeficiency in a human patient (25Turul T. Tezcan I. Artac H. De Bruin-Versteeg S. Barendregt B.H. Reisli I. Sanal O. Van Dongen J.J.M. Van Der Burg M. Clinical heterogeneity can hamper the diagnosis of patients with ZAP70 deficiency.Eur. J. Pediatr. 2009; 168: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this inborn error of immunity remained largely unresolved. In this study, we identified C564 as the site of a posttranslational modification known as protein S-acylation. Our experimental validation and functional characterization of the “disease mutant” revealed that the C564R mutation creates the acylation-deficient form of ZAP-70 that is unable to support early TCR signal transduction events resulting in inhibited T cell activation. S-acylation of ZAP-70 was initially discovered in resting T cells; however, we found that engagement of the TCR triggers robust changes in ZAP-70 lipidation levels. We observed a rapid increase in ZAP-70 S-acylation after 2 min of TCR stimulation followed by a sharp decline to basal levels after 5 min (Fig 1E). This rapid and transient pattern of ZAP-70 S-acylation closely resembles the phosphorylation kinetics of proximal TCR signaling proteins, including ZAP-70 itself. Thus, these observations suggest that stimulus-induced S-acylation of ZAP-70 likely plays a regulatory role during initiation of early TCR signaling events and that the enzymes controlling ZAP-70 S-acylation are an intricate part of the proximal TCR signaling machinery. To evaluate the functional significance of ZAP-70 S-acylation, we decided to test whether the acylation-deficient mutant, C564R ZAP-70, is able to mediate activation of the TCR signaling pathway. However, we were concerned that introduction of the positively charged arginine residue could disturb the protein confirmation, resulting in ZAP-70 deficiency due to misfolding, aggregation, or premature degradation. Alternatively, the C564R mutation within the C-terminal part of the kinase domain could cause a more subtle effect by affecting the ability of ZAP-70 to recognize its protein substrates. We tested both possibilities directly by stably expressing ZAP-70 constructs in P116 cells and setting up an in vitro kinase assay in which recombinant SLP-76 protein was added to immunoprecipitated ZAP-70 (Fig. 2). This experiment demonstrated that C564R ZAP-70 retained the ability to phosphorylate its substrate, indicating that this mutation did not result in protein impairment. This conclusion was further supported by our data showing that the C564R mutant can still be efficiently targeted to the plasma membrane and phosphorylated by Lck (Fig. 3). Moreover, substitution of the neighboring cysteine residue in the position 560 by arginine had no apparent effect on ZAP-70 signaling function as evident from the ability of C560R mutant to fully rescue T cell activation in ZAP-70 null cells (Fig. S6). Furthermore, we found that substitution of C564 by serine (C564S) also resulted in a significantly increased ZAP-70 phosphorylation, loss of cytoplasmic calcium influx after TCR engagement, and significant disruption of TCR signaling (Figs. S3 and S4). Thus, these data suggest that the functional deficiency of the C564R mutant observed in our studies was caused by loss of S-acylation rather than diminished kinase activity. We found that the S-acylation of ZAP-70 is critical for its signaling function in the proximal TCR pathway. Despite being catalytically active, the acylation-deficient mutant of ZAP-70 interrupted the TCR signaling cascade by failing to phosphorylate its targets, LAT and SLP-76, thus effectively blocking calcium responses and downstream signaling and subsequent T cell activation. The reason why acylation-deficient ZAP-70 was unable to phosphorylate its substrates is not entirely clear. Disproving our initial hypothesis, loss of S-acylation did not prevent the interaction between ZAP-70 and its activator kinase Lck, but rather enhanced i"

In a small cohort of 65 children living in the same rural area of south-west Sweden, we have previously found that maternal factors, including prenatal diet, affect childhood allergy risk, suggesting that in utero conditions may be important for allergy development. Here, we studied if metabolites in the umbilical cord blood of newborns may be related to development of childhood allergy, accounting for key perinatal factors such as mode of delivery, birth order and sex. Available umbilical cord blood plasma samples from 44 of the participants were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics; allergy was diagnosed by specialised paediatricians at ages 18 months, 3 years and 8 years and included eczema, asthma, food allergy and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Nineteen cord blood metabolites were related to future allergy diagnosis though there was no clear pattern of up- or downregulation of metabolic pathways. In contrast, perinatal factors birth order, sex and mode of delivery affected several energy and biosynthetic pathways, including glutamate and aspartic acid—histidine metabolism (p = 0.004) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (p = 0.006) for birth order; branched chain amino acid metabolism (p = 0.0009) and vitamin B 6 metabolism (p = 0.01) for sex; and glyoxylate and dicarboxylic acid metabolism (p = 0.005) for mode of delivery. Maternal diet was also related to some of the metabolites associated with allergy. In conclusion, the cord blood metabolome includes individual metabolites that reflect lifestyle, microbial and other factors that may be associated with future allergy diagnosis, and also reflects temporally close events/factors. Larger studies are required to confirm these associations, and perinatal factors such as birth order or siblings must be considered in future cord-blood metabolome studies."
https://openalex.org/W3124543050,"Liver is the central metabolic hub that coordinates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The bioactive derivative of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), was shown to regulate major metabolic genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and glucokinase among others. Expression levels of these genes undergo profound changes during adaptation to fasting or in metabolic diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it is unknown whether the levels of hepatic RA change during metabolic remodeling. This study investigated the dynamics of hepatic retinoid metabolism and signaling in the fed state, in fasting, and in T1D. Our results show that fed-to-fasted transition is associated with significant decrease in hepatic retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) activity, the rate-limiting step in RA biosynthesis, and downregulation of RA signaling. The decrease in RDH activity correlates with the decreased abundance and altered subcellular distribution of RDH10 while Rdh10 transcript levels remain unchanged. In contrast to fasting, untreated T1D is associated with upregulation of RA signaling and an increase in hepatic RDH activity, which correlates with the increased abundance of RDH10 in microsomal membranes. The dynamic changes in RDH10 protein levels in the absence of changes in its transcript levels imply the existence of posttranscriptional regulation of RDH10 protein. Together, these data suggest that the downregulation of hepatic RA biosynthesis, in part via the decrease in RDH10, is an integral component of adaptation to fasting. In contrast, the upregulation of hepatic RA biosynthesis and signaling in T1D might contribute to metabolic inflexibility associated with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3125664918,"<h2>Summary</h2> Learning new rules and adopting novel behavioral policies is a prominent adaptive behavior of primates. We studied the dynamics of single neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and putamen of monkeys while they learned new classification tasks every few days over a fixed set of multi-cue patterns. Representing the rules and the neuronal selectivity as vectors in the space spanned by a set of stimulus features allowed us to characterize neuronal dynamics in geometrical terms. We found that neurons in the cingulate cortex mainly rotated toward the rule, implying a policy search, whereas neurons in the putamen showed a magnitude increase that followed the rotation of cortical neurons, implying strengthening of confidence for the newly acquired rule-based policy. Further, the neural representation at the end of a session predicted next-day behavior, reflecting overnight retention. The novel framework for characterization of neural dynamics suggests complementing roles for the putamen and the anterior cingulate cortex."

While it is known that steroid hormones such as estrogen and 20-hydroxyecdysone counteract insulin function, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this attenuation remain unclear. In the present study, using the agricultural pest lepidopteran Helicoverpa armigera as a model, we proposed that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induces dephosphorylation of INSR to counteract insulin function. We observed high expression and phosphorylation of INSR during larval feeding stages that decreased during metamorphosis. Insulin upregulated INSR expression and phosphorylation, whereas 20E repressed INSR expression and induced INSR dephosphorylation in vivo. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B, encoded by Ptpn1) dephosphorylated INSR in vivo. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) was critical for 20E-induced INSR dephosphorylation by maintaining the transcription factor Forkhead box O (FoxO) in the nucleus, where FoxO promoted Ptpn1 expression and repressed Insr expression. Knockdown of Ptpn1 using RNA interference maintained INSR phosphorylation, increased 20E production, and accelerated pupation. RNA interference of Insr in larvae repressed larval growth, decreased 20E production, delayed pupation, and accumulated hemolymph glucose levels.

Insulin maintains normal blood glucose levels; however, the steroid hormones counteract insulin function and increase blood glucose levels, even cause diabetes (7Hwang J.L. Weiss R.E. Steroid-induced diabetes: A clinical and molecular approach to understanding and treatment.Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2014; 30: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For example, glucocorticoids, which are widely used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs (5Elena C. Chiara M. Angelica B. Chiara M.A. Laura N. Chiara C. Claudio C. Antonella F. Nicola G.

Pract. 2018; 5: 170-175PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. The regulation of hemolymph glucose levels by 20E and its mechanism are also unclear. The insulin receptor (INSR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in the insulin pathway by binding its ligand (insulin) to regulate glucose, fatty acids, and protein metabolism to promote growth (9Gabbouj S. Ryhanen S. Marttinen M. Wittrahm R. Takalo M. Kemppainen S. Martiskainen H. Tanila H. Haapasalo A. Hiltunen M. Natunen T. Altered insulin signaling in Alzheimer's disease brain - special emphasis on PI3K-Akt pathway.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 629Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). INSR is a constitutive homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein (10Mohammadiarani H. Vashisth H. All-atom structural models of the transmembrane domains of insulin and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptors.Front. Endocrinol. 2016; 7: 68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comprising two α and two β subunits linked by disulfide bridges (11Tatulian S.A. Structural dynamics of insulin receptor and transmembrane signaling.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). INSR is encoded by the Insr gene as a single protein. A protease, furin, cleaves the protein into the α and β subunits, named INSRα and INSRβ, respectively (12Bass J. Turck C. Rouard M. Steiner D.F. Furin-mediated processing in the early secretory pathway: Sequential cleavage and degradation of misfolded insulin receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11905-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). INSRα has insulin-binding sites and is located outside the cell membrane. INSRβ contains a transmembrane domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase elements (13Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. The human insulin receptor cDNA: The structural basis for hormone-activated transmembrane signalling.Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Insulin binding causes a conformational change and autophosphorylation of INSRβ, resulting in phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-diphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (14Czech M.P. Yu K.T. Lewis R.E. Davis R.J. Mottola C. MacDonald R.G. Necessary P.C. Corvera S. Insulin receptor kinase and its mode of signaling membrane components.Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1985; 1: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). PIP3 attracts AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (9Gabbouj S. Ryhanen S. Marttinen M. Wittrahm R. Takalo M. Kemppainen S. Martiskainen H. Tanila H. Haapasalo A. Hiltunen M. Natunen T. Altered insulin signaling in Alzheimer's disease brain - special emphasis on PI3K-Akt pathway.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 629Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). AKT phosphorylates AS160 protein, which promotes glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the cell membrane for glucose uptake into the cell from blood (9Gabbouj S. Ryhanen S. Marttinen M. Wittrahm R. Takalo M. Kemppainen S. Martiskainen H. Tanila H. Haapasalo A. Hiltunen M. Natunen T. Altered insulin signaling in Alzheimer's disease brain - special emphasis on PI3K-Akt pathway.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 629Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). AKT also phosphorylates Forkhead box O (FoxO), a negative regulator of the insulin pathway, to locate FoxO in the cytoplasm, thus blocking its transcriptional activity in the nucleus (15Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Cell-autonomous regulation of cell and organ growth in Drosophila by Akt/PKB.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The above insulin-induced events can be reversed by the pathway's negative regulator, phosphatase, and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), also named as MMAC1 (mutated in multiple advanced cancer 1), or TEP1 (TGF-regulated and epithelial cell-enriched phosphatase) (16Goberdhan D.C. Paricio N. Goodman E.C. Mlodzik M. Wilson C. Drosophila tumor suppressor PTEN controls cell size and number by antagonizing the Chico/PI3-kinase signaling pathway.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3244-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The INSR-mediated insulin signaling pathway and its downstream signaling molecules are structurally and functionally conserved throughout evolution from worms to mammals (17Das D. Arur S. Conserved insulin signaling in the regulation of oocyte growth, development, and maturation.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 444-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Insulin promotes growth and ecdysone production in the prothoracic gland (PG), and in turn, the increased 20E level counteracts insulin function and promotes insect metamorphosis (18Mirth C. Truman J.W. Riddiford L.M. The role of the prothoracic gland in determining critical weight for metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1796-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 20E regulates the nuclear localization of transcription factor FoxO to counteract the role of insulin in promoting growth in Drosophila melanogaster (19Colombani J. Bianchini L. Layalle S. Pondeville E. Dauphin-Villemant C. Antoniewski C. Carre C. Noselli S. Leopold P. Antagonistic actions of ecdysone and insulins determine final size in Drosophila.Science. 2005; 310: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In Helicoverpa armigera, 20E upregulates Pten expression to repress AKT phosphorylation; therefore, FoxO cannot be phosphorylated by AKT and enters the nucleus to induce downstream gene transcription in the 20E pathway (20Cai M.J. Zhao W.L. Jing Y.P. Song Q. Zhang X.Q. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. 20-Hydroxyecdysone activates Forkhead box O to promote proteolysis during Helicoverpa armigera molting.Development. 2016; 143: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, a high 20E titer inhibits Pdk1 expression and represses AKT and FoxO phosphorylation, resulting in FoxO nuclear localization to induce autophagy and repress cell proliferation in H. armigera (21Pan J. Di Y.Q. Li Y.B. Chen C.H. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. Insulin and 20-hydroxyecdysone oppose each other in the regulation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 expression during insect pupation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 18613-18623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All these studies indicate that 20E counteracts the insulin pathway; however, whether 20E exerts this effect from the beginning of the insulin pathway by repressing INSR phosphorylation and expression, and the consequence, is unknown. To understand the mechanisms by which steroid hormones counteract the insulin pathway, we used the lepidopteran insect H. armigera, an agricultural pest, as a model, and the well-known factors in insulin pathway as readouts for the study. Our study revealed that INSR plays roles in insect larval growth and therefore promotes 20E production to reach a critical titer during larval feeding stages. 20E induces the dephosphorylation of INSR to repress the insulin pathway. Thus, the steroid hormone 20E counteracts the insulin pathway to stop larval growth and accumulate hemolymph glucose. H. armigera completes six larval instars, pupae, and adult stages in about 1 month (22Zhao X.-F. Progress in understanding hormonal regulation during the postembryonic development of Helicoverpa armigera.J. Integr. Agric. 2020; 19: 1417-1428Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To study the function of INSR, its abundance and phosphorylation profiles during development were examined. Two commercially available antibodies against human non-phospho-INSRβ (INSRβ) and phospho-INSRβ (p-INSRβ) were used for western blotting to detect changes in the INSR protein levels and changes in protein phosphorylation. INSRβ was detected as a single band using the anti-INSRβ antibody in the epidermis, midgut, and fat body. INSRβ levels increased during feeding stages from the sixth instar 6 h to 48 h (sixth-6 h–sixth-48 h) and decreased during metamorphosis from the sixth instar larvae 72 h (sixth-72 h) to the adult (Fig. 1, A and B). The antibody against INSRβ recognized H. armigera INSRβ-His specifically, with a lower molecular band representing the endogenous INSRβ (Fig. S1A). The mRNA levels of Insr showed similar expression profiles to that of the protein (Fig. S1B). These data suggested that INSR expression was reduced during metamorphosis. To determine the profile of INSRβ phosphorylation, an antibody against p-INSRβ was used after enrichment of same amount of INSRβ to overcome the different expression levels of INSRβ during metamorphosis. Higher levels of p-INSRβ during the larval feeding stages (5F and sixth-6 h–sixth-48 h) compared with that during the metamorphic stages (sixth-72 h–sixth-120 h) were detected (Fig. 1C). INSRβ was detected as two bands using the anti-INSRβ antibody and a 7.5% low-concentration gel (Fig. 1D). Lambda protein phosphatase (λPPase) treatment decreased the intensity of the p-INSRβ band, suggesting that the upper band was the phosphorylated form of INSRβ (p-INSRβ) (Fig. S1C). These results suggested that phosphorylation of INSRβ occurs at a lower level during metamorphosis. The 20E titer in vivo appeared to increase from 0.5 μM to 10 μM from larval growth to metamorphosis in H. armigera (23Di Y.Q. Han X.L. Kang X.L. Wang D. Chen C.H. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F.

Zhao Y.M. Han X.L. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone binds to dopamine receptor to repress lepidopteran insect feeding and promote pupation.PLoS Genet. 2019; 15e1008331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To address the mechanism of the lower level and phosphorylation of INSRβ during metamorphosis, we investigated the roles of insulin and 20E in these events by injecting different concentrations of insulin and 20E into the sixth instar 6 h larvae hemocoel. Increasing concentrations of insulin increased INSRβ levels and phosphorylation in the larval epidermis (Fig. 2A). The increased levels of phosphorylated INSRβ were confirmed using the anti-p-INSRβ antibody after normalization of the INSRβ levels by affinity enrichment of INSRβ (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a higher concentration of 20E (500 ng) decreased INSRβ levels (Fig. 2C) and phosphorylation, detected after affinity enrichment of INSRβ (Fig. 2D). In addition, a high concentration of 20E (5 μM) was confirmed to repress insulin-induced INSRβ levels and phosphorylation in HaEpi cells (Fig. 2, E and F), which represented a model to study INSR in cells. These results suggested that high concentration of 20E represses INSRβ levels and phosphorylation. INSRβ undergoes autophosphorylation by binding insulin (14Czech M.P. Yu K.T. Lewis R.E. Davis R.J. Mottola C. MacDonald R.G. Necessary P.C. Corvera S. Insulin receptor kinase and its mode of signaling membrane components.Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1985; 1: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, a deficiency of insulin might be the reason for the decrease of INSRβ phosphorylation. However, eight ILPs were identified by BLAST searching of the H. armigera genome using the sequences of 38 Bombyx mori ILPs, 8 Drosophila ILPs (25Lin F. Hossain M.A. Post S. Karashchuk G. Tatar M. De Meyts P. Wade J.D. Total solid-phase synthesis of biologically active Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (DILP2).Aust. J. Chem. 2017; 70: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and 10 Homo sapiens ILPs (Fig. S2), and which ILP binds to INSR was not known; therefore, the expression levels of all Ilp genes were detected to address the insulin levels. Surprisingly, the mRNA levels of eight Ilp genes increased in the epidermis, midgut, and fat body during metamorphosis from the wandering stage to the later pupal stage, as assessed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. S3, A–H). The Ilp genes in the brain also exhibited increased expression during metamorphosis, in addition to B10-like, whose relationship with INSRβ requires further study (Fig. S3I). Compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, 20E-injected in larvae increased their expression of B2-like, B10-like, and C1-like in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig. S3, J–O). These findings suggested that the expression levels of most Ilp genes are sufficient during metamorphosis and are thus not the reason for the decrease in INSRβ phosphorylation; therefore, INSRβ is likely dephosphorylated by some protein phosphatases under 20E regulation during metamorphosis. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, was used to test the above hypothesis in HaEpi cells. Insulin-induced INSRβ phosphorylation was compared with that in the PBS control. 20E inhibited the insulin-induced INSRβ phosphorylation, compared with that of the DMSO control; however, 20E could not inhibit INSRβ phosphorylation after the cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (Fig. 3, A and C), suggesting that 20E inhibited INSRβ phosphorylation by promoting the synthesis of certain proteins. Further experiments showed that phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Cat. 20109ES05) repressed 20E-induced INSRβ dephosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and D), implying that 20E acts via a protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate INSRβ. To determine the phosphatase that phosphorylates INSRβ, we identified three highly expressed protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (PTPase) genes, Ptpn1, Mtmr6, and Ptprn2, during metamorphosis from the midgut transcriptomes at the sixth-24 h feeding stage and sixth-72 h metamorphic stage, using the Illumina sequencing platform, a database produced in our laboratory. The transcriptome had only been determined once; therefore, the phosphatases were further examined for their developmental expression profiles in tissues using qRT-PCR. The transcript levels of the three PTPases increased in the midgut during the metamorphic stages (sixth-72 h to adult) compared with that in the feeding stages (sixth-6 h–sixth-48 h) (Fig. 4A), and 20E increased their expression (Fig. 4B), suggesting that they might be involved in 20E-induced INSRβ dephosphorylation. To identify which of the three PTPases dephosphorylates INSRβ, we knocked down their expression in HaEpi cells using RNAi, separately. Insulin induced INSRβ phosphorylation, compared with PBS, and 20E decreased insulin-induced INSRβ phosphorylation compared with DMSO. However, knockdown of Ptpn1 maintained INSRβ phosphorylation, whereas after knockdown of Mtmr6 and Ptprn2, 20E still induced INSRβ dephosphorylation, compared with dsGFP (Fig. 4, C and D). The efficacy of PTPase knockdown was demonstrated using qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. S4). Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments using the antibody against INSRβ (anti-INSRβ) confirmed that the overexpressed PTP1B-GFP-His protein interacted with INSRβ under 20E induction (Fig. 4E). These data suggested that PTP1B dephosphorylates INSRβ. PTEN is a dual-function phosphatase playing roles in the cell membrane (26Jamaspishvili T. Berman D.M. Ross A.E. Scher H.I. De Marzo A.M. Squire J.A. Lotan T.L. Clinical implications of PTEN loss in prostate cancer.Nat. Rev. Urol. 2018; 15: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and its expression is upregulated by 20E during metamorphosis (20Cai M.J. Zhao W.L. Jing Y.P. Song Q. Zhang X.Q. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. 20-Hydroxyecdysone activates Forkhead box O to promote proteolysis during Helicoverpa armigera molting.Development. 2016; 143: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); therefore, its involvement in INSRβ dephosphorylation was examined. The mRNA levels of Pten increased during metamorphosis from the wandering stage to the pupal stage in the epidermis, midgut, and fat body (Fig. 5A). A 20E receptor EcR-binding element (EcRE) 5′-AATGGCAATGACTAC-3′ (−1060 to −1074 bp, relative to ATG) was predicted (http://jaspardev.genereg.net/) in the promoter region of Pten. 20E increased the transcript level of Pten in a dose- and time-dependent manner, compared with that in the DMSO control (Fig. S5, A and B). In HaEpi cells, 20E reduced the insulin induced-p-INSRβ levels; however, knockdown of Pten blocked 20E-induced dephosphorylation of INSRβ, compared with dsGFP. In contrast, overexpression of Pten decreased INSRβ phosphorylation in the absence of 20E induction, compared with that in cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 5B). The statistical analysis confirmed the data (Fig. 5C). The efficacy of Pten knockdown was demonstrated using qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5C), and the overexpression of Pten was indicated using western blotting (Fig. S5D). However, Co-IP experiments did not identify an interaction between INSRβ and PTEN (Fig. S5E). These results indicated that PTEN is involved in INSRβ dephosphorylation, but it cannot interact with INSRβ directly. A previous study showed that PTEN induces FoxO nuclear localization by repressing AKT and FoxO phosphorylation in H. armigera under 20E induction (20Cai M.J. Zhao W.L. Jing Y.P. Song Q. Zhang X.Q. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. 20-Hydroxyecdysone activates Forkhead box O to promote proteolysis during Helicoverpa armigera molting.Development. 2016; 143: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); therefore, PTEN was suspected to play roles in 20E-induced INSRβ dephosphorylation by regulating FoxO nuclear localization, thereby promoting Ptpn1 expression. Therefore, FoxO fused with a GFP tag was overexpressed in HaEpi cells to address the mechanism of PTEN’s involvement in 20E-induced INSRβ dephosphorylation, with GFP showing the subcellular location of FoxO. FoxO-GFP and GFP were confirmed as overexpressed in HaEpi cells, separately (Fig. S6A). The overexpressed FoxO-GFP was localized in the nucleus in the PBS control and translocated into the cytoplasm after insulin induction. Compared with the insulin plus DMSO control, 20E reversed insulin’s function and maintained FoxO-GFP’s nuclear localization. However, compared with dsRFP plus insulin and 20E, after knockdown of Pten, 20E could not maintain FoxO-GFP’s nuclear localization (Fig. 6A). The control group overexpressing the GFP tag did not show the subcellular variation in FoxO localization (Fig. S6B), confirming that PTEN determines FoxO-GFP nuclear localization. The effect of FoxO-GFP nuclear localization on the expression of PTP1B was examined to address its role in PTP1B expression. A FoxO-binding element (FoxOBE) 5′-TTGTTAAC-3′ (−980 to −973 bp, relative to ATG) was predicted in the promoter region of Ptpn1, which was similar to the FoxOBE sequence (5′-TTGTTTAC-3′) in the promoter region of H. armigera BrZ7 (20Cai M.J. Zhao W.L. Jing Y.P. Song Q. Zhang X.Q. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. 20-Hydroxyecdysone activates Forkhead box O to promote proteolysis during Helicoverpa armigera molting.Development. 2016; 143: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the FoxO-GFP overexpressing cells, the Ptpn1 level increased compared with that in the GFP overexpressing cells (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the overexpressed FoxO-GFP enhanced Ptpn1 expression. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that FoxO-GFP bound more FoxOBE under 20E treatment than it did in the DMSO treatment control using the primer FoxOBE of Ptpn1 (FoxOBE-Ptpn1-F/FoxOBE-Ptpn1-R primers targeting the Ptpn1 FoxOBE-containing sequence, as shown in the Table S1). The IgG negative control and Ptpn1 primers (Ptpn1-F/R located in the open reading frame (ORF) of Ptpn1) did not produce the same results (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that 20E via FoxO promotes Ptpn1 transcription. Next, the effect of FoxO-GFP nuclear localization on the level of INSRβ was examined because another kind of FoxOBE, 5′-TGTTTAC-3′ (−1835 to −1829 bp, relative to ATG), was predicted in the promoter region of Insr. Interestingly, in the FoxO-GFP overexpressing cells, the protein level of INSRβ decreased, in addition to decrease of INSRβ phosphorylation by PTP1B (Fig. 6D), suggesting that overexpression of FoxO-GFP repressed Insr expression. ChIP results further showed that FoxO-GFP bound more FoxOBE than GFP, using the primer FoxOBE of Insr (FoxOBE-Insr-F/FoxOBE-Insr-R primers targeting the Insr FoxOBE containing sequence, as shown in the Table S1). The IgG negative control and Insr primers (Insr-F/R, located in the open reading frame of Insr Table S1) did not produce the same results (Fig. 6E). These findings suggested that FoxO is the repressor of Insr transcription. To examine the function of PTP1B in vivo, we knocked down Ptpn1 by injecting dsPtpn1 into the sixth instar 6 h larval hemocoel. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of Ptpn1 was successfully knocked down in the epidermis (Fig. 7A). The level of phosphorylated INSRβ after injection of dsPtpn1 was significantly higher than that in the dsGFP control group (Fig. 7B), which confirmed the role of PTP1B in INSRβ dephosphorylation in vivo. As a consequence, the major effects of knockdown of Ptpn1 were the production of smaller pupae (Fig. 7, C–E) and earlier pupation, compared with that in the control group (Fig. 7F). In addition, the larval midgut appeared red, which normally occurs during larval midgut programmed cell death (PCD) during metamorphosis (27Hakim R.S. Baldwin K. Smagghe G. Regulation of midgut growth, development, and metamorphosis.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2010; 55: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Wang J.L. Jiang X.J. Wang Q. Hou L.J. Xu D.W. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. Identification and expression profile of a putative basement membrane protein gene in the midgut of Helicoverpa armigera.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in the dsPtpn1 group, but not in the dsGFP-treated larval midgut at the same time after injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fig. 7G). This suggested that the larvae of dsPtpn1 entered metamorphosis earlier than the control group. The 20E titer in the hemolymph was 5 μM, which was higher than that (2.5 μM) in the dsGFP control (Fig. 7H), indicating that maintaining phosphorylation of INSRβ increased 20E production, which accelerated pupation. To examine the function of INSR in insect growth and insulin function, we injected dsInsr into fifth instar 24 h larvae to knock down Insr. Western blotting showed that the level of the INSRβ protein was successfully reduced (Fig. 8A). This resulted in 30.9% death among the fifth instar and the sixth instar larvae and 59.5% small pupae (Fig. 8, B and C). Moreover, the pupal weight of the dsInsr-treated group decreased to an average of 0.26 g compared with 0.37 g of the dsGFP injection control (Fig. 8D). The pupation time was delayed significantly from 140 h to 190 h after knockdown of Insr (Fig. 8E), and the midgut appeared red later than that in the dsGFP control (Fig. 8F), suggesting that INSR plays roles in larval growth and pupation. The reason for the delayed pupation might because of insufficient 20E in the hemolymph (Fig. 8G) along with the delayed larval growth when Insr was knocked down. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of insulin pathway genes- Insr, Pi3k, and Akt were downregulated after Insr knockdown (Fig. 8H), and western blottin"
https://openalex.org/W3122436454,"The core functionality of many socio-technical systems, such as supply chains, (inter)national trade and human mobility, concern transport over large geographically-spread complex networks. The dynamical intertwining of many heterogeneous operational elements, agents and locations are oft-cited generic factors to make these systems prone to large-scale disruptions: initially localised perturbations amplify and spread over the network, leading to a complete standstill of transport. Our level of understanding of such phenomena, let alone the ability to anticipate or predict their evolution in time, remains rudimentary. We approach the problem with a prime example: railways. Analysing spreading of train delays on the network by building a physical model, supported by data, reveals that the emergence of large-scale disruptions rests on the dynamic interdependencies among multiple ‘layers’ of operational elements (resources and services). The interdependencies provide pathways for the so-called delay cascading mechanism, which gets activated when, constrained by local unavailability of on-time resources, already-delayed ones are used to operate new services. Cascading locally amplifies delays, which in turn get transported over the network to give rise to new constraints elsewhere. This mechanism is a rich addition to some well-understood ones in, e.g., epidemiological spreading, or the spreading of rumours and opinions over (contact) networks, and stimulates rethinking spreading dynamics on complex networks. Having these concepts built into the model provides it with the ability to predict the evolution of large-scale disruptions in the railways up to 30-60 minutes up front. For transport systems, our work suggests that possible alleviation of constraints as well as a modular operational approach would arrest cascading, and therefore be effective measures against large-scale disruptions."
https://openalex.org/W3123366855,"L1 syndrome is a rare developmental disorder characterized by hydrocephalus of varying severity, intellectual deficits, spasticity of the legs, and adducted thumbs. Therapy is limited to symptomatic relief. Numerous gene mutations in the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM, hereafter abbreviated L1) were identified in L1 syndrome patients, and those affecting the extracellular domain of this transmembrane type 1 glycoprotein show the most severe phenotypes. Previously analyzed rodent models of the L1 syndrome focused on L1-deficient animals or mouse mutants with abrogated cell surface expression of L1, making it difficult to test L1 function-triggering mimetic compounds with potential therapeutic value. To overcome this impasse, we generated a novel L1 syndrome mouse with a mutation of aspartic acid at position 201 in the extracellular part of L1 (p.D201N, hereafter termed L1-201) that displays a cell surface-exposed L1 accessible to the L1 mimetics. Behavioral assessment revealed an increased neurological deficit score and increased locomotor activity in male L1-201 mice carrying the mutation on the X-chromosome. Histological analyses of L1-201 mice showed features of the L1 syndrome, including enlarged ventricles and reduced size of the corpus callosum. Expression levels of L1-201 protein as well as extent of cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence labelling of cultured cerebellar neurons were normal. Importantly, treatment of these cultures with the L1 mimetic compounds duloxetine, crotamiton, and trimebutine rescued impaired cell migration and survival as well as neuritogenesis. Altogether, the novel L1 syndrome mouse model provides a first experimental proof-of-principle for the potential therapeutic value of L1 mimetic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3123870022,"Ras genes are among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human malignancies. To date, there are no successful anticancer drugs in the clinic that target Ras proteins or their pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and characterize new components that regulate Ras activity or mediate its downstream signaling. To this end, we used a combination of affinity-pulldown and mass spectrometry to search for proteins that are physically associated with KRas. One of the top hits was Radil, a gene product with a Ras-association domain. Radil is known to be a downstream effector of Rap1, inhibiting RhoA signaling to regulate cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that Radil interacted with all three isoforms of Ras including HRas, NRas, and KRas, although it exhibited the strongest interaction with KRas. Moreover, Radil interacts with GTP-bound Ras more efficiently, suggesting a possibility that Radil may be involved in Ras activation. Supporting this, ectopic expression of Radil led to transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Radil knockdown resulted in weakened activation of Ras downstream signaling components, which was coupled with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and reduced expression of mesenchymal cell markers. Moreover, Radil knockdown greatly reduced the number of adhesion foci and depolymerized actin filaments, molecular processes that facilitate cancer cell migration. Taken together, our present studies strongly suggest that Radil is an important player for regulating Ras signaling, cell adhesion, and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and may provide new directions for Ras-related anticancer drug development. Ras genes are among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human malignancies. To date, there are no successful anticancer drugs in the clinic that target Ras proteins or their pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and characterize new components that regulate Ras activity or mediate its downstream signaling. To this end, we used a combination of affinity-pulldown and mass spectrometry to search for proteins that are physically associated with KRas. One of the top hits was Radil, a gene product with a Ras-association domain. Radil is known to be a downstream effector of Rap1, inhibiting RhoA signaling to regulate cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that Radil interacted with all three isoforms of Ras including HRas, NRas, and KRas, although it exhibited the strongest interaction with KRas. Moreover, Radil interacts with GTP-bound Ras more efficiently, suggesting a possibility that Radil may be involved in Ras activation. Supporting this, ectopic expression of Radil led to transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Radil knockdown resulted in weakened activation of Ras downstream signaling components, which was coupled with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and reduced expression of mesenchymal cell markers. Moreover, Radil knockdown greatly reduced the number of adhesion foci and depolymerized actin filaments, molecular processes that facilitate cancer cell migration. Taken together, our present studies strongly suggest that Radil is an important player for regulating Ras signaling, cell adhesion, and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and may provide new directions for Ras-related anticancer drug development. Ras proteins comprise a family of small GTPases that are involved in regulating a variety of biological processes including cell survival, proliferation, and migration (1Malumbres M. Barbacid M.

Ras proteins function as binary signaling switches with “on” and “off” states, which are largely controlled by GTP and GDP binding, respectively (4Muratcioglu S. Chavan T.S. Freed B.C. Jang H.

Cell adhesion and motility play a pivotal role in normal development as they are critical for wound healing, stem cell homing, and immune cell trafficking. In normal cells, activated Ras increases cell migration, which is accompanied by extensive actin cytoskeleton remodeling (6Tse J.M. Cheng G. Tyrrell J.A. Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Boucher Y. Jain R.K.

For example, wound healing often invokes collective cell migration and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in high animals (12Campbell K. Casanova J.

At the molecular level, epithelial and mesenchymal cells express distinct sets of gene products, many of which are directly involved in cell adhesion and/or migration (14Evdokimova V. Tognon C. Ng T.

Rap1 is a ubiquitously expressed small GTPase, which plays a key role in modulating cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and endothelial barrier functions (16Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

Cancer Biol. 2019; 54: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Radil is a downstream effector of Rap1, regulating integrin activation and controlling neutrophil chemotaxis (18Ahmed S.M. Theriault B.L. Uppalapati M. Chiu C.W. Gallie B.L. Sidhu S.S. Angers S. KIF14 negatively regulates Rap1a-Radil signaling during breast cancer progression.J.

Radil consists of three notable domains including Ras-association (RA), dilute-containing (DIL), and PDZ domains (20Gingras A.R. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Bobkov A.A. Ginsberg M.H.

DIL domain was originally identified fungi containing a stretch of sequences homologous to the cargo-binding domain of class V myosins. To date, the function of DIL domain remains largely unknown. Upon activation, cytosolic Radil is capable of translocating to the plasma membrane in a Rap1a-GTP–dependent manner (18Ahmed S.M. Theriault B.L. Uppalapati M. Chiu C.W. Gallie B.L. Sidhu S.S. Angers S. KIF14 negatively regulates Rap1a-Radil signaling during breast cancer progression.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 951-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Radil causes focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and promotes cell adhesion and sustains elongated morphology (18Ahmed S.M. Theriault B.L. Uppalapati M. Chiu C.W. Gallie B.L.

Affinity pulldown coupled with mass spectrometry identified that Radil physically interacted with Ras proteins with KRas exhibiting the highest affinity. The physical interaction between Radil and Ras was influenced by the GTP-bound status of Ras. Radil knockdown led to reduced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis, which is coupled with decreased cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion. Moreover, Radil promotes expression of Vimentin, Zeb1, and Snail, transcription factors of the mesenchymal cells. Ras activities are directly mediated by various downstream components it interacts with (22Lynch S.J. Snitkin H. Gumper I. Philips M.R. Sabatini D. Pellicer A.

SUMO wrestling with Ras.Small GTPases. 2016; 7: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the function of Ras in regulating cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation, we attempted to identify new molecular components that physically interacted with Ras. We ectopically expressed HRasV12 that was tagged with the Flag moiety. Through the use of affinity pulldown and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of candidate proteins that physically interacted with Flag-tagged HRas (Fig. 1, A and B). To ascertain which proteins were enriched in the KRas IP over the empty vector control, we calculated a fold change using the spectral counts. To be able to calculate a ratio for proteins that had only been identified in the sample and not the control, we imputed the data by adding 2 spectral counts to all proteins in both samples. As expected, HRas (the bait) was the highest scored proteins (Table S1). KRas was identified as the top-interacting protein (Fig. 1B). Among others, Radil is one of the top-interacting proteins (Fig. 1B, highlighted). We first focused on characterizing Radil as it contains interesting domains. Western blotting revealed that Radil expression varied among transformed cell lines with A549 (lung carcinoma) and HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma) exhibiting high levels of expression (Fig. 1C). Given that direct physical association between Ras and Radil has not been reported in the literature, we performed a series of experiments to confirm whether Radil is a bona fide Ras-interacting protein. We transfected HEK293T cells with Flag-Radil plasmid for 24 h, after which cells were collected and lysed for coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis using the anti-Flag antibody. Flag-Radil was efficiently expressed and recovered by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). Endogenous Ras proteins were enriched in the immunoprecipitates after blotting with a pan-Ras antibody. Endogenous KRas4B (KRas thereafter) was also pulled down with Flag-Radil, suggesting that Radil physically associates with KRas. As a reciprocal approach, we transfected HEK293T cells with a Flag-KRasV12 expression plasmid for 24 h, after which the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the Flag antibody. Co-IP analysis revealed that a significant amount of Radil was enriched in Flag-KRasV12 precipitates (Fig. 2B). These combined results thus indicate that Radil physically interacts with KRas. Radil protein consists of RA, DIL, and PDZ domains (Fig. 2C). The RA domain (RAΔ) has been found in several other Ras-interacting proteins including Rin1, RASSF5, RalGDS, PLCs, and Ras GEFs (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Sabatier C. McCormick F. Signaling specificity by Ras family GTPases is determined by the full spectrum of effectors they regulate.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In fact, it is essential for mediating the interaction between Radil and Rap1, the latter being a small G-protein that plays an important role in the regulation of endothelial function (17Shah S. Brock E.J. Ji K. Mattingly R.R. Ras and Rap1: A tale of two GTPases.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2019; 54: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We then determined whether it was also required for mediating its interaction with Ras. We observed that whereas the full-length Radil was capable of pulling down both KRas and Rap1 (Fig. 2D), the deletion of the RAΔ completely abolished the interaction between Radil and Ras (and Rap1). Expression of Flag-Radil and Flag-RadilRAΔ was equally efficient (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Radil physically interacts with Ras and that RAΔ of Radil is essential for mediating the interaction. Biochemically, Ras GTPases catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. GTP-bound Ras is active, whereas GDP-bound one is inactive (1Malumbres M. Barbacid M. RAS oncogenes: The first 30 years.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 2Campbell P.M. Der C.J. Oncogenic Ras and its role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.Semin.

Cancer. 2011; 11: 761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). To test whether GTP/GDP-loading status affected the interaction between Radil and Ras, we transfected HEK293T cells for 24 h with a plasmid encoding Flag-HRas (WT HRas), constitutively active mutant (HRasV12 bound with GTP), or dominant negative mutant (HRasN17 incapable of GTP-binding). Co-IP with the Flag antibody followed by immunoblotting revealed that more Radil was associated with HRasV12 than with HRas (Fig. 3A), strongly suggesting that GTP binding affects the Radil–Ras interaction. Further supporting this notion, no Radil was detected in HRasN17 immumoprecipitates (Fig. 3A). Expression of transfected plasmids coding for various Ras proteins was comparable, and the immunoprecipitation was efficient as well. Therefore, these observations strongly suggest that Radil may positively regulate or mediate Ras activation and signaling. Ras binds to GTP, or GDP results in conformational changes (4Muratcioglu S. Chavan T.S. Freed B.C. Jang H. Khavrutskii L. Freed R.N. Dyba M.A. Stefanisko K. Tarasov S.G. Gursoy A. Keskin O. Tarasova N.I. Gaponenko V. Nussinov R. GTP-dependent K-Ras dimerization.Structure. 2015; 23: 1325-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We speculated that Radil may prefer a GTP-bound Ras conformation. To test this hypothesis, we simulated 3D conformation of Radil-RA–KRasGTP and Radil-RA–KRasGDP complexes using available software. We found that Radil displays a higher affinity to GTP-bound KRas than to GDP-bound one (Fig. 3B). Downstream effectors that mediate Ras activities are frequently isoform specific (27Nakhaeizadeh H. Amin E. Nakhaei-Rad S. Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. The RAS-effector interface: Isoform-specific differences in the effector binding regions.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0167145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Radil binds to different isoforms of Ras with a different affinity, we transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid construct coding for Flag-tagged HRas, NRas, or KRas. Plasmids expressing constitutively active mutants (V12) of each isoform were also used as controls. We observed that Radil interacted with WT KRas more efficiently than with either WT NRas or WT HRas although KRas expression was very low compared with that of either NRas or HRas (Fig. 3C). Consistent with above observations, an enhanced interaction was detected between Radil and constitutively active Ras (HRasV12, KRasV12, and NRasV12), given that expression of WT Ras and active Ras of various isoforms was comparable (Fig. 3C). We next asked how KRas might mediate the interaction with Radil. Cells transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-KRas and/or Flag-Radil were lysed, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody. We observed that Rap1 and ArhGAP29 were present in Radil immunoprecipitates, indicating that Radil constitutively interacted with Rap1 and ArhGAP29 (Fig. 3D). Radil also strongly interacted with GFP–KRas as Radil immunoprecipitates contained a high level of GFP-KRas. Interestingly, the interaction between KRas and Radil suppressed the interaction between Radil and Rap1 or ArhGAP29, suggesting that KRas competes with Rap1 and ArhGAP29 for Radil. Given that the association between Radil and Ras is affected by the GTP-binding status of Ras, we hypothesized that Radil is involved in regulating Ras activity and signaling. To test this possibility, we generated stable cell line expressing inducible KRas (293FT/Flag-KRasV12). Upon doxycycline (Dox) treatment, expression of transfected FLAG-KRas was steadily induced, leading to the activation of downstream signaling components including p-MEK and p-ERK (Fig. 4A). We then asked the role of Radil in KRasV12-activated downstream activation. 293FT/Flag-KRasV12 cells were transfected with Radil siRNAs or control sRNAs and then treated with Dox for 12 or 24 h, after which cells were analyzed for expression of transfected KRas and endogenous Radil, as well as Ras downstream signaling. We observed that knocking down Radil had no significant effect on the activation/phosphorylation of MEK by ectopically expressed KRasV12 (Fig. 4B and Fig. S1D). To further elucidate the role of Radil in modulating Ras signaling, we generated stable cell line with inducible expression of Flag-Radil (293FT/Flag-Radil). Upon Dox treatment, Flag–Radil expression was rapidly and steadily induced (Fig. 4C). Increased expression of Flag–Radil was correlated with transient activation of MEK and ERK, peaking around 4 h after Dox treatment (Fig. 4C). Intriguingly, further increase in Radil expression was correlated with suppression of p-MEK and p-ERK. To elucidate the possible mechanism of Ras regulation by Radil, we measured the level of GTP-bound Ras after induced Radil expression. We observed that treatment with Dox for about 4 h induced Radil expression, which was coupled with increased GTP–Ras as well (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, continued induction of Radil deceased the level of GTP–Ras, strongly suggesting that Radil may regulate Ras activity in a concentration-dependent manner. We next determined whether knocking down the basal level of Radil affected Ras downstream signaling. Cells transfected with siRNAs to either control or Radil for 24 h after which cells were fed 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for various times. We observed that Radil downregulation compromised phosphorylation/activation of cRaf and MEK by growth factors in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1C). These results strongly suggest that Radil is involved in regulating Ras downstream signaling. We have previously shown that KRas plays an important role in regulating cell migration, invasion, and EMT (15Choi B.H. Philips M.R. Chen Y. Lu L. Dai W. K-Ras Lys-42 is crucial for its signaling, cell migration, and invasion.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 17574-17581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine whether Radil might be also involved in these processes, we knocked down Radil and/or KRas in A549 cells and then measured their proliferation rate. We observed that compared with the control cells, knocking down either Radil or KRas significantly reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 6A). Immunoblotting revealed that Radil knockdown greatly reduced expression of vimentin (Fig. 6B and Fig. S1B), a mesenchymal marker positively associated with motility and adhesion (28Kidd M.E. Shumaker D.K. Ridge K.M. The role of vimentin intermediate filaments in the progression of lung cancer.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 50: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 29Konig K. Meder L. Kroger C.

Li S. Vimentin in cancer and its potential as a molecular target for cancer therapy.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 3033-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Radil knockdown significantly reduced the expression of Snail and Zeb1, two master transcription factors for mesenchymal cells, with a concomitant increase of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker (Fig. 6B). As expected, knockdown of KRas also caused downregulation of vimentin and snail, which was correlated with upregulation of ZO-1, an epithelial cell marker (Fig. 6B). Further supporting EMT induced by Radil and KRas, we carried out cell invasion assays after downregulation of Radil and KRas. We observed that knockdown of Radil or KRas led to reduced cell invasion and that the effect of decreased cell invasion by downregulation of Radil and Ras was additive (Fig. 6, C and D). To further understand how Radil or KRas affects cell proliferation and invasion, as well as EMT, we measured cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization after modulating either Radil or KRas expression. Cells transfected siRNAs to Radil, KRas, or both were fixed and stained with antibodies to vinculin (a component of focal adhesion [FA]) and phalloidin (staining for F-actin). Compared with control cells, Radil knockdown greatly reduced the number of FAs in the cells (Fig. 7A), which was associated with the loss of actin polymerization and a significantly reduced cell size. KRas knockdown also reduced the number of intracellular FAs and actin polymerization; it also affected the cell morphology although the cell size did not seem to be reduced as dramatically as it did with Radil siRNA (Fig. 7A). Kinase profiling revealed that expression of KRasV12 also activated FAK (Fig. S2), a protein kinase positively involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Based on the present study, we propose the following model that depicts Radil’s role in modulating KRas during cell proliferation, migration, and EMT (Fig. 7B). As a molecular component that mediates the function of growth factors, Radil interacts with and modulates KRas activity. Prolonged activation of KRas and its downstream signaling leads to enhanced expression of mesenchymal cell phenotypes coupled with suppression of epithelial cell phenotypes. We have identified Radil as a new Ras-interacting protein that plays an important role in regulating KRas activity in cell proliferation, migration, and EMT. We demonstrate that Radil interacts with all three isoforms of Ras including HRas, NRas, and KRas although it exhibits the strongest interaction with KRas. Moreover, Radil interacts with GTP-bound Ras more efficiently than it does with GDP-bound one, suggesting a possibility that Radil may be involved in regulating Ras activity. Supporting this, we show that induced expression of Radil leads to activation of MEK and ERK albeit transiently. In addition, knockdown of Radil compromises activation of Ras downstream components including cRaf and MEK1 by FBS. Intriguingly, high levels of Radil lead to reduced downstream signaling (Fig. 4C). This could be due to feedback control of KRas activity by a downstream component(s). Alternatively, high levels of intracellular Radil could promote its interaction with and activation of Rap1, also a small GTPase. Competition between Rap1 and Ras proteins for intracellular GTP would diminish the activation of KRas signaling. Supporting this, we observe that continued induction of Radil reduces the amount of GTP-bound Ras (Fig. 4D). Radil-mediated activation of Ras signaling is likely associated with its ability in promoting cell adhesion, migration, and EMT.

https://openalex.org/W3121814676,"A robust activity of the lysosomal Ca2+ channel TRPML1 is sufficient to correct cellular defects in neurodegeneration. Importantly, lysosomes are refilled by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it is unclear how TRPML1 function could be modulated by the ER. Here, we deal with this issue in rat primary cortical neurons exposed to different oxygen conditions affecting neuronal survival. Under normoxic conditions, TRPML1: (1) showed a wide distribution within soma and along neuronal processes; (2) was stimulated by the synthetic agonist ML-SA1 and the analog of its endogenous modulator, PI(3,5)P2 diC8; (3) its knockdown by siRNA strategy produced an ER Ca2+ accumulation; (4) co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with the ER-located Ca2+ sensor stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1). In cortical neurons lacking STIM1, ML-SA1 and PI(3,5)P2 diC8 failed to induce Ca2+ release and, more deeply, they induced a negligible Ca2+ passage through the channel in neurons transfected with the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3-ML1. Moreover, TRPML1/STIM1 interplay changed at low-oxygen conditions: both proteins were downregulated during the ischemic preconditioning (IPC) while during IPC followed by 1 hour of normoxia, at which STIM1 is upregulated, TRPML1 protein was reduced. However, during oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation, TRPML1 and STIM1 proteins peaked at 8 hours of reoxygenation, when the proteins were co-immunoprecipitated and reactive oxygen species (ROS) hyperproduction was measured in cortical neurons. This may lead to a persistent TRPML1 Ca2+ release and lysosomal Ca2+ loss. Collectively, we showed a new modulation exerted by STIM1 on TRPML1 activity that may differently intervene during hypoxia to regulate organellar Ca2+ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3125324301,"It has been well-established that cancer cells often display altered metabolic profiles, and recent work has concentrated on how cancer cells adapt to serine removal. Serine can be either taken exogenously or synthesized from glucose, and its regulation forms an important mechanism for nutrient integration. One of the several important metabolic roles for serine is in the generation of bioactive sphingolipids since it is the main substrate for serine palmitoyltransferase, the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of sphingolipids. Previously, serine deprivation has been connected to the action of the tumor suppressor p53, and we have previously published on a role for p53 regulating sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), an enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). SK1 is a key enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis that functions in pro-survival and tumor-promoting pathways and whose expression is also often elevated in cancers. Here we show that SK1 was degraded during serine starvation in a time and dose-dependent manner, which led to sphingosine accumulation. This was independent of effects on p53 but required the action of the proteasome. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of SK1, to compensate for SK1 loss, was detrimental to cell growth under conditions of serine starvation, demonstrating that the suppression of SK1 under these conditions is adaptive. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption decreased in response to SK1 degradation, and this was accompanied by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Suppression of ROS with N-acteylcysteine resulted in suppression of the metabolic adaptations and in decreased cell growth under serine deprivation. The effects of SK1 suppression on ROS were mimicked by D-erythro-sphingosine, whereas S1P was ineffective, suggesting that the effects of loss of SK1 were due to the accumulation of its substrate sphingosine. This study reveals a new mechanism for regulating SK1 levels and a link of SK1 to serine starvation as well as mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W3125944504,"Tissue-resident macrophages are required for homeostasis, but also contribute to tissue dysfunction in pathophysiological states. The sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) induces an anti-inflammatory and tissue-reparative phenotype in macrophages. As NE has a well-established role in promoting triglyceride lipolysis in adipocytes, and macrophages accumulate triglyceride droplets in various physiological and disease states, we investigated the effect of NE on primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage triglyceride metabolism. Surprisingly, our data show that in contrast to the canonical role of NE in stimulating lipolysis, NE acting via beta2-adrenergic receptors (B2ARs) in macrophages promotes extracellular fatty acid uptake and their storage as triglycerides and reduces free fatty acid release from triglyceride-laden macrophages. We demonstrate that these responses are mediated by a B2AR activation-dependent increase in Hilpda and Dgat1 gene expression and activity. We further show that B2AR activation favors the storage of extracellular polyunsaturated fatty acids. Finally, we present evidence that macrophages isolated from hearts after myocardial injury, for which survival critically depends on leukocyte B2ARs, have a transcriptional signature indicative of a transient triglyceride accumulation. Overall, we describe a novel and unexpected role of NE in promoting triglyceride storage in macrophages that could have potential implications in multiple diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3121740907,"ADAMTS proteases mediate biosynthesis and breakdown of secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in numerous physiological and disease processes. In addition to their catalytic domains, ADAMTS proteases contain ancillary domains, which mediate substrate recognition and ECM binding and confer distinctive properties and roles to individual ADAMTS proteases. Although alternative splicing can greatly expand the structural and functional diversity of ADAMTS proteases, it has been infrequently reported and functional consequences have been rarely investigated. Here, we characterize the structural and functional impact of alternative splicing of ADAMTS17, mutations in which cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome 4. Two novel ADAMTS17 splice variants, ADAMTS17A and ADAMTS17B, were investigated by structural modeling, mass spectrometry, and biochemical approaches. Our results identify a novel disulfide-bridged insertion in the ADAMTS17A spacer that originates from inclusion of a novel exon. This insertion results in differential autoproteolysis of ADAMTS17, and thus, predicts altered proteolytic activity against other substrates. The second variant, ADAMTS17B, results from an in-frame exon deletion and prevents ADAMTS17B secretion. Thus, alternative splicing of the ADAMTS spacer significantly regulates the physiologically relevant proteolytic activity of ADAMTS17, either by altering proteolytic specificity (ADAMTS17A) or by altering cellular localization (ADAMTS17B)."
https://openalex.org/W3122891914,"Human Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19) and mouse ortholog Fgf15 play similar roles in liver regeneration and metabolism via the activation of Fgfr4/b-klotho (Klb). Monomeric FGF19 and dimeric Fgf15 are both necessary for liver regeneration and proper bile acid (BA) metabolism. FGF19 elicits stronger effects than Fgf15 on glucose and fatty acid metabolism and only FGF19 induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, inhibiting FGF19/FGFR4 signaling in HCC patients is associated with toxicity due to elevated BA levels. Here, we examine the structure/function relationship in Fgf15/FGF19 to better understand the molecular basis for their distinct functions. We demonstrate that FGF19 is a more effective activator of Fgfr4 and of downstream signaling (Erk, Plcg1) than Fgf15. Furthermore, we use site-directed mutagenesis to show that the presence or absence of an unpaired cysteine in Fgf15/19 modulates ligand structure and determines the ability of these molecules to induce hepatocyte proliferation, with monomers being more potent activators. Consistent with these findings, an engineered dimeric variant of FGF19 is less effective than wild-type FGF19 at inducing liver growth in cooperation with the Wnt-enhancer RSPO3. In contrast to effects on proliferation, monomeric and dimeric ligands equally inhibited the expression of Cyp7a1, the enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step in BA production. Thus, structure and function of Fgf15/FGF19 are intricately linked, explaining why FGF19, but not Fgf15, induces liver tumorigenesis. Our data provide insight into FGF19/FGFR4 signaling and may inform strategies to target this pathway while limiting on-target toxicity due to dysregulation of BA production or induction of hepatocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3123156450,"Infection with Influenza A virus can lead to the development of encephalitis and subsequent neurological deficits ranging from headaches to neurodegeneration. Post-encephalitic parkinsonism has been reported in surviving patients of H1N1 infections, but not all cases of encephalitic H1N1 infection present with these neurological symptoms, suggesting that interactions with an environmental neurotoxin could promote more severe neurological damage. The heavy metal, manganese (Mn), is a potential interacting factor with H1N1 because excessive exposure early in life can induce long-lasting effects on neurological function through inflammatory activation of glial cells. In the current study, we used a two-hit model of neurotoxin-pathogen exposure to examine whether exposure to Mn during juvenile development would induce a more severe neuropathological response following infection with H1N1 in adulthood. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MnCl 2 in drinking water (50 mg/kg/day) for 30 days from days 21–51 postnatal, then infected intranasally with H1N1 three weeks later. Analyses of dopaminergic neurons, microglia and astrocytes in basal ganglia indicated that although there was no significant loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta, there was more pronounced activation of microglia and astrocytes in animals sequentially exposed to Mn and H1N1, as well as altered patterns of histone acetylation. Whole transcriptome Next Generation Sequencing (RNASeq) analysis was performed on the substantia nigra and revealed unique patterns of gene expression in the dual-exposed group, including genes involved in antioxidant activation, mitophagy and neurodegeneration. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to elevated levels of Mn during juvenile development could sensitize glial cells to more severe neuro-immune responses to influenza infection later in life through persistent epigenetic changes."
https://openalex.org/W3125095863,"Intestinal epithelial cells are tightly bound by tight junction proteins (TJP) which are dynamic and sensitive to environmental stress. However, the role of the endocytic pathway in the regulation of TJP abundance and tight junction integrity during nutrient stress is poorly understood. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the regulation of TJP abundance during nutrient starvation and the role of the endocytic mechanism in this process. IPEC-J2 cells were subjected to nutrient starvation in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) and abundance of TJP, an indication of tight junction remodeling, was characterized with RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. Abundance of TJP was dynamically regulated by nutrient starvation. The protein levels of claudin-1, 3, and 4 were initially downregulated within the first 6 hours of starvation, and then, increased thereafter (P < .01). However, there was no change in occludin and ZO-1. Lysosome and proteasome inhibitors were used to determine the contribution of these protein degradation pathways to the TJP remodeling. Short-term starvation-induced degradation of claudin-1, 3, and 4 was found to be lysosome dependent. Specifically, the downregulation of claudin-3 and 4 was via a dynamin-dependent, but clathrin and caveolae independent, endocytic pathway and this downregulation was partly reversed by amino acids supplementation. Interestingly, the re-synthesis of TJP with prolonged starvation partly depended on proteasome function. Collectively, this study, for the first time, elucidated a major role for dynamin-dependent endocytosis of claudin-3 and 4 during nutrient stress in intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, transient endocytosis inhibition may be a potential mechanism for preserving tight junction integrity and function in metabolic or pathological states such as inflammatory bowel disease that involves destruction of intestinal epithelial TJP."
https://openalex.org/W3125338465,"Background Resistance training has a positive impact on functional capacity and muscle mass in the elderly. However, due to physical limitations or a simple aversion against regular exercise, a majority of the elderly do not reach the recommended exercise doses. This led us to evaluate the effect of whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS), a novel, time-efficient, and smooth training technology on physical function, fat-free mass, strength, falls-efficacy, and social participation of the elderly. Methods The present study is a randomized, parallel group clinical trial approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution. Sixty-six volunteers (age ≥ 60 years) will be recruited from the geriatric outpatient department in a tertiary hospital and primary care units and randomized into two groups: WB-EMS group or active control group (aCG). The WB-EMS or aCG protocol will consist of 16 sessions for 8 consecutive weeks, twice per week. The primary outcomes will be maximal isometric knee extension (IKE), functional lower extremity strength, fat-free mass, gait speed, and risk of falls measured before and after intervention. The secondary outcomes will be social participation and falls-efficacy assessed before and after the intervention and at three and six months of follow-up. Participant’s satisfaction with and awareness of electrical stimulation therapy will also be assessed immediately after the 8-week intervention. Discussion Patients receiving WB-EMS exercises are believed to have better outcomes than those receiving conventional, more time-consuming resistance exercises. Hence, innovative, time-efficient, joint-friendly, and highly individualized exercise technologies (such as WB-EMS) may be a good choice for the elderly with time constraints, physical limitations, or little enthusiasm, who are exercising less than the recommended amounts for impact on muscle mass, strength, and function."
https://openalex.org/W3125913486,"In recent times, China has emphasized five major development concepts to promote high-quality development: coordination, green, innovation, openness, and sharing. As a metamorphosis of these ideas, Chinese science and technology parks (STPs) are gathering areas of high-tech industries and represent advanced productive forces. Their greenness, openness, and innovative developments herald the future development trends of China. Based on the data of 52 STPs in China from 2011 to 2018, this study analyzes the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) quantity and quality on the low-carbon development of the STPs. We use Hansen’s nonlinear panel threshold regression model with knowledge accumulation as the threshold variable. The results show the following: First, there are complex nonlinear relationships between FDI quantity, FDI quality, and the low-carbon development of the STPs. Second, FDI quantity has a significant positive impact on the low-carbon development of the STPs only when the level of knowledge accumulation is below a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold the effect is no longer significant. Third, FDI quality has a significant positive impact on the low-carbon development of STPs only when the level of knowledge accumulation is lower than a certain threshold; beyond which, the impact is no longer significant. These results can serve as a reference for China to effectively promote economic low-carbon growth of STPs and achieve green, open, and innovative development."
https://openalex.org/W3102903815,"Controlling unmodified serotonin levels in brain synapses is a primary objective when treating major depressive disorder-a disease that afflicts ∼20% of the world's population. Roughly 60% of patients respond poorly to first-line treatments and thus new therapeutic strategies are sought. To this end, we have constructed isoform-specific inhibitors of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A3 (SULT1A3)-the isoform responsible for sulfonating ∼80% of the serotonin in the extracellular brain fluid. The inhibitor design includes a core ring structure, which anchors the inhibitor into a SULT1A3-specific binding pocket located outside the active site, and a side chain crafted to act as a latch to inhibit turnover by fastening down the SULT1A3 active-site cap. The inhibitors are allosteric, they bind with nanomolar affinity and are highly specific for the 1A3 isoform. The cap-stabilizing effects of the latch can be accurately calculated and are predicted to extend throughout the cap and into the surrounding protein. A free-energy correlation demonstrates that the percent inhibition at saturating inhibitor varies linearly with cap stabilization - the correlation is linear because the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle, nucleotide release, scales linearly with the fraction of enzyme in the cap-open form. Inhibitor efficacy in cultured cells was studied using a human mammary epithelial cell line that expresses SULT1A3 at levels comparable with those found in neurons. The inhibitors perform similarly in ex vivo and in vitro studies; consequently, SULT1A3 turnover can now be potently suppressed in an isoform-specific manner in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W3122644100,"During the late phase of HIV-1 infection, viral Gag polyproteins are targeted to the plasma membrane (PM) for assembly. Gag localization at the PM is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the envelope protein (Env) into budding particles. Gag assembly and Env incorporation are mediated by the N-terminal myristoylated matrix (MA) domain of Gag. Nonconservative mutations in the trimer interface of MA (A45E, T70R, and L75G) were found to impair Env incorporation and infectivity, leading to the hypothesis that MA trimerization is an obligatory step for Env incorporation. Conversely, Env incorporation can be rescued by a compensatory mutation in the MA trimer interface (Q63R). The impact of these MA mutations on the structure and trimerization properties of MA is not known. In this study, we employed NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and sedimentation techniques to characterize the structure and trimerization properties of HIV-1 MA A45E, Q63R, T70R, and L75G mutant proteins. NMR data revealed that these point mutations did not alter the overall structure and folding of MA but caused minor structural perturbations in the trimer interface. Analytical ultracentrifugation data indicated that mutations had a minimal effect on the MA monomer-trimer equilibrium. The high-resolution X-ray structure of the unmyristoylated MA Q63R protein revealed hydrogen bonding between the side chains of adjacent Arg-63 and Ser-67 on neighboring MA molecules, providing the first structural evidence for an additional intermolecular interaction in the trimer interface. These findings advance our knowledge of the interplay of MA trimerization and Env incorporation into HIV-1 particles."
https://openalex.org/W3123921865,"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a global problem with high mortality. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood. To reveal new serum feature of AECOPD and their potential implications, we have analyzed 180 serum samples, and found that in the serum of AECOPD patients, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts are dynamically increased as partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) drops, which is accompanied by progressively decreasing thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and thioredoxin (Trx1), as compared with those of healthy people. This phenomenon is unique, because acute hypoxia patients have 1.1-fold or 1.7-fold higher serum TrxR1 or Trx1 activity, respectively, than healthy people, in keeping with low 4HNE level. Moreover, serum 4HNE-protein adducts may form disulfide-linked complexes with high-molecular-weight, the amount of which is significantly increased during AECOPD. Serum 4HNE-protein adducts include 4HNE-Trx1 adduct and 4HNE-TrxR1 adduct, but only the former is significantly increased during AECOPD. Through cell biology, biochemistry and proteomics methods, we have demonstrated that extracellular 4HNE and 4HNE-Trx1 adduct affect human bronchial epithelial cells via different mechanisms. 4HNE-Trx1 adduct may significantly alter the expression of proteins involved mainly in RNA metabolism, but it has no effect on TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability. On the other hand, low levels of 4HNE promote TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability, while high levels of 4HNE inhibit TrxR1/Trx1 expression and cell viability, during which Trx1, at least in part, mediate the 4HNE action. Our data suggest that increasing serum 4HNE and decreasing serum Trx1 in AECOPD patients are closely related to the pathological processes of the disease. This finding also provides a new basis for AECOPD patients to use antioxidant drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3125195095,"Cellular viral reservoirs are rapidly established in tissues upon HIV-1/SIV infection, which persist throughout viral infection, even under long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART). Specific integrins are involved in the homing of cells to gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and inflamed tissues, which may promote the seeding and dissemination of HIV-1/SIV to these tissue sites. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of prophylactic integrin blockade (α4β7 antibody or α4β7/α4β1 dual antagonist TR-14035) on viral infection, as well as dissemination and seeding of viral reservoirs in systemic and lymphoid compartments post-SIV inoculation. The results showed that blockade of α4β7/α4β1 did not decrease viral infection, replication, or reduce viral reservoir size in tissues of rhesus macaques after SIV infection, as indicated by equivalent levels of plasma viremia and cell-associated SIV RNA/DNA to controls. Surprisingly, TR-14035 administration in acute SIV infection resulted in consistently higher viremia and more rapid disease progression. These findings suggest that integrin blockade alone fails to effectively control viral infection, replication, dissemination, and reservoir establishment in HIV-1/SIV infection. The use of integrin blockade for prevention or/and therapeutic strategies requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3122136121,"Introduction Quality work environment has been established as a marker of employee value creation. A plethora of qualitative evidence suggested that sustained focus on employee satisfaction through changes in the work environment, communication of patient-centered care strategic vision, management of staff workload, and workplace social support are factors that stimulate Patient-centered care. Yet, it seems that the effect of work environment on the patient-centered behavior of hospital employees has not been statistically estimated, and it is unclear which of the elements of the work environment best predict patient-centered behavior. Methods Using a survey design and quantitative methods to gather and analyze data, a sample of 179 respondents from three district hospitals were included in the study using a multi-stage proportional sampling technique. Data were collected using self-administered Likert item questionnaires. Simple linear regression was used to estimate the influence of work environment elements on patient-centered behavior. Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the best predictors of patient-centered behavior of hospital employees. Results Perceived internal communication of patient-centered care strategies (β = 0.23; P&lt;0.001), supervisor support (β = 0.31; P&lt;0.001), coworker support (β = 0.50; P&lt;0.001), and working conditions (β = 0.18; P&lt;0.013) had a positive significant effect on patient-centered behavior of employees. Good predictors of employees’ patient-centered behavior were perceived coworker support (β = 0.51; P&lt;0.001) and job characteristics (β = 0.16; P&lt;0.01). Conclusion The work environment of hospital employees significantly affects their patient-centered behavior. Co-worker support and job characteristics were the best predictors of the patient-centered behavior of hospital employees. Hospitals Managers seeking to improve patient-centered behavior through employee value creation may consider improved job characteristics in combination with workplace social support and or communication of PCC strategies and goals."

In the past twenty years, several crystal structures of AC in isolated form and complexed to G α s subunits have been resolved. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of the inhibition mechanism of AC, induced by G α i , is still far from being fully understood. Here, classical molecular dynamics simulations of the isolated holo AC protein type 5 and the holo binary complex AC5:G α i have been analyzed to investigate the conformational impact of G α i association on ATP-bound AC5.

Fatty acids (FAs) are essential constituents of biological membranes, energy storage, and precursor of signaling molecules. Mammalian cells contain FAs with different carbon number, which have both structural and functional diversity. Long-chain FAs (LCFAs) have 11 to 20 carbons, among which C16 and C18 species are the most abundant. Very-long-chain FAs (VLCFAs) have >20 carbons. Although the amount of VLCFAs is generally lower than that of LCFAs, VLCFAs have various functions that are not complemented by LCFAs, such as skin barrier formation, myelin formation and maintenance, retinal function, and spermatogenesis (1Guillou H.

Although an LCFA palmitate (C16:0) is synthesized by FA synthase in the cytosol, VLCFAs are synthesized by the FA elongation cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which repetitively adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to acyl-CoA (5Menendez J.A.

This cycle consists of four reactions: (1) condensation of acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to produce 3-ketoacyl-CoA, (2) reduction of 3-ketoacyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, (3) dehydration of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to trans-2-enoyl-CoA, and (4) reduction of trans-2-enoyl-CoA to the elongated acyl-CoA.

In addition to the FA elongation, the reductase activity of TER has been shown to be involved in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism. S1P, which is produced by phosphorylating sphingosine, is a potent lipid mediator that acts as a ligand for five G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) (S1P1–5) (9Stepanovska B. Huwiler A.

Chem. 2014; 289: 24736-24748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, TER is involved in both the synthesis of VLCFAs and S1P metabolism, regulating the chemical composition of sphingolipids. Apart from the reductase activity, TER has been shown to interact with ceramide synthase and Seipin, an ER membrane protein required for lipid droplet biogenesis, thereby associating with ceramide synthesis in the ER membrane and formation of lipid droplets from the ER membrane, respectively (14Ohno Y. Suto S. Yamanaka M. Mizutani Y. Mitsutake S. Igarashi Y. Sassa T. Kihara A. ELOVL1 production of C24 acyl-CoAs is linked to C24 sphingolipid synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent genetic studies have shown that mutations in TECRL, a muscle-specific paralogue of TER, are associated with inherited arrhythmias (16Devalla H.D. Gélinas R. Aburawi E.H. Beqqali A. Goyette P.

Interestingly, induced pluripotent cell–derived cardiomyocytes with the TECRL mutation exhibit various abnormalities in Ca2+ transients upon stimulation, including slower Ca2+ uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (16Devalla H.D. Gélinas R. Aburawi E.H. Beqqali A. Goyette P. Freund C. Chaix M.A. Tadros R. Jiang H. Le Béchec A. Monshouwer-Kloots J.J. Zwetsloot T. Kosmidis G. Latour F.

Med. 2016; 8: 1390-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although its molecular mechanism remains unclear. It also remains unknown whether TER is involved in Ca2+ uptake to the ER in nonmuscle cells. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that regulates a wide range of cellular processes, such as muscle contraction, neuronal transmission, motility, proliferation, and transcriptional control (19Clapham D.E. Calcium signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). The ER is the most important intracellular Ca2+ store. The Ca2+ concentration in the ER is at millimolar levels, whereas the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is at nanomolar levels at rest (19Clapham D.E. Calcium signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki J. Kanemaru K. Ishii K. Ohkura M. Okubo Y. Iino M. Imaging intraorganellar Ca2+ at subcellular resolution using CEPIA.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ER releases Ca2+ into the cytosol through two major classes of Ca2+ channels, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors (21Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K.

Saito A. Fleischer S. Purification of the ryanodine receptor and identity with feet structures of junctional terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum from fast skeletal muscle.J. Biol.

Purification and reconstitution of the calcium release channel from skeletal muscle.Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in response to various stimuli. The ER then recovers released Ca2+ through sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) that transport Ca2+ from the cytosol to the ER lumen with the energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis (24Vandecaetsbeek I. Vangheluwe P. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vanoevelen J. The Ca2+ pumps of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a004184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), leading to termination of Ca2+ signal. In mammals, three different genes (ATP2A1-3) encode SERCA proteins (SERCA1-3). SERCA2, which shows the most widespread expression pattern among three SERCA proteins, has two major splicing isoforms, SERCA2a and SERCA2b. Although SERCA2a is expressed in slow skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles, SERCA2b is expressed ubiquitously and functions as a house-keeping protein (24Vandecaetsbeek I. Vangheluwe P. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vanoevelen J. The Ca2+ pumps of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a004184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Wu K.D. Lee W.S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J.

Wuytack F. Modulating sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 (SERCA2) activity: Cell biological implications.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that regulation of the SERCA activity is critical to determine the frequency, duration, and strength of Ca2+ responses in muscle cells. In cardiac muscle cells, the SERCA2a activity is regulated by phospholamban (PLN), a small transmembrane protein that directly binds to SERCA2a. Although PLN inhibits the SERCA2a activity in resting states, adrenergic stimulation relieves this inhibition. The resultant enhancement of the SERCA2a activity accelerates cardiac relaxation and increases the Ca2+ content in the SR, which then strengthens cardiac contraction (27MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Phospholamban: A crucial regulator of cardiac contractility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Although various proteins have been reported to regulate the activity of SERCA in muscle cells (24Vandecaetsbeek I. Vangheluwe P. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vanoevelen J. The Ca2+ pumps of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a004184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the regulatory mechanism of SERCA2b in nonmuscle cells is not completely understood. In the present study, we identify SERCA2b as a TER-binding protein. We demonstrate that TER overexpression reduces SERCA2b activity. We also show that TER depletion increases the Ca2+ content in the ER. In contrast to the TECRL mutation, TER depletion accelerates Ca2+ uptake to the ER after ligand-induced Ca2+ release to the cytosol. These results indicate that TER limits Ca2+ accumulation in the ER and reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of SERCA2b in nonmuscle cells. We first sought to identify ER protein(s) that bind to TER by affinity purification/mass spectrometry. We generated HEK293 clones stably expressing TER with an N-terminal Strep-tag. The Triton X-100 extracts of these cells or parental HEK293 cells were applied to beads conjugated with Strep-Tactin, which binds to the Strep-tag with high affinity and specificity (28Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. The Strep-tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. In addition to Strep-TER, bands at 55, 95, 170, 180, and 400 kDa were specifically detected in the pull-down fraction from Strep-TER–expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis identified p55, p95, p170, p180, and p400 as β-tubulin, SERCA2b, protein MON2 homologue/SERCA2b, nuclear pore complex protein Nup205, and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, respectively (Fig. 1B and Table S1). Detection of SERCA2b in the p170 band is not consistent with its expected molecular mass (∼100 kDa). Given the identification of the p95 band as SERCA2b, this is probably due to contamination from the p95 band, suggesting the abundance of SERCA2b in the Strep-TER pull-down fraction. The presence of SERCA2b in the Strep-TER pull-down fraction was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-SERCA2b antibody (Fig. 1C). In addition to a band with the expected molecular mass (∼100 kDa), the anti-SERCA2b antibody detected a band around 130 kDa in the Strep-TER pull-down fraction. Given that the molecular mass of Strep-TER is about 30 kDa, the 130-kDa band is probably an SDS-resistant heterodimer of SERCA2b and Strep-TER. Because SERCA2b is the only protein localized to the ER in the identified proteins, and expected to be abundant in the Strep-TER pull-down fraction, we characterized SERCA2b as a potential binding partner of TER in this study. We assessed whether endogenous TER bound to endogenous SERCA2b by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. The Triton X-100 extracts of HEK293 cells were incubated with anti-TER or control antibody. SERCA2b was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with TER (Fig. 1D), indicating the binding of endogenous TER to endogenous SERCA2b. We also tested if TER bound to SERCA2b in other cell types. The n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) extracts of primary human keratinocytes and HuH-7, a human hepatoma cell line, were subjected to the coimmunoprecipitation analyses. In both cell types, SERCA2b was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with TER (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that TER binds to SERCA2b not only in HEK293 cells but also in other cell types including primary cells, suggesting the physiological relevance of this interaction. Next, we examined the subcellular localization of TER and SERCA2b. HEK293 cells were immunostained with the anti-TER and the anti-SERCA2b antibodies and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. SERCA2b showed a reticular staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm, which is consistent with its well-established ER localization. TER was colocalized with SERCA2b in the reticular structure (Fig. 1E). Together, these results indicate that endogenous TER forms a complex with endogenous SERCA2b in the ER membrane. To examine if TER directly bound to SERCA2b, we performed pull-down experiments with purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant TER with an N-terminal FLAG-tag (FLAG–TER) and recombinant SERCA2b with an N-terminal PA-tag (PA-SERCA2b) (29Fujii Y. Kaneko M. Neyazaki M. Nogi T. Kato Y. Takagi J. PA tag: A versatile protein tagging system using a super high affinity antibody against a dodecapeptide derived from human podoplanin.Protein Expr. Purif. 2014; 95: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression system and purified. PA-SERCA2b was incubated with FLAG–TER immobilized on anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads or the anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads alone in a buffer containing Ca2+. PA-SERCA2b was specifically pulled down with FLAG–TER, indicating that TER directly bound to SERCA2b (Fig. 2A). Removing Ca2+ from the reaction buffer did not affect the amount of PA-SERCA2b pulled down by FLAG–TER, showing that Ca2+ was not essential for the binding of TER to SERCA2b (Fig. 2A). During the pumping cycle, SERCA undergoes conformational changes. The conformations of SERCA are classified into two major states (E1 and E2). The E1 state has high affinity for Ca2+ and captures Ca2+ in the cytosol, and the E2 state has low affinity for Ca2+ and releases Ca2+ in the ER lumen (30Toyoshima C. Cornelius F. New crystal structures of PII-type ATPases: Excitement continues.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin (Tg), a potent inhibitor of SERCA, fixes it to a form analogous to the E2 state, thereby preventing its pumping cycle (31Sagara Y. Inesi G. Inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPase by thapsigargin at subnanomolar concentrations.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of purified PA-SERCA2b with Tg reduced the amount of PA-SERCA2b pulled down by FLAG–TER (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effect of Tg on the binding of TER to SERCA2b in cells. Strep-TER–expressing HEK293 cells were treated with Tg before cell lysis and subjected to the pull-down experiments. Tg treatment significantly reduced the amount of endogenous SERCA2b pulled down by Strep-TER (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results suggest that SERCA2b in the E2 state has less affinity to TER than that in the E1 state. We searched for the region in TER responsible for its binding to SERCA2b. Based on the reported topologies of yeast and Arabidopsis orthologues, human TER is predicted to have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain in the cytosol, 6 transmembrane helixes, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic region (32Paul S. Gable K. Dunn T.M. A six-membrane-spanning topology for yeast and Arabidopsis Tsc13p, the enoyl reductases of the microsomal fatty acid elongating system.J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, left). To test if these cytoplasmic regions were involved in the binding to SERCA2b, we generated truncation constructs lacking either the N- or C-terminal region (ΔN or ΔC) and short fragments containing only one of these regions (N-term or C-term) (Fig. 3A, right). FLAG-tagged full-length TER, ΔN, ΔC, and N-term along with 3xHA-tagged SERCA2b were expressed in HEK293 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with the pull-down of SERCA2b by TER (Fig. 2), 3xHA-SERCA2b was significantly coimmunoprecipitated with full-length TER (Fig. 3B). To validate the coimmunoprecipitation, we used 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KAR), another enzyme in the FA elongation cycle (7Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. Identification of two mammalian reductases involved in the two-carbon fatty acyl elongation cascade.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7335-7343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as a negative control. A faint and negligible level of 3xHA-SERCA2b was coimmunoprecipitated with KAR, validating the specific binding of 3xHA-SERCA2b and full-length TER. 3xHA-SERCA2b was coimmunoprecipitated with ΔN or ΔC much less than with full-length TER (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, 3xHA-SERCA2b was not coimmunoprecipitated with N-term. These results suggest that both the N- and C-terminal regions are required for the full binding of TER to SERCA2b and that the N-terminal region by itself does not bind to SERCA2b. We next investigated if C-term bound to SERCA2b. Because we could not express FLAG-tagged C-term in HEK293 cells, we expressed it as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein in Escherichia coli and performed pull-down experiments. GST, GST-N-term, or GST-C-term was immobilized to glutathione beads, and the beads were incubated with the lysates of HEK293 cells expressing 3xHA-SERCA2b. GST-C-term, but not GST or GST-N-term, pulled down 3xHA-SERCA2b (Fig. 3C), indicating that the C-terminal region of TER binds to SERCA2b. These results show that TER directly binds to SERCA2b through its C-terminal region. Because Tg reduced the binding of full-length TER to SERCA2b (Fig. 2, B and C), we examined the effects of Tg on the binding of the C-terminal region to SERCA2b. HEK293 cells expressing 3xHA-SERCA2b were treated with Tg before cell lysis, and the lysates of these cells were incubated with GST-C-term immobilized on glutathione beads. Tg treatment reduced the amount of 3xHA-SERCA2b pulled down with GST-C-term (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the C-terminal region prefers SERCA2b in the E1 state to that in the E2 state as full-length TER, validating a role of the C-terminal region as a SERCA2b-interacting region of TER. We also tested if Tg affected the colocalization of TER and SERCA2b in HEK293 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. TER and SERCA2b were still colocalized in Tg-treated cells (Fig. S1). Because TER and SERCA2b are ER-resident proteins, they are probably present in the ER membrane even after they are dissociated. Therefore, it might be difficult to detect changes in the colocalization of these proteins with Tg treatment by immunofluorescence microscopy. Tg inhibits the binding of SERCA to PLN and sarcolipin, both of which regulate SERCA activity in muscle cells (35Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M. Sarcolipin protein interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) is distinct from phospholamban protein, and only sarcolipin can promote uncoupling of the SERCA pump.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 6881-6889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, our finding that Tg inhibits the binding of TER to SERCA2b (Fig. 2, B and C) raised the possibility that TER would modulate SERCA2b activity. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of TER overexpression on endogenous SERCA2b ATPase activity. FLAG–TER was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and a microsomal fraction was prepared by differential centrifugation. The endogenous SERCA2b ATPase activity in the microsomal membranes was measured with a spectrophotomeric assay (36Inoue M. Sakuta N. Watanabe S. Zhang Y. Yoshikaie K. Tanaka Y. Ushioda R. Kato Y. Takagi J. Tsukazaki T. Nagata K. Inaba K. Structural basis of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b regulation via transmembrane Helix interplay.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 1221-1230.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FLAG–TER (full-length or ΔC) expression did not alter SERCA2b protein levels in the microsomal fractions (Fig. 4A). However, FLAG–TER (full-length) expression significantly reduced SERCA2b ATPase activity compared with empty vector control. The expression of the TER mutant with little SERCA2b binding (ΔC) weakly reduced SERCA2b activity (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that TER expression reduces SERCA2b activity through its binding to SERCA2b. SERCA2b ATPase activity is required for uptake of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the ER lumen. We therefore hypothesized that TER would limit the Ca2+ content in the ER lumen by suppressing SERCA2b activity. To address this, we measured the ER Ca2+ content in cells depleted of TER. Two independent siRNAs were used to deplete TER, which was confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-TER antibody (Fig. 5A). SERCA2b protein levels were grossly normal in TER-depleted cells when compared with control cells. To monitor the ER Ca2+ content, we treated cells with Tg in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This treatment causes the passive release of Ca2+ from the ER lumen to the cytosol. This release can be measured as an increase in the fluorescence value of a cytosolic Ca2+ indicator dye, Fluo-4 (37Gee K.R. Brown K.A. Chen W.N. Bishop-Stewart J. Gray D. Johnson I. Chemical and physiological characterization of fluo-4 Ca(2+)-indicator dyes.Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The increase of Fluo-4 fluorescence after Tg addition was larger in TER-depleted cells than in control cells (Fig. 5A). To estimate the total amount of Ca2+ released to the cytosol, we calculated the area under the curve of each Ca2+ trace. The areas under the curves were significantly increased by TER depletion (Fig. 5A), suggesting that TER depletion increased the ER Ca2+ content. We next examined if these abnormalities in TER-depleted cells was rescued by reconstituting TER expression. Transfection of an siTER #1-resistant TER construct [FLAG–TER (rescue)] with siTER #1 clearly restored TER expression (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the results in cells without vector transfection (Fig. 5A), the increase of Fluo-4 fluorescence after Tg addition and the areas under the curves were larger in cells transfected with siTER #1 and empty vector than in cells transfected with siControl and empty vector. In contrast, they were not significantly changed in cells transfected with siTER #1 and FLAG–TER (rescue) compared with those in the control cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the increase of the ER Ca2+ content by siTER #1 transfection is rescued by reconstituting TER exp"

Data and methods Using the nationally representative data on 160551 unmarried young women aged 15–24 years from the District Level Reproductive and Child Health Survey (DLHS: 2007–2008) in India, this research evaluated the demographic and socioeconomic differentials in the access to family life/sex education (FLE) among youth in India. Using the adjusted multiple logistic regression models, the association between access to family life/sex education and attitudes towards a range of sexual and reproductive health matters among young unmarried Indian women were investigated. Results Less than half of the unmarried young women had received some form of FLE (48 percent) in India. However, there were substantial demographic and socioeconomic variations in their access to FLE, as relatively less educated women from the poorest wealth quintiles, religious and social minorities (Muslims, Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes) were significantly less likely to receive FLE as compared to other women. Importantly, the likelihood of holding favourable/positive attitudes towards reproductive processes, knowledge and discussion of contraceptive methods, precise awareness about the transmission pathways of RTIs/STIs and HIV/AIDS was significantly higher among those women in India who had access to FLE. Conclusion The present research underscores the protective role of family life education towards improving the sexual and reproductive life experiences of young people. It further underscores the vital need to implement a comprehensive and culturally appropriate programme of family life education in order to meet the sexual and reproductive health demands of the adolescents and young people in India."
https://openalex.org/W3125062141,"Osteoclast bone resorption activity is critically regulated to maintain bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts resorb bone by producing protons and acid hydrolase via lysosomal secretion, however, a detailed mechanism remains elusive. PMEPA1 is a vesicular membrane protein, which binds to the NEDD4 family member of ubiquitin ligases. We have previously reported that Pmepa1 is highly expressed in bone resorbing osteoclasts, and regulates bone resorption. Here, we investigated the mechanism of bone resorption regulated by PMEPA1. Mutant mice lacking NEDD4-binding domains of PMEPA1 displayed enhanced bone volume, and reduced bone resorption activity in comparison with those of WT mice. Analysis with pH-sensitive fluorescence probe revealed that proton secretion from osteoclasts significantly decreased in Pmepa1 mutant osteoclasts. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PMEPA1 was colocalized with NEDD4, V0A3, and V0D2 subunits of vacuolar ATPase, which regulate the proton production of osteoclasts. In addition, Nedd4 knockdown reduced bone resorption and proton secretion of osteoclasts. Furthermore, Pmepa1 mutation and Nedd4 knockdown altered the cytoplasmic distribution of components of V-ATPase and expression of autophagy-related proteins, suggesting that lysosomal secretion is affected. Collectively, these findings indicate that PMEPA1 controls proton secretion from osteoclasts via NEDD4 by regulating vesicular trafficking, and NEDD4 is an important regulator of bone resorption."

Methods AT foci were examined in intrasurgical biopsy specimens of costal cartilages of children (8–17 years old) with PE (n = 12) and PC (n = 12) and in age-matching autopsy control samples (n = 10) using histological and immunohistochemical staining, atomic force and nonlinear optical microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, morphometry and statistics. Results AT areas were identified in the costal cartilage ECM in children with normal chest, PE and PC. Each type of the AT areas (“canonical”, “intertwined”, “fine-fibred” and “intralacunary”) had a unique morphological pattern of thickness and alignment of amianthoid fibers (AFs). AFs were formed via lateral aggregation of collagen type II fibrils in the intact ECM. Foci of the AT were observed significantly more frequently in the PE and PC groups. The AT areas had unique quantitative features in each study group. Conclusion AT is a structurally diverse form of ECM alteration present in healthy and pathological costal cartilage. PE and PC are associated with specific AT disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3125667418,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder whereby phenylalanine metabolism is deficient due to allelic variations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ). There is no cure for PKU other than orthotopic liver transplantation, and the standard of care for patients is limited to dietary restrictions and key amino acid supplementation. Therefore, Pah was edited in pig fibroblasts for the generation of PKU clone piglets that harbor a common and severe human mutation, R408W. Additionally, the proximal region to the mutation was further humanized by introducing 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to allow for development of gene editing machinery that could be translated directly from the pig model to human PKU patients that harbor at least one classic R408W allele. Resulting piglets were hypopigmented (a single Ossabaw piglet) and had low birthweight (all piglets). The piglets had similar levels of PAH expression, but no detectable enzymatic activity, consistent with the human phenotype. The piglets were fragile and required extensive neonatal care to prevent failure to thrive and early demise. Phenylalanine levels rose sharply when dietary Phe was unrestricted but could be rapidly reduced with a low Phe diet. Fibroblasts isolated from R408W piglets show susceptibility to correction using CRISPR or TALEN, with subsequent homology-directed recombination to correct Pah . This pig model of PKU provides a powerful new tool for development of all classes of therapeutic candidates to treat or cure PKU, as well as unique value for proof-of-concept studies for in vivo human gene editing platforms in the context of this humanized PKU allele."

AR42J are often used as a cell-culture model of cerulein (CN)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). Nevertheless, it is controversial how to treat AR42J for reliable induction of AP-like processes. Gene knockout and/or overexpression often remain challenging, as well. In this study, we demonstrate conditions for a reliable induction of proinflammatory markers upon CN treatment in AR42J and high transfection efficacy using Glyoxalase-I (Glo-I) as a target of interest. Methods Effects of dexamethasone (dexa) and CN on cell morphology and amylase secretion were analyzed via ELISA of supernatant. IL-6, TNF-α and NF-κB-p65 were measured via qRT-PCR, ELISA and Western Blot (WB). Transfection efficacy was determined by WB, qRT-PCR and immune fluorescence of pEGFP-N1-Glo-I-Vector and Glo-I-siRNA. Results Treatment of AR42J with 100 nm dexa is mandatory for differentiation to an acinar-cell-like phenotype and amylase production. CN resulted in secretion of amylase but did not influence amylase production. High levels of CN-induced amylase secretion were detected between 3 and 24 hours of incubation. Treatment with LPS alone or in combination with CN did not influence amylase release compared to control or CN. CN treatment resulted in increased TNF-α production but not secretion and did not influence IL-6 mRNA. CN-induced stimulation of NF-κB was found to be highest on protein levels after 6h of incubation. Transient transfection was able to induce overexpression on protein and mRNA levels, with highest effect after 12 to 24 hours. Gene-knockdown was achieved by using 30 pmol of siRNA leading to effective reduction of protein levels after 72 hours. CN did not induce amylase secretion in AR42J cell passages beyond 35. Conclusion AR42J cells demonstrate a reliable in-vitro model of CN-induced AP but specific conditions are mandatory to obtain reproducible data."
https://openalex.org/W3125976007,"Background Pre-clinical testing of retinal pathology and treatment efficacy depends on reliable and valid measures of retinal function. The electroretinogram (ERG) and tests of visual acuity are the ideal standard, but can be unmeasurable while useful vision remains. Non-image-forming responses to light such as the pupillary light reflex (PLR) are attractive surrogates. However, it is not clear how accurately such responses reflect changes in visual capability in specific disease models. The purpose of this study was to test whether measures of non-visual responses to light correlate with previously determined visual function in two photoreceptor degenerations. Methods The sensitivity of masking behavior (light induced changes in running wheel activity) and the PLR were measured in 3-month-old wild-type mice (WT) with intact inner retinal circuitry, Pde6b - rd1/rd1 mice ( rd1 ) with early and rapid loss of rods and cones, and Prph2-Rd2/Rd2 mice ( Rd2 ) with a slower progressive loss of rods and cones. Results In rd1 mice, negative masking had increased sensitivity, positive masking was absent, and the sensitivity of the PLR was severely reduced. In Rd2 mice, positive masking identified useful vision at higher light levels, but there was a limited decrease in the irradiance sensitivity of negative masking and the PLR, and the amplitude of change for both underestimated the reduction in irradiance sensitivity of image-forming vision. Conclusions Together these data show that in a given disease, two responses to light can be affected in opposite ways, and that for a given response to light, the change in the response does not accurately represent the degree of pathology. However, the extent of the deficit in the PLR means that even a limited rescue of rod/cone function might be measured by increased PLR amplitude. In addition, positive masking has the potential to measure effective treatment in both models by restoring responses or shifting thresholds to lower irradiances."
https://openalex.org/W3123947752,"Due to the inefficient reproduction of microorganisms in oxygen-deprived environments of the reservoir, the applications of microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) are restricted. To overcome this problem, a new type of air-assisted MEOR process was investigated. Three compounding oil degradation strains were screened using biochemical experiments. Their performances in bacterial suspensions with different amounts of dissolved oxygen were evaluated. Water flooding, microbial flooding and air-assisted microbial flooding core flow experiments were carried out. Carbon distribution curve of biodegraded oil with different oxygen concentration was determined by chromatographic analysis. The long-chain alkanes are degraded by microorganisms. A simulation model was established to take into account the change in oxygen concentration in the reservoir. The results showed that the optimal dissolved oxygen concentration for microbial growth was 4.5~5.5mg/L. The main oxygen consumption in the reservoir happened in the stationary and declining phases of the microbial growth systems. In order to reduce the oxygen concentration to a safe level, the minimum radius of oxygen consumption was found to be about 145m. These results demonstrate that the air-assisted MEOR process can overcome the shortcomings of traditional microbial flooding techniques. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of microbial enhanced oil recovery and improving the efficiency of microbial oil displacement."
https://openalex.org/W3124162864,"Many studies on cascading failures adopt the degree or the betweenness of a node to define its load. From a novel perspective, we propose an approach to obtain initial loads considering the harmonic closeness and the impact of neighboring nodes. Based on simulation results for different adjustable parameter θ , local parameter δ and proportion of attacked nodes f , it is found that in scale-free networks (SF networks), small-world networks (SW networks) and Erdos-Renyi networks (ER networks), there exists a negative correlation between optimal θ and δ . By the removal of the low load node, cascading failures are more likely to occur in some cases. In addition, we find a valuable result that our method yields better performance compared with other methods in SF networks with an arbitrary f , SW and ER networks with large f . Moreover, the method concerning the harmonic closeness makes these three model networks more robust for different average degrees. Finally, we perform the simulations on twenty real networks, whose results verify that our method is also effective to distribute the initial load in different real networks."
https://openalex.org/W3124364691,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Despite recent progress, the mechanisms responsible for the technique’s effectiveness have yet to be fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to gain new insights into the interactions between STN-DBS and cortical network activity. We therefore combined high-resolution functional near-infrared spectroscopy with low-resolution electroencephalography in seven Parkinsonian patients on STN-DBS, and measured cortical haemodynamic changes at rest and during hand movement in the presence and absence of stimulation (the ON-stim and OFF-stim conditions, respectively) in the off-drug condition. The relative changes in oxyhaemoglobin [HbO], deoxyhaemoglobin [HbR], and total haemoglobin [HbT] levels were analyzed continuously. At rest, the [HbO], [HbR], and [HbT] over the bilateral sensorimotor (SM), premotor (PM) and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortices decreased steadily throughout the duration of stimulation, relative to the OFF-stim condition. During hand movement in the OFF-stim condition, [HbO] increased and [HbR] decreased concomitantly over the contralateral SM cortex (as a result of neurovascular coupling), and [HbO], [HbR], and [HbT] increased concomitantly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—suggesting an increase in blood volume in this brain area. During hand movement with STN-DBS, the increase in [HbO] was over the contralateral SM and PM cortices was significantly lower than in the OFF-stim condition, as was the decrease in [HbO] and [HbT] in the DLPFC. Our results indicate that STN-DBS is associated with a reduction in blood volume over the SM, PM and DLPF cortices, regardless of whether or not the patient is performing a task. This particular effect on cortical networks might explain not only STN-DBS’s clinical effectiveness but also some of the associated adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W3125671982,"Background Current clinical evidence suggests that a well-planned physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) program is effective for scoliosis regression. Objectives We investigated the effect of curve patterns on Cobb angles with PSSE. Methods This was a non-randomized prospective clinical trial that recruited participants with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis between January and June 2017. Participants were grouped by curve pattern into major thoracic and major lumbar groups. An outpatient-based PSSE program was conducted with the following schedule of intensive exercise: ≥ 1 session of supervised PSSE per month and &gt; 30min of home exercise 5 days/week in the first 6 months, after which exercise frequency was reduced to 1 session of supervised PSSE every three months and &gt; 30min of home exercise 5 days/week until 2 years after study initiation. Radiographic Cobb angle progressions were identified at the 1, 1.5 and 2-year follow-ups. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the differences in Cobb angles between groups at four testing time points. The two-tailed significance level was set to 0.05. Results In total, 40 participants were recruited, including 22 with major thoracic curves (5 males and 17 females; mean age 13.5±1.8 years; Cobb angle 18–45 degrees) and 18 with major lumbar curves (7 males and 11 females; mean age 12.7±1.7 years; Cobb angle 15–48 degrees). Curve regressions, namely the reduction of Cobb angles between 7 to 10 degrees were noted in 9.1% of participants in the major thoracic group; reductions of 6 to 13 degrees were noted in 33.3% of participants in the major lumbar group at the 2-year follow-up. Repeated measurements revealed a significant time effect (F 2.2,79.8 = 4.1, p = 0.02), but no group (F 2.2,79.8 = 2.3, p = 0.1) or time × group (F 1,37 = 0.97, p = 0.3) effects in reducing Cobb angles after 2 years of PSSE. A logistic regression analysis revealed that no correlation was observed between curve pattern and curve regression or stabilization (OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.31–1.1, p = 0.068) at the 2-year follow-up. Conclusion This was the first study to investigate the long-term effects of PSSE in reducing Cobb angles on the basis of major curve location. No significant differences in correction were observed between major thoracic and major lumbar curves. A regression effect and no curve deterioration were noted in both groups at the 2-year follow-up. Trial registration ChiCTR1900028073."

https://openalex.org/W3121199589,"The macaw palm has been domesticated due to its potential use in the production of biofuel, in addition to several co-products that can be generated from its oil and pulp. One of the current challenges in this area is the harvesting, as there are no specific machines for this operation. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the appropriate information regarding the physical properties of the plant, so that it is feasible to develop the technologies necessary for the commercial scale application of macaw palm, allowing it to contribute to the sustainable production of raw material for the biofuel industry and other co-products. The principle of mechanical vibration can be used to shed fruit from trees when ripe, and it can be a method used for harvesting. Thus, as proposed in this study, it was necessary to study the dynamic behavior of the fruit-rachilla system during vibration. Hence, the modal properties of the system were determined. A study on the dynamic behaviors was carried out using a deterministic finite element model, and the natural frequencies were obtained through a frequency-scanning test to evaluate the model. The mean relative error (MRE) between the measured and simulated natural frequencies was also used to evaluate the model. The natural frequencies, determined experimentally, varied from 26.21 to 33.45 Hz on average, whereas the simulated frequencies varied from 24.81 to 39.27 Hz. The overall MRE was 9.08%. Once the model was validated, a sensibility test was carried out, which showed that the density of fruit and the elasticity modulus are the parameters that most influence the natural frequencies of the fruit-rachilla system."
