https://openalex.org/W2029749273,"Injectable nanoparticulate carriers have important potential applications such as site-specific drug delivery or medical imaging. Conventional carriers, however, cannot generally be used because they are eliminated by the reticulo-endothelial system within seconds or minutes after intravenous injection. To address these limitations, monodisperse biodegradable nanospheres were developed from amphiphilic copolymers composed of two biocompatible blocks. The nanospheres exhibited dramatically increased blood circulation times and reduced liver accumulation in mice. Furthermore, they entrapped up to 45 percent by weight of the drug in the dense core in a one-step procedure and could be freeze-dried and easily redispersed without additives in aqueous solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1981112371,"Some cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) are due to alterations in a mutS-related mismatch repair gene. A search of a large database of expressed sequence tags derived from random complementary DNA clones revealed three additional human mismatch repair genes, all related to the bacterial mutL gene. One of these genes (hMLH1) resides on chromosome 3p21, within 1 centimorgan of markers previously linked to cancer susceptibility in HNPCC kindreds. Mutations of hMLH1 that would disrupt the gene product were identified in such kindreds, demonstrating that this gene is responsible for the disease. These results suggest that defects in any of several mismatch repair genes can cause HNPCC."
https://openalex.org/W2067761476,"lNTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates various aspects of the immune response, acute-phase reaction and haematopoiesis (for reviews see refs 1, 2). In vitro, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and interleukin-11 display overlapping activities with IL-6. This functional redundancy may be explained by the interactions of specific binding receptors with a common signal-transducing receptor (gp130) (for reviews see refs 3, 4). To elucidate the unique function of IL-6 in vivo, we have disrupted the IL-6 gene by homologous recombination. IL-6-deficient mice develop normally. They fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular bacterium. The T-cell-dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. Further, the inflammatory acute-phase response after tissue damage or infection is severely compromised, whereas it is only moderately affected after challenge with lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that IL-6 production induced by injury or infection is an important in vivo SOS signal which coordinates activities of liver cells, macrophages and lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2153343124,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) constitute a family of receptor-like and cytoplasmic signal transducing enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues and are characterized by homologous catalytic domains. The crystal structure of a representative member of this family, the 37-kilodalton form (residues 1 to 321) of PTP1B, has been determined at 2.8 A resolution. The enzyme consists of a single domain with the catalytic site located at the base of a shallow cleft. The phosphate recognition site is created from a loop that is located at the amino-terminus of an alpha helix. This site is formed from an 11-residue sequence motif that is diagnostic of PTPs and the dual specificity phosphatases, and that contains the catalytically essential cysteine and arginine residues. The position of the invariant cysteine residue within the phosphate binding site is consistent with its role as a nucleophile in the catalytic reaction. The structure of PTP1B should serve as a model for other members of the PTP family and as a framework for understanding the mechanism of tyrosine dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2005811101,"The frequency (frq) locus of Neurospora crassa was originally identified in searches for loci encoding components of the circadian clock. The frq gene is now shown to encode a central component in a molecular feedback loop in which the product of frq negatively regulated its own transcript, which resulted in a daily oscillation in the amount of frq transcript. Rhythmic messenger RNA expression was essential for overt rhythmicity in the organism and no amount of constitutive expression rescued normal rhythmicity in frq loss-of-function mutants. Step reductions in the amount of FRQ-encoding transcript set the clock to a specific and predicted phase. These results establish frq as encoding a central component in a circadian oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W2054593368,"Although signals for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been identified in the cytoplasmic domain of various ER-resident type I transmembrane proteins, the mechanisms responsible for ER retention are still unknown. Yeast and mammalian ER retention motifs interacted specifically in cell lysates with the coatomer, a polypeptide complex implicated in membrane traffic. Mutations that affect the ER retention capacity of the motifs also abolished binding of the coatomer. These results suggest a role for the coatomer in the retrieval of transmembrane proteins to the ER in both yeast and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1992749367,"Eclosion, or emergence of adult flies from the pupa, and locomotor activity of adults occur rhythmically in Drosophila melanogaster, with a circadian period of about 24 hours. Here, a clock mutation, timeless (tim), is described that produces arrhythmia for both behaviors. The effects of tim on behavioral rhythms are likely to involve products of the X chromosome-linked clock gene period (per), because tim alters circadian oscillations of per RNA. Genetic mapping places tim on the left arm of the second chromosome between dumpy (dp) and decapentaplegic (dpp)."
https://openalex.org/W2009907090,"T lymphocyte maturation is dependent on interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) expressed on the developing thymocyte and intrathymic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide ligands. The relation between the peptide-MHC complex that results in negative or positive selection has not been identified. Here, the requirements for the maturation of thymocytes expressing a defined transgenic TCR specific for a viral peptide are studied in fetal thymic organ culture. Low concentrations of the viral peptide antigen recognized by this transgenic TCR can mediate positive selection, whereas high concentrations result in thymocyte tolerance. These findings support the affinity-avidity model of thymocyte selection."
https://openalex.org/W1594412667,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including agonists for G protein-coupled receptors. Using transient transfection of COS-7 cells, we have studied the stimulation of a hemagglutinin-tagged p44mapk (p44HA-mapk) by receptors coupled to Gs, Gq, and Gi. Agonists that act via all three G proteins stimulated p44HA-mapk activity. A constitutively activated alpha s mutant, forskolin, and a cAMP analog also increased p44HA-mapk activity, indicating that cAMP in COS-7 cells, in contrast to other cell types, activates the MAPK pathway. Similarly, a constitutively activated alpha q mutant, overexpression of phospholipase C-beta 2, and a phorbol ester also stimulated p44HA-mapk, suggesting that Gq-coupled receptors stimulate the MAPK pathway by increasing phosphatidylinositol turnover and probably stimulating protein kinase C. In COS-7 cells, in contrast to Rat-1 cells, mutationally activated alpha i did not stimulate the MAPK pathway. G protein beta and gamma subunits, overexpressed together, did activate p44HA-mapk; this finding suggests that in COS-7 cells Gi-coupled receptors may stimulate the MAPK pathway through beta gamma. These unexpected results in COS-7 cells show that G proteins and second messengers regulate the MAPK pathway differently in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1979187651,"Engagement of antigen receptor complexes induces rapid activation of Src-family kinases and association with phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI-3 kinase). Here it was found that the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Lyn and Fyn bound to a proline-rich region (residues 84 to 99) within the 85-kilodalton subunit (p85) of PI-3 kinase. The binding of SH3 to the purified kinase led to a five- to sevenfold increase in the specific activity of PI-3 kinase. Ligand-induced receptor stimulation activated PI-3 kinase, and this activation was blocked by a peptide containing residues 84 to 99 of p85. These data demonstrate a mechanism for PI-3 kinase activation and show that binding of SH3 domains to proline-rich target sequences can regulate enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2093109164,"The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus seryl-transfer RNA synthetase, a class 2 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, complexed with a single tRNA(Ser) molecule was solved at 2.9 A resolution. The structure revealed how insertion of conserved base G20b from the D loop into the core of the tRNA determines the orientation of the long variable arm, which is a characteristic feature of most serine specific tRNAs. On tRNA binding, the antiparallel coiled-coil domain of one subunit of the synthetase makes contacts with the variable arm and T psi C loop of the tRNA and directs the acceptor stem of the tRNA into the active site of the other subunit. Specificity depends principally on recognition of the shape of tRNA(Ser) through backbone contacts and secondarily on sequence specific interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1968410906,"In wild-type Drosophila, the period protein (PER) is found in nuclei of the eyes and brain, and PER immunoreactivity oscillates with a circadian rhythm. The studies described here indicate that the nuclear localization of PER is blocked by timeless (tim), a second chromosome mutation that, like per null mutations, abolishes circadian rhythms. PER fusion proteins without a conserved domain (PAS) and some flanking sequences are nuclear in tim mutants. This suggests that a segment of PER inhibits nuclear localization in tim mutants. The tim gene may have a role in establishing rhythms of PER abundance and nuclear localization in wild-type flies."
https://openalex.org/W1972254316,"The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2005344674,"Ultraviolet light has been linked with the development of human skin cancers. Such cancers often exhibit mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze at nucleotide resolution the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers along the p53 gene in ultraviolet-irradiated human fibroblasts. Repair rates at individual nucleotides were highly variable and sequence-dependent. Slow repair was seen at seven of eight positions frequently mutated in skin cancer, suggesting that repair efficiency may strongly contribute to the mutation spectrum in a cancer-associated gene."

Although the deletion inoculum replicates in inoculated cells, systemic infections occur only if recombination restores a functional capsid gene. Four of 125 inoculated transgenic plants, representing three different transgenic lines, became systemically infected. Analysis of viral RNA confirmed that RNA recombination had united the transgenic messenger RNA and the challenging virus through aberrant homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1996375432,"The low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 binds all neurotrophins with similar affinity. For elucidation of its function, mice bearing a null mutation in the p75 locus were generated. Examination of sympathetic innervation of target tissues revealed that pineal glands lacked innervation and sweat gland innervation was absent or reduced in particular footpads. The absence of adult innervation reflects the failure of axons to reach these targets during development rather than a target deficit. These results indicate that p75 facilitates development of specific populations of sympathetic neurons, for which it may support axon growth."

https://openalex.org/W1555667651,"The human malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax invades erythrocytes by binding to a cell surface protein identified as the Duffy blood group antigen. The molecular properties of the Duffy antigen, which was recently cloned, are very similar to those of a chemokine binding protein known as the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor. This has led to the suggestion that these two molecules are the same protein. To further investigate the suspected double identity of the Duffy antigen we have transfected it into a human erythroleukemic cell line, K562. Cells stably expressing the Duffy antigen were isolated and used to characterize the protein. K562 cells transfected with the Duffy antigen displayed specific 125I-melanoma growth-stimulating activity (MGSA) binding while mock transfected cells did not. Comparison of 125I-MGSA binding to the Duffy antigen and the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor showed that the specific 125I-MGSA binding to both proteins was displaced by excess unlabeled MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, and platelet factor 4, but not by macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha or -1 beta. Scatchard analysis of competition binding studies with these unlabeled chemokines revealed high affinity binding to the Duffy antigen with KD binding values of 24 +/- 4.9, 20 +/- 4.7, 41.9 +/- 12.8, and 33.9 +/- 7 nM for MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, respectively. A monoclonal antibody, Fy6, to the Duffy antigen inhibited 125I-MGSA binding to K562 cells expressing the Duffy antigen. Cell membranes from K562 cells permanently expressing the Duffy antigen were chemically cross-linked with 125I-MGSA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the cross-linked products showed covalent incorporation of radiolabeled MGSA into a protein of molecular mass 47 kDa, and cross-linking was inhibited in the presence of unlabeled MGSA. These studies provide evidence that the Duffy blood group antigen is the same protein as the human erythrocyte chemokine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1994349958,"Ion transporters can be thought of as ion channels that open and close only at one end at a time. As in real channels, ions may cross through an electrical field as they diffuse into and bind within the transporter pore, thereby generating electrical current. Extracellular sodium binding by the sodium potassium (Na,K) pump is associated with ultrafast charge movements in giant cardiac membrane patches. The charge movements are complete within 4 microseconds. They occur only when binding sites are open to the extracellular side, and they are abolished by ouabain and by the removal of extracellular sodium. Fast extracellular ion binding may be the exclusive source of Na,K pump electrogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2035391529,"Crystal structures of seryl-tRNA synthetase from Thermus thermophilus complexed with two different analogs of seryl adenylate have been determined at 2.5 A resolution. The first complex is between the enzyme and seryl-hydroxamate-AMP (adenosine monophosphate), produced enzymatically in the crystal from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and serine hydroxamate, and the second is with a synthetic analog of seryl adenylate (5'-O-[N-(L-seryl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine), which is a strong inhibitor of the enzyme. Both molecules are bound in a similar fashion by a network of hydrogen bond interactions in a deep hydrophilic cleft formed by the antiparallel beta sheet and surrounding loops of the synthetase catalytic domain. Four regions in the primary sequence are involved in the interactions, including the motif 2 and 3 regions of class 2 synthetases. Apart from the specific recognition of the serine side chain, the interactions are likely to be similar in all class 2 synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1573285735,"A mu opioid receptor and a G protein-activated K+ channel were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. Stimulation of the mu opioid receptor induced an inwardly rectifying current that was blocked by opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, indicating that the mu opioid receptor is functionally coupled to the K+ channel. The coupling is mediated by G proteins, since pertussis toxin treatment reduced the K+ current and injection of GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) enhanced it. Repeated stimulation of the mu receptor leads to desensitization, as the K+ current from the second stimulation was reduced to 70% of that from the first one. Both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) regulate this process, but in opposite direction. Activation of PKC by treatment of the oocyte with phorbol ester potentiated the desensitization of the mu receptor-induced current. However, incubation of the cell with a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, completely abolished the desensitization. The cAMP effect appears to be mediated by PKA, since injection of a PKA catalytic subunit showed the same effect as cAMP incubation. These results suggest that PKA and PKC differentially regulate the mu opioid receptor coupling to the G protein-activated K+ channel."

https://openalex.org/W1526648993,"Cyclophilin (CyP), a protein with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (rotamase) activity, is the specific cellular target of cyclosporin A. We have isolated cDNA clones of two genes (designated ROC1 and ROC4) encoding CyP homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). The protein products of these genes are distinct from a previously identified Arabidopsis CyP. ROC1 is expressed in all tested plant organs and encodes a protein which is highly similar to previously described cytosolic CyP isoforms of other plants. In contrast, ROC4 is expressed only in photosynthetic organs and encodes a protein which includes an amino-terminal extension with properties of known chloroplast transit peptides. In vitro import experiments using the putative precursor protein to ROC4 showed that the protein is imported into chloroplasts where it is processed to the predicted mature size. Rotamase assays and immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions indicate the presence of a CyP isoform in the stroma of chloroplasts but not in the thylakoid membranes or thylakoid lumen. Together, these data show that ROC4 is a novel CyP isoform which is located in the stroma of chloroplasts. In vitro chloroplast import of precursors of other chloroplast proteins was unaffected by concentrations of cyclosporin A which completely inhibit rotamase activity of chloroplast stromal CyP. Thus, this activity is not essential for protein import into chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1973170344,"The repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet light, was studied at nucleotide resolution. Human fibroblasts were irradiated with ultraviolet light and allowed to repair. The DNA was enzymatically cleaved at the CPDs, and the induced breaks along the promoter and exon 1 of the PGK1 gene were mapped by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. Repair rates within the nontranscribed strand varied as much as 15-fold, depending on nucleotide position. Preferential repair of the transcribed strand began just downstream of the transcription start site but was most pronounced beginning at nucleotide +140 in exon 1. The promoter contained two slowly repaired regions that coincided with two transcription factor binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1487326635,"The chlorination of taurine by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system was investigated under steady state conditions. By systematically varying the pH and the concentrations of H2O2,Cl-, and taurine such that chloride inhibition and the unwanted formation of inactive compound II intermediate are minimized, rate data were found to fit a mechanism involving an enzyme-bound chlorinating intermediate. The mechanism we propose is as follows. [formula: see text] The kinetic parameters determined at pH 4.7 are: k1 = (3.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(7) M-1 S-1, k2 = (2.8 +/- 1.2) x 10(6) M-1 S-1, and k3 = (4.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(5) M-1 S-1. The rate constant for compound I formation (k1) is of the same order of magnitude as the value (1.8 x 10(7) M-1 S-1) obtained using transient state techniques in a previous study by our group. The value of k3 is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the non-enzymatic reaction between HOCl and taurine at the same pH. The results of this study indicate that the chlorination reaction mediated by the myeloperoxidase system in vivo may involve an enzyme intermediate species rather than free HOCl. Not only does this mechanism offer the advantage of substrate specificity but also of speed compared to the non-enzymatic reaction. This mechanism can also explain how the indiscriminate oxidation reactions by HOCl are prevented in the leukocyte. The fast formation of taurine monochloramine, a relatively non-toxic and stable compound compared to HOCl, is consistent with the proposed role of taurine in the neutrophil, that of protecting certain targets including myeloperoxidase from the attack by potent chlorinated oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2054854945,"Interactions during cell adhesion to external surfaces may reach the level of discrimination of molecular chirality. Cultured epithelial cells interact differently with the [011] faces of the (R,R) and (S,S) calcium tartrate tetrahydrate crystals. In a modified version of the classical Pasteur experiment, the enantiomorphous crystals were sorted out from a 1:1 mixture by the selective adhesion of cells to the (R,R) crystals. This stereospecificity results from molecular recognition between chiral components on the cell surface and the structured crystal surface. Crystals may allow experimental differentiation between distinct stages in cell substrate contacts, providing mechanistic information not readily attainable on conventional heterogeneous surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1567781970,"In the current study we have measured phosphatidylinositols during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]myoinositol to a steady state, synchronized to the G1/S boundary, and the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids were measured at various times after release from the block. The levels of total cellular PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 relative to total cellular phospholipid did not vary throughout the cell cycle. We then isolated nuclei from synchronized cells using a non-detergent method and found that the levels of nuclear PtdIns lipids decreased by over 50% at 2 and 4 h after release from the G1/S boundary (S-phase of the cell cycle) and returned to the original levels by 9 h. Separation of individual inositol-containing nuclear lipids showed that PtdIns decreased by 50% while levels of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 decreased by 66%. Levels of the cytoplasmic PtdIns lipids remained constant throughout this period. This experiment indicates that there is specific nuclear. PtdIns turnover that is activated during DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1551195741,"Stimulation of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with carbachol, a muscarinic agonist, down-regulates the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor by > 90% with maximal and half-maximal effects after approximately 6 h and approximately 1 h, respectively. Examination of the mechanistic basis of this down-regulation revealed that carbachol increased the rate of type I InsP3 receptor degradation (radiolabeled immunoprecipitable receptor was lost from cells with half-times of > 8 h and approximately 1 h in the absence and presence of carbachol, respectively) and that the concentration of type I InsP3 receptor mRNA, despite a transient decrease after 3 h, did not correlate with levels of the receptor. Only those muscarinic receptor subtypes coupled to stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis were capable of causing type I InsP3 receptor down-regulation. Ca2+ mobilization was pivotal to the mechanisms of receptor down-regulation, since perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis with either EGTA or thapsigargin blocked the ability of carbachol to accelerate receptor degradation. Studies with thapsigargin also revealed that both functional InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores and persistent elevation of InsP3 concentration were required for down-regulation to occur. In conclusion, phosphoinositidase C-linked muscarinic receptors down-regulate the type I InsP3 receptor by accelerating its degradation. It appears that this process is initiated by persistent discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores via the channels formed by tetramerically complexed type I InsP3 receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1592426620,"The roles of the putative membrane-interactive regions of factor VIIa (fVIIa) and tissue factor (TF) have been examined. Enzymatic removal of the 4-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of fVIIa had no effect on hydrolysis of a tripeptidyl chromogenic substrate in the absence or presence of TF. Additionally, Gla-domainless fVIIa (GdVIIa) was similar to native fVIIa in activating factor X in the absence of TF and phospholipid. However, GdVIIa in complex with recombinant soluble TF (sTF) was 76-fold less efficient in factor X activation than was fVIIa.sTF. The difference increased to 740-fold using TF relipidated in vesicles composed of 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (TF/PCPS). While Gla domain deletion produced a 10(3)-fold increase in the Kd for binding to TF/PCPS, the Kd for binding to TF/PC increased only 20-fold, and that for sTF in the absence of phospholipid increased 10-fold. Kd values for GdVIIa binding to TF/PCPS, TF/PC, or sTF were nearly identical. Thus, most of the binding energy required for formation of the fVIIa.TF complex was present even after Gla domain deletion. Both fVIIa and GdVIIa were capable of binding sTF in the presence of excess divalent metal-ion chelator, suggesting Ca(2+)-independent binding or the presence of a novel very high affinity Ca2+ binding site in fVIIa. The results demonstrate that the effect of the Gla domain on the Kd is apparent only in the presence of PS, and that interactions involving the fVIIa Gla domain and phospholipid are critical for efficient proteolysis of factor X on a membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1639001609,"A group of myeloid precursors of defense peptides has recently been shown to have highly homologous N-terminal regions. Using a strategy based on this homology, a novel cDNA was cloned from pig bone marrow RNA and found to encode a 153-residue polypeptide. This comprises a highly conserved region encompassing a 29-residue signal peptide and a 101-residue prosequence, followed by a unique, 23-residue, cationic, C-terminal sequence. A peptide corresponding to this C-terminal sequence was chemically synthesized and shown to exert antimicrobial activity against both Gram positive and negative bacteria at concentrations of 2-16 microM. The activity of this potent and structurally novel antibacterial peptide appears to be mediated by its ability to damage bacterial membranes, as shown by the rapid permeabilization of the inner membrane of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1541846432,"The presence of secA and secY gene homologues in the plastid genomes of red algae and cyanophytes has raised the possibility that the products of these genes are involved in protein translocation across the thylakoid membrane. Bacterial SecA proteins are effectively inhibited by azide, and we have tested the effects of this compound on the transport of lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane in pea chloroplasts. Recent studies have shown that lumenal proteins are transported by two different mechanisms, one dependent on the thylakoidal delta pH and the other requiring the presence of a stromal protein factor and ATP. In this report we show that azide inhibits the transport across the thylakoid membrane of the latter group of proteins, which includes plastocyanin and the lumenal 33-kDa protein of photosystem II; translocation of proteins by the delta pH-dependent pathway is unaffected. Following import into isolated chloroplasts in the presence of azide, a substantial proportion of plastocyanin and the 33-kDa protein is found as the stromal intermediate form; the proportion increases with lower ATP concentrations, suggesting that azide and ATP may compete for a single site. The presence of azide completely inhibits the import of the 33-kDa protein by isolated thylakoids, but import is restored if the azide is removed from the stromal extract or thylakoids, prior to the import incubation. The data thus indicate that azide reversibly inhibits the transport of a subset of proteins across the thylakoid membrane, consistent with the involvement of a SecA homolog. The results also indicate that azide is potentially a valuable tool for the future assignment of novel lumenal proteins to one of the thylakoidal protein transport mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1524058052,"trans-Sialidase isolated from trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas' disease, is multimeric and heterogeneous in size. We show here that limited proteolysis of tans-sialidase with papain yields a single monomeric polypeptide chain of 70 kDa that conserves full enzymatic activity on soluble and membrane-bound substrates. The papain fragment lacks most of the 12-amino acid repeats of the carboxyl-terminal domain that comprises about 50% of the native trans-sialidase. When injected into rabbits, the papain-generated fragment induces antibodies that inhibit trans-sialidase activity and trypomastigote sialylation. The repeats are also not required for the stability of the enzyme or for the correct folding during the biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, but seem essential for trans-sialidase oligomerization. We conclude that trans-sialidase is composed of two structurally and functionally independent domains."
https://openalex.org/W2047537712,P element-induced chromosome breakage on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster was repaired six times more frequently when a homologous template was located anywhere on the X chromosome rather than on an autosome. Cis-trans comparisons confirmed that recombinational repair was more frequent when the interacting sequences were physically connected. These results suggest that the search for homology between the broken ends and a matching template sequence occurs preferentially in the cis configuration. This cis advantage operates over more than 15 megabases of DNA.
https://openalex.org/W1606163488,"The interaction of the adipocyte/skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT-4) with clathrin lattices may be important in maintaining its intracellular distribution. To better understand the role of clathrin lattices in the sorting of GLUT-4, we have attempted to determine the cellular origin of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that contain this transporter. The fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA) causes the selective disassembly of clathrin lattices at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not at the plasma membrane (PM), thus providing a way of estimating the proportion of GLUT-4 in PM- versus TGN-derived clathrin lattices. Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to BFA resulted in a rapid disassembly of clathrin lattices at the TGN, observed by optical sectioning microscopy, and to a pronounced decrease in the yield of CCVs purified from these cells. Thus, CCVs isolated from BFA-treated cells are likely to be derived from the PM. Immunoblotting experiments revealed the presence of GLUT-4 in such CCVs, suggesting that under basal conditions the transporter is continually retrieved from the PM through the CCV pathway. Exposure of both BFA-treated or non-treated cells to insulin resulted in a 4-6-fold increase in the concentration of GLUT-4 at the PM. In parallel, the concentration of GLUT-4 in PM-derived CCVs decreased by 60%. These results suggest (a) that the effect of insulin to increase the cell surface concentration of GLUT-4 is not inhibited by BFA, and (b) that a decreased association of GLUT-4 with endocytic CCVs may be important in facilitating its increased cell surface concentration in response to the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1586467890,"DNA methylation is deregulated during oncogenesis. Since several major anti-cancer drugs act on topoisomerases, we investigated the effects of cytosine methylation on topoisomerase cleavage activities. Both topoisomerase I and II cleavage patterns were modified by CpG methylation in c-myc gene DNA fragments. Topoisomerase II changes, mainly cleavage reduction, occurred for methylation sites within 7 base pairs from the topoisomerase II breaks and were different for VM-26 and azatoxin. For topoisomerase I, cleavage enhancement as well as suppression were observed. Using synthetic methylated oligonucleotides, we show that hemimethylation is sufficient to alter topoisomerase I activity. Cytosine methylation on the scissile strand within the topoisomerase I consensus sequence had strong effects. Cleavage was stimulated by methylation at position -4 and was strongly inhibited by methylation at position -3 (with position -1 being the enzyme-linked nucleotide). This inhibitory effect was attributed to the presence of a methyl group in the major groove, since the transition uracil to thymine also inhibited cleavage. Altogether these results suggest an interaction of topoisomerase I with the DNA major grove at positions -3 and -4. In addition, DNA methylation may have profound effects on the activity of topoisomerases and may alter the distribution of cleavage sites produced by anticancer drugs in chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1995544883,"EMS, a blastomere of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, produces body wall muscle cell-autonomously in isolation. Within the embryonic context, however, the specification of body wall muscle derived from EMS depends on inductive interactions between its daughter MS and ABa descendants that are required to overcome inhibitory interactions with other cells. The inductive events between the MS and ABa descendants are reciprocal, specifying subsequent fates in both lineages. Both induction events are blocked by mutations in the gene glp-1, known to encode a Notch-like transmembrane receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1511235644,"Lactate monooxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of L-lactate with molecular oxygen to acetate, CO2, and water. Histidine 290 has been proposed to be the active site base in lactate monooxygenase (Giegel, D. A., Williams, C. H., Jr., and Massey, V. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6626-6632) and was mutated to a glutamine (H290Q). The mutant enzyme shows properties that support strongly the postulated function of the histidine. The ability of L-lactate to reduce the enzyme flavin is essentially abolished, whereas reoxidation of reduced enzyme with oxygen proceeds at 1.4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1, a rate essentially like that found in the wild type enzyme. The substrate, L-lactate, is bound with a Kd equal to 2.0 x 10(-2) M, and D-lactate, a competitive inhibitor with a Kd of 3.1 x 10(-3) M. Both values are similar to binding measured in the wild type enzyme. Unlike the situation with wild type enzyme, where the transition state analog oxalate is bound tightly in a two-step reaction involving proton uptake from solution (Ghisla, S., and Massey, V. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6729-6735), the mutant enzyme binds oxalate weakly, in a single step reaction, with a Kd in the order of 0.1 M. No effect was observed upon varying the pH, indicating that binding does not include a protonation step. Replacing the histidine also has a significant effect on the ability of the enzyme to stabilize the flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct. Sulfite is bound at least 1000-fold weaker than it is in the wild type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1986323631,"The pathogenesis of amoebic dysentery is a result of cytolysis of the colonic mucosa by the parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. The cytolysis results in extensive local ulceration and allows the amoeba to penetrate and metastasize to distant sites. Factors involved in this process were defined with three clones that express hemolytic activities in Escherichia coli. These potential amoebic virulence determinants were also toxic to human colonic epithelial cells, the primary cellular targets in amoebal invasion of the large intestine. The coding sequences for the hemolysins were close to each other on a 2.6-kilobase segment of a 25-kilobase extrachromosomal DNA element. The structural genes for the hemolysins were within inverted repeats that encode ribosomal RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1485471413,"In this study we report on the evidence that an alpha-like DNA polymerase purified from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus has a modular organization of its associated catalytic activities (polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease). This enzyme, a monomer of about 100 kDa whose complete primary structure is available, has a protease hypersensitive site that is likely to be cleaved by the action of endogenous proteases during the purification procedure. As a consequence of that, two proteolytic fragments of about 50 and 40 kDa, in addition to the intact 100-kDa molecular species, can be detected upon SDS-PAGE of highly purified S. solfataricus DNA polymerase samples. The amino-terminal microsequence analysis by Edman degradation has revealed that the 50- and the 40-kDa polypeptides correspond to the carboxyl- and the amino-terminal portion of the protein molecule, respectively. Using the bidimensional activity gel assay procedure, recently described by Longley and Mosbaugh (Longley, M. J., and Mosbaugh, D. W. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2655-2664), we have demonstrated that the 50-kDa fragment retains a Mg(2+)-dependent DNA polymerizing activity, whereas the 40-kDa polypeptide is able to catalyze the excision of mispaired nucleotides at the 3'-OH terminus of a primer/template DNA substrate in the presence of Mn2+ ions. On the other hand, the 100-kDa protein possess both activities. To date, this is the first report indicating, on the basis of direct functional data, that the polymerization and the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of a family B DNA polymerase can be ascribed to physically distinct modules of the enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1487272172,"Lactate monooxygenase utilizes oxygen in the conversion of L-lactate to acetate, CO2, and water. The gene for the enzyme from Mycobacterium smegmatis had been cloned into Escherichia coli (Giegel, D. A., Williams, C. H., Jr., and Massey, V. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6626-6632) and the derived amino acid sequence compared to glycolate oxidase and flavocytochrome b2, enzymes of known three-dimensional structure (Lindqvist, Y., and Branden, C. I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3624-3628; Xia, Z. X., and Mathews, S. F. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 212, 837-863). There is strong homology, especially around residues in the active site. The mechanism proposed for lactate monooxygenase involves an intermediate having a negative charge at the N(1)-position of the FMN. Based on the homology, lysine 266 is the residue suggested to neutralize that charge. Wild type enzyme and several forms of the enzyme altered at active site residues by site-directed mutagenesis have been expressed in E. coli and purification procedures developed. The properties determined for the recombinant wild type enzyme were, in every case, the same as those previously determined for the enzyme isolated from M. smegmatis. Mutation of lysine 266 to a methionine created K266M. The semiquinone showed spectral features different from those found in the wild type enzyme and was no longer thermodynamically stable. This indicates a redox potential for the enzyme-bound semiquinone/reduced flavin couple that is higher than the midpoint potential for the oxidized flavin/semiquinone couple. The two-electron redox potential was determined to be -180 mV at 25 degrees C, pH 7.0. In wild type enzyme, attack of the flavin ring by sulfite creates a negative charge at the FMN N(1)-position. In K266M, the stabilization of the sulfite adduct was 17,000-fold weaker (Kd approximately 10(-3) M) than in the wild type enzyme, with a rate of association that is lowered by 10,000-fold (kon = 1.2 M-1 s-1). The rate of reduction with L-lactate is significantly decreased in K266M. Unexpectedly, binding of substrate and inhibitors is significantly weaker in K266M than in the wild type enzyme. In all properties involving a negative charge at position N(1) of the FMN, K266M is distinctly different from wild type enzyme. This makes it quite likely that lysine 266 serves the postulated role of interacting with this negative charge."
https://openalex.org/W1505438501,"Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is critical to the control of cellular growth, differentiation, and carcinogenesis. A GC-rich region in the ODC promoter contains two overlapping protein binding sites that interact to regulate basal level expression in some cell types. A perfect binding motif for transcription factor Sp1 (CCCCGCCCC) is located at nucleotides -114 to -106 relative to the site of transcriptional initiation, binds strongly to purified Sp1 protein, and forms several complexes when incubated with nuclear extracts. Only one of these complexes is recognized by Sp1-specific antibody. A new protein-binding motif (GCCCCTCCCC, located at -110 to -100) partially overlaps with the Sp1 site and analyses by DNase I protection showed that a new protein (NF-ODC1) and the Sp1-like proteins interact with the ODC promoter in a mutually exclusive manner. Mutation of the NF-ODC1 binding motif strongly enhanced ODC promoter strength in some cell types, but had little or no influence in others. The effect of mutating the Sp1 site also varied with cell type. These cell type specificities did not correlate with the levels of Sp1 and NF-ODC1 binding activities in nuclear extracts. These results show that regulation of the ODC promoter by the Sp1 family is cell type-specific and modulated by a negative effector that we have termed NF-ODC1."
https://openalex.org/W1521828842,"Previous biochemical analyses with covalent affinity labels and thiol-blocking reagents suggested possible roles for one methionine residue and multiple cysteine residues in binding of steroid to the 250-amino acid hormone-binding domain at the C-terminal end of mammalian glucocorticoid receptors. To test the functional roles of these residues in the receptor's ability to bind hormone and active transcription of target genes, the mouse glucocorticoid receptor cDNA was specifically mutated to cause single amino acid substitutions for methionine 610 and for each of the 5 cysteines (at positions 628, 644, 649, 671, and 742) in the hormone-binding domain. Among these 6 residues, only mutations in cysteine 671 and cysteine 742 caused substantial reductions in function. In transient transfection assays, the concentration of dexamethasone required for half-maximal activation of a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene was increased by 10-40-fold by changing cysteine 742 to serine or cysteine 671 to serine or alanine. At saturating concentrations of dexamethasone, the mutant receptors activated the reporter gene to the same extent as the wild type receptor, indicating that the mutations affected only the hormone-binding function of the receptor and not its ability to bind DNA or activate transcription once the hormone was bound."
https://openalex.org/W1541084402,"Abstract The probable involvement of hepatic carbamyl-P in the reciprocal relationship between hepatic ureagenesis and glycogenesis from glucose was explored. Isolated perfused liver preparations from 48-h fasted rats were employed. Moderate (9.2 mM) and relatively high levels of glucose (34 mM) were perfused. Hepatic glycogenesis, glucose-6-P, carbamyl-P, and citrulline levels, hepatic urea formation, and ureagenesis based upon perfusate urea levels were measured. Experimental probes selected to modify hepatic ureagenesis and carbamyl-P production and utilization included: (a) NH4Cl, maintained at 5 mM by continuous infusion (NH4+ is a substrate for carbamyl-P synthase I and glutamate dehydrogenase); (b) norvaline, an inhibitor of ornithine transcarbamylase which catalyzes the first committed step in the urea cycle; and (c) ethoxyzolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase which produces HCO3-, an essential substrate for carbamyl-P synthase I. NH4+ increased ureagenesis and decreased glycogenesis. The inclusion of norvaline with NH4+ decreased ureagenesis and increased glycogenesis. Ethoxyzolamide with or without NH4+ inhibited both ureagenesis and glycogenesis, and decreased the hepatic glucose-6-P level. Glycogenesis was greater at 34 mM than 9.2 mM glucose, increased in norvaline-containing preparations correlative with increased availability of carbamyl-P, and decreased when carbamyl-P formation was inhibited by ethoxyzolamide. Kinetic analysis indicated a Km, Glc of 31 mM for glucose phosphorylation preliminary to glycogenesis. Glycogen formation via the indirect pathway (i.e. involving extrahepatic glycolysis, transport of lactate to the liver, and glyconeogenesis therefrom) was quantitatively insufficient to account for the observed glycogenesis. Glucokinase is contraindicated by the inverse relationship between hepatic glycogenesis and ATP availability in the ethoxyzolamide-treated preparations. In contrast, carbamyl-P:glucose phosphotransferase activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase system has the characteristics to bridge hepatic ureagenesis and glycogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1557102204,"Complementarity determining region (CDR) transplant studies were conducted between two monoclonal antibodies of distinctly different specificities (anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4-4-20 and anti-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mAb 04-01) which possessed nearly identical light chains but dissimilar heavy chains. The variations in binding specificities between the two immunoglobulins suggested that the active-site features of anti-fluorescein antibodies were dictated by characteristics intrinsic to the heavy chain (H-chain). To identify specific regions of the H-chain which influence the structure and function of an anti-fluorescein active site, CDR transplantation was systematically employed to convert the anti-ssDNA 04-01 antibody active site to an active site with anti-fluorescein activity. Each mAb 4-4-20 H-chain CDR (HCDR) was transplanted into the H-chain of a single-chain derivative of the 04-01 molecule. A fluorescence polarization ligand binding assay was utilized to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of hybrid transplant single-chain antibody HCDR1-HCDR2-HCDR3(4-4-20) for fluorescein (3.8 x 10(-7) M, indicating successful conversion of an anti-ssDNA active site to an anti-fluorescein binding site. A similar Kd (6.3 x 10(-7) M) was determined using a fluorescein fluorescence quenching assay. The transplantation results are discussed in terms of the relative contribution of each HCDR to a successful conversion in antibody specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1533497471,"NADPH-adrenoferredoxin reductase, a flavoprotein from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria, has been investigated to elucidate the equilibrium and dynamic properties of the interaction with NADP+ and adrenoferredoxin (adrenodoxin) using proton NMR spectroscopy. The line width of the signals from NADP+ depends on the presence of the reductase. The off rate constant of NADP+ from the reductase is estimated to be about 15-20 s-1 on the basis of line width measurements. No appreciable difference in off rate is detected between adenine and nicotinamide moieties of NADP+. Transferred nuclear Overhauser effect experiments for NADP+ indicate the time-dependent magnetization transfer profiles with a long lag phase. The proton NMR spectra during the titration of the reductase with adrenodoxin reveal that the reductase possesses distinct binding sites for both NADP+ and adrenodoxin. The sharp resonances in the aromatic region due to His-10 and His-62 of adrenodoxin were utilized as a probe to explore the interaction with the reductase. IN the mixture of adrenodoxin and the reductase at the mol ratio of 6:1, T1 values of the histidine residue in adrenodoxin were measured by the inversion recovery method. At low ionic strength, T1 values of the resonances are not affected in the presence or absence of the reductase. In the presence of the reductase, T1 values of resonances resulting from the histidine residues become shorter as the concentration of KCl increases because of rapid exchange between bound and free states. At low ionic strength (10 mM phosphate buffer), the off rate from the reductase is estimated to be less than about 4 s-1. The off rate of adrenodoxin from the reductase could be the rate-limiting step in cytochrome c reductase activity at low ionic strength."
