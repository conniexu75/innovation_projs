https://openalex.org/W2596630349,"During 2015-2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs."

Metal recycling and technological change will contribute to sustaining supply, but mining must continue and grow for the foreseeable future to ensure that such minerals remain available to industry. New links are needed between existing institutional frameworks to oversee responsible sourcing of minerals, trajectories for mineral exploration, environmental practices, and consumer awareness of the effects of consumption. Here we present, through analysis of a comprehensive set of data and demand forecasts, an interdisciplinary perspective on how best to ensure ecologically viable continuity of global mineral supply over the coming decades."

The magnitude of air-traffic-related aerosol-cloud interactions and the ways in which these interactions might change in the future remain uncertain. Modelling studies of the present and future effects of aviation on climate require detailed information about the number of aerosol particles emitted per kilogram of fuel burned and the microphysical properties of those aerosols that are relevant for cloud formation. However, previous observational data at cruise altitudes are sparse for engines burning conventional fuels, and no data have previously been reported for biofuel use in-flight. Here we report observations from research aircraft that sampled the exhaust of engines onboard a NASA DC-8 aircraft as they burned conventional Jet A fuel and a 50:50 (by volume) blend of Jet A fuel and a biofuel derived from Camelina oil. We show that, compared to using conventional fuels, biofuel blending reduces particle number and mass emissions immediately behind the aircraft by 50 to 70 per cent. Our observations quantify the impact of biofuel blending on aerosol emissions at cruise conditions and provide key microphysical parameters, which will be useful to assess the potential of biofuel use in aviation as a viable strategy to mitigate climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2595860143,"In cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies are thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark matter halo. In the local Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases with disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic regions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation velocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or increasing with disk radius. Comparison between the dynamical mass and the sum of stellar and cold gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, inferred from ancillary data, suggest high baryon factions in the inner, star-forming regions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than in the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (stellar initial mass function, calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves for the outer disks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation velocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this trend arises because of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the massive, high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon dominated, with dark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the large velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial pressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing radius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift. Qualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early Universe efficiently condensed at the centres of dark matter halos when gas fractions were high, and dark matter was less concentrated.

Inner membrane-anchored long OPA1 (L-OPA1) undergoes proteolytic cleavage resulting in short OPA1 (S-OPA1). It is often thought that S-OPA1 is a functionally insignificant proteolytic product of L-OPA1 because the accumulation of S-OPA1 due to L-OPA1 cleavage is observed in mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. However, cells contain a mixture of both L- and S-OPA1 in normal conditions, suggesting the functional significance of maintaining both OPA1 forms, but the differential roles of L- and S-OPA1 in mitochondrial fusion and energetics are ill-defined. Here, we examined mitochondrial fusion and energetic activities in cells possessing L-OPA1 alone, S-OPA1 alone, or both L- and S-OPA1. Using a mitochondrial fusion assay, we established that L-OPA1 confers fusion competence, whereas S-OPA1 does not. Remarkably, we found that S-OPA1 alone without L-OPA1 can maintain oxidative phosphorylation function as judged by growth in oxidative phosphorylation-requiring media, respiration measurements, and levels of the respiratory complexes. Most strikingly, S-OPA1 alone maintained normal mitochondrial cristae structure, which has been commonly assumed to be the function of OPA1 oligomers containing both L- and S-OPA1. Furthermore, we found that the GTPase activity of OPA1 is critical for maintaining cristae tightness and thus energetic competency. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to conventional notion, S-OPA1 is fully competent for maintaining mitochondrial energetics and cristae structure.

Changes in mitochondrial shape, number, and location in cells are now well appreciated collectively as mitochondrial dynamics. Among many types of mitochondrial shape changes, fission and fusion are the most characterized processes. The main molecular factors controlling mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamin-related membrane remodeling proteins.

In a steady state, a balance between fission and fusion maintains mitochondrial size and number. However, metabolic changes, stimuli, or stress from inside and outside of the cells shifts the fission-fusion balance to induce temporary or permanent changes in mitochondrial morphology (8Yu T.

Not surprisingly, growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial fission and fusion are intimately associated with energetic maintenance of mitochondria. However, molecular components regulating this connection are poorly understood. OPA1, one of the mitochondrial dynamics proteins, has been implicated in mitochondrial energetic maintenance. Mitochondria of OPA1-deficient cells are fragmented and show greatly diminished cristae, which is functionally reflected as a defect in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (14Griparic L. van der Wel N.N.

As such, although mutations in OPA1 in human are best known to cause optic atrophy, they are associated with extraocular systemic manifestations such as deafness, myopathy, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and more rarely spastic paraplegia and multiple sclerosis-like illness known as autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus (17Alexander C.

These observations suggest that OPA1 is a critical factor connecting mitochondrial morphology and energetics. Inside mitochondria, OPA1 exists in both inner membrane-anchored and soluble forms facing the intermembrane space. Human OPA1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, generating eight different splice variants (21Olichon A. Elachouri G. Baricault L. Delettre C. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. OPA1 alternate splicing uncouples an evolutionary conserved function in mitochondrial fusion from a vertebrate restricted function in apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Delettre C.

Genet. 2001; 109: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Upon expression, OPA1 is imported to the mitochondria by the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). The transmembrane (TM) domain downstream of MTS acts as a stop transfer signal, anchoring the OPA1 protein at the inner membrane, leaving most of the protein in the intermembrane space (23Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. The human dynamin-related protein OPA1 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the inter-membrane space.FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The membrane-anchored OPA1 (“L-OPA1” for long OPA1) is further cleaved by proteases downstream of the TM region, generating TM-free OPA1 (“S-OPA1” for short OPA1). At least two cleavage sites, each cleaved by OMA1 and Yme1L, have been identified (6Song Z. Chen H. Fiket M. Alexander C. Chan D.C.

It has been shown that the presence of both L- and S-OPA1 is necessary for mitochondrial fusion, whereas L- or S-OPA1 alone is insufficient for fusion in normal conditions (6Song Z. Chen H. Fiket M.

Currently available information concerning L- and S-OPA1-specific roles in mitochondrial energetics is from studies with the manipulations of OMA1, Yme1L, or prohibitin 2 (Phb2) that perturb OPA1 processing. OMA1/Yme1L double knock-out cells that have only L-OPA1 are fusion-competent and maintain normal cristae structure, indicating that L-OPA1 is sufficient for mitochondrial fusion, cristae maintenance, and conferring apoptotic resistance (29Anand R. Wai T. Baker M.J. Kladt N. Schauss A.C. Rugarli E. Langer T. The i-AAA protease YME1L and OMA1 cleave OPA1 to balance mitochondrial fusion and fission.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of Phb2 induces OPA1 cleavage, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation, cristae disruption, and increased apoptotic sensitivity, and reintroduction of L-OPA1, not S-OPA1, to Phb2-null cells restored these defects, suggesting that S-OPA1 is incompetent for mitochondrial fusion and cristae maintenance (39Merkwirth C.

Thus, it is possible that the mitochondrial phenotypes observed by knocking out Phb2, OMA1, or Yme1L may include effects unrelated to OPA1 function. Furthermore, contrary to the notion that OPA1 cleavage is causal for mitochondrial fragmentation and OXPHOS defect, an increase in OXPHOS enhances OPA1 cleavage and induces mitochondrial fusion (51Mishra P.

Proteolytic cleavage of Opa1 stimulates mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and couples fusion to oxidative phosphorylation.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of OPA1 cleavage in mitochondrial fusion is controversial, and specific roles of L- and S-OPA1 in energetic maintenance are ill-defined. In the present study, we used cells exclusively expressing L-OPA1, S-OPA1, or both to evaluate the differential functions of L- and S-OPA1. Our data elaborate and confirm that L-OPA1 has an intrinsic activity for mitochondrial fusion, whereas the fusion activity of S-OPA1 is insignificant. On the other hand, we found that either S- or L-OPA1 alone is sufficient to support mitochondrial energetic activity. Most surprisingly, cells having S-OPA1 alone maintain normal cristae structure. These experimental data show that S-OPA1 has full competency for mitochondrial energetic maintenance despite lacking fusion activity. We propose that S-OPA1 may expedite cristae reorganization, providing energetic flexibility. OPA1 is expressed in eight different splice variants (v1–v8) (22Delettre C. Griffoin J.M. Kaplan J.

As a representative OPA1 that produces both L- and S-OPA1, we used variant 1 (OPA1-v1). When expressed in cells, OPA1-v1 is cleaved incompletely at S1, generating cleaved S-OPA1 along with uncleaved L-OPA1.

https://openalex.org/W2596680179,"The vertebrate-conserved RNA-binding protein DND1 is required for the survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs), as well as the suppression of germ cell tumours in mice. Here we show that in mice DND1 binds a UU(A/U) trinucleotide motif predominantly in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA, and destabilizes target mRNAs through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the extent of suppression is dependent on the number of DND1-binding sites. This DND1-dependent mRNA destabilization is required for the survival of mouse PGCs and spermatogonial stem cells by suppressing apoptosis. The spectrum of target RNAs includes positive regulators of apoptosis and inflammation, and modulators of signalling pathways that regulate stem-cell pluripotency, including the TGFβ superfamily, all of which are aberrantly elevated in DND1-deficient PGCs. We propose that the induction of the post-transcriptional suppressor DND1 synergizes with concurrent transcriptional changes to ensure precise developmental transitions during cellular differentiation and maintenance of the germ line."

https://openalex.org/W2596394293,"Understanding and predicting the likely response of ecosystems to climate change are crucial challenges for ecology and for conservation biology. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in the tropics as these forests store more than half the total atmospheric carbon stock in their biomass. Biomass is determined by the balance between biomass inputs (i.e., growth) and outputs (mortality). We can expect therefore that conditions that favor high growth rates, such as abundant water supply, warmth, and nutrient-rich soils will tend to correlate with high biomass stocks. Our main objective is to describe the patterns of above ground biomass (AGB) stocks across major tropical forests across climatic gradients in Northwestern South America. We gathered data from 200 plots across the region, at elevations ranging between 0 to 3400 m. We estimated AGB based on allometric equations and values for stem density, basal area, and wood density weighted by basal area at the plot-level. We used two groups of climatic variables, namely mean annual temperature and actual evapotranspiration as surrogates of environmental energy, and annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and water availability as surrogates of water availability. We found that AGB is more closely related to water availability variables than to energy variables. In northwest South America, water availability influences carbon stocks principally by determining stand structure, i.e. basal area. When water deficits increase in tropical forests we can expect negative impact on biomass and hence carbon storage."
https://openalex.org/W2597115690,"More than 80% of available malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are based on the detection of histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Recent studies have shown the genes that code for this protein and its paralog, histidine-rich protein-3 (PfHRP3), are absent in parasites from the Peruvian Amazon Basin. Lack of PfHRP2 protein through deletion of the pfhrp2 gene leads to false-negative RDT results for P. falciparum. We have evaluated the extent of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in a convenience sample of 198 isolates from six sites in three states across the Brazilian Amazon Basin (Acre, Rondonia and Para) and 25 isolates from two sites in Bolivia collected at different times between 2010 and 2012. Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene and their flanking genes on chromosomes 7 and 13, respectively, were amplified from 198 blood specimens collected in Brazil. In Brazil, the isolates collected in Acre state, located in the western part of the Brazilian Amazon, had the highest percentage of deletions for pfhrp2 25 (31.2%) of 79, while among those collected in Rondonia, the prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletion was only 3.3% (2 out of 60 patients). In isolates from Para state, all parasites were pfhrp2-positive. In contrast, we detected high proportions of isolates from all 3 states that were pfhrp3-negative ranging from 18.3% (11 out of 60 samples) to 50.9% (30 out of 59 samples). In Bolivia, only one of 25 samples (4%) tested had deleted pfhrp2 gene, while 68% (17 out of 25 samples) were pfhrp3-negative. Among the isolates tested, P. falciparum pfhrp2 gene deletions were present mainly in those from Acre State in the Brazilian Amazon. These results indicate it is important to reconsider the use of PfHRP2-based RDTs in the western region of the Brazilian Amazon and to implement appropriate surveillance systems to monitor pfhrp2 gene deletions in this and other parts of the Amazon region."
https://openalex.org/W2732109967,"Insulin resistance is a well-known risk factor for obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) and associated cardiovascular diseases, but its mechanisms are undefined in the lymphatics. Mesenteric lymphatic vessels from MetSyn or LPS-injected rats exhibited impaired intrinsic contractile activity and associated inflammatory changes. Hence, we hypothesized that insulin resistance in lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) affects cell bioenergetics and signaling pathways that consequently alter contractility. LMCs were treated with different concentrations of insulin or glucose or both at various time points to determine insulin resistance. Onset of insulin resistance significantly impaired glucose uptake, mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption rates, glycolysis, lactic acid, and ATP production in LMCs. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia also impaired the PI3K/Akt while enhancing the ERK/ p38MAPK/JNK pathways in LMCs. Increased NF-kB nuclear translocation and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and VCAM-1 levels in insulin-resistant LMCs indicated activation of inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain-20, a key regulator of lymphatic muscle contraction, was observed in insulin-resistant LMCs. Therefore, our data elucidate the mechanisms of insulin resistance in LMCs and provide the first evidence that hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia promote insulin resistance and impair lymphatic contractile status by reducing glucose uptake, altering cellular metabolic pathways, and activating inflammatory signaling cascades.—Lee, Y., Fluckey, J.

https://openalex.org/W2602325707,"Motile cilia are found on unicellular organisms such as the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, on sperm cells, and on cells that line the trachea and fallopian tubes in mammals. The motility of cilia relies on a number of large protein complexes including the force-generating outer dynein arms (ODAs). The transport of ODAs into cilia has been previously shown to require the transport adaptor ODA16, as well as the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT46, but the molecular mechanism by which ODAs are recognized and transported into motile cilia is still unclear. Here, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of C. reinhardtii ODA16 (CrODA16) and mapped the binding to IFT46 and ODAs. The CrODA16 structure revealed a small 80-residue N-terminal domain and a C-terminal 8-bladed β-propeller domain that are both required for the association with the N-terminal 147 residues of IFT46. The dissociation constant of the IFT46-ODA16 complex was 200 nm, demonstrating that CrODA16 associates with the IFT complex with an affinity comparable with that of the individual IFT subunits. Furthermore, we show, using ODAs extracted from the axonemes of C. reinhardtii, that the C-terminal β-propeller but not the N-terminal domain of CrODA16 is required for the interaction with ODAs. These data allowed us to present an architectural model for ODA16-mediated IFT of ODAs."

This study investigates how smartphone users’ security- and privacy-related decisions are influenced by their attitudes, perceptions, and understanding of various security threats. In this work, we seek to provide quantified insights into smartphone users’ behavior toward multiple key security features including locking mechanisms, application repositories, mobile instant messaging, and smartphone location services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reveals often unforeseen correlations and dependencies between various privacy- and security-related behaviors. Our work also provides evidence that making correct security decisions might not necessarily correlate with individuals’ awareness of the consequences of security threats. By comparing participants’ behavior and their motives for adopting or ignoring certain security practices, we suggest implementing additional persuasive approaches that focus on addressing social and technological aspects of the problem. On the basis of our findings and the results presented in the literature, we identify the factors that might influence smartphone users’ security behaviors. We then use our understanding of what might drive and influence significant behavioral changes to propose several platform design modifications that we believe could improve the security levels of smartphones."

Synergies existed among multiple ecosystem services in savanna and woodland states with significantly larger nutrient pools, more diversity and native plant richness, and less invasive species.

https://openalex.org/W2620771580,"Prokaryotic pathogens establish infection in mammals by capturing the proteolytic enzyme plasminogen (Plg) onto their surface to digest host extracellular matrix (ECM). One of the bacterial surface Plg receptors is the multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In a defensive response, the host mounts an inflammatory response, which involves infiltration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. This requires macrophage exit from the blood and migration across basement membranes, a phenomenon dependent on proteolytic remodeling of the ECM utilizing Plg. The ability of Plg to facilitate inflammatory cell recruitment critically depends on receptors on the surface of phagocyte cells. Utilizing a combination of biochemical, cellular, knockdown, and in vivo approaches, we demonstrated that upon inflammation, macrophages recruit GAPDH onto their surface to carry out the same task of capturing Plg to digest ECM to aid rapid phagocyte migration and combat the invading pathogens. We propose that GAPDH is an ancient, evolutionarily conserved receptor that plays a key role in the Plg-dependent regulation of macrophage recruitment in the inflammatory response to microbial aggression, thus pitting prokaryotic GAPDH against mammalian GAPDH, with both involved in a conserved role of Plg activation on the surface of their respective cells, to conflicting ends.-Chauhan, A.

The NuRD complex is an epigenetic regulation-related protein complex functioning as a key factor in various important biological processes. It has the unique composition of two distinct functional enzymatic activities exercised by the ATPase/helicase Chd3/4 (Mi-2α/β) and the histone deacetylases Hdac1/2 (11Allen H.F. Wade P.A. Kutateladze T.G. The NuRD architecture.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3513-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Saladi S.V. de la Serna I.L. ATP dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes in embryonic stem cells.Stem Cell Rev. 2010; 6: 62-73Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional proteins included in this complex are proteins with a methyl-DNA-binding domain (Mbd2/3), WD40 repeat proteins (Rbbp7/4), metastasis-associated proteins (Mta1/2/3), and poorly defined proteins (Gatad2a/b) (11Allen H.F. Wade P.A. Kutateladze T.G. The NuRD architecture.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3513-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed a role of the NuRD complex in the regulation of ESC identity, especially the function of Mbd3, a core functional component essential for the stable formation of the complex (13Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mbd3−/− ESCs can self-renew normally and maintain an undifferentiated state even in the absence of LIF (13Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, Mbd3-depleted ESCs cannot make lineage specification properly in response to differentiation stimuli (13Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Kaji K. Nichols J. Hendrich B. Mbd3, a component of the NuRD co-repressor complex, is required for development of pluripotent cells.Development. 2007; 134: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Compared with Mbd3, the role of Chd4, the largest component of the NuRD complex, in the regulation of ESC identity is poorly defined. Chd4, also known as Mi-2β, belongs to the class II CHD subfamily. It was originally identified as an autoantigen in dermatomyositis (15Wang H.B. Zhang Y. Mi2, an auto-antigen for dermatomyositis, is an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Limited studies of Chd4 in stem cells show that CHD4 is essential for planarian stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration by contributing to neoblast formation (16Scimone M.L. Meisel J. Reddien P.W. The Mi-2-like Smed-CHD4 gene is required for stem cell differentiation in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea.Development. 2010; 137: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that it is required for the self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (17Yoshida T. Hazan I. Zhang J. Ng S.Y. Naito T. Snippert H.J. Heller E.J. Qi X. Lawton L.N. Williams C.J. Georgopoulos K. The role of the chromatin remodeler Mi-2β in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and multilineage differentiation.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1174-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In ESCs and during somatic cell reprogramming, Chd4 is usually considered as a partner of Mbd3, acting consistently with the NuRD complex as a whole (18Whyte W.A. Bilodeau S. Orlando D.A. Hoke H.A. Frampton G.M. Foster C.T. Cowley S.M. Young R.A. Enhancer decommissioning by LSD1 during embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2012; 482: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 19Rais Y. Zviran A. Geula S. Gafni O. Chomsky E.

Jaitin D.A. et al.Deterministic direct reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency.Nature. 2013; 502: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, increasing studies indicate that there are submodules of large protein complexes in a context-dependent manner. The possibility exists that Chd4 may function as a peripheral subunit of the NuRD complex in different cell types such as ESCs (20Low J.K. Webb S.R. Silva A.P. Saathoff H. Ryan D.P. Torrado M. Brofelth M. Parker B.L. Shepherd N.E. Mackay J.P. CHD4 is a peripheral component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex.J. Biol.

Biol. 2016; 428: 2931-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the specific function of Chd4 in mouse ESCs and found that, differently from Mbd3, Chd4 is a gene required for ESC self-renewal. Chd4-deficient ESCs have an attenuated self-renewal ability. Interestingly, Chd4 acts as a repressor for the expression of the transcription factor Tbx3, thereby inhibiting lineage specification, especially toward the endoderm. Further, our study reveals that the protein stability of Chd4 is controlled posttranslationally. The histone variant H2A.Z interacts with Chd4 and stabilizes Chd4 proteins by preventing 26S proteasome-mediated Chd4 protein degradation. Taken together, this study defines the role of Chd4 in ESC fate determination and identifies the Chd4-Tbx3 axis for the precise control of ESC fate. We began with comparing the expression level of Chd4 between mouse ESCs (CGR8 and J1 ESC lines) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and found that both mRNA and protein levels of Chd4 were significantly higher in ESCs than in MEF cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The finding implies that Chd4 may have a role in ESCs. To determine the role of Chd4 for ESC self-renewal, we constructed Tet-On Chd4 RNAi ESC lines stably integrated with inducible Chd4 shRNAs responsive to doxycycline (Dox) treatment. To ensure knockdown (KD) specificity, two stable cell lines (Chd4i-1 and Chd4i-8) with distinct shRNA sequences targeting Chd4 were established. An enhanced GFP RNAi (eGFPi) cell line with an eGFP shRNA sequence constructed in the same system was used as a negative control. After treating the inducible cells of Chd4i lines with Dox, Chd4 expression levels drastically decreased at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas the treatment did not alter the Chd4 level in eGFPi cells (Fig. 1, C and D), confirming the specificity of our induction system. To exclude the effect of Chd4 shRNA on the homolog of Mi-2, Chd3 (also known as Mi-2α), we examined the expression level of Chd3 in Tc-inducible RNAi cell lines (eGFPi, Chd4i-1, and Chd4i-8) treated with or without Dox for 4 days. In accordance with a previous report (22Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Mi-2/NuRD: multiple complexes for many purposes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we found that Chd3 expression was much less abundant compared with Chd4 in undifferentiated ESCs (supplemental Fig. 1). Intriguingly, Chd3 mRNA levels were elevated to some extent in Chd4-depleted cells, implying a potential compensatory role. However, the elevated Chd3 level was lower than that of Chd4 after RNAi treatment and not sufficient to affect the effect of Chd4 depletion. We found that colonies of Chd4-deficient ESCs were smaller than those of control cells and brighter, especially at the edge of the colonies (Fig. 1E). The phenotype could be observed after 4 days of Dox treatment and became more obvious after cell passaging. Moreover, the attachment of ESC colonies to dishes seemed looser than that of control cells, as indicated by the fact that Chd4-deficient ESCs floated during examination of the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an often-used molecular marker of undifferentiated ESCs (data not shown). The loose attachment of Chd4 KD ESCs prevented us from conducting colony formation assays to assess their capacity to self-renew. Instead, we carried out a fluorescence-based competitive assay, which has also been used in determining the self-renewal ability of ESCs (5Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). For this assay, stable cell lines expressing GFP and shRNAs targeting Chd4 or luciferase were generated and mixed with control ESCs stably expressing non-targeting shRNA (GFP-negative) cells at a 4:1 ratio. The percentages of GFP-positive cells were determined at every passage for six continuous generations. A progressive reduction of GFP-positive cells was observed in Chd4 KD cells for both Chd4i lines (Fig. 1F), indicating that Chd4 depletion impaired the ability of ESCs to self-renew. To characterize Chd4 depletion-induced phenotypes at a molecular level, we examined the expression levels of pluripotency- and differentiation-associated genes in established inducible RNAi cell lines treated with or without Dox for 4 days. Our qRT-PCR assay results showed that expression of self-renewal-associated genes responded to the silencing of Chd4 differently. The transcript levels of Oct4 and Rex1 remained unchanged, whereas the levels of Tbx3 and Klf5 increased. Moreover, Chd4 depletion led to reduced Nanog and Klf4 expression (Fig. 1G), suggesting a unique and complicated transcription-regulatory role of Chd4 in ESCs. As for differentiation-associated genes, the expression levels of markers for the mesoderm (T and Mixl1), endoderm (Gata6 and Sox17), trophectoderm (Cdx2 and Hand1), and ectoderm (Fgf5) increased to various degrees in Chd4-depleted cells (Fig. 1H), implying that Chd4 might repress the expression of lineage master genes to maintain ESCs at an undifferentiated state. As a negative control, Dox treatment did not alter expression levels of any genes tested in eGFPi cells (Fig. 1I). Collectively, these results reveal that Chd4 is required for the maintenance of ESC self-renewal, probably through controlling the expression of various sets of important genes. Usually, disruption of self-renewal genes in ESCs would give rise to differentiated cell morphologies, including enlarged cell size, decreased ratio of the nucleus to cytoplasm, and the loss of compact ESC colonies. In contrast, Chd4-depleted ESCs had reduced self-renewal ability with smaller and tight colonies (Fig. 1E). To determine whether the smaller size of colonies was due to fewer cells in colonies, we seeded the same number of cells in different groups and counted the cells for nine consecutive passages, with 3 days for one passage. Cell growth curves showed that Chd4-deficient ESCs (Chd4i in the presence of Dox) had significantly slower cell growth rates than control cells (Chd4i in the absence of Dox) (Fig. 2, A and B). The similar cell growth rate of eGFPi cells in the absence and presence of Dox excluded an influence of Dox on cell growth (Fig. 2C). This result indicated that Chd4 was needed for the normal growth of ESCs. We then examined whether the reduced cell growth of Chd4 KD cells was a result of decreased cell proliferation or increased cell apoptosis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by BrdU incorporation assay and Annexin V-PI staining assay, respectively. Our results indicated that Chd4 deficiency decreased ESC proliferation ability (Fig. 2D) and increased the proportions of early apoptotic cells significantly (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that Chd4 plays a role in maintaining the normal growth of ESCs, probably by ensuring cell survival and proliferation. The abovementioned studies were conducted under culture conditions supporting ESC self-renewal. We wanted to know the role of Chd4 during ESC differentiation. To this end, we performed differentiation assays both in vitro and in vivo. We cultured ESCs in suspension for the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), a widely used ESC differentiation strategy (23Keller G.M. In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), and compared the expression profiles of lineage marker genes between control (in the absence of Dox) and Chd4 KD cells (in the presence of Dox) on days 0, 3, 6, and 9 of EB formation. Specific and efficient KD of Chd4 expression by Dox treatment during EB formation was first validated (Fig. 3, A and C). Moreover, the normal induction of marker genes for various lineages, including Fgf5, T, Gata6, and Cdx2, during EB formation was indicated by a gradual up-regulation of these genes in control cells, similar to the expression pattern reported previously during EB formation (24Hailesellasse Sene K. Porter C.J. Palidwor G. Perez-Iratxeta C. Muro E.M. Campbell P.A. Rudnicki M.A. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Gene function in early mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Significantly stronger induction of all these lineage marker genes was found in Chd4 KD cells compared with control cells at all time points examined (Fig. 3B). However, Dox treatment did not alter the expression profiles of these genes in eGFPi cells, excluding the possibility that changes of gene expression in Chd4i cells were caused by the Dox treatment (Fig. 3D). The finding indicated that depletion of Chd4 promoted ESC differentiation during EB formation. In addition, we examined the expression patterns of Oct4 and Tbx3 in the same differentiation system. Both genes were quickly and substantially down-regulated on day 3 of EB formation and maintained at low levels until day 9 in control cells (supplemental Fig. 2, A–D), consistent with their known expression patterns during differentiation (24Hailesellasse Sene K. Porter C.J. Palidwor G. Perez-Iratxeta C. Muro E.M. Campbell P.A. Rudnicki M.A. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Gene function in early mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similar to ESCs cultured under self-renewal conditions, Chd4 KD cells did not alter Oct4 levels while significantly elevating Tbx3 levels on different days of EB formation, further supporting the notion that Chd4 has a repressive effect on Tbx3 expression. As Mbd3 and Chd4 are both in the NuRD complex, and our data indicated that silencing of Chd4 induced phenotypes entirely different from those reported for Mbd3 under both self-renewal and differentiation culture conditions, it became necessary to re-examine the function of Mbd3 to verify the difference. To this end, we generated two ESC lines (Mbd3i-1 and Mbd3i-2) stably transduced by lentiviruses carrying Mbd3 shRNAs along with one control line (Ni) using non-targeting shRNA. The Mbd3 KD efficiency was first validated (Fig. 3E). With these lines, we evaluated marker gene expression patterns in the same EB formation system. In accordance with reported results, the induction of all differentiation genes tested was blocked in Mbd3 KD cells on day 3 of EB formation. Significantly impaired induction of Gata6 and Cdx2 expression was observed at all time points examined (Figs. 3F). These data indicated that, different from Chd4, Mbd3 KD impaired ESC differentiation. Therefore, Chd4 and Mbd3 have distinct functions in ESCs both at the undifferentiated state and during differentiation. Furthermore, we assessed the developmental potential of Chd4 KD ESCs in vivo by teratoma formation assays. We injected Chd4 KD ESCs (Chd4i-1 and Chd4i-8) stably transduced by lentiviruses carrying Chd4 shRNAs, along with Ni ESCs stably transduced by non-targeting shRNA, into immune-deficient mice. For each mouse, we injected the Ni cells into the left leg and one Chd4 KD cell line into the right leg. After 3 weeks, we observed teratomas in all injected mice, and there was no obvious difference in the size of teratomas in the two legs of the same mouse. At the fourth week after injection, we isolated teratomas and found that teratomas derived from Chd4 KD ESCs were bigger than those derived from Ni ESCs (Fig. 3G and supplemental Fig. 2E). This is in agreement with the results of our in vitro assays, which indicated that Chd4 KD promoted ESC differentiation. Analysis of H&E-stained teratoma sections revealed that teratomas derived from both Chd4 KD and Ni ESCs contained various cell types or tissues of all three germ layers, including pigmented neural rosettes (ectoderm), cartilage (mesoderm), and goblet cells (endoderm) (Fig. 3H and supplemental Fig. 2F). These results support the notion that Chd4-deficient ESCs sustain and even have more robust developmental potentials. To understand how Chd4 KD induced the up-regulation of lineage marker genes, we tested the role of Tbx3 in Chd4 KD-induced phenotypes, as Tbx3 expression increased significantly in Chd4-depleted cells, and our previous study showed that Tbx3 has dual functions in both ESC self-renewal maintenance and endoderm gene induction (25Lu R. Yang A. Jin Y. Dual functions of T-box 3 (Tbx3) in the control of self-renewal and extraembryonic endoderm differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8425-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To answer the question of whether Chd4 regulated Tbx3 expression directly, we first searched published Chd4 ChIP sequencing data (18Whyte W.A. Bilodeau S. Orlando D.A. Hoke H.A. Frampton G.M. Foster C.T. Cowley S.M. Young R.A. Enhancer decommissioning by LSD1 during embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2012; 482: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and found the enrichment of Chd4 at the Tbx3 promoter region. Our ChIP-qPCR results validated the binding of Chd4 at the Tbx3 gene (Fig. 4A), implying a direct regulatory role of Chd4 for Tbx3 transcription. Additionally, to obtain more evidence that Tbx3 is indeed a target of Chd4, we cloned three genomic DNA fragments from the Tbx3 promoter region (each about 1 kb surrounding Chd4-binding sites) into a luciferase reporter plasmid, respectively, and transfected these reporter plasmids into 293FT cells together with different amounts (0, 25, 50, and 100 ng) of the Chd4 expression construct. The luciferase reporter assay results indicated that Chd4 overexpression significantly inhibited Tbx3 promoter-controlled luciferase activities (Fig. 4B). These data support the notion that Chd4 may directly repress the expression of Tbx3. Second, as it was reported that the NuRD complex could recruit PRC2 to the genomic regulatory region (26Reynolds N. Salmon-Divon M. Dvinge H. Hynes-Allen A. Balasooriya G. Leaford D. Behrens A. Bertone P. Hendrich B. NuRD-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 facilitates recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 to direct gene repression.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we examined the association of the key component of PRC2, Suz12, at the promoter region of Tbx3 in control and Chd4-deficient cells to address the questions of whether PRC2 would be recruited to the Tbx3 gene and whether Chd4 could regulate PRC2 recruitment. As anticipated, Suz12 was recruited to the Tbx3 locus, and Chd4 KD significantly reduced the recruitment (Fig. 4C). Finally, we tested whether abnormally activated Tbx3 expression caused by Chd4 KD could account for the aberrant induction of differentiation-associated genes. To this end, we transfected Tc-inducible RNAi cells (Chd4i-1 and Chd4i-8) with specific Tbx3 siRNAs after the cells were treated with or without Dox for 4 days to knock down Tbx3 in Chd4 KD cells and collected cells for experiments 2 days after Tbx3 siRNA transfection (Fig. 4, D and G). Our qRT-PCR results showed that Tbx3 KD could rescue Chd4-KD induced down-regulation of the pluripotency gene Nanog but not other tested pluripotency genes (Fig. 4, E and H). This finding is in line with a previous report that Tbx3 overexpression could induce ESC differentiation via repressing Nanog transcription (27Zhao D. Wu Y. Chen K. Tbx3 isoforms are involved in pluripotency maintaining through distinct regulation of Nanog transcriptional activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2014; 444: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tbx3 could alleviate Chd4 KD-induced up-regulation of marker genes, including T, Gata4, Gata6, Sox17, and Cdx2. Among Chd4 KD-induced genes, elevated expression of Gata6, a master regulator of the endoderm, was most markedly inhibited by Tbx3 deficiency (Fig. 4, F and I), consistent w"

Cell-cell adhesion is a defining feature of multicellular organisms, and underlies tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. In the adherens junction, the extracellular region of classical cadherins mediates the physical interaction between cells. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins binds to β-catenin, which in turn binds to α-catenin, a filamentous actin (F-actin)-binding protein. The cadherin·β-catenin·α-catenin complex binds stably to actin in a force-dependent manner, thereby physically linking cadherins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. In addition to β-catenin and F-actin, α-catenin binds to other F-actin-binding proteins including vinculin, which is recruited to nascent junctions upon a force-dependent conformational change in α-catenin, and is thought to further stabilize the linkage to the cytoskeleton (1Ladoux B.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The N-terminal (N) domain contains two 4-helix bundles, designated NI and NII, which share a central, long α-helix. The N domain binds to β-catenin and, in the case of mammalian αE-catenin, mediates homodimerization. This is followed by the middle (M) domain, comprised of three tandem 4-helix bundles, MI, MII, and MIII, that contain binding sites for vinculin, α-actinin, and afadin.

Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin binds to the MI bundle, which exists in a conformational equilibrium in which its two central helices can dissociate from the bundle and bind to vinculin. This equilibrium is shifted toward the “closed,” four-helix bundle state through intramolecular interactions with the MIII domain, also known as the “adhesion modulation domain.” It is thought that mechanical force alters the relative positions of MI and MIII and thereby removes this inhibition (10Maki K.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a homologous junctional complex consisting of HMR-1, a classical cadherin homolog, HMP-2, a β-catenin homolog, and HMP-1, the α-catenin homolog (12Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Despite sequence homologies, the C. elegans proteins exhibit different biochemical and biophysical properties than their mammalian counterparts. The cytoplasmic domain of HMR-1 is shorter than that of classical vertebrate cadherins and binds to HMP-2 more weakly; in both cases phosphorylation of the cadherin increases affinity for β-catenin (13Choi H.J.

Most metazoans express a single β-catenin that functions in both cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and Wnt signaling, whereas C. elegans expresses several β-catenin homologs, of which only HMP-2 functions in adhesion. HMP-1 is a monomeric α-catenin homolog that binds HMP-2 and the phosphorylated HMR-1·HMP-2 complex, but it was reported that it does not bind actin in vitro, even though its ABD and association with actin are essential for its function in vivo (15Kwiatkowski A.V.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Differences in biochemical properties between mammalian αE-catenin and homologs in zebrafish, fruit fly, and cnidarians have also been described (16Miller P.W. Clarke D.N. Weis W.I. Lowe C.J.

Thus, understanding the biochemical function of the C. elegans proteins promises to provide insights into shared and unique roles of the cadherin·catenin complex in multicellular organisms. Here, we present structural and biochemical data on C. elegans HMP-1 and its interactions with other junctional components. The middle (M) domain of mammalian αE-catenin is conformationally flexible, which enables force-dependent binding to vinculin (10Maki K. Han S.W. Hirano Y. Yonemura S. Hakoshima T. Adachi T.

Therefore, we determined the crystal structure of the HMP-1 M domain to understand its structural and functional characteristics. The HMP-1 M domain (residues 270–646) was overexpressed, purified, and crystallized (18Kang H. Bang I. Weis W.I. Choi H.J.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the HMP-1 M domain consists of three 4-helix bundles, and is similar to low resolution structures of the corresponding region of αE-catenin visualized in crystals of nearly full-length αE-catenin (PDB codes 4IGG and 4K1N). The HMP-1 M domain crystals have two crystallographically independent copies in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B) that are structurally very similar (r.m.s. deviation = 1.2 Å for 348 Cα positions). Size exclusion chromatography verified that the M domain is a monomer in solution (data not shown). The first two 4-helix bundles, MI and MII, are connected by a continuous α helix, and the last helix of MII and the first helix of MIII are connected by a single amino acid, Thr500, which packs against Val381 and Ile384 in MII, and Phe505 in MIII. The relative position of MII and MIII is stabilized by extensive polar and nonpolar interactions between them (Fig. 1, C and D). Phe505 and Val508 in MIII interact with Val381 in MII. The aliphatic portion of the Arg551 side chain and Cα of Gly550 in MIII engage in van der Waals interactions with Leu389 in MII. In addition to these nonpolar interactions, polar interactions also stabilize the overall MII-MIII conformation, including a salt bridge between Arg551 and Asp386 and hydrogen bonding of His512 with Asp382 and Ser385. Arg551 and Asp386 form additional polar interactions with charged residues on neighboring bundles, thereby connecting MI, MII, and MIII and stabilizing the overall M domain structure. Overall, 5 linked polar interactions lie at the core of the M domain (Fig. 1D). In addition, two more salt bridges, Asp504 (MIII)-Arg378 (MI) and Arg554 (MIII)-Asp497 (MII), stabilize a compact conformation of the M domain. The overall structure of the HMP-1 M domain is more similar to that of the αE-catenin M domain (r.m.s. deviation value of 2.1 Å for 309 Cα positions) than the vinculin M domain (r.m.s. deviation value of 3.9 Å for 268 Cα positions) (Fig. 2, A and B). The D3b and D4 bundles of vinculin superimpose well with MII and MIII of HMP-1 (r.m.s. deviation = 1.3 Å for 206 Cα positions), whereas the first bundle (vinculin D3a, HMP-1 MI) is positioned differently. This appears to be caused by the presence of the vinculin D2 domain, which is absent in HMP-1 and other α-catenins. The D2 bundle makes close contacts with D3a, likely leading to a different subdomain arrangement in vinculin (Fig. 2B). Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis identified six salt bridges that stabilize the relative positions of the three M domain bundles in mammalian αE-catenin (19Li J. Newhall J. Ishiyama N. Gottardi C. Ikura M. Leckband D.E. Tajkhorshid E. Structural determinants of the mechanical stability of α-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 18890-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the αE-catenin and HMP-1 M domains (Fig. 3A) reveals that four of six salt bridges are conserved in HMP-1: Asp497-Arg554, Arg378-Asp504, Arg320-Glu515, and Asp386-Arg551 (Fig. 3B). The other two salt bridges are not conserved, as the positively charged arginine is replaced by an uncharged cysteine in one pair (Asp390-Cys543) and by a neutral glutamine in another (Asp271-Gln445) (Fig. 3B). The four conserved salt bridges in HMP-1, together with the aforementioned polar and nonpolar interactions, appear to be sufficient to maintain the observed M domain crystal structure. This is supported by the observation that crystal structures of the MII-MIII fragment of αE-catenin (PDB codes 1H6G and 1L7C) are very different from both the full M domain structure of αE-catenin (PDB codes 4IGG and 4K1N) and HMP-1. Variation in the relative position of MII and MIII in MII-MIII fragment crystals indicates that all three bundles are required to keep the M domain in a stable conformation. This may also be due in part to the low pH of these crystals, which could disrupt stabilizing salt bridges. The dynamic formation and breakage of salt bridges within the M domain are likely important for structural stability and may be related to the function of αE-catenin as a mechanosensor (19Li J. Newhall J. Ishiyama N. Gottardi C. Ikura M. Leckband D.E. Tajkhorshid E. Structural determinants of the mechanical stability of α-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 18890-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding to vinculin is force dependent, and is mediated by the MI bundle, which unfolds such that its two central helices become co-linear and bind to the vinculin D1 domain (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2013; 288: 15913-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that αE-catenin adopts two distinct conformations depending on mechanical stress. In the absence of tension, the vinculin-binding site in MI is largely inaccessible, as shown by the relatively weak affinity of αE-catenin for vinculin (Kd = 2 μm) (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As force is applied to the protein, the salt bridges stabilizing the M domain structure are broken and the MI bundle is freed to interact with vinculin (19Li J. Newhall J. Ishiyama N. Gottardi C. Ikura M. Leckband D.E. Tajkhorshid E. Structural determinants of the mechanical stability of α-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 18890-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When MIII is deleted, the KD drops to 5 nm, indicating that stabilization of the M domain by the MIII bundle inhibits vinculin binding (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Given the structural similarity between the HMP-1 and αE-catenin M domains, it is possible that the HMP-1 M domain undergoes open-closed conformational changes similar to mammalian αE-catenin. Such changes could regulate the accessibility of a binding site for an actin-binding protein such as vinculin, although HMP-1 and the vinculin homolog DEB-1 are not co-expressed in epithelial cells in C. elegans (22Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. The basal component of the nematode dense-body is vinculin.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct tissue expression could reflect an evolutionary change in gene expression without an alteration in the intrinsic ability of the two proteins to interact. Alternatively, a loss of affinity between HMP-1 and DEB-1 could have ultimately led to their functional dissociation over evolutionary time. To assess the latter possibility, we tested whether the HMP-1 M domain can bind to vertebrate vinculin and/or DEB-1. The D1 domain of vinculin, consisting of the N-terminal 259 amino acids, encompasses the full α-catenin-binding site (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Vinculin D1 and the corresponding region of DEB-1 were expressed and purified with N-terminal GST tags for pulldown assays. Even though the DEB-1 D1 domain is highly homologous to vinculin D1 (53% sequence identity and 77% sequence similarity) (supplemental Fig. S1), DEB-1 D1 was not easily expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli, and the small amount of soluble material collected from cell lysis eluted as a high molecular weight aggregate during gel filtration chromatography. To obtain soluble DEB-1 D1 protein, we introduced the point mutation C206S, which removes a non-conserved, solvent-exposed residue that should not affect overall structural integrity, nor the potential HMP-1-binding site based on a structure-based sequence alignment with the vinculin·αE-catenin complex (PDB code 4E18). DEB-1 C206S D1 was expressed successfully as a soluble protein and used for binding assays. GST pulldown assays indicated that the HMP-1 M domain binds to GST-vinculin D1, whereas no binding was detected to GST-DEB-1 D1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements showed that the HMP-1 M domain binds to vinculin D1 with 1:1 stoichiometry and a Kd of 0.60 μm (Table 2, supplemental Fig. S3), an affinity similar to that of the αE-catenin M domain for vinculin D1 (Kd = 2 μm) (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Like the interaction between αE-catenin and vinculin, the HMP-1-vinculin interaction was endothermic, which strongly suggests that binding to vinculin involves unfurling of the MI bundle as described for αE-catenin (20Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian α-catenin, however, removing the HMP-1 MIII bundle did not increase affinity for vinculin (Kd = 0.57 μm; Table 2). When both MII and MIII were removed, the vinculin binding affinity to MI increased by ∼200-fold (Kd = 3 nm), essentially the same as the affinity of αE-catenin MI-MII for vinculin (Table 2).Table 2ITC measurement of HMP-1 binding to HMP-2, vinculin D1, and DEB-1 D1ProteinsKDΔHTΔSΔGnmkcal mol−1HMP-1 + HMP-2HMP-1(FL)HMP-2(13-678)1−21.5−9.2−12.3HMP-1(FL)HMP-2(13-678)·pHMR-1(cyto80)3.9−22.9−11.3−11.6HMP-1 + vinculinHMP-1 MVinculin D160018.527.0−8.5HMP-1 MI-MIIVinculin D157213.121.6−8.5HMP-1 MIVinculin D13.17.619.2−11.6HMP-1 + DEB-1HMP-1 MDEB-1 D1NDaND, not determined.NDNDNDHMP-1 MI-MIIDEB-1 D1NDNDNDNDHMP-1 MIDEB-1 D1150−21.812.5−9.3a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We previously showed that, unlike mammalian αE-catenin, the HMP-1 MI region is partially protected from protease digestion in full-length HMP-1 (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). That observation, together with the vinculin binding data presented here, suggest that although the underlying mechanism of binding is the same in both HMP-1 and αE-catenin, MI-MII forms a more stable structure in HMP-1 than in mammalian αE-catenin. The HMP-1 M domain crystal structure reveals that Ser318 and Arg320, located on a loop connecting the second and third helices of the MI bundle, form polar interactions with His383 and Asp386, respectively, in MII (Fig. 4A). In αE-catenin, Ser318 is replaced with Cys324, which does not contact MII. Moreover, a more extensive polar interaction network is found between the second and third helices in HMP-1 MI relative to αE-catenin. In particular, Glu346 stabilizes polar interactions between two helices through hydrogen bonds with Tyr290, Arg292, and Arg296 (Fig. 4B). In addition, the loop containing Phe296 and Glu298 in αE-catenin appears to be flexible, as it adopts different conformations in crystallographically independent structures, which places these residues in different positions that may facilitate or disrupt the inter-helical interactions, making the MI bundle more dynamic. To test whether the HMP-1 MI bundle could bind to DEB-1, GST pulldown and ITC experiments were performed using the purified HMP-1 MI bundle (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). HMP-1 MI binds to DEB-1 D1 with Kd of 150 nm, which is 50 times weaker than its binding to vinculin (Table 2). Assuming the affinity for DEB-1 is similarly weakened by the presence of MII and/or MIII as seen in the binding to vinculin, the HMP-1 M domain would be predicted to interact with DEB-1 with Kd of ∼7.5 μm, which likely explains why no binding was observed by ITC or pulldown. The weaker binding between HMP-1 and DEB-1 can be attributed to differences in the binding interface as well as the less dynamic structure of the HMP-1 M domain relative to that of αE-catenin. The amino acids engaged in the formation of the αE-catenin·vinculin complex are well conserved in HMP-1 and DEB-1, respectively, except for two regions (supplemental Table S1). Met352 of αE-catenin, which contacts Met26 of vinculin, is replaced by the polar residue Glu346 in HMP-1. In DEB-1, His63 replaces Thr64 of vinculin, and thereby removes the polar interaction with Arg329 present in αE-catenin (Arg323 of HMP-1). We speculate that functional disassociation may have allowed the HMP-1 M domain to evolve a distinct mechanism of regulation and/or function. To further investigate differences between α-catenin and HMP-1, we attempted to crystallize full-length HMP-1. These attempts failed, perhaps due to the flexibility of the C-terminal ABD and the preceding linker. Therefore, we visualized the full-length structure of HMP-1 at low resolution by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (supplemental Fig. S4, Table 3). The values of the radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum particle size (Dmax) were 42 and 150 Å, respectively, in agreement with an earlier study (23Callaci S. Morrison K. Shao X. Schuh A.L. Wang Y. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hardin J. Audhya A. Phosphoregulation of the C. elegans cadherin-catenin complex.Biochem. J. 2015; 472: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Comparison of the SAXS-derived envelope of full-length HMP-1 to that of the HMP-1 “head” comprising the N and M domains indicated that the protruding stalk of the envelope likely corresponds to the C-terminal ABD (Fig. 5A). HMP-1 is a monomer in solution regardless of protein concentration or temperature (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J.

There are no crystal structures of monomeric full-length α-catenins available. Therefore, crystal structures of the N and ABD domains of αN-catenin, as well as our HMP-1 M domain structure were used to model the full-length HMP-1 into the SAXS envelope (PDB codes 4P9T and 4K1O) (21Ishiyama N.

However, another crystal structure of full-length dimeric αE-catenin indicates that the ABD is highly mobile in solution (21Ishiyama N. Tanaka N. Abe K. Yang Y.J. Abbas Y.M. Umitsu M. Nagar B.

SAXS analysis of full-length αN-catenin, which exists predominantly as a monomer in solution, revealed an elongated shape with Rg = 51 Å and Dmax = 175 Å (21Ishiyama N. Tanaka N. Abe K. Yang Y.J.

These overall dimensions are larger than those of HMP-1. Thus, the overall size of HMP-1 determined by SAXS is smaller than that of monomeric αN-catenin, and the C-terminal ABD appears to protrude in a relatively fixed orientation from the head, indicating a more compact structure with relatively limited flexibility of its ABD. Our SAXS model of HMP-1 shows its ABD exposed to solvent, suggesting it could also bind to F-actin. We have shown that the ABD is essential for HMP-1 function in vivo (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we reported previously that the purified isolated HMP-1 ABD bound actin but full-length HMP-1 did not (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We therefore re-tested the F-actin-binding activity of several different purified HMP-1 constructs, including the full-length protein, in standard actin pelleting assays. We found that the full-length HMP-1 protein does bind actin (Fig. 6A). Sequence alignment based on the αN-catenin ABD structure indicates that HMP-1 has a 64-residue unstructured region following the ABD helical bundle. Deletion of the C-terminal 23 amino acids of the ABD, which are not conserved in other α-catenin ABDs, does not affect the ability of this domain to bind F-actin (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We made an even shorter ABD construct in which the unstructured C-terminal tail was removed entirely (residues 672–863). This minimal ABD binds to F-actin comparably to the full ABD + C-terminal tail (residues 672–927), suggesting that the non-conserved tail region is not involved in F-actin binding. All constructs containing the minimal ABD, including full-length HMP-1 and HMP-1-ΔN (270–863; data not shown), bound to F-actin, whereas HMP-1 constructs devoid of the ABD did not (Fig. 6A), indicating that HMP-1 binds to F-actin through its ABD. We sought to find the cause of this experimental discrepancy between our previous report (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and these results. We found that in some of the experiments reported in the original paper, the “full-length” HMP-1 construct had acquired an insertion in the M-ABD linker, apparently due to recombination in the bacteria used for expression of the recombinant protein. The inserted sequence created a frameshift and deleted the ABD. We verified that the constructs used in the present work contained the native sequence, so we conclude that the full-length HMP-1 protein binds F-actin. HMP-1 forms a ternary complex with HMP-2 and the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of HMR-1 (pHMR-1(cyto)) (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The interaction between HMP-2 and non-phosphorylated HMR-1 is much weaker than that of β-catenin with E-cadherin, and only pHMR-1(cyto) forms a stable complex with HMP-2 in vitro and in vivo (13Choi H.J. Loveless T. Lynch A.M. Bang I. Hardin J. Weis W.I. A conserved phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between cadherin and β-catenin in vitro in vivo.Dev. Cell. 2015; 33: 82-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mammalian αE- and αN-catenins bind to a cadherin·β-catenin binary complex with Kd of ∼1 nm, whereas they bind an order of magnitude more weakly to β-catenin alone (Kd of 10–20 nm) (25Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Ahlsen G. Hansen S.D. Weis W.I. Structural and thermodynamic characterization of cadherin·β-catenin·α-catenin complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13589-13601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using ITC, we tested whether pHMR-1 binding similarly increases the affinity of HMP-2 toward HMP-1. An N-terminal 12-amino acid deletion mutant of HMP-2 (HMP-2(13–678)) was used instead of full-length HMP-2 to improve solubility (13Choi H.J. Loveless T. Lynch A.M. Bang I. Hardin J. Weis W.I. A conserved phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between cadherin and β-catenin in vitro in vivo.Dev. Cell. 2015; 33: 82-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Kd value of the interaction between HMP-1 and HMP-2 was measured as ∼1 nm, and the binary complex of pHMR-1(cyto) and HMP-2 bound to HMP-1 with a similar Kd (Table 2, supplemental Fig. S5). Thus, the HMP-2 affinity for HMP-1 is intrinsically higher than in the mammalian system, and HMR-1 binding does not enhance the affinity of HMP-2 for HMP-1. The E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is longer than that of HMR-1; crystal structures show that its C-terminal region forms two short helices that bind to the N-terminal armadillo repeats of β-catenin (26Huber A.H. Weis W.I.

Choi H.J. Ahlsen G. Hansen S.D. Weis W.I. Structural and thermodynamic characterization of cadherin·β-catenin·α-catenin complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13589-13601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, sequence and structural data show that HMR-1 lacks this C-terminal helical region, and thus cannot form contacts with HMP-1 in the ternary complex. We speculate that selective pressure to maintain a ∼1 nm affinity complex of cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin, combined with the truncated tail of HMR-1, requires a higher affinity of HMP-2 for HMP-1. We reported previously that HMP-1 forms a ternary complex with HMP-2 and phosphorylated HMR-1 (15Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J. In vitro in vivo reconstitution of the cadherin-catenin-actin complex from Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14591-14596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but that the ternary complex did not bind actin. Re-evaluation of this result showed that both the binary HMP-2·HMP-1 complex and the ternary complex of pHMR-1, HMP-2, and HMP-1 bound to F-actin with Kd values in the single micromolar range, similar to HMP-1 alone (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S6). This behavior is different from the effect of β-catenin on the actin-binding activity of vertebrate α-catenins. β-Catenin binding decreases the affinity >10 times in the zebrafish cadherin·catenin complex (3Miller P.W. Pokutta S. Ghosh A. Almo S.C. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Kwiatkowski A.V. Danio rerio αE-catenin is a monomeric F-actin binding protein with distinct properties from Mus musculus αE-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22324-22332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and about 2–3 times in the αT-catenin·β-catenin complex (6Wickline E.D. Dale I.W. Merkel C.D. Heier J.A. Stolz D.B. Kwiatkowski A.V. αT-Catenin is a constitutive actin-binding α-catenin that directly couples the cadherin·catenin complex to actin filaments.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 15687-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The underlying structural reason for this allosteric behavior is not fully understood. However, if β-catenin binding alters actin-binding properties by conformational changes transmitted through the M domain, the relative rigidity of the HMP-1 M domain may dampen this allosteric effect. We speculate that differences in the M domain structure alter the detailed force-dependent behavior of cadherin·catenin complex binding to F-actin. Knowledge of α-catenin function is essential for understanding the regulation of cell-cell adhesion as well as the evolution of multicellularity in metazoans. Our data indicate that the overall structure and function of HMP-1 and other α-catenins are similar, but more complex conformational regulation appears to have arisen in the vertebrate proteins. First, α-catenin and actin-binding proteins vinculin and α-actinin are co-expressed with α-catenin in mammalian epithelial cells, whereas their homologs in C. elegans are not (22Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. The basal component of the nematode dense-body is vinculin.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These additional partners may influence the properties of α-catenin through allosteric effects. Second, mechanical force is a key regulator of mammalian α-catenin, because the inhibitory effect of β-catenin on actin binding by αE-catenin is overcome by mechanical force, and force also relieves the autoinhibition of vinculin binding by the MI domain. The effects of force on the C. elegans cadherin·catenin complex remain to be established. More broadly, studies of α-catenins from cnidarians, nematodes, fish, and mammals have revealed significant functional differences despite their overall homology (16Miller P.W. Clarke D.N. Weis W.I. Lowe C.J. Nelson W.J. The evolutionary origin of epithelial cell-cell adhesion mechanisms.Curr. Top. Membr. 2013; 72: 267-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The challenge in the future will be to understand how different properties of α-catenins relate to molecular structure as well as the mechanical environment of their respective tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2595650665,"GPS telemetry markedly enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of animal location data, and recent advances in micro-GPS receivers permit their deployment on small mammals. One such technological advance, snapshot technology, allows for improved battery life by reducing the time to first fix via postponing recovery of satellite ephemeris (satellite location) data and processing of locations. However, no previous work has employed snapshot technology for small, terrestrial mammals. We evaluated performance of two types of micro-GPS (< 20 g) receivers (traditional and snapshot) on a small, semi-fossorial lagomorph, the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), to understand how GPS errors might influence fine-scale assessments of space use and habitat selection. During stationary tests, microtopography (i.e., burrows) and satellite geometry had the largest influence on GPS fix success rate (FSR) and location error (LE). There was no difference between FSR while animals wore the GPS collars above ground (determined via light sensors) and FSR generated during stationary, above-ground trials, suggesting that animal behavior other than burrowing did not markedly influence micro-GPS errors. In our study, traditional micro-GPS receivers demonstrated similar FSR and LE to snapshot receivers, however, snapshot receivers operated inconsistently due to battery and software failures. In contrast, the initial traditional receivers deployed on animals experienced some breakages, but a modified collar design consistently functioned as expected. If such problems were resolved, snapshot technology could reduce the tradeoff between fix interval and battery life that occurs with traditional micro-GPS receivers. Our results suggest that micro-GPS receivers are capable of addressing questions about space use and resource selection by small mammals, but that additional techniques might be needed to identify use of habitat structures (e.g., burrows, tree cavities, rock crevices) that could affect micro-GPS performance and bias study results."

https://openalex.org/W2598524671,"The Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is the first enzyme of the respiratory chain and the main ion transporter in many marine and pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae. The V. cholerae Na+-NQR has been extensively studied, but its binding sites for ubiquinone and inhibitors remain controversial. Here, using a photoreactive ubiquinone PUQ-3 as well as two aurachin-type inhibitors [125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2 and photoaffinity labeling experiments on the isolated enzyme, we demonstrate that the ubiquinone ring binds to the NqrA subunit in the regions Leu-32–Met-39 and Phe-131–Lys-138, encompassing the rear wall of a predicted ubiquinone-binding cavity. The quinolone ring and alkyl side chain of aurachin bound to the NqrB subunit in the regions Arg-43–Lys-54 and Trp-23–Gly-89, respectively. These results indicate that the binding sites for ubiquinone and aurachin-type inhibitors are in close proximity but do not overlap one another. Unexpectedly, although the inhibitory effects of PAD-1 and PAD-2 were almost completely abolished by certain mutations in NqrB (i.e. G140A and E144C), the binding reactivities of [125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2 to the mutated enzymes were unchanged compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. We also found that photoaffinity labeling by [125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2, rather than being competitively suppressed in the presence of other inhibitors, is enhanced under some experimental conditions. To explain these apparently paradoxical results, we propose models for the catalytic reaction of Na+-NQR and its interactions with inhibitors on the basis of the biochemical and biophysical results reported here and in previous work."
https://openalex.org/W2595469781,"Purpose/Relevance Fibrosis and hence capsule formation around the glaucoma implants are the main reasons for glaucoma implant failure. To address these issues, we designed a microfluidic meshwork and tested its biocompatibility in a rabbit eye model. The amount of fibrosis elicited by the microfluidic meshwork was compared to the amount elicited by the plate of conventional glaucoma drainage device. Methods Six eyes from 3 New Zealand albino rabbits were randomized to receive either the novel microfluidic meshwork or a plate of Ahmed glaucoma valve model PF7 (AGV PF7). The flexible microfluidic implant was made from negative photoresist SU-8 by using micro-fabrication techniques. The overall size of the meshwork was 7 mm × 7 mm with a grid period of 100 μm. Both implants were placed in the subtenon space at the supratemporal quadrant in a standard fashion. There was no communication between the implants and the anterior chamber via a tube. All animal eyes were examined for signs of infection and implant erosion on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 and then monthly. Exenterations were performed in which the entire orbital contents were removed at 3 months. Histology slides of the implant and the surrounding tissues were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Thickness of the fibrous capsules beneath the implants were measured and compared with paired student’s t-test between the two groups. Results The gross histological sections showed that nearly no capsule formed around the microfluidic meshwork in contrast to the thick capsule formed around the plate of AGV PF7. Thickness of the fibrotic capsules beneath the AGV PF7 plate from the 3 rabbit eyes was 90μm, 82μm, and 95 μm, respectively. The thickness at the bottom of fibrotic capsules around the new microfluidic implant were 1μm, 2μm, and 1μm, respectively. The difference in thickness of capsule between the two groups was significant (P = 0.002). No complications were noticed in the 6 eyes, and both implants were tolerated well by all rabbits. Conclusion The microfluidic meshwork elicited minimal fibrosis and capsule formation after 3-months implantation in a rabbit model. This provides promising evidence to aid in future development of a new glaucoma drainage implant that will elicit minimal scar formation and provide better long-term surgical outcomes."

From August to September 2012, the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) conducted a cross-sectional survey in 84 Malawian health facilities to capture current health facility service availability and readiness and health worker capacity and practice pertaining to labor, delivery, and immediate postpartum care. The survey collected data on availability of equipment, supplies, and medications, and health worker knowledge and performance scores on intrapartum care simulation and actual management of real clients at a subset of facilities. We ran linear regression models to identify predictors of high simulation performance of routine delivery care and management of asphyxiated newborns across all facilities surveyed. Key supplies for infection prevention and thermal care of the newborn were found to be missing in many of the surveyed facilities. At the health center level, 75% had no clinician trained in basic emergency obstetric care or newborn care and 39% had no midwife trained in the same. We observed that there were no proportional increases in available transport and staff at a facility as catchment population increased. In simulations of management of newborns with breathing problems, health workers were able to complete a median of 10 out of 16 tasks for a full-term birth case scenario and 20 out of 30 tasks for a preterm birth case scenario. Health workers who had more years of experience appeared to perform worse. Our study provides a benchmark and highlights gaps for future evaluations and studies as Malawi continues to make strides in improving facility-based care. Further progress in reducing the burden of neonatal and fetal death in Malawi will be partly predicated on guaranteeing properly equipped and staffed facilities in addition to ensuring the presence of skilled health workers."
https://openalex.org/W2602085494,"Autotaxin (ATX) or ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2) is a secretory glycoprotein and functions as the key enzyme for lysophosphatidic acid generation. The mechanism of ATX protein trafficking is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that p23, a member of the p24 protein family, was the protein-sorting receptor required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export of ATX. A di-phenylalanine (Phe-838/Phe-839) motif in the human ATX C-terminal region was identified as a transport signal essential for the ATX-p23 interaction. Knockdown of individual Sec24 isoforms by siRNA revealed that ER export of ATX was impaired only if Sec24C was down-regulated. These results suggest that ATX is selectively exported from the ER through a p23, Sec24C-dependent pathway. In addition, it was found that AKT signaling played a role in ATX secretion regulation to facilitate ATX ER export by enhancing the nuclear factor of activated T cell-mediated p23 expression. Furthermore, the di-hydrophobic amino acid motifs (FY) also existed in the C-terminal regions of human ENPP1 and ENPP3. Such a p23, Sec24C-dependent selective ER export mechanism is conserved among these ENPP family members."

Changes in infarct size and serum cTnT (cardiac troponin T) caused by I/R were reduced by exercise training. Moreover, cardiac dysfunction caused by I/R was also alleviated by exercise training. These effects of exercise training were reversed by nor-BNI (a selective κ-OR antagonist), Compound C (a selective AMPK inhibitor), Akt inhibitor and L-NAME (a non-selective eNOS inhibitor). Expression of κ-OR and phosphorylation of AMPK, Akt and eNOS were significantly increased in the ME, HE and AE groups. These findings demonstrated that the cardioprotective effect of exercise training is possibly mediated by the κ-OR-AMPK-Akt-eNOS signaling pathway."

However, no high-resolution visualisation of the myometrium at the organ level has previously been attained.We have developed a technique to reconstruct the whole myometrium from serial histological slides, at a resolution of approximately 50 μm per voxel edge. Reconstructions of samples taken from human and rat uteri are presented here, along with histological verification of the reconstructions and detailed investigation of the fibrous structure of these uteri, using a range of tools specifically developed for this analysis. These reconstruction techniques enable the high-resolution rendering of global structure previously observed at lower resolution. Moreover, structures observed previously in small portions of the myometrium can be observed in the context of the whole organ. The reconstructions are in direct correspondence with the original histological slides, which allows the inspection of the anatomical context of any features identified in the three-dimensional reconstructions.The methods presented here have been used to generate a faithful representation of myometrial smooth muscle at a resolution of ∼50 μm per voxel edge. Characterisation of the smooth muscle structure of the myometrium by means of this technique revealed a detailed view of previously identified global structures in addition to a global view of the microarchitecture. A suite of visualisation tools allows researchers to interrogate the histological microarchitecture. These methods will be applicable to other smooth muscle tissues to analyse fibrous microarchitecture."

Several barriers have been identified in the use of MgSO4, especially in low and middle-income settings.To describe the obstetrician's perception on possible reasons for underutilizing magnesium sulfate to treat preeclampsia/eclampsia.A qualitative clinical study, based on phenomenological reference by semi-structured interviews and open-ended discussions with obstetricians of the public healthcare system in primary care units (PCU) and referral maternity hospitals (RMH), in a southeastern Brazilian city.Fear of drug toxicity was the major cause for not prescribing the medication in PCU. Fear was justified by insufficient technical, structural and organizational resources of healthcare facilities and by a shortage of physicians properly trained for adequate drug use.Fear of toxicity of magnesium sulfate was the main barrier towards timely and proper drug use. Periodic skill development and training of obstetricians, along with integration of the medical team in the work environment may contribute to decrease fear, ensuring safety of drug prescription and thus possibly reducing adverse outcomes related to PE."
https://openalex.org/W2596613949,"Aims It is perceived that patients with a history of frequent alcohol consumption require more opioids for postoperative pain control and experience less postoperative nausea and vomiting than patients without such a history. However, there is scarce evidence supporting this notion. The aim of this study was to assess association between frequent alcohol consumption and opioid requirement for postoperative pain control and occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Methods The medical records for 4143 patients using intravenous patient-control analgesia with opioids after abdominal surgery between January 2010 and September 2013 were obtained, and associations were sought between the cumulative opioid consumption (in intravenous morphine equivalence) per body weight (mg/kg) in the first 2 days after abdominal operation and several demographic and clinical variables by multiple regression analysis. The association between the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and several demographic and clinical variables was also sought by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Frequent alcohol drinking, among other previously reported factors, was associated with increased opioid consumption for postoperative pain control (p < 0.001). The estimate effect of frequent alcohol drinking was 0.117 mg/kg. Frequent alcohol drinking was also associated with decreased risks of postoperative nausea (odds ratio = 0.59, p = 0.003) and vomiting (odds ratio = 0.49, p = 0.026). Conclusions Frequent alcohol drinking was associated with increased opioid consumption for postoperative pain control and decreased risks of postoperative nausea and vomiting after abdominal surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2595407850,"Processes shaping the African Guineo-Congolian rain forest, especially in the West African part, are not well understood. Recent molecular studies, based mainly on forest tree species, confirmed the previously proposed division of the western African Guineo-Congolian rain forest into Upper Guinea (UG) and Lower Guinea (LG) separated by the Dahomey Gap (DG). Here we studied nine populations in the area of the DG and the borders of LG and UG of the widespread liana species, Chasmanthera dependens (Menispermaceae) by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), a chloroplast DNA sequence marker, and modelled the distribution based on current as well as paleoclimatic data (Holocene Climate Optimum, ca. 6 kyr BP and Last Glacial Maximum, ca. 22 kyr BP). Current population genetic structure and geographical pattern of cpDNA was related to present as well as historical modelled distributions. Results from this study show that past historical factors played an important role in shaping the distribution of C. dependens across West Africa. The Cameroon Volcanic Line seems to represent a barrier for gene flow in the present as well as in the past. Distribution modelling proposed refugia in the Dahomey Gap, supported also by higher genetic diversity. This is in contrast with the phylogeographic patterns observed in several rainforest tree species and could be explained by either diverging or more relaxed ecological requirements of this liana species."

https://openalex.org/W2597132664,"Among the greatest challenges facing the conservation of plants and animal species in protected areas are threats from a rapidly changing climate. An altered climate creates both challenges and opportunities for improving the management of protected areas in networks. Increasingly, quantitative tools like species distribution modeling are used to assess the performance of protected areas and predict potential responses to changing climates for groups of species, within a predictive framework. At larger geographic domains and scales, protected area network units have spatial geoclimatic properties that can be described in the gap analysis typically used to measure or aggregate the geographic distributions of species (stacked species distribution models, or S-SDM). We extend the use of species distribution modeling techniques in order to model the climate envelope (or ""footprint"") of individual protected areas within a network of protected areas distributed across the 48 conterminous United States and managed by the US National Park System. In our approach we treat each protected area as the geographic range of a hypothetical endemic species, then use MaxEnt and 5 uncorrelated BioClim variables to model the geographic distribution of the climatic envelope associated with each protected area unit (modeling the geographic area of park units as the range of a species). We describe the individual and aggregated climate envelopes predicted by a large network of 163 protected areas and briefly illustrate how macroecological measures of geodiversity can be derived from our analysis of the landscape ecological context of protected areas. To estimate trajectories of change in the temporal distribution of climatic features within a protected area network, we projected the climate envelopes of protected areas in current conditions onto a dataset of predicted future climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the climate envelopes of some parks may be locally unique or have narrow geographic distributions, and are thus prone to future shifts away from the climatic conditions in these parks in current climates. In other cases, some parks are broadly similar to large geographic regions surrounding the park or have climatic envelopes that may persist into near-term climate change. Larger parks predict larger climatic envelopes, in current conditions, but on average the predicted area of climate envelopes are smaller in our single future conditions scenario. Individual units in a protected area network may vary in the potential for climate adaptation, and adaptive management strategies for the network should account for the landscape contexts of the geodiversity or climate diversity within individual units. Conservation strategies, including maintaining connectivity, assessing the feasibility of assisted migration and other landscape restoration or enhancements can be optimized using analysis methods to assess the spatial properties of protected area networks in biogeographic and macroecological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2596723820,"To determine inter-observer variability in target volume definition of cervical cancer in radical and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) settings.Eight physicians contoured CTVs of 2 patients underwent definitive and postoperative RT. Each volume was analyzed using the individual/median volume ratio and generalized conformity index (CIgen). And center of mass (COM) of each contour was calculated. Expert agreement was quantified using an expectation maximization algorithm for Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE).For definitive RT, the individual/median volume ratio ranged from 0.51 to 1.41, and CIgen was 0.531. Mean 3-dimensional distances of average to each COM were 7.8 mm. For postoperative RT setting, corresponding values were 0.65-1.38, 0.563, and 5.3 mm. Kappa value of expert agreement was 0.65 and 0.67, respectively. STAPLE estimates of the sensitivity, specificity, and kappa measures of inter-physician agreement were 0.73, 0.98, and 0.65 for the definitive and 0.75, 0.98, and 0.67 for the adjuvant radiotherapy setting. The largest difference was observed in the superior-inferior direction, particularly in the upper vagina and the common iliac area.As there was still some variability in target delineation, more detailed guidelines for target volume delineation and continuing education would help to reduce this uncertainty."
