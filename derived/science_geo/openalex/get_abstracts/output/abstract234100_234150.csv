This is not characteristic of any of the influenza viruses. The hæmolysis was of slight degree and apparently irregular in its occurrence. Following the appearance of the paper by Morgan, Enders and Wagley1 on mumps virus hæmolysis, it was noted that when dilutions of Newcastle disease virus were made in phosphate solution instead of physiological saline, both fowl and human red cells were more extensively lysed. A comprehensive study of the phenomenon was afterwards begun."

https://openalex.org/W2005540244,"THE discovery of Plasmodium berghei by Vincke and Lips1 has provided a valuable new strain of malaria for the laboratory trials of chemotherapeutic drugs. We are grateful to Prof. H. E. Shortt for presenting us with a strain of this organism, which we have used for the investigation of the series of 2 : 4-diaminopyrimidines described by Faleo el al.2. One of the compounds, 2:4 diamino-5-p-chloro-phenoxy-6-methyl pyrimidine (48–210), was assayed simultaneously against P. gallinaceum in chicks and P. berghei in mice at the same dose-levels. The chick test was performed by the method of Curd, Davey and Rose3, and the mouse test by a similar procedure. The mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of infected blood in heparinized saline. Each mouse received about five million parasitized erythrocytes. Six doses of drug were given by stomach tube, night and morning, for the following three days. Blood smears were prepared on the fifth and seventh days of the disease, and the percentage of parasitized cells determined for each mouse."

Kelner2 reported earlier this year that visible light enhances the recovery of conidia of Streptomyces griseus which have been treated with ultra-violet radiation. Some years ago, Whitaker3 found what may have been the same kind of effect in the eggs of the alga, Fucus furcatus."

Thus, enzymatic degradation of poly-desoxyribose nucleic acid by Kunitz's1 crystalline desoxyribonuclease (supplied by the Worthington Biochemical Laboratory, Freehold, New Jersey) may be followed by determinations of dielectric constant."

https://openalex.org/W2083795278,"MANY studies have been made concerning the antigenic structure of viruses of the psittacosislymphogranuloma group as revealed by the complement-fixation technique ; these include experiments recently reported on the effect of various reagents on psittacosis virus1. It was shown that 0·001 molar potassium periodate destroyed the serologically active heat-stable group antigen of heated virus suspensions, while leaving some reactivity, due to the labile specific component, in similar but unheated preparations. The possibility that skin tests might be used for demonstrating the specific behaviour of virus treated with the same reagent was considered, since it is recognized that the preparations which have been or are used for this method of diagnosing lymphogranuloma venereum2 3,4 produce skin reactions which are largely or entirely due to the group antigen5,6. Heated yolk-sac suspensions of both psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum viruses have, in this laboratory, given closely parallel results in patients with lymphogranuloma venereum7."
https://openalex.org/W1986358892,"IN connexion with a problem of biosynthesis, we had occasion to prepare a sample of ethanol in which some of the α-hydrogen atoms were replaced by deuterium. This was done by heating propionic acid with deuterium sulphate, recovering the labelled propionic acid and treating its silver salt with bromine in carbon tetrachloride; the resulting ethyl bromide was hydrolysed by heating with water or with aqueous silver sulphate. Absence of deuterium from the methyl group of this alcohol was proved by oxidation to acetic acid with aqueous potassium permanganate. The silver salt of this acetic acid contained very little deuterium (0·03—0·06 per cent excess), and this was not due to exchange with the aqueous medium during oxidation, for a parallel experiment on ordinary ethanol in a heavy water medium also afforded deuterium-free silver acetate. Analysis of the labelled ethanol as ethyl 3 : 5-dinitrobenzoate indicated a deuterium excess of 40 'atom per cent' on the two α-hydrogen atoms. The sample was thus a mixture of CH3CH2OH, CH3CHDOH and CH3CD2OH."
https://openalex.org/W1966679618,"BY cultivating Rhodotorula gracilis on media of varying composition, it is very easy to obtain yeast with different amounts of fat and protein1. A yeast rich in protein and poor in fat is obtained in a nitrogen-rich medium. In a nitrogen-poor medium, the yeast will be poor in protein and rich in fat. The protein content of the yeast may vary between 13 and 50 per cent of the dried matter. It seemed probable that such a large variation of the amount of yeast protein could change qualitatively the composition of the protein. We have investigated the amino-acid composition of yeast with low and high amounts of protein."

This phenomenon is of interest in many ways, one of the most important being in connexion with the production of thunderstorms."

https://openalex.org/W1983854970,"TSETSE control should never be divorced from research, though it may fall into the two categories—long-range and applied. Long-range control is devoted to the extermination of tsetse, whether concerned with the transmission of trypanosomiasis or not. Like pure research, it has great potential value but the problems of human and animal trypanosomiasis often assume dangerous proportions, demanding the immediate application of remedial measures. In this applied work the scientific side tends to be elbowed aside ; yet the need is no less and the range considerably wider than in long-range control. For urgency demands that attention be focused on the tsetse, only inasmuch as it is a menace to man and his animals. Each problem must be assessed at its true value in relation to the welfare and activities of the local people and to the economy of the country as a whole. Consideration has to be given to factors governing the transmission and spread of infection. Measures must be appraised and selected to give the greatest degree of relief in the shortest time, and, a point often overlooked, to fit in with the life of the people with the least disturbance and without leaving a burden of costly maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2018960821,"IN calculations relating to the aerial bactericidal action of certain α-hydroxy acids, it was noted that the calculated rates of diffusion of these acids into air-suspended salivary particles, when plotted against the water content of the particles, did not appear to extrapolate to the expected diffusion-rate in pure water at 100 per cent water content1. It was suggested that this might be due to the formation of a shell of dried material on the outside of the particles so that the water content of the particle as a whole, some minutes after its formation, exceeded that of the outer layers, the estimated diffusion-rates being largely determined by the water content of these layers. Measurements of the equilibrium water content of saliva dried at various relative humidities confirm that, at relative humidities greater than 50 per cent, the water content of the salivary particles some minutes after their formation exceeds the equilibrium value."

https://openalex.org/W1997918245,"THE fact that the cytoplasm content of the liver cell is determined by the quality and quantity of the dietary protein has recently been utilized for the assay of the nutritive value of a protein1. A measure of the cytoplasm content of the liver cell was obtained by estimating either non-glycogen non-lipid liver solids or liver protein per 100 gm. body-weight in female rats. It was then suggested that the variability of the method might be reduced by referring the amount of liver protein not to 100 gm. body-weight but to liver deoxyribonucleic acid, the only constituent of the liver which appears to be independent of variations in dietary protein2. The possibility of using male instead of female rats was also considered."

https://openalex.org/W2009350111,"SAFRANAL (I) and its glycosidic precursor picrocrocin (the bitter principle of saffron)1 have been shown by Kuhn, Moewus and Wendt2 to play a remarkable part in controlling the sexual characteristics of the hermaphroditic green alga Chlamydomonas eugametos f. synoica. It was demonstrated that the glycoside acted as a gynotermone for the organism (that is, caused the cells to become female), the minimum quantity required being 106 molecules per cell. On the other hand, safranal (I) acted as a male termone (androtermone), the effect being observable at a far greater dilution, only 10 molecules per cell being required. The closely allied compound, 4-hydroxy-β-cyclocitral, was also observed to act as an androtermone3."

Lord Samuel points to various factors which may lead the State to be concerned more actively with the question of leisure, and this moves him to indicate two dangers that attend State activity in the cultural field. The first of these is the obvious danger of direction when the State provides help. Generally, it may be said that the danger to freedom and voluntary effort in Great Britain is fully realized, and that many voluntary organisations are being subsidized without being made subordinate. The second danger, that the advent of democracy and the substitution of public for private patronage may lead to a lowering of standards, is also real, and much that has happened in public life in recent months suggests that it is increasing."
