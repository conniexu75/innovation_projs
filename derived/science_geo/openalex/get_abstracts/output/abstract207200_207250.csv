https://openalex.org/W1987641837,"Populations of single neurons in visual cortex, middle suprasylvian association cortex, and brain stem of cat show greater variance of spontaneous discharge rates during waking than during sleep; this change in variance occurs in the absence of significant changes in mean discharge rates. Neurons which discharge rapidly during sleep tend to discharge even more rapidly during waking, whereas neurons with relatively low rates of discharge during sleep tend to have reduced spontaneous activity during waking."

A constitutive nonoxidative decarboxylase from Aerobackr species is described whose substrates are cinnamic acids bearing a 4-hydroxy group. p-Coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids (4-hydroxy, 3,4-dihydroxy, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acids, respectively) are attacked in decreasing order of rate by Aerobacter uerogenes NRRL B-2614. ages, suggests that the ring substituents were not altered by the reaction. The presence of a hydroxyl resonance, even though the bands from the reaction product were too weak to determine the number of hydroxy substituents, makes it most likely that the 3,Cdihydroxy structure of the parent acid was retained and that the compound was 3,4-dihydroxystyrene. 2. The products from p-coumaric and caffeic acids were estab- lished as hydroxystyrenes (4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylcatechol) . The products were identified by their characteristic properties and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and, in the case of the product from p-coumaric acid, by synthesis. Absorption spectra and the RF values of the hydroxystyrenes in four solvent systems are given. The decarboxylation product from ferulic acid, presumably 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, was not specifically characterized. .&Hydroxystyrene and Product from p-Coumaric Acid-Values from the spectrum of the product in acetone are shown in Table III together with those of 4-methoxystyrene. Again the spec- trum of a substituted styrene is immediately apparent. In this case the aromatic methoxyl region could be scanned without solvent interference, and no peaks were observed. The aromatic band is entirely typical of an asymmetric p-disubstituted ben- zene. Unknown product and synthetic 4-hydroxystyrene gave identical spectra. REFERENCES 3. A cell-free extract of the enzyme showed similarity of sub- strate specificity and pH optimum to the cell-bound enzyme. 4. Aspects of the microbial and higher plant occurrence of the enzyme are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2093081567,"WHEN microsporidian parasites of the genus Nosema infect insects, abnormal growth and metamorphosis are commonly observed. Heavily infected pupæ of saturniid Lepidoptera moult to adults which retain many pupal characters1. When flour beetles of the genus Tribolium are similarly infected, they appear larger than normal and die at or before pupation2. We have found that the larger size of such infected beetle larvæ is a result of more rapid growth and of supernumerary moults. All these effects resemble those which can be produced by injection of insect juvenile hormone or by implantation of corpora allata, the endocrine gland which produces this hormone3–6. Three hypotheses could explain this similarity of parasitic infection and endocrine activity: (1) The parasite might cause hypertrophy of, or hypersecretion by, the corpora allata of the host. (2) The parasite might cause other tissues of the host to produce juvenile hormone. (3) The parasites, themselves, might produce materials with juvenile hormone activity. We have carried out experiments by which we can decide among these alternatives."

https://openalex.org/W2051815590,"THIS communication reports the results of analytical ultracentrifuge analyses on sera of 50 acutely mentally disturbed patients. Sera were taken within 24 hr. of admission to hospital and prior to institution of definitive therapy. Phenothiazine, monoamine oxidase inhibitor or electroshock therapy had not been given to any patient during the three months prior to serum collection. The diagnoses were varied; but all patients had an acute mental disturbance of sufficient severity to warrant hospital admission. Consecutively admitted patients were used excluding only those with known organic brain disease, alcoholism and those known to have had drug or electro-shock treatment during the previous three months. Sera of 48 blood bank donors were used as controls. Sera were stored at −15° C. until analysis, which was usually within 8 weeks of collection. (Analytical ultracentrifuge examinations were made by the Institute of Medical Physics, Belmont, California.)"

As in the majority of cases no significant difference was found between the proteolytic activity of plasma and serum, a blood clot cannot contain more plasminogen than that present in the volume of serum included."
https://openalex.org/W2057894119,"After treatment of the isolated retina of a fish (Centropomus) with ammonia (NH3), the electrical responses to light are confined to the receptor layer. These receptor responses are fast in light adaptation and very slow in dark adaptation. The light-adapted responses have thresholds 3 to 4 logarithmic units of light intensity higher than the dark- adapted ones. Both kinds of responses are linearly related to light intensity up to the appearance of saturation. Interactions between receptors and adjacent glia cells appear to be involved in adaptation."

Preliminary results of our investigation point to a definite influence in this respect."

https://openalex.org/W2349230954,"IN work described elsewhere1 we showed how to understand the steady-state transport of oxygen through haemoglobin solution by the application of Fick's law of mass transport. The oxygen flux was shown to depend not only on the pressure difference across the diffusion cell but also on the absolute partial pressures of oxygen at the cell boundaries. This behaviour is a direct consequence of the nonlinear relation between oxyhaemoglobin concentration and oxygen partial pressure. We pointed out, for example, that if the haemoglobin is saturated with oxygen at both ends of the diffusion path it cannot contribute to the transport of oxygen and all the oxygen transport must therefore take place through the plasma."
