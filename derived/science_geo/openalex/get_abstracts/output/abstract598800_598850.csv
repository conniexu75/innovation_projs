https://openalex.org/W2768081527,"All countries, irrespective of their developmental stage, face an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases including diabetes mellitus. There is substantial evidence of the existence of the gap in the level of diabetes mellitus and its complications prevention and control measures in developing countries. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in urban and rural dwellers in a low-income country from both younger and older population and to identify factors related.This is a community based comparative cross-sectional study conducted in a low-income country, Ethiopia. The sample size was determined by EPI-Info for two populations; the WHO's STEP-wise approach for non-communicable diseases surveillance in developing countries was employed for sampling, study variable selection and data collection procedures. Fasting blood glucose levels were measured by finger pricking after overnight fasting. Data entry was done by EPI-data computer program version 3.1 and then processed by SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression tests were used to assess the associations between diabetes status of individuals and its potential predictor variables. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant level.The study was conducted on 1405 individuals with age range of 18-97 years old. The mean fasting blood glucose level for study participants was 91.16mg/dl; while it was 94.73mg/dl for urban and 87.71mg/dl for rural dwellers. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 3.3%; while it was 2.0% for rural and (4.6%) for urban dwellers. Both the mean blood glucose level and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus were significantly higher for urban residents than rural. More than three-fourths of diabetic cases were newly diagnosed by this study. Urban dwellers, centrally obese, overweight, and hypertensive individuals have higher odds of getting diabetes mellitus.High prevalence of diabetes mellitus involving both old and young population was documented. Most diabetic cases were suddenly diagnosed during this survey. The problem is noticeably alarming, attention should be given to the control and prevention of diabetes mellitus and related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2767892922,"Turnover of the 26S proteasome by autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that governs cellular proteolytic capacity and eliminates inactive particles. In most organisms, proteasomes are located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the specific autophagy routes for nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasomes are unclear. Here, we investigate the spatial control of autophagic proteasome turnover in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We found that nitrogen starvation–induced proteasome autophagy is independent of known nucleophagy pathways but is compromised when nuclear protein export is blocked. Furthermore, via pharmacological tethering of proteasomes to chromatin or the plasma membrane, we provide evidence that nuclear proteasomes at least partially disassemble before autophagic turnover, whereas cytoplasmic proteasomes remain largely intact. A targeted screen of autophagy genes identified a requirement for the conserved sorting nexin Snx4 in the autophagic turnover of proteasomes and several other large multisubunit complexes. We demonstrate that Snx4 cooperates with sorting nexins Snx41 and Snx42 to mediate proteasome turnover and is required for the formation of cytoplasmic proteasome puncta that accumulate when autophagosome formation is blocked. Together, our results support distinct mechanistic paths in the turnover of nuclear versus cytoplasmic proteasomes and point to a critical role for Snx4 in cytoplasmic agglomeration of proteasomes en route to autophagic destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2767814516,"Negative effects of postovulatory aging on fertilization ability and subsequent embryo development have been reported in rodents; however, the molecular and cellular changes during this process have not been fully defined. Here, we used porcine oocytes, a model that is physiologically and developmentally similar to humans, to explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie how postovulatory aging affects oocyte quality and fertilization capacity. We found that postovulatory aging caused the morphologic change of porcine oocytes by exhibiting the incompact expansion of cumulus cells and an increased occurrence of fragmentation. Aging also impaired oocyte quality by disrupting organelle structures, including the spindle assembly, actin polymerization, and mitochondrial integrity. Moreover, postovulatory aging led to the abnormal distribution of cortical granules and ovastacin, which, in turn, resulted in defective sperm binding and consequently compromised fertilization potential. Of note, we observed that postovulatory aging induced oxidative stress with a high level of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic rate in oocytes, thereby resulting in the deterioration of critical factors in the maintenance of oocyte quality and fertilization capacity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that postovulatory aging perturbs a variety of molecular and cellular changes in porcine oocytes by inducing oxidative stress.-Miao, Y., Zhou, C., Cui, Z., Zhang, M., ShiYang, X., Lu, Y., Xiong, B.

https://openalex.org/W2767592665,"The biomechanics-based Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk assessment has gained considerable scientific and clinical momentum. However, such studies have mainly focused on information at a single time point, and little is known about how AAA properties change over time. Consequently, the present study explored how geometry, wall stress-related and blood flow-related biomechanical properties change during AAA expansion. Four patients with a total of 23 Computed Tomography-Angiography (CT-A) scans at different time points were analyzed. At each time point, patient-specific properties were extracted from (i) the reconstructed geometry, (ii) the computed wall stress at Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), and (iii) the computed blood flow velocity at standardized inflow and outflow conditions. Testing correlations between these parameters identified several nonintuitive dependencies. Most interestingly, the Peak Wall Rupture Index (PWRI) and the maximum Wall Shear Stress (WSS) independently predicted AAA volume growth. Similarly, Intra-luminal Thrombus (ILT) volume growth depended on both the maximum WSS and the ILT volume itself. In addition, ILT volume, ILT volume growth, and maximum ILT layer thickness correlated with PWRI as well as AAA volume growth. Consequently, a large ILT volume as well as fast increase of ILT volume over time may be a risk factor for AAA rupture. However, tailored clinical studies would be required to test this hypothesis and to clarify whether monitoring ILT development has any clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2767404629,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common event in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), especially in extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants. This cohort study investigated the incidence of and risk factors for AKI in ELBW infants and their overall survival at the postmenstrual age (PMA) of 36 weeks. Methods All ELBW infants admitted to our NICU between January 2010 and December 2013 were enrolled. Those who died prior to 72 hours of life, had congenital renal abnormality, or had only one datum of the serum creatinine (SCr) level after the first 24 hours of life were excluded. The criteria used for the diagnosis of AKI was set according to the modified neonatal KDIGO AKI definition. Results AKI occurred in 56% of 276 infants. Specifically, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI occurred in 30%, 17%, and 9% of ELBW infants, respectively. High-frequency ventilation support (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78–6.67, p< 0.001), the presence of patent ductus arteriosus (adjusted OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.25–8.07, p < 0.001), lower gestational age (adjusted OR for gestational age: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.58–0.83, < 0.001), and inotropic agent use (adjusted OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.31–5.21, p = 0.006) were independently associated with AKI. Maternal pre-eclampsia was a protective factor (adjusted OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.14–0.97, p = 0.044). Infants with AKI had higher mortality before the PMA of 36 weeks with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.34 (95% CI: 1.21–23.53, p = 0.027). Additionally, infants with stage 3 AKI had a highest HR of 10.60, 95% CI: 2.09–53.67, p = 0.004). Conclusion AKI was a very common event (56%) in ELBW infants and was associated with a lower GA, high-frequency ventilation support, the presence of PDA, and inotropic agent use. AKI reduced survival of ELBW infants before the PMA of 36 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2767767832,"IsdB is a receptor on the surface of the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus that extracts heme from hemoglobin (Hb) to enable growth on Hb as a sole iron source. IsdB is critically important both for in vitro growth on Hb and in infection models and is also highly up-regulated in blood, serum, and tissue infection models, indicating a key role of this receptor in bacterial virulence. However, structural information for IsdB is limited. We present here a crystal structure of a complex between human Hb and IsdB. In this complex, the α subunits of Hb are refolded with the heme displaced to the interface with IsdB. We also observe that atypical residues of Hb, His58 and His89 of αHb, coordinate to the heme iron, which is poised for transfer into the heme-binding pocket of IsdB. Moreover, the porphyrin ring interacts with IsdB residues Tyr440 and Tyr444 Previously, Tyr440 was observed to coordinate heme iron in an IsdB·heme complex structure. A Y440F/Y444F IsdB variant we produced was defective in heme transfer yet formed a stable complex with Hb (Kd = 6 ± 2 μm) in solution with spectroscopic features of the bis-His species observed in the crystal structure. Haptoglobin binds to a distinct site on Hb to inhibit heme transfer to IsdB and growth of S. aureus, and a ternary complex of IsdB·Hb·Hp was observed. We propose a model for IsdB heme transfer from Hb that involves unfolding of Hb and heme iron ligand exchange."

Objective To apply a cascade analysis to implementation of household contact investigation in a programmatic setting. Design Prospective, multi-center observational study. Methods We constructed a cascade for household contact investigation to describe the proportions of: 1) index patient households recruited; 2) index patient households visited; 3) contacts screened for TB; and 4) contacts completing evaluation for, and diagnosed with, active TB. Results 338 (33%) of 1022 consecutive index TB patients were eligible for contact investigation. Lay health workers scheduled home visits for 207 (61%) index patients and completed 104 (50%). Among 287 eligible contacts, they screened 256 (89%) for symptoms or risk factors for TB. 131 (51%) had an indication for further TB evaluation. These included 59 (45%) with symptoms alone, 58 (44%) children <5, and 14 (11%) with HIV. Among 131 contacts found to be symptomatic or at risk, 26 (20%) contacts completed evaluation, including five (19%) diagnosed with and treated for active TB, for an overall yield of 1.7%. The cumulative conditional probability of completing the entire cascade was 5%. Conclusion Major opportunities exist for improving the effectiveness and yield of TB contact investigation by increasing the proportion of index households completing screening visits by lay health workers and the proportion of at-risk contacts completing TB evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2767791674,"Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses are hallmarks of the pathophysiology of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. In these stresses, different kinases phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α, enabling the translation of stress response genes; among these is GADD34, the protein product of which recruits the α-isoform of protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1α) and eIF2α to assemble a phosphatase complex catalyzing eIF2α dephosphorylation and resumption of protein synthesis. Aberrations in this pathway underlie the aforementioned disorders. Previous observations indicating that GADD34 is induced by arsenite, a thiol-directed oxidative stressor, in the absence of eIF2α phosphorylation suggest other roles for GADD34. Here, we report that arsenite-induced oxidative stress differs from thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-induced ER stress in promoting GADD34 transcription and the preferential translation of its mRNA in the absence of eIF2α phosphorylation. Arsenite also stabilized GADD34 protein, slowing its degradation. In response to oxidative stress, but not ER stress, GADD34 recruited TDP-43, and enhanced cytoplasmic distribution and cysteine modifications of TDP-43 promoted its binding to GADD34. Arsenite also recruited a TDP-43 kinase, casein kinase-1ɛ (CK1ɛ), to GADD34. Concomitant with TDP-43 aggregation and proteolysis after prolonged arsenite exposure, GADD34-bound CK1ɛ catalyzed TDP-43 phosphorylations at serines 409/410, which were diminished or absent in GADD34−/− cells. Our findings highlight that the phosphatase regulator, GADD34, also functions as a kinase scaffold in response to chronic oxidative stress and recruits CK1ɛ and oxidized TDP-43 to facilitate its phosphorylation, as seen in TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Protein homeostasis, also referred to as proteostasis, coordinates the processes of protein synthesis, folding, and degradation that together impose a high demand on the cell’s energy reserves. Thus, an unfavorable environment, such as nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress, heat shock, and radiation, negatively impacts proteostasis, and the accompanying proteotoxic stress contributes to many human diseases (1Wang M. Kaufman R.J. Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a conduit to human disease.Nature. 2016; 529 (26791723): 326-33510.1038/nature17041Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). A common cellular response to stress is the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translational initiation factor, eIF2α, on serine 51, by one or more eIF2α kinases. This phosphorylation of eIF2α attenuates the assembly of the translational initiation complex, consisting of the ribosomal subunits and initiation factors, at AUG start sites in mRNAs and represses general protein synthesis. At the same time, P-eIF2α enhances translation of a select group of mRNAs, characterized by the presence of upstream ORFs (2Lee Y.Y. Cevallos R.C. Jan E.

Among the genes transcribed and translated in response to P-eIF2α is GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible transcript 34, also known as PPP1R15a), whose protein product recruits the α-isoform of protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1α) and eIF2α to assemble an active eIF2α phosphatase (7Choy M.S.

The loss of mouse genes encoding GADD34 and its structural homologue, CReP (constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation or PPP1R15b), eliminates all eIF2α phosphatase activity and yields no embryos (9Harding H.P.

However, crossing the PPP1R15a/b heterozygous mice with animals carrying a mutation (S51A) that mimics eIF2α dephosphorylation yields live pups, although they fail to thrive after birth (9Harding H.P.

These data argued that GADD34 (and CReP) functions primarily if not exclusively as a component of eIF2α phosphatase during mouse development. Earlier observations that GADD34 was induced by arsenite, a thiol-directed oxidative stress, in the absence of eIF2α phosphorylation (10Brush M.H. Shenolikar S. Control of cellular GADD34 levels by the 26S proteasome.Mol.

The apparent molecular size of the major cellular GADD34 complex at ∼670 kDa (11Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J.

This suggested that cells contained other GADD34-interacting proteins that may also modulate the stress response. Together, these observations prompted us to initiate proteomics studies to identify novel GADD34-interacting proteins and examine their role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Here, we report the identification of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), a known regulator of RNA and protein homeostasis (12Buratti E. Baralle F.E.

Most importantly, our data highlight the ability of GADD34, a known phosphatase regulator, to function as a kinase scaffold that controls TPD-43 phosphorylation and potentially contributes to the pathobiology of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Our prior studies identified arsenite as among the most robust inducers of GADD34 protein in mammalian cells (10Brush M.H. Shenolikar S. Control of cellular GADD34 levels by the 26S proteasome.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28 (18794359): 6989-700010.1128/MCB.00724-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To compare stresses, HEK293T cells were exposed to tunicamycin (TN), an inhibitor of protein glycosylation in the ER; thapsigargin (TG), which depletes ER calcium and impairs chaperone function; and arsenite (Ars), an inducer of oxidative stress. All three stresses elevated eIF2α phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, with TN displaying the slowest onset. Whereas both TG and Ars elicited robust eIF2α phosphorylation, GADD34 accumulation was much higher in the arsenite-treated cells. Lower or no GADD34 was observed in TG- and TN-treated cells over a similar time period (Fig. 1A). The increases in GADD34 protein mirrored stress-induced GADD34 mRNA levels, which were also the highest in arsenite-treated cells (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation of eIF2α plays an essential role in GADD34 expression in response to TG or TN, such that the knock-in substitution of serine 51 with alanine (S51A), which abolishes eIF2α phosphorylation, also eliminates GADD34 expression in response to TG and TN (18Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D.

These studies were also the first to note, however, that arsenite still induced GADD34 expression in the eIF2α (S51A) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but the underlying mechanisms were not investigated. Our previous studies showed that TG treatment of WT MEFs resulted in transient increase in eIF2α phosphorylation, reaching a peak at 30 min (19Reid D.W. Chen Q. Tay A.S. Shenolikar S. Nicchitta C.V. The unfolded protein response triggers selective mRNA release from the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2014; 158 (25215492): 1362-137410.1016/j.cell.2014.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The current studies showed that at 1–2 h, P-eIF2α levels subsided with the expression of GADD34 (Fig. 1B). The P-eIF2α-mediated activation of ISR was demonstrated by the time-dependent increases in mRNAs and proteins representing CHOP and GADD34, downstream ISR genes. The ablation of eIF2α phosphorylation in S51A MEFs, however, strongly suppressed the TG-mediated induction of CHOP and GADD34 proteins and mRNAs, as well as the mRNA encoding ATF4, another ISR gene that is essential for GADD34 transcription (20Ma Y.

In sharp contrast, arsenite induced GADD34 protein expression in both WT and S51A MEFs (Fig. 1C). Arsenite also increased the levels of mRNAs encoding GADD34, CHOP, and ATF4, in both WT and S51A MEFs. Despite the increase in CHOP mRNA, no CHOP protein was detected in S51A MEFs, potentially highlighting that efficient translation of CHOP mRNA requires eIF2α phosphorylation (3Palam L.R. Baird T.D.

This was surprising, as the GADD34 mRNA, which also contains upstream ORFs that enable its translation in the presence of P-eIF2α (1Wang M. Kaufman R.J. Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a conduit to human disease.Nature. 2016; 529 (26791723): 326-33510.1038/nature17041Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), was efficiently translated in the S51A MEFs. During cell recovery from stress, the GADD34 protein undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation, displaying a half-life of <1 h (10Brush M.H. Shenolikar S. Control of cellular GADD34 levels by the 26S proteasome.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28 (18794359): 6989-700010.1128/MCB.00724-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of stress on protein turnover, endogenous GADD34 protein was expressed in HEK293T cells by exposure to TG or Ars (Fig. 1D). The addition of cycloheximide (CHX) that inhibited new protein synthesis resulted in the rapid decay of the GADD34 protein in TG-treated cells, with rates similar to those seen in control unstressed cells (Fig. 1E), and little or no GADD34 protein was visible after 2 h. By contrast, the decay rate for GADD34 in arsenite-treated cells was slower, with GADD34 protein still visible at 4 h. To strengthen these initial observations, we coexpressed human GADD34-GFP, shown to degrade at a rate similar to that of endogenous GADD34 (10Brush M.H. Shenolikar S. Control of cellular GADD34 levels by the 26S proteasome.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28 (18794359): 6989-700010.1128/MCB.00724-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), along with the proteasome substrate, GFPu (21Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Application and analysis of the GFPu family of ubiquitin-proteasome system reporters.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399 (16338377): 481-49010.1016/S0076-6879(05)99033-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as an independent readout of proteasome function. Both GADD34-GFP and GFPu were rapidly degraded in control CHX-treated cells (Fig. 1E). The addition of MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, attenuated the turnover of both GADD34-GFP and GFPu, consistent with their degradation by the proteasome. Whereas TG had no discernible effect on turnover of GADD34-GFP or GFPu, arsenite significantly stabilized GADD34-GFP without affecting the degradation of GFPu. These data showed that arsenite preferentially stabilized GADD34-GFP without impairing proteasomal function. Thus, the combined effects of increased transcription, translation, and protein stability accounted for the high GADD34 levels seen in cells undergoing oxidative stress. To identify novel GADD34 functions, we expressed FLAG-GADD34 in HEK293T cells and subjected anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates to mass spectrometry. In six independent experiments (the data are available at www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/ or http://www.imexconsortium.org with the identifier IM-23248), PP1α (5 of 6 experiments) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. and eIF2α (4 of 6 experiments) were consistently identified, confirming GADD34's known ability to scaffold these two proteins (7Choy M.S.

Among the new potential GADD34-interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry (4 of 6 experiments) was the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), which has been implicated in RNA and protein homeostasis (13Ling S.C.

We confirmed the association of endogenous TDP-43 using immunoblotting of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from FLAG-GADD34–expressing HEK293T cells with an anti-TDP-43 antibody (Fig. 2A). KARA, a mutant GADD34 that does not bind PP1α (22Brush M.H. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD34 targets protein phosphatase 1 to the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes dephosphorylation of the subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2.Mol.

To examine TDP-43 association with endogenous GADD34, HEK293T cells were treated with arsenite (100 μm, 6 h) to induce GADD34 expression, and anti-TDP-43 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-GADD34 antibody. These data showed that endogenous GADD34 bound the endogenous TDP-43 with an efficacy similar to that of the known TDP-43–interacting RNA-binding protein, TIAR (Fig. 2B). A faint band representing TDP-43 was seen in immunoprecipitates using control or nonspecific IgG. This probably represented arsenite-induced TDP-43–containing protein aggregates, which cosedimented with the IgG-bound protein G beads. These samples, however, contained no GADD34 or TIAR, highlighting the specificity of the anti-TDP-43 immunoprecipitates. In these experiments, we were unable to detect TDP-43 in the reciprocal anti-GADD34 immunoprecipitates that had been shown previously to contain PP1α and eIF2α. This suggested that the TDP-43 footprint on GADD34 was different from that of PP1α or eIF2α such that TDP-43 association occluded the binding of GADD34 by the anti-GADD34 antibody, whose epitope resided near the C terminus of human GADD34. To examine the potential modulation of GADD34/TDP-43 binding by stress, FLAG-GADD34-expressing HEK293T cells were exposed to various stresses, and FLAG-GADD34 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TDP-43 (Fig. 3A). These data showed that arsenite, and to a lesser extent, FCCP, a mitochondrial inhibitor, enhanced GADD34 binding to TDP-43. Exposure to increasing arsenite concentrations highlighted a dose dependence for FLAG-GADD34 binding to endogenous TDP-43 (also to a lesser extent to eIF2α), although PP1α binding to GADD34 was independent of stress (Fig. 3B). N-Acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, inhibited the arsenite-induced GADD34/TDP-43 association (Fig. 3C), illustrating that an oxidative stress was elicited by arsenite that enhanced TDP-43 recruitment to the GADD34·PP1α·eIF2α complex. Ectopically expressed GADD34 strongly suppresses stress signaling (25Lu P.D. Jousse C. Marciniak S.J. Zhang Y. Novoa I. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P. Cytoprotection by pre-emptive conditional phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2.EMBO J. 2004; 23 (14713949): 169-17910.1038/sj.emboj.7600030Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine the importance of P-eIF2α in GADD34/TDP-43 association, low levels of FLAG-GADD34 were expressed in WT and S51A MEFs (Fig. 3D). As anticipated, a short exposure to arsenite increased eIF2α phosphorylation in WT MEFs but not in S51A MEFs. Arsenite partially reduced the TDP-43 levels in both cells, possibly redirecting the protein to TDP-43–containing stress granules (14Colombrita C. Zennaro E. Fallini C. Weber M. Sommacal A. Buratti E. Silani V. Ratti A. TDP-43 is recruited to stress granules in conditions of oxidative insult.J.

Regardless, the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from both arsenite-treated WT and S51A MEFs contained detectable TDP-43. These data showed that GADD34/TDP-43 association was independent of P-eIF2α and ISR signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation of TDP-43 from arsenite-treated HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-GADD34 polypeptides showed that other than the peptide encompassing the N-terminal region, amino acids 1–200, all other GADD34 polypeptides bound TDP-43 (Fig. 4, A and B). By comparison, only the C-terminal domain of GADD34, represented by amino acids 514–674, bound PP1α (22Brush M.H. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S.

Purified recombinant GST-GADD34 proteins also sedimented TDP-43 as well as PP1α and eIF2α from HEK293T lysates (Fig. 4C). These in vitro experiments confirmed that the C-terminal region, 514–674, bound PP1α and eIF2α although much more weakly. By comparison, the N-terminal domain, 1–513, bound eIF2α avidly but did not interact with PP1α (7Choy M.S. Yusoff P. Lee I.C. Newton J.C. Goh C.W. Page R. Shenolikar S. Peti W. Structural and functional analysis of the GADD34:PP1 eIF2α phosphatase.Cell Rep. 2015; 11 (26095357): 1885-189110.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The full-length GST-GADD34, 1–674, and the C-terminal peptide, 241–674, expressed poorly in bacteria and, thus, showed a reduced binding to eIF2α, PP1α, and TDP-43 (Fig. 4C). Together, these experiments suggested that an extended region of GADD34 represented the TDP-43–docking site (Fig. 4A) that still accommodated eIF2α and PP1α binding to GADD34. Arsenite promotes the oxidation of one or more cysteines in TDP-43 (26Cohen T.J. Hwang A.W. Unger T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

After processing in the Golgi to cleave the N-terminal prodomain from the C-terminal growth factor (GF) domain in each monomer, pro-TGF-β is secreted and stored in latent complexes. It is unclear which prodomain and GF monomer are linked before proprotein convertase cleavage and how much conformational change occurs following cleavage. We have determined a structure of pro-TGF-β1 with the proprotein convertase cleavage site mutated to mimic the structure of the TGF-β1 proprotein. Structure, mutation, and model building demonstrate that the prodomain arm domain in one monomer is linked to the GF that interacts with the arm domain in the other monomer in the dimeric structure (i.e. the prodomain arm domain and GF domain in each monomer are swapped). Swapping has important implications for the mechanism of biosynthesis in the TGF-β family and is relevant to the mechanism for preferential formation of heterodimers over homodimers for some members of the TGF-β family. Our structure, together with two previous ones, also provides insights into which regions of the prodomain–GF complex are highly structurally conserved and which are perturbed by crystal lattice contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2768077201,"The identification of growth factors as potential biomarkers in alcohol addiction may help to understand underlying mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Previous studies have linked growth factors to neural plasticity in neurocognitive impairment and mental disorders. In order to further clarify the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on circulating growth factors, a cross-sectional study was performed in abstinent AUD patients (alcohol group, N = 91) and healthy control subjects (control group, N = 55) to examine plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). The association of these plasma peptides with relevant AUD-related variables and psychiatric comorbidity was explored. The alcohol group was diagnosed with severe AUD and showed an average of 13 years of problematic use and 10 months of abstinence at the moment of participating in the study. Regarding common medical conditions associated with AUD, we observed an elevated incidence of alcohol-induced liver and pancreas diseases (18.7%) and psychiatric comorbidity (76.9%). Thus, AUD patients displayed a high prevalence of dual diagnosis (39.3%) [mainly depression (19.9%)] and comorbid substance use disorders (40.7%). Plasma BDNF and IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in the alcohol group than in the control group (p<0.001). Remarkably, there was a negative association between IGF-1 concentrations and age in the control group (r = -0.52, p<0.001) that was not found in the alcohol group. Concerning AUD-related variables, AUD patients with liver and pancreas diseases showed even lower concentrations of BDNF (p<0.05). In contrast, the changes in plasma concentrations of these peptides were not associated with abstinence, problematic use, AUD severity or lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. These results suggest that further research is necessary to elucidate the role of BDNF in alcohol-induced toxicity and the biological significance of the lack of correlation between age and plasma IGF-1 levels in abstinent AUD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2791550490,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze deacetylation of acetyl-lysine residues within proteins. To date, HDAC substrate specificity and selectivity have been largely estimated using peptide substrates. However, it is unclear whether peptide substrates accurately reflect the substrate selectivity of HDAC8 toward full-length proteins. Here, we compare HDAC8 substrate selectivity in the context of peptides, full-length proteins, and protein–nucleic acid complexes. We demonstrate that HDAC8 catalyzes deacetylation of tetrameric histone (H3/H4) substrates with catalytic efficiencies that are 40–300-fold higher than those for corresponding peptide substrates. Thus, we conclude that additional contacts with protein substrates enhance catalytic efficiency. However, the catalytic efficiency decreases for larger multiprotein complexes. These differences in HDAC8 substrate selectivity for peptides and full-length proteins suggest that HDAC8 substrate preference is based on a combination of short- and long-range interactions. In summary, this work presents detailed kinetics for HDAC8-catalyzed deacetylation of singly-acetylated, full-length protein substrates, revealing that HDAC8 substrate selectivity is determined by multiple factors. These insights provide a foundation for understanding recognition of full-length proteins by HDACs."

After collection of social and behavioral characteristics, each woman received a physical examination and a blood sample was taken for biological analyses, including HIV testing. The relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral variables involved in high risk for HIV as well as biological results were investigated by bivariate analysis in relationship with FSW categories as main outcomes, and by bivariate analysis followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis in relationship with HIV as the main outcome. The strength of statistical associations was measured by crude and adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals.The typology of FSW comprised six different categories. Two groups were the ""official"" professional FSW primarily classified according to their locations of work [i) ""kata""(18.55%) representing women working in poor neighborhoods of Bangui; ii) ""pupulenge"" (13.91%) working in hotels and night clubs to seek white men]. Four groups were ""clandestine"" nonprofessional FSW classified according to their reported main activity [i) ""market and street vendors"" (20.86%); ii) ""schoolgirls or students"" (19.13%) involved in occasional transactional sex (during holidays); iii) ""housewives or unemployed women"" (15.65%); iv) ""civil servants"" (11.88%) working as soldiers or in the public sector]. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 was 19.12% (66/345). HIV varied according to FSW categories. Thus, among professional FSW, the HIV prevalence was 6-fold higher in ""kata"" than ""pupulenge"" (39.13% versus 6.30%; P = 0.001). Among nonprofessional FSW, the ""vendors"" showed the highest HIV prevalence (31.91%), which was higher than in ""students"" (6.10%; P = 0.001), ""civil servants"" (9.83%; P = 0.005), and ""housewives"" (13.00%; P = 0.01). In bivariate analysis, the following variables showed statistically significant association with risk for HIV infection: nationality; age of first sexual intercourse; self-assessment of HIV risk; knowledge of HIV status; anal sex practice with last clients; irregular condom use in last week; consumption of alcohol; other psycho-active substances; past history of STIs; HBs Ag; HSV-2 and bacterial vaginosis. However, the variable ""sex workers categories"" dichotomized into professional versus nonprofessional FSW was no longer associated with HIV. In multivariate logistical regression analysis, HIV infection was strongly associated with nationality (15.65% versus 3.77%) [adjusted OR (aOR) 3.39: 95% CI:1.25-9.16, P<0.05]; age of first sexual intercourse (21.10% versus 14.00%) (aOR 2.13: 95% CI: 1.03-4.39, P<0.05); anal sex practice with last clients (43.40% versus 11.50%) (aOR 4.31: 95% CI:2.28-8.33, P<0.001); irregular condom use in past week (33.50% versus 3.00%) (aOR 5.49: 95% CI:1.89-15.98, P<0.001); alcohol consumption before sex (34.70% versus 7.80%) (aOR 2.69: 95% CI:1.22-4.96, P<0.05); past history of STIs (41.00% versus 10.80%) (aOR 2.46: 95% CI:1.22-4.97, P<0.05) and bacterial vaginosis (29.80% versus 4.29%) (aOR 6.36: 95% CI: 2.30-17.72, P<0.001).Our observations highlight the high level of vulnerability for HIV acquisition of both poor professional ""kata"" and nonprofessional ""street vendor"" FSW categories. These categories should be particularly taken into account when designing specific prevention programs for STIs/HIV control purposes."

The role of non-coding RNAs in cell cycle regulation during serum starvation has been investigated previously; microarray analysis shows that a large number of microRNAs are significantly and sustainably altered during serum starvation (10Leeper N.J.

Cell Physiol. 2011; 226: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The levels of miR-16 increase during arrest in G0 phase and decrease upon release into the cell cycle, suggesting that the rapid up-regulation of miR-16 induces cell cycle arrest (11Rissland O.S.

Similarly, it has been reported that miR-34a targets Sirt1 in response to oxidative and genotoxic stress, exacerbating hypoxia and serum starvation–induced apoptosis during serum starvation (12Zhang F. Cui J. Liu X. Lv B. Liu X. Xie Z. Yu B. Roles of microRNA-34a targeting SIRT1 in mesenchymal stem cells.Stem Cell Res. Ther. 2015; 6: 195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar miRNA expression patterns were observed during stalling of cell growth either by contact inhibition or serum starvation, suggesting that common growth pathways are targeted (13Suh E.J.

Thus, there is accumulating evidence that miRNAs modulate major physiological pathways during stress, playing a key role in adaptation of cancer cells. miRNAs from multiple families (miR-16, miR-7, miR-132, and miR-144) have been identified that target cyclin E, with their down-regulation being linked to different cancers (14Zhang X.

Although it is widely accepted that miRNA-mediated cyclin E regulation has a vital role in oncogenesis, the role of cyclin E in regulating the cell cycle in the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. Moreover, no miRNA has been identified that targets CCNE1 during serum starvation. In recent years, it has been realized that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in tumorigenesis through their interactions with DNA, protein, and RNA. Functional annotation of mammalian cDNA has identified more that 25,000 RNAs that have a 5′ cap and splicing and polyadenylation sites but no open reading frame (18Hon C.C. Ramilowski J.A. Harshbarger J. Bertin N. Rackham O.J. Gough J. Denisenko E. Schmeier S. Poulsen T.M. Severin J. Lizio M. Kawaji H. Kasukawa T. Itoh M. Burroughs A.M. et al.An atlas of human long non-coding RNAs with accurate 5′ ends.Nature. 2017; 543: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Deregulated expression of several lncRNAs has been associated with cancers. One such oncogenic lncRNA is HOTAIR, up-regulation of which indicates poor prognosis and enhanced metastasis in breast cancer (19Gupta R.A. Shah N. Wang K.C. Kim J. Horlings H.M. Wong D.J. Tsai M.C. Hung T. Argani P. Rinn J.L. Wang Y. Brzoska P. Kong B. Li R. West R.B. et al.Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR reprograms chromatin state to promote cancer metastasis.Nature. 2010; 464: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms of action of lncRNA is to titrate away specific miRNAs, thereby relieving the repression of miRNA target genes. It has been shown that long non-coding RNA, PTENP1, acts as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-106b and miR-93 (20Zhang R. Guo Y. Ma Z. Ma G. Xue Q. Li F. Liu L. Long non-coding RNA PTENP1 functions as a ceRNA to modulate PTEN level by decoying miR-106b and miR-93 in gastric cancer.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 26079-26089Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been reported that lncRNA XLOC_008466 is up-regulated in human non-small cell lung cancer, where it functions as a ceRNA, directly binding to miR-874, although the target gene that affects cell proliferation remained unidentified (21Yang R. Li P. Zhang G. Lu C. Wang H. Zhao G. Long non-coding RNA XLOC_008466 functions as an oncogene in human non-small cell lung cancer by targeting miR-874.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2017; 42: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Serum withdrawal resembles the growth factor deprivation characteristic of the poorly vascularized tumor microenvironment and has aided in the discovery of key growth modulatory genes and miRNAs that have a role in the oncogenic transformation (22Bar-Joseph Z. Siegfried Z. Brandeis M. Brors B. Lu Y. Eils R. Dynlacht B.D. Simon I. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of the human cell cycle identifies genes differentially regulated in normal and cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the miRNA–mRNA regulatory networks in contrasting physiological growth states, cell cycle entry and exit, to draw a correlation between them and tested these regulatory networks during osteosarcoma oncogenesis. We observed that miR-874 targets CCNE1 during serum starvation, whereas in growth factor–sufficient conditions, miR-874 is down-regulated, resulting in CCNE1 prevalence and cell growth. We observed that the miR-874 regulation of CCNE1 is lost in osteosarcoma, leading to aggressive cancer-related phenotypes. To identify the miRNAs that are differentially regulated during growth factor deficiency, we followed a systematic approach as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. Asynchronous HCT116 cells were grown in serum-free medium for 48 h, after which cells were resupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and further grown for 12 h. The asynchronous, serum-starved, and serum-resupplemented cells were harvested for evaluating RNA and protein levels as well as cell cycle analysis; flow cytometry analysis established that serum-starved cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase, indicating cell cycle exit, whereas after serum restimulation, cells progressed into the cell cycle (Fig. 1B). Serum withdrawal led to an increase in the levels of CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27, which were down-regulated as cells progressed into the cell cycle after serum restimulation (Fig. 1C). We performed global miRNA expression profiling of asynchronous, serum-starved, and serum-resupplemented cells from two biological replicates using miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th generation), which is based on miRBase version 19.0. High concordance among the biological replicates demonstrated that the individual sample sets had low variability, as seen in the heat map (Fig. 1D). Of a total of 567 miRNAs that were analyzed, we identified 51 differentially expressed miRNAs in asynchronous, serum-starved, and serum-resupplemented HCT116 cells with a >2-fold change using a significance analysis of microarray (SAM) plot (Fig. 1E). A majority of these differentially regulated miRNAs were up-regulated following serum withdrawal (48Balcells I. Cirera S. Busk P.K. Specific and sensitive quantitative RT-PCR of miRNAs with DNA primers.BMC Biotechnol. 2011; 11: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and down-regulated upon serum restimulation (44Han J. Liu Z. Wang N. Pan W. MicroRNA-874 inhibits growth, induces apoptosis and reverses chemoresistance in colorectal cancer by targeting X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.Oncology Rep. 2016; 36: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas only three miRNAs exhibited an inverse expression pattern. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed differential expression of 13 miRNAs: miR-663a, miR-874-3p (miR-874), miR-1469, miR-3178, miR-3195, miR-3196, miR-3687, miR-4279, miR-4449, miR-4488, miR-4497, miR-4508, and miR-4516. Each of these miRNAs was found to be up-regulated in serum-starved cells in comparison with asynchronously growing cells, whereas the expression levels of these miRNAs were down-regulated in serum-resupplemented cells in comparison with serum-starved cells (Fig. 1F). A repertoire of E2F-regulated genes primarily involved in DNA replication and cell cycle is known to be down-regulated in the G0 phase, and by using qRT-PCR we determined the levels of key cell cycle genes in asynchronous, serum-starved, and serum-resupplemented cells. The expression levels of major cell cycle and replication genes showed an inverse correlation to that of the differentially regulated miRNAs; serum deprivation resulted in down-regulation of the genes, and upon serum restimulation, the normal expression levels were restored (Fig. 1G). Immunoblotting confirmed the down-regulation of key cell cycle and replication proteins (Fig. 1H). Next, we sought to identify the putative targets of the serum starvation–induced miRNAs based on the miRNA target prediction algorithms, TargetScan, miRanda, miRWalk, and RNA22 (Fig. 1I). While deciding on the candidate miRNA to be pursued for further investigation, our decision was based on miRBase 21, which identifies “high-confidence” miRNAs based on several criteria, such as sufficient reads for each miRNA arm in the miRBase-collated deep sequencing data set, processing pattern of the mature sequences from the hairpin precursor form, and conservation of miRNA sequences across species, the methodology of which has been described in detail (23Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: annotating high confidence microRNAs using deep sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D68-D73Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Among the 13 validated miRNAs identified in our screen, only miR-874 was included in the high-confidence miRNA subset; therefore, we focused on this miRNA for further investigation. miR-874 is well conserved across mammals ranging from humans to rhesus monkeys to mice and has been detected in deep sequencing from multiple tissues: squamous cells, embryonic stem cells, cerebellum, heart, kidney, melanomas, etc. Another major factor in deciding on the candidate miRNA was the size; it has been reported that several miRNAs in the range of 17–19 nucleotides are possibly by-products of other non-coding RNAs like t-RNAs and sno-RNAs, originating from pseudo-precursor miRNA genes that lack the typical pre-miRNA hairpin structure. In our study, whereas miR-874 was 22 nt long, a majority of other miRNAs (miR-3178, miR-3195, miR-3196, miR-4279, miR-4488, miR-4497, miR-4508, and miR-4516) were found to be shorter than 19 nt. Therefore, for further evaluations, we followed up with miR-874 that fulfilled the basic acceptance criteria for a high-confidence miRNA. To evaluate whether the predicted genes are targets of miR-874, we transfected double-stranded mimic of miR-874, which increased its intracellular levels (Fig. 1J). miR-874 overexpression led to a significant decrease in the transcript levels of cyclin E1, whereas the mRNA levels of the other predicted targets, Cdc25a, Mcm8, and Psf2, remained unaffected, thereby suggesting that CCNE1 is a target of miR-874 (Fig. 1K). The levels of CCNE2 did not decrease after miR-874 expression, indicating that it specifically targets CCNE1 for cell cycle regulation (Fig. 1K). Thus, our screen identified miR-874 as a serum starvation–induced miRNA. We have observed that the levels of miR-874 increase during serum starvation, whereas those of CCNE1 decrease, and this pattern is reversed during serum restimulation. We wanted to establish whether miR-874 was responsible for the oscillation in CCNE1 levels; therefore, we restored miR-874 levels during serum restimulation and assayed the effect on CCNE1 levels. We transfected miR-874 twice in serum-starved cells followed by serum stimulation to allow them to enter the cell cycle (Fig. 2A, i). We observed that the presence of miR-874 prevented the cyclin E1 increase during cell cycle reentry (Fig. 2A, ii and iii). However, unlike CCNE1, the increase in the levels of CCNE2 during cell cycle reentry was not affected by miR-874 overexpression (Fig. 2A, ii). We observed that although the levels of CCNE1 mRNA increase significantly in the 12-h period of serum resupplementation, the increase in protein levels was not proportionate to the increase in mRNA. We believe that although fresh mRNA is synthesized during serum restimulation, it is not completely translated in the 12-h period, as it has been previously reported that levels of many proteins, including cyclin E, are only partially restored during 12–16 h of serum restimulation (24D'Abaco G.M.

Coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and degradation by mTORC1.Nature. 2014; 513: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that miR-874 specifically targets CCNE1, and its down-regulation permits CCNE1 increase during cell cycle reentry. Next, we wanted to test whether miR-874–mediated CCNE1 regulation is preserved in osteosarcoma, a condition where CCNE1 deregulation is well established (27Lockwood W.W. Stack D. Morris T. Grehan D. O'Keane C. Stewart G.L. Cumiskey J. Lam W.L. Squire J.A. Thomas D.M. O'Sullivan M.J. Cyclin E1 is amplified and overexpressed in osteosarcoma.J. Mol. Diagn. 2011; 13: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We compared the endogenous levels of miR-874 and CCNE1 in human normal osteoblastic cell line hFOB1.19 and two other human osteosarcoma cell lines that differ in their aggressiveness: U2OS (rapidly proliferating, highly invasive, and migratory) and KPD (slowly proliferating, less invasive, and migratory) (Fig. 2B, i) (28Lauvrak S.U. Munthe E. Kresse S.H. Stratford E.W. Namløs H.M. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Myklebost O. Functional characterisation of osteosarcoma cell lines and identification of mRNAs and miRNAs associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes.Br. J. Cancer. 2013; 109: 2228-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The levels of CCNE1 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in U2OS in comparison with both KPD and hFOB1.19 (Fig. 2B, ii and iii). The expression of miR-874 in all three of the cell lines was inversely correlated to CCNE1 levels (i.e. miR-874 was considerably low in U2OS as compared with KPD and hFOB1.19) (Fig. 2B, iv). This indicates an inverse correlation between CCNE1 and miR-874 expression in human osteosarcoma. We also established that the oscillation of miR-874 and CCNE1 during cell cycle reentry and exit is conserved in osteosarcoma cell lines (Fig. 2C, i–iv). For evaluating whether CCNE1 is a direct target of miR-874, we mutated the binding site of miR-874 in CCNE1 (Fig. 3A). The entire 3′-UTR of CCNE1 carrying either the WT or mutated binding site for miR-874 was cloned into pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase vector. When the wild-type CCNE1 3′-UTR was introduced into U2OS cells along with miR-874 mimic or positive control miR-16 mimic, it exhibited a significant reduction in the luciferase activity, but the mutation in the binding site at the 3′-UTR abrogated the inhibition on luciferase activity caused by miR-874 overexpression (Fig. 3B). Thus, miR-874 inhibits CCNE1 expression through direct interaction with its 3′-UTR. We have determined the effect of miR-874 overexpression on CCNE1 levels, and next we assessed the effect of loss of function of miR-874 on CCNE1 levels. We transfected U2OS cells with mimic of miR-874 or single-stranded antisense inhibitor of miR-874, alone or in combination, and evaluated the effect on CCNE1 expression. As expected, we observed a marked decrease in CCNE1 levels as a result of miR-874 overexpression, whereas CCNE1 protein increased marginally upon miR-874 inhibition (Fig. 3, C and D). However, transfection of miR-874 inhibitor reversed the CCNE1 down-regulation caused by miR-874 mimic expression, confirming that miR-874 regulates endogenous CCNE1 levels. Thus, miR-874 represses CCNE1 by binding to a site in its 3′-UTR. It has been well established that the promoter for the CCNE1 gene harbors multiple binding sites for E2F transcription factors, and they regulate the expression of endogenous cyclin E (29Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Regulation of the cyclin E gene by transcription factor E2F1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 30Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. E2F3 activity is regulated during the cell cycle and is required for the induction of S phase.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the decrease of CCNE1 levels after miR-874 overexpression is due to the down-regulation of E2F transcription factors. We evaluated the levels of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 after miR-874 overexpression in asynchronously growing U2OS cells. We observed that although the CCNE1 mRNA levels were down-regulated, the levels of E2F transcription factors did not alter significantly (Fig. 4A). We also evaluated the levels of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 during serum starvation, and as expected, the levels of all three of the E2F transcription factors were down-regulated in serum-deficient cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, miR-874 overexpression during serum resupplementation did not significantly alter the endogenous levels of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 mRNA (Fig. 4B). There was a 30% reduction in the levels of E2F3 after miR-874 mimic transfection; however, because the expression of CCNE1 is known to be controlled by all three transcription factors, it is unlikely to result in major CCNE1 down-regulation. Thus, the decrease in CCNE1 levels caused by miR-874 is not due to down-regulation of E2F transcription factors. Transcription factor–binding site prediction algorithms identify 16 putative E2F consensus–binding sites in the 10-kb region surrounding the genomic loci from where miR-874 is expressed (chromosome 5q31.2). We wanted to assay whether E2F transcription factors regulate the expression of primary transcript of miR-874. Therefore, we evaluated the levels of primary miRNA (pri-miR-874) upon E2F1 or E2F2 depletion by RT-PCR with primers that amplify the 201-nt region around the mature miR-874. We observed that E2F1 or E2F2 siRNA effectively reduced the levels of targeted gene, but the levels of pri-miR-874 were not significantly reduced (Fig. 4C, i and ii). The results indicate that although miR-874 harbors several E2F consensus–binding sites, its expression may not be regulated in an E2F-dependent manner. It has been reported that lncRNA XLOC_008466 functions as a competing endogenous RNA binding to miR-874. We wanted to assay whether the XLOC_008466–miR-874 network affects CCNE1 expression in osteosarcomas (Fig. 4D). We depleted the endogenous levels of XLOC_008466 by transfecting a siRNA duplex that targets its 3′-end. Transfection of siRNA targeting XLOC_008466 decreased its endogenous levels to about half that of control cells (Fig. 4D). The decrease in XLOC_008466 levels resulted in a significant increase in miR-874 levels, establishing that XLOC_008466 functions as a natural sponge for miR-874. Concomitantly, up-regulation of miR-874 due to XLOC_008466 inhibition resulted in CCNE1 down-regulation. Thus, the XLOC_008466–miR-874–CCNE1 network exists in osteosarcoma, and it is likely that a balance of these antagonistic factors influences the progression of osteosarcoma. Having identified CCNE1 as a direct target of miR-874, we next investigated the effect of miR-874 on cell cycle progression, particularly on S phase progression. U2OS cells transfected on 3 consecutive days with miR-874 mimic were either grown asynchronously or synchronized at the G1/S boundary by hydroxyurea treatment for 20 h and were subsequently released into S phase by further growing the cells in drug-free medium for 3 h. Cells at the three indicated time points were subjected to a short BrdU pulse of 20 min and were subsequently harvested for BrdU immunofluorescence. We observed that the BrdU incorporation in asynchronously growing cells transfected with miR-874 was reduced to 23% as compared with 49% in control cells (Fig. 5A, i and iii). When BrdU incorporation was measured distinctly upon S phase enrichment (HU + 3 h), we observed that in comparison with 61% control cells that were BrdU-positive, only 15% of the miR-874–transfected cells incorporated BrdU (Fig. 5A, ii and iii). Thus, miR-874 expression impedes S phase progression. Next, we tested the miR-874–CCNE1 regulation in HOS and MG-63 osteosarcoma cell lines. MG-63 is an osteosarcoma cell line that displays a high proliferation rate and clonogenic ability under anchorage-independent conditions and shows >90% tumor formation in in vivo tumorigenicity assays (28Lauvrak S.U.

A comparison of the properties and activities of a laccase-negative mutant strain (SilA−) with that of the wild-type was studied in terms of their ability to degrade lignin from grass lignocellulose. The yields of solubilized lignin (acid precipitable polymeric lignin, APPL) obtained from wheat straw by both strains in Solid State Fermentation (SSF) conditions demonstrated the importance of SilA laccase in lignin degradation with the wild-type showing 5-fold more APPL produced compared with the mutant strain (SilA−). Analytical pyrolysis and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) confirmed that the APPL obtained from the substrate fermented by wild-type strain was dominated by lignin derived methoxyphenols whereas those from SilA− and control APPLs were composed mainly of polysaccharides. This is the first report highlighting the role of this laccase in lignin degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2767334296,"Background Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NECs) are aggressive, rapidly proliferating tumors. Therapeutic response to current chemotherapy regimens is usually short lasting. The aim of this study was to examine the expression and potential clinical importance of immunoreactive p53 protein in GEP-NEC. Materials and methods Tumor tissues from 124 GEP-NEC patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were collected from Nordic centers and clinical data were obtained from the Nordic NEC register. Tumor proliferation rate and differentiation were re-evaluated. All specimens were immunostained for p53 protein using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression analyses were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results All tumor tissues were immunoreactive for either one or both neuroendocrine biomarkers (chromogranin A and synaptophysin) and Ki67 index was >20% in all cases. p53 immunoreactivity was only shown in 39% of the cases and was not found to be a prognostic marker for the whole cohort. However, p53 immunoreactivity was correlated with shorter PFS in patients with colorectal tumors (HR = 2.1, p = 0.03) in a univariate analysis as well as to poorer PFS (HR = 2.6, p = 0.03) and OS (HR = 3.4, p = 0.02) in patients with colorectal tumors with distant metastases, a correlation which remained significant in the multivariate analyses. Conclusion In this cohort of GEP-NEC patients, p53 expression could not be correlated with clinical outcome. However, in patients with colorectal NECs, p53 expression was correlated with shorter PFS and OS. Further studies are needed to establish the role of immunoreactive p53 as a prognostic marker for GEP-NEC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2767356892,"Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the major cause of birth defects and a precise definition of the HCMV-specific T-cell response in primary infection may help define reliable correlates of immune protection during pregnancy. In this study, a high throughput method was used to define the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for four HCMV proteins in the naïve compartment of seronegative subjects and the effector/memory compartments of subjects with primary/remote HCMV infection. The naïve repertoire displayed comparable frequencies of T cells that were reactive with HCMV structural (pp65, gB and the pentamer gHgLpUL128L) and non-structural (IE-1) proteins. Whereas, following natural infection, the majority of effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognized either gB or IE-1, respectively, and pp65. The pattern of T cell reactivity was comparable at early and late stages of infection and in pregnant women with primary HCMV infection transmitting or not transmitting the virus to the fetus. At an early stage of primary infection, about 50% of HCMV-reactive CD4+ T cells were long-term IL-7Rpos memory cells, while 6-12 months later, the frequency of these cells increased to 70%, approaching 100% in remote infections. In contrast, only 10-20% of HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were long-term memory cells up to 12 months after infection onset, thereafter increasing to 70% in remote infections. Interestingly, a significantly higher frequency of HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells with a long-term IL-7Rpos memory phenotype was observed in non-transmitting compared to transmitting women. These findings indicate that immunodominance in HCMV infection is not predetermined in the naïve compartment, but is the result of virus-host interactions and suggest that prompt control of HCMV infection in pregnancy is associated with the rapid development of long-term IL-7Rpos memory HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells and a low risk of virus transmission to the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2767620514,"Objective 
Assessing risk of adverse outcomes among patients with chronic liver disease has been challenging due to non-linear disease progression. We previously developed accurate prediction models for fibrosis progression and clinical outcomes among patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The primary aim of this study was to validate fibrosis progression and clinical outcomes models among a heterogeneous patient cohort.


Design 
Adults with CHC with ≥3 years follow-up and without hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplant (LT), HBV or HIV co-infection at presentation were analyzed (N = 1007). Outcomes included: 1) fibrosis progression 2) hepatic decompensation 3) HCC and 4) LT-free survival. Predictors included longitudinal clinical and laboratory data. Machine learning methods were used to predict outcomes in 1 and 3 years.


Results 
The external cohort had a median age of 49.4 years (IQR 44.3–54.3); 61% were male, 80% white, and 79% had genotype 1. At presentation, 73% were treatment naive and 31% had cirrhosis. Fibrosis progression occurred in 34% over a median of 4.9 years (IQR 3.2–7.6). Clinical outcomes occurred in 22% over a median of 4.4 years (IQR 3.2–7.6). Model performance for fibrosis progression was limited due to small sample size. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for 1 and 3-year risk of clinical outcomes was 0.78 (95% CI 0.73–0.83) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.69–0.81).


Conclusion 
Accurate assessments for risk of clinical outcomes can be obtained using routinely collected data across a heterogeneous cohort of patients with CHC. These methods can be applied to predict risk of progression in other chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2767949301,"Given that caffeine consumption is exponentially rising in adolescents and they are at increased risk for repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (RmTBI), we sought to examine the pathophysiological outcomes associated with early life caffeine consumption and RmTBI. Adolescent male and female Sprague Dawley rats received either caffeine in the drinking water or normal water and were then randomly assigned to 3 mild injuries using our lateral impact device or 3 sham procedures. Following injury induction, behavioral outcomes were measured with a test battery designed to examine symptoms consistent with clinical manifestation of PCS (balance and motor coordination, anxiety, short-term working memory, and depressive-like behaviours). In addition, pathophysiological outcomes were examined with histological measures of volume and cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus, as well as microglia activation in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Finally, modifications to expression of 12 genes (Adora2a, App, Aqp4, Bdnf, Bmal1, Clock, Cry, Gfap, Orx1, Orx2, Per, Tau), in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and/or the hypothalamus were assessed. We found that chronic caffeine consumption in adolescence altered normal developmental trajectories, as well as recovery from RmTBI. Of particular importance, many of the outcomes exhibited sex-dependent responses whereby the sex of the animal modified response to caffeine, RmTBI, and the combination of the two. These results suggest that caffeine consumption in adolescents at high risk for RmTBI should be monitored."

It is not clear when and how to reduce a dose of 5-ASA after inducing remission. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and evaluate the risk factors of relapse for UC patients receiving 5-ASA. Methods The medical records of prospectively registered UC patients who received oral 5-ASA as maintenance therapy between January and December 31, 2014, were investigated. The patients’ clinical characteristics in a 2-year follow-up were compared between a relapse group and a remission group. Results Of 527 UC patients receiving only oral 5-ASA, 390 (74.0%) maintained remission and 137 (26.0%) relapsed during the follow-up period. Multivariable analysis indicated that a shorter duration of disease remission (p < 0.001, OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.12–1.38) was statistically significant for each comparison between the remission and relapse groups among all the patients. Risk factors for clinical relapse were a shorter duration of disease remission (p <0.001, OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04–1.33) in the high-dose 5-ASA group and a shorter duration of disease remission (p = 0.003, OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.13–1.89) and a history of steroid use (p = 0.048, OR: 4.73, 95% CI: 1.01–22.2) in the low-dose group. Conclusions A dose reduction of 5-ASA might be cautiously selected in UC patients with a history of steroid use and a shorter duration of disease remission."
https://openalex.org/W2767998745,"The Cervidae family comprises more than fifty species divided into three subfamilies: Capreolinae, Cervinae and Hydropotinae. A characteristic attribute for the species included in this family is the great karyotype diversity, with the chromosomal numbers ranging from 2n = 6 observed in female Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis to 2n = 70 found in Mazama gouazoubira as a result of numerous Robertsonian and tandem fusions. This work reports chromosomal homologies between cattle (Bos taurus, 2n = 60) and nine cervid species using a combination of whole chromosome and region-specific paints and BAC clones derived from cattle. We show that despite the great diversity of karyotypes in the studied species, the number of conserved chromosomal segments detected by 29 cattle whole chromosome painting probes was 35 for all Cervidae samples. The detailed analysis of the X chromosomes revealed two different morphological types within Cervidae. The first one, present in the Capreolinae is a sub/metacentric X with the structure more similar to the bovine X. The second type found in Cervini and Muntiacini is an acrocentric X which shows rearrangements in the proximal part that have not yet been identified within Ruminantia. Moreover, we characterised four repetitive sequences organized in heterochromatic blocks on sex chromosomes of the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We show that these repeats gave no hybridization signals to the chromosomes of the closely related moose (Alces alces) and are therefore specific to the reindeer."
https://openalex.org/W2768050331,"Introduction We have previously established a link between impaired phagocytic capacity and deregulated S1P signaling in alveolar macrophages from COPD subjects. We hypothesize that this defect may include a disruption of epithelial-macrophage crosstalk via Spns2-mediated intercellular S1P signaling. Methods Primary alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells from COPD subjects and controls, cell lines, and a mouse model of chronic cigarette smoke exposure were studied. Cells were exposed to 10% cigarette smoke extract, or vehicle control. Spns2 expression and subcellular localization was studied by immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and RT-PCR. Phagocytosis was assessed by flow-cytometry. Levels of intra- and extracellular S1P were measured by S1P [3H]-labeling. Results Spns2 expression was significantly increased (p<0.05) in alveolar macrophages from current-smokers/COPD patients (n = 5) compared to healthy nonsmokers (n = 8) and non-smoker lung transplant patients (n = 4). Consistent with this finding, cigarette smoke induced a significant increase in Spns2 expression in both human alveolar and THP-1 macrophages. In contrast, a remarkable Spns2 down-regulation was noted in response to cigarette smoke in 16HBE14o- cell line (p<0.001 in 3 experiments), primary nasal epithelial cells (p<0.01 in 2 experiments), and in smoke-exposed mice (p<0.001, n = 6 animals per group). Spns2 was localized to cilia in primary bronchial epithelial cells. In both macrophage and epithelial cell types, Spns2 was also found localized to cytoplasm and the nucleus, in line with a predicted bipartile Nuclear Localization Signal at the position aa282 of the human Spns2 sequence. In smoke-exposed mice, alveolar macrophage phagocytic function positively correlated with Spns2 protein expression in bronchial epithelial cells. Conclusion Our data suggest that the epithelium may be the major source for extracellular S1P in the airway and that there is a possible disruption of epithelial/macrophage cross talk via Spns2-mediated S1P signaling in COPD and in response to cigarette smoke exposure."

PMEs are therefore tightly regulated by proteinaceous inhibitors (PMEIs), some of which become active upon changes in cellular pH. Nevertheless, a detailed picture of how this pH-dependent inhibition of PME occurs at the molecular level is missing.

Our complementary approach uncovered how changes in the protonation of amino acids at the complex interface shift the network of interacting residues between intermolecular and intramolecular. These shifts ultimately regulate the stability of the PME3–PMEI7 complex and the inhibition of the PME as a function of the pH. These findings suggest a general model of how pH-dependent proteinaceous inhibitors function.

https://openalex.org/W2767804965,"The neurophysiology underlying temporal perception significantly overlaps with areas of dysfunction identified in schizophrenia. Patients commonly exhibit distorted temporal perception, which likely contributes to functional impairments. Thus, study of temporal perception in animal models of the disease may help to understand both cognitive and neurobiological factors involved in functional impairments in patients. As maternal immune activation (MIA) has been shown to be a significant etiological risk factor in development of schizophrenia and other developmental psychiatric diseases, we tested interval timing in a rat model of MIA that has previously been shown to recapitulate several behavioural and neurophysiological impairments observed in the disease. Rats were tested on a temporal-bisection task, in which temporal duration stimuli were categorized as either “short” or “long” by responding to a corresponding lever. Data from this task were modeled to provide estimates of accuracy and sensitivity of temporal perception. Parameter estimates derived from the model fitting showed that MIA rats significantly overestimated the passage of time compared to controls. These results indicate that the MIA rat paradigm recapitulates timing distortions that are phenotypical of schizophrenia. These findings lend further support to the epidemiological validity of this MIA rat model, supporting its relevance for future research into the role of maternal immune activation in producing neurobiological and behavioural impairments in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2767247172,Objective Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease clinically manifesting as progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Cadherin-11 (CDH11) expression is increased in fibrotic skin and lung tissue. Targeting CDH11 may be an effective approach to treating fibrosis. We hypothesize that targeting CDH11 will decrease fibrosis in the tight skin-1 (Tsk-1) mouse model. Methods CDH11 expression was determined in the Tsk-1 mouse model using quantitative real time PCR and immunofluorescence (IF). Inhibitory anti- CDH11 monoclonal antibodies were tested in Tsk-1 mice for their ability to decrease hypodermal fibrosis. Results Expression of CDH11 was increased in fibrotic skin from Tsk-1 mice compared to pallid controls. IF staining demonstrated that CDH11 expression localized to fibroblasts within the hypodermis of fibrotic skin. Treatment with inhibitory anti-CDH11 monoclonal antibodies decreased hypodermal thickness and fibrotic mediators in Tsk-1 mice compared to control antibodies. Conclusions These data demonstrate an important role for CDH11 in the development of skin fibrosis in Tsk-1 mice. These data add to the growing evidence for the important role of CDH11 in tissue fibrosis and fibrotic disease such as systemic sclerosis.
https://openalex.org/W2767246928,"The 14-3-3 family of intracellular proteins are dimeric, multifunctional adaptor proteins that bind to and regulate the activities of many important signaling proteins. The subunits within 14-3-3 dimers are predicted to be stabilized by salt bridges that are largely conserved across the 14-3-3 protein family and allow the different isoforms to form heterodimers. Here, we have examined the contributions of conserved salt-bridging residues in stabilizing the dimeric state of 14-3-3ζ. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, our results revealed that Asp21 and Glu89 both play key roles in dimer dynamics and contribute to dimer stability. Furthermore, hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry showed that mutation of Asp21 promoted disorder in the N-terminal helices of 14-3-3ζ, suggesting that this residue plays an important role in maintaining structure across the dimer interface. Intriguingly, a D21N 14-3-3ζ mutant exhibited enhanced molecular chaperone ability that prevented amorphous protein aggregation, suggesting a potential role for N-terminal disorder in 14-3-3ζ's poorly understood chaperone action. Taken together, these results imply that disorder in the N-terminal helices of 14-3-3ζ is a consequence of the dimer-monomer dynamics and may play a role in conferring chaperone function to 14-3-3ζ protein."
https://openalex.org/W2767259858,"Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome) behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that behaviour is ‘anchored’ to individual state (e.g. body condition, gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments. Risk-taking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found significant between-individual correlation only in the low food × long basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size (≈ age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural predictability, but not in behavioural type."
https://openalex.org/W2767439119,"Even though Cyprus was an important crossing point for the westward spread of olive, and one of the primary regions of domestication, its genetic recourses remain uncharted at a great extent. Throughout the centuries, a number of ancient olive trees remain in the same orchards, contributing to Cypriot oleiculture and society. In an attempt to explore this monumental genetic pool, a survey was conducted to identify centennial olive trees in rural provinces of Cyprus. Microsatellites were employed in order to study their genetic composition (including rootstocks when feasible) and to establish possible associations among genotypes. High numbers of specific alleles, suggestive of the distinctiveness of this germplasm, were detected, and both grafting and rootstock propagation was verified. Moreover, it was determined by Bayesian structural and network reticulate analysis that centennial olives can be divided in two discrete genetic clusters having intermediate admixed accessions. Furthermore, it was determined that all contemporary Cypriot cultivars, that were included in the present study, were highly affiliated exclusively to one genetic group, a strong evidence of selection among elite clones. The information acquired from the current study reveals the genetic rareness of this material and its contribution to the current olive germplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2767561854,"One of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), whose lack of tumour mass also makes a prompt diagnosis difficult. Moreover, genomic differences between common breast cancers and IBC have not been completely assessed, thus substantially limiting the identification of biomarkers unique to IBC. Here, we developed a novel statistical analysis of gene expression profiles corresponding to microdissected IBC, non-IBC (nIBC) and normal samples that enabled us to identify a set of genes significantly associated with a specific disease state. Second, by using advanced methods based on controllability network theory, we identified a set of critical control proteins that uniquely and structurally control the entire proteome. By mapping high change variance genes in protein interaction networks, we found that a large statistically significant fraction of genes whose variance changed significantly between normal and IBC and nIBC disease states were among the set of critical control proteins. Moreover, this analysis identified the overlapping genes with the highest statistical significance; these genes may assist in developing future biomarkers and determining drug targets to disrupt the molecular pathways driving carcinogenesis in IBC."
https://openalex.org/W2767282831,"Non-union is a major clinical problem in the healing of fractures, especially in patients with osteoporosis. The systemic administration of drugs is time consuming and large doses are demanding and act slowly, whereas local release acts rapidly, increases the quality and quantity of the bone tissue. We hypothesize that local delivery demonstrates better therapeutic effects on an osteoporotic fracture. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the local application of ibandronate loaded with a collagen sponge on regulating bone formation and remodeling in an osteoporotic rat model of fracture healing. We found that the local delivery of ibandronate exhibited excellent effects on improving the bone microarchitecture and suppressed effects on bone remodeling. At 4 weeks, more callus formation and improvement of mechanical character and microstructure were observed in a local delivery via μCT, mechanical test, histological research and serum analysis. The suppression of bone remodeling was compared with a systemic treatment at 12 weeks, and the structural mechanical properties and microarchitecture were also improved with local delivery. This research identifies an earlier, safer and integrated approach for local delivery of ibandronate with collagen and provides a better strategy for the treatment of osteoporotic fracture in rats."

Secondary goals included analyzing the effect of various factors (gender, age, country, etc) on swimmers’ performances. Data were obtained from FINA information about the finalists from 2007 to 2015 WCs and finalists from 2006 to 2013 Junior-WCs (2400 entries). Final filtered database just included swimmers who participated in both junior and senior WCs (719 entries). A univariate general linear model (GLM) was used to examine the association between time; origin (swimmer who participated in Junior WC or not); maintenance years (number of years achieving finalist positions); country; and age, adjusting for year of competition. An ordinal logistic regression (OLR) model was used to identify predictors of achieving the top positions. The origin variable was not significant in either the GLM or the OLR. The only significant variables in the GLM were maintenance years (F4,706 = 7.689; p < .05) and year of competition (F4,706 = 23.239; p < .05). The OLR revealed a strong association (p < .001) between the position variable and maintenance years, getting better positions as you get more WCs (odds = 1.85). In conclusion, no evidence was obtained to conclude finalist position in Junior WC have influence in achieve success in FINA WC. Maintenance years in WCs have a positive impact to achieve better positions."
https://openalex.org/W2767243639,"Coronaviruses are of major importance for both animal and human health. With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169–284 944), only 0.07% of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0–249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired."
https://openalex.org/W2767524650,"Ethanol causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) partly by inhibiting cell adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule. Ethanol interacts with an alcohol binding pocket in the L1 extracellular domain (ECD), and dephosphorylation of S1248 in the L1 cytoplasmic domain (CD) renders L1 adhesion insensitive to inhibition by ethanol (L1 insensitive). The mechanism underlying this inside-out signaling is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of the human L1-CD at S1152, Y1176, S1181, and S1248 renders L1 sensitive to ethanol by promoting L1 coupling with ankyrin-G and the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton. Knockdown of ankyrin-G or L1 mutations that uncouple L1 from ankyrin reduce L1 sensitivity to ethanol, but not methanol, consistent with a small conformational change in the extracellular alcohol binding pocket. Phosphorylation of Y1176 and ankyrin-G coupling with L1 are higher in NIH/3T3 clonal cell lines in which ethanol inhibits L1 adhesion than in ethanol-resistant NIH/3T3 clonal cell lines. Similarly, phosphorylation of Y1176 is higher in C57BL/6J mice that are sensitive to ethanol teratogenesis than in ethanol resistant C57BL/6N mice. Finally, polymorphisms in genes that encode ankyrin-G and p90rsk, a kinase that phosphorylates S1152, are linked to facial dysmorphology in children with heavy prenatal ethanol exposure. These findings indicate that genes that regulate L1 coupling to ankyrin may influence susceptibility to FASD.-Dou, X., Menkari, C., Mitsuyama, R., Foroud, T., Wetherill, L., Hammond, P., Suttie, M., Chen, X., Chen, S.-Y., Charness, M.

https://openalex.org/W2767993782,"Peropsin is a non-visual opsin in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. In mammals, peropsin is present in the apical microvilli of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These structures interdigitate with the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. RPE cells play critical roles in the maintenance of photoreceptors, including the recycling of visual chromophore for the opsin visual pigments. Here, we sought to identify the function of peropsin in the mouse eye. To this end, we generated mice with a null mutation in the peropsin gene (Rrh). These mice exhibited normal retinal histology, normal morphology of outer segments and RPE cells, and no evidence of photoreceptor degeneration. Biochemically, Rrh−/− mice had ∼2-fold higher vitamin A (all-trans-retinol (all-trans-ROL)) in the neural retina following a photobleach and 5-fold lower retinyl esters in the RPE. This phenotype was similar to those reported in mice that lack interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) or cellular retinol-binding protein, suggesting that peropsin plays a role in the movement of all-trans-ROL from photoreceptors to the RPE. We compared the phenotypes in mice lacking both peropsin and IRBP with those of mice lacking peropsin or IRBP alone and found that the retinoid phenotype was similarly severe in each of these knock-out mice. We conclude that peropsin controls all-trans-ROL movement from the retina to the RPE or may regulate all-trans-ROL storage within the RPE. We propose that peropsin affects light-dependent regulation of all-trans-ROL uptake from photoreceptors into RPE cells through an as yet undefined mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2767452014,"Post-conflict affiliative interactions have been widely investigated in primates but not extensively in other species. Using the Post Conflict-Matched Control (PC-MC) comparison method, this study investigated the patterns of post-conflict opponent affiliation (POA) of a captive family group of 19 arctic wolves (Canis lupus arctos), investigating the correlation with various factors. We found that POAs occurred mainly in the non-feeding context and more often when the victim was dominant and the aggressor subordinate. Furthermore, POAs were more likely to have been initiated by the victim than the aggressor. Victims’ stress related behaviours occurred more in PC than MC periods, and more after high vs. low intensity aggressions but they were not more likely to occur after conflicts between wolves with a stronger social bond and POAs did not reduce their rate of occurrence. Our results showed that re-aggression was twice less frequent when a friendly interaction occurred between the aggressor and the victim, and consistent with this, victims engaged in POAs more often than the aggressor. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that POAs in wolves may have been selected for as a mechanism to avoid conflict escalation, which could lead to social disruption and hence jeopardize cooperative activities. The high relatedness among individuals in the pack and the greater dependence of all members on cooperation in breeding and hunting may reduce the importance of ‘relationship quality’ as a mediating factor of POAs, although dominance relationships, which are directly linked to the risks of further conflicts, do play an important role."

A mixed-mechanism rabbit DE model, in which the main lacrimal gland, Harderian gland, and nictitating membrane were resected, was further explored in this study. Conjunctival impression cytology specimens were harvested before excision (BE) and up to 3 months after excision (AE) in 8 (16 eyes) male New Zealand White rabbits, and immunoblotting was employed to assess the expression of AQP5 and MUC5AC. It was observed that AQP5 and MUC5AC showed a positive, synchronous expression pattern with progressive upregulation at protein level up to 2 months AE. At 3 months, the expression of both proteins decreased, but was still higher than that of BE. Such a synchronous relationship was further observed in mouse conjunctiva epithelium primary cells under hyperosmotic condition. Moreover, the co-immunoprecipitation of AQP5 and MUC5AC suggested a possible physical interaction between the two molecules. Our data indicates that conjunctival AQP5 and MUC5AC act synchronously in response to acute DE stress."

However, the rate of complications associated with the surgical procedure varies from 0.7% to 37.4% in real-world settings. We assessed the frequency, type and severity of adverse events following VMMC among 427 adult men surgically circumcised in southeastern Botswana; 97% completed ≥1 follow-up visit within seven days post-circumcision. Thirty moderate AEs were observed in 28 men resulting in an overall AE rate of 6.7%. Patient satisfaction was high: >95% were very or somewhat satisfied with the procedure and subsequent follow-up care."
https://openalex.org/W2767392291,"Mucosal immunization of influenza vaccine is potentially an effective approach for the prevention and control of influenza. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of oral immunization with a non-recombinant Lactococcus lactis displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein, LL-HA1/L/AcmA, to induce mucosal immune responses and to accord protection against influenza virus infection in mice. The LL-HA1/L/AcmA was orally administered into mice and the immune response was evaluated. Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA developed detectable specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid. The results obtained demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited mucosal immunity in both the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract. The protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in immunized mice against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed. Upon challenge, the non-immunized group of mice showed high susceptibility to influenza virus infection. In contrast, 7/8 of mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA survived. In conclusion, oral administration of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice induced mucosal immunity and most importantly, provided protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. These results highlight the potential application of L. lactis as a platform for delivery of influenza virus vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2767531709,"Because of unreliable self-report, accelerometry is increasingly used to objectively monitor physical activity (PA). However, results of accelerometric studies vary depending on the chosen cutpoints between activity intensities. Population-specific activity patterns likely affect the size of these differences. To establish their size and stability we apply three sets of cutpoints, including two calibrated to a single reference, to our accelerometric data and compare PA estimates.1402 German adolescents from the GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts wore triaxial accelerometers (Actigraph GT3x) for one week (mean 6.23 days, 14.7 hours per day) at the hip. After validation of wear, we applied three sets of cutpoints for youth, including the most common standard (Freedson, 2005) and two calibrated to a single reference, (Romanzini uni- and triaxial, from Romanzini, 2014) to these data, estimating daily sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MPA, VPA, MVPA). Stability of differences was assessed by comparing Romanzini's two sets of cutpoints.Relative agreement between cutpoints was closer for activity of lower intensities (largest difference for sedentary behaviour 9%) but increased for higher intensities (largest difference for light activity 40%, MPA 102%, VPA 88%; all p<0.01). Romanzini's uniaxial and triaxial cutpoints agreed no more closely with each other than with Freedson's.Estimated PA differed significantly between different sets of cutpoints, even when those cutpoints agreed perfectly on another dataset (i.e. Romanzini's.) This suggests that the detected differences in estimated PA depend on population-specific activity patterns, which cannot be easily corrected for: converting activity estimates from one set of cutpoints to another may require access to raw data. This limits the utility of accelerometry for comparing populations in place and time. We suggest that accelerometric research adopt a standard for data processing, and apply and present the results of this standard in addition to those from any other method."
https://openalex.org/W2767625889,"Background Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation is an essential therapeutic intervention, yet it causes the clinical syndrome known as ventilator-induced lung injury. Various lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies have attempted to reduce or prevent ventilator-induced lung injury but few modalities have proven effective. A model that isolates the contribution of mechanical ventilation on the development of acute lung injury is needed to better understand biologic mechanisms that lead to ventilator-induced lung injury. Objectives To evaluate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers in reducing lung injury in a ventilator-induced lung injury murine model in short- and longer-term ventilation. Methods 5–12 week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 85) were anesthetized, placed on mechanical ventilation for either 2 hrs or 4 hrs with either low tidal volume (8 ml/kg) or high tidal volume (15 ml/kg) with or without positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. Results Alteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier was noted at 2 hrs of high tidal volume ventilation. Standardized histology scores, influx of bronchoalveolar lavage albumin, proinflammatory cytokines, and absolute neutrophils were significantly higher in the high-tidal volume ventilation group at 4 hours of ventilation. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure resulted in significantly decreased standardized histology scores and bronchoalveolar absolute neutrophil counts at low- and high-tidal volume ventilation, respectively. Recruitment maneuvers were essential to maintain pulmonary compliance at both 2 and 4 hrs of ventilation. Conclusions Signs of ventilator-induced lung injury are evident soon after high tidal volume ventilation (as early as 2 hours) and lung injury worsens with longer-term ventilation (4 hrs). Application of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers are protective against worsening VILI across all time points. Dynamic compliance can be used guide the frequency of recruitment maneuvers to help ameloriate ventilator-induced lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2767795012,"Redesigning protein surface topology to improve target binding holds great promise in the search for highly selective therapeutics. While significant binding improvements can be achieved using natural amino acids, the introduction of non-canonical residues vastly increases sequence space and thus the chance to significantly out-compete native partners. The potency of protein inhibitors can be further enhanced by synthesising mirror image, D-amino versions. This renders them non-immunogenic and makes them highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. Current experimental design methods often preclude the use of D-amino acids and non-canonical amino acids for a variety of reasons. To address this, we build an in silico pipeline for D-protein designs featuring non-canonical amino acids. For a test scaffold we use an existing D-protein inhibitor of VEGF: D-RFX001. We benchmark the approach by recapitulating previous experimental optimisation with canonical amino acids. Subsequent incorporation of non-canonical amino acids allows designs that are predicted to improve binding affinity by up to -7.18 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W2767570804,"Allelic variation at the Zea mays (maize) pericarp color1 (p1) gene has been attributed to epigenetic gene regulation. A p1 distal enhancer, 5.2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, has demonstrated variation in DNA methylation in different p1 alleles/epialleles. In addition, DNA methylation of sequences within the 3' end of intron 2 also plays a role in tissue-specific expression of p1 alleles. We show here a direct evidence for small RNAs' involvement in regulating p1 that has not been demonstrated previously. The role of mediator of paramutation1 (mop1) was tested in the maintenance of somatic silencing at distinct p1 alleles: the non-paramutagenic P1-wr allele and paramutagenic P1-rr' epiallele. The mop1-1 mutation gradually relieves the silenced phenotype after multiple generations of exposure; P1-wr;mop1-1 plants display a loss of 24-nt small RNAs and DNA methylation in the 3' end of the intron 2, a region close to a Stowaway transposon. In addition, a MULE sequence within the proximal promoter of P1-wr shows depletion of 24nt siRNAs in mop1-1 plants. Release of silencing was not correlated with small RNAs at the distal enhancer region of the P1-wr allele. We found that the somatic silencing of the paramutagenic P1-rr' is correlated with significantly reduced H3K9me2 in the distal enhancer of P1-rr'; mop1-1 plants, while symmetric DNA methylation is not significantly different. This study highlights that the epigenetic regulation of p1 alleles is controlled both via RdDM as well as non-RdDM mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2767604033,"A limited collection of signaling networks and transcriptional effectors directs the full spectrum of cellular behaviors that comprise development. One mechanism to diversify regulatory potential is to combine multiple biochemical activities into the same protein. Exemplifying this principle of modularity, Eyes absent (Eya), originally identified as a transcriptional co-activator within the retinal determination gene network (RDGN), also harbors tyrosine and threonine phosphatase activities. Although mounting evidence argues for the importance of Eya’s phosphatase activities to mammalian biology, genetic rescue experiments in Drosophila have shown that the tyrosine phosphatase function is dispensable for normal development. In this study, we repeated these rescue experiments in genetically sensitized backgrounds in which the dose of one or more RDGN factor was reduced. Heterozygosity for sine oculis or dachshund, both core RDGN members, compromised the ability of phosphatase-dead eya, but not of the control wild type eya transgene, to rescue the retinal defects and reduced viability associated with eya loss. We speculate that Eya’s tyrosine phosphatase activity, although non-essential, confers robustness to RDGN output."
https://openalex.org/W2767876826,"Background Knee flexion contractures occur frequently in non-ambulatory, aged persons and persons with central nervous system lesions, rendering positioning and nursing care difficult. There are often risks associated with surgical interventions. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous needle tenotomy to lengthen the knee flexor muscles and improve passive function. Methods This was a retrospective study of all patients who underwent percutaneous needle tenotomy between 2012 and 2014. Tenotomy was carried out in the semi-tendinosus, biceps femoris and gracillis muscles under local anesthesia. The procedure took no more than 40 minutes. Range of motion (ROM) was evaluated immediately post-operatively and 3 months later. Results Thirty-four needle tenotomies were carried out. Mean lack of knee extension was 94.2° (range 35–120°) pre-op, (range 15–90°; p<0.05) immediately post-op and 50.1° (range 10–90°; p<0.05) three months later, thus a mean increase of 44.1° knee extension (range 0–90°). All care and positioning objectives were achieved. There were no complications and procedure-related pain was rated as 3-4/ 10. Conclusions Needle tenotomy was well tolerated and yielded a significant increase in ROM with no unwanted effects. All objectives were achieved. This technique could be used in an ambulatory care setting or within institutions for severely disabled individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2767988125,"Numerical simulations are fundamental to the development of medical imaging systems because they can save time and effort in research and development. In this study, we developed a method of creating the virtual projection images that are necessary to study dedicated breast computed tomography (BCT) systems. Anthropomorphic software breast phantoms of the conventional compression type were synthesized and redesigned to meet the requirements of dedicated BCT systems. The internal structure of the breast was randomly constructed to develop the proposed phantom, enabling the internal structure of a naturally distributed real breast to be simulated. When using the existing monochromatic photon incidence assumption for projection-image generation, it is not possible to simulate various artifacts caused by the X-ray spectrum, such as the beam hardening effect. Consequently, the system performance could be overestimated. Therefore, we considered the polychromatic spectrum in the projection image generation process and verified the results. The proposed method is expected to be useful for the development and optimization of BCT systems."
https://openalex.org/W2765680435,"This research investigated how accurately people infer what others are thinking after observing a brief sample of their behaviour and whether culture/similarity is a relevant factor. Target participants (14 British and 14 Mediterraneans) were cued to think about either positive or negative events they had experienced. Subsequently, perceiver participants (16 British and 16 Mediterraneans) watched videos of the targets thinking about these things. Perceivers (both groups) were significantly accurate in judging when targets had been cued to think of something positive versus something negative, indicating notable inferential ability. Additionally, Mediterranean perceivers were better than British perceivers in making such inferences, irrespective of nationality of the targets, something that was statistically accounted for by corresponding group differences in levels of independently measured collectivism. The results point to the need for further research to investigate the possibility that being reared in a collectivist culture fosters ability in interpreting others’ behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2767372018,"Endemic infections with the common avian pathogen Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) may incur a significant cost on the host population. In this study, we determined the potential of endemic Salmonella infections to reduce the reproductive success of blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great (Parus major) tits by correlating eggshell infection with reproductive parameters. The fifth egg of each clutch was collected from nest boxes in 19 deciduous forest fragments. Out of the 101 sampled eggs, 7 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were recovered. The low bacterial prevalence was reflected by a similarly low serological prevalence in the fledglings. In this study with a relatively small sample size, presence of Salmonella did not affect reproductive parameters (egg volume, clutch size, number of nestlings and number of fledglings), nor the health status of the fledglings. However, in order to clarify the impact on health and reproduction a larger number of samples have to be analyzed. Phage typing showed that the isolates belonged to the definitive phage types (DT) 193 and 99, and multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) demonstrated a high similarity among the tit isolates, but distinction to human isolates. These findings suggest the presence of passerine-adapted Salmonella strains in free-ranging tit populations with host pathogen co-existence."
https://openalex.org/W2767279474,"Peptidase inhibitors are key proteins involved in the control of peptidases. In arthropods, peptidase inhibitors modulate the activity of peptidases involved in endogenous physiological processes and peptidases of the organisms with which they interact. Exploring available arthropod genomic sequences is a powerful way to obtain the repertoire of peptidase inhibitors in every arthropod species and to understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the diversification of this kind of proteins. A genomic comparative analysis of peptidase inhibitors in species belonging to different arthropod taxonomic groups was performed. The results point out: i) species or clade-specific presence is shown for several families of peptidase inhibitors; ii) multidomain peptidase inhibitors are commonly found in many peptidase inhibitor families; iii) several families have a wide range of members in different arthropod species; iv) several peptidase inhibitor families show species-specific (or clade-specific) gene family expansions; v) functional divergence may be assumed for particular clades; vi) passive expansions may be used by natural selection to fix adaptations. In conclusion, conservation and divergence of duplicated genes and the potential recruitment as peptidase inhibitors of proteins from other families are the main mechanisms used by arthropods to fix diversity. This diversity would be associated to the control of target peptidases and, as consequence, to adapt to specific environments."
https://openalex.org/W2768045244,"Pentatricopeptide repeat proteins are one of the major protein families in flowering plants, containing around 450 members. They participate in RNA editing and are related to plant growth, development and reproduction, as well as to responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. Their characteristics have been described in silico; however, relatively little is known about their biochemical properties. Different types of PPR proteins, with different tasks in RNA editing, have been suggested to interact in an editosome to complete RNA editing. Other non-PPR editing factors, such as the multiple organellar RNA editing factors and the organelle RNA recognition motif-containing protein family, for example, have also been described in plants. However, while evidence on protein interactions between non-PPR RNA editing proteins is accumulating, very few PPR protein interactions have been reported; possibly due to their high instability. In this manuscript, we aimed to optimize the conditions for non-denaturing protein extraction of PPR proteins allowing in vivo protein analyses, such as interaction assays by co-immunoprecipitation. The unusually high protein degradation rate, the aggregation properties and the high pI, as well as the ATP-dependence of some PPR proteins, are key aspects to be considered when extracting PPR proteins in a non-denatured state. During extraction of PPR proteins, the use of proteasome and phosphatase inhibitors is critical. The use of the ATP-cofactor reduces considerably the degradation of PPR proteins. A short centrifugation step to discard cell debris is essential to avoid PPR precipitation; while in some cases, addition of a reductant is needed, probably caused by the pI/pH context. This work provides an easy and rapid optimized non-denaturing total protein extraction protocol from plant tissue, suitable for polypeptides of the PPR family."
