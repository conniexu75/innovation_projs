https://openalex.org/W1998217227,"Because aerobic metabolic rates decrease in hypoxia-sensitive cells under oxygen-limiting conditions, the demand for glucose or glycogen for anaerobic glycolysis may rise drastically as a means of making up for the energetic shortfall. However, ion and electrical potentials typically cannot be sustained because of energy insufficiency and high membrane permeabilities; therefore metabolic and membrane functions in effect become decoupled. In hypoxia-tolerant animals, these problems are resolved through a number of biochemical and physiological mechanisms; of these metabolic arrest and stabilized membrane functions are the most effective strategies for extending tolerance to hypoxia. Metabolic arrest is achieved by means of a reversed or negative Pasteur effect (reduced or unchanging glycolytic flux at reduced O2 availability); and coupling of metabolic and membrane function is achievable, in spite of the lower energy turnover rates, by maintaining membranes of low permeability (probably via reduced densities of ion-specific channels). The possibility of combining metabolic arrest with channel arrest has been recognized as an intervention strategy. To date, the success of this strategy has been minimal, mainly because depression of metabolism through cold is the usual arrest mechanism used, and hypothermia in itself perturbs controlled cell function in most endotherms."

A mouse hybridoma was produced that was specific to these proteins. Repeated cloning of the hybridoma did not separate the two reactivities. The p66/p51 was purified from HTLV-III lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to NH2-terminal Edman degradation. Single amino acid residues were obtained in 17 successive degradation cycles. The sequence determined was a perfect translation of the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the HTLV-III pol gene. The purified p66/51 had reverse transcriptase activity and the monoclonal immunoglobulin G specifically removed the enzyme activity from crude viral extract as well as purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2040681869,"Long-term cultures were established of HTLV-III-infected T4 cells from patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of T4 cells from normal donors after infection of the cells in vitro. By initially reducing the number of cells per milliliter of culture medium it was possible to grow the infected cells for 50 to 60 days. As with uninfected T cells, immunologic activation of the HTLV-III-infected cells with phytohemagglutinin led to patterns of gene expression typical of T-cell differentiation, such as production of interleukin-2 and expression of interleukin-2 receptors, but in the infected cells immunologic activation also led to expression of HTLV-III, which was followed by cell death. The results revealed a cytopathogenic mechanism that may account for T4 cell depletion in AIDS patients and suggest how repeated antigenic stimulation by infectious agents, such as malaria in Africa, or by allogeneic blood or semen, may be important determinants of the latency period in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2093561619,"We have characterized a 3547 bp DNA fragment from male-sterile (cms-T) maize mitochondria, designated TURF 2H3, selected because of its unique and abundant transcripts. Sequence analysis indicated that TURF 2H3 originated by recombinations among portions of the flanking and/or coding regions of the maize mitochondrial 26S ribosomal gene, the ATPase subunit 6 gene, and the chloroplast tRNA-Arg gene. TURF 2H3 contains two long open reading frames that could encode polypeptides of 12,961 Mr and 24,675 Mr. The larger open reading frame hybridizes to transcripts in all maize cytoplasms, the smaller to transcripts only in T cytoplasm. TURF 2H3 transcripts appear to be uniquely altered in cms-T plants restored to fertility by the nuclear restorer genes Rf1 and Rf2. A possible relationship between TURF 2H3, nuclear restorer genes, and the male sterility trait in T cytoplasm is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1605075022,"Tryptophan degradation in mice initiated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was characterized, taking advantage of its induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Our results demonstrated that in various tissues, N-formylkynurenine produced by the dioxygenase from tryptophan was rapidly hydrolyzed into kynurenine by a kynurenine formamidase, but it was not further metabolized. The localization in the liver and kidney of the kynurenine-metabolizing enzymes suggested that kynurenine thus formed was transported by the bloodstream to those two organs to be metabolized. In fact, the plasma kynurenine level increased in parallel with the induction of the dioxygenase by lipopolysaccharide, and kinetic analysis indicated that at the maximal induction of the enzyme there was a 3-fold increase in the kynurenine production. The major metabolic route of kynurenine was excretion in urine as xanthurenic acid. This increase in the kynurenine production was not explained by L-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase in the liver, because during the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the hepatic enzyme level was substantially suppressed. These findings indicated that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase actively oxidized tryptophan in mice and that its induction resulted in an increase in tryptophan degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1966708748,"Excised group II introns in yeast mitochondria appear as covalently closed circles under the electron microscope. We show that these circular molecules are branched and resemble the lariats arising through splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs in yeast and higher eukaryotes. One member of this intron class (aI5c in the gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) is capable of self-splicing in vitro, giving correct exon-exon ligation and resulting in the appearance of both linear and lariat forms of the excised intron. Nuclease digestion of the latter molecules reveals the presence of a complex oligonucleotide with the probable structure AGU, which thus resembles the branch point formed in the spliceosome-dependent reactions undergone by nuclear pre-mRNAs. Unlike group I introns, this group II intron is not demonstrably dependent on GTP for self-splicing and circularization of the isolated, linear intron is not observed. A model accounting for these observations is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2083442176,"Red blood cells that are infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum express new antigens on their surface. In a study of these antigens in the erythrocytes of naturally infected children in the Gambia, an antibody-mediated agglutination assay revealed an extreme degree of antigenic diversity. Serum samples from each of ten children in the convalescent stage of malaria infection reacted with infected cells from the same child but generally not with infected cells from the other children. The Gambian children's erythrocytes also expressed shared determinants: sera from Gambian adults often reacted with the surface of infected cells from all of the children and were shown by adsorption and elution experiments to contain antibodies that recognized several isolates. Conserved determinants exposed on infected erythrocytes may be important for development of antimalarial immunity either naturally or through vaccination."

https://openalex.org/W1505230657,"The interaction of human apolipoprotein (apo-) E3 with heparin was examined using heparin-Sepharose as a model system. The approach taken to determine the region of apo-E that is responsible for binding to heparin was to identify apo-E monoclonal antibodies that inhibited heparin binding, to determine the epitopes of the inhibiting antibodies, and finally to examine the heparin binding of fragments containing the inhibiting antibody epitopes. Three antibodies, designated 1D7, 6C5, and 3H1, were found to inhibit binding, suggesting that multiple heparin binding sites were present on apo-E. The epitopes of the inhibiting antibodies were determined by immunoblot analysis of synthetic or proteolytic fragments of apo-E. Measurement of the heparin binding activity of fragments containing epitopes of the inhibiting antibodies demonstrated that apo-E3 contains two heparin binding sites. The first site is located in the vicinity of residues 142-147 and coincides with the 1D7 epitope. The second binding site is contained in the carboxyl-terminal region of apo-E and is inhibited by 3H1, the epitope of which is located between residues 243 and 272. The epitope of the third inhibiting antibody, 6C5, is located at the amino terminus of apo-E; however, this antibody inhibits the second heparin binding site located in the carboxyl-terminal region. A head-to-tail association of apo-E, in which the 6C5 epitope and the second heparin binding site would be in close proximity, is proposed to account for this observation. In the lipid-free state both heparin binding sites on apo-E are expressed; however, when apo-E is complexed to phospholipid or on the surface of a lipoprotein particle, only the first binding site (residues 142-147) is expressed."

https://openalex.org/W2041669057,"Parathyroid hormone-like factors have been found in extracts of tumors associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, many of which are of squamous epithelial origin. Cultured, nonmalignant human keratinocytes were examined for the production of similar factors. Keratinocyte-conditioned medium from ten cultures stimulated the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in clonally derived rat osteosarcoma cells sensitive to parathyroid hormone. Bovine [Nle8,18, Tyr34]PTH-(3-34)NH2, a competitive inhibitor of parathyroid hormone, stopped the adenylate cyclase production stimulated by keratinocyte-conditioned medium, but antisera to parathyroid hormone had no effect on such adenylate cyclase activity. The active component of keratinocyte-conditioned medium has a molecular weight exceeding that of native parathyroid hormone. These characteristics are shared by the parathyroid hormone receptor agonists associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, which suggests that normal human keratinocytes may produce a factor related to that produced by malignant tumors associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W2016363821,"Calcium ions flow into cells through several distinct classes of voltage-dependent calcium-selective channels. Such fluxes play important roles in electrical signaling at the cell membrane and in chemical signaling within cells. Further information about calcium channels was obtained by injecting RNA isolated from rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle into Xenopus oocytes. Macroscopic currents through voltage-operated calcium channels were resolved when the endogenous calcium-dependent chloride current was blocked by replacing external calcium with barium and chloride with methanesulfonate. The resulting barium current was insensitive to tetrodotoxin but was completely blocked by cadmium or cobalt. With both heart and brain RNA at least two distinct types of calcium ion conductance were found, distinguishable by their time course and inactivation properties. In oocytes injected with heart RNA, the slowly inactivating component was selectively blocked by the calcium-channel antagonist nifedipine. Barium ion currents induced by heart RNA were modulated by isoproterenol, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1522569372,"The levels of DNA methyltransferase in nuclei from 9 tumorigenic and 9 nontumorigenic cell lines were examined. In all but 2 cases, the extractable methyltransferase activity was 4-3000-fold higher in tumorigenic than in nontumorigenic cells. Tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells from four species were grown in the presence of various concentrations (10(-8)-10(-6) M) of an inhibitor of the methylase enzyme, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dCyd). The reduction of 5-methylcytosine content in newly replicated DNA in the presence of 5-aza-dCyd was used to determine the relative methylase activity in each cell line. In all 4 cases, tumorigenic cells required larger doses of drug to inhibit DNA methylation to the same extent as their nontumorigenic counterparts. The relative rates of incorporation of [3H]5-aza-dCyd were determined for each cell line, and tumorigenic cells were shown to incorporate equal or greater amounts of 5-aza-dCyd into DNA compared to nontumorigenic cells. These results showed that the differences in the inhibition of DNA methylation in response to 5-aza-dCyd were not due to differences in the ability of these cells to incorporate the drug. Thus, it was demonstrated by two independent methods that tumorigenic cells contained higher levels of methylating capacity than nontumorigenic cells. This overabundance of methyltransferase may alter DNA methylation patterns and affect phenotypic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1588222095,"The effect of 8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin on the phosphorylation state and protein kinase activity of the insulin receptor was evaluated in cultured IM-9 lymphoblasts. 8-Bromo-cAMP (1 mM) or forskolin (10 microM) enhanced the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor purified from 32P-labeled cells by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody. In the absence of insulin, phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the receptor was increased approximately 2-fold by raising intracellular cAMP. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the beta subunit following treatment of cells with forskolin revealed an increase in phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor occurred on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and was diminished by prior exposure of cells to forskolin. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that forskolin did not enhance the turnover of phosphate on the receptor of cells previously exposed to insulin. Furthermore, extracts from forskolin-treated cells did not differ from control extracts in their capacity to dephosphorylate 32P-labeled receptor isolated from cells treated with insulin. The insulin-dependent tyrosine protein kinase activity of the receptor isolated from forskolin-treated cells was approximately 50% as active as the receptor isolated from either control or insulin-treated cells. This was assessed using both histone and a peptide synthesized in accordance with the deduced amino acid sequence of a potential autophosphorylation site of the human receptor (Thr-Arg-Asp-Ile-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Lys) as substrates for the protein kinase reaction. These results suggest that agents that raise intracellular cAMP increase phosphorylation of the insulin receptor on serine and threonine residues, reduce insulin-mediated receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues, and inhibit the insulin-dependent tyrosine protein kinase activity of the receptor. Thus cAMP may attenuate insulin action by altering the state of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1596631230,"In the present study we investigated the characteristics of the transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in an opossum kidney cell line endowed with parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors. In confluent epithelial cell culture, a Na-dependent Pi transport (NaPiT) was identified. Preincubation for 1 h with bovine (b)PTH(1-34) at 10(-7) M inhibited the NaPiT from 2.76 +/- 0.11 to 1.08 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein X 2 min-1 (p less than 0.001). This inhibition was already expressed 5 min after exposure to 10(-7) M bPTH. It was associated with a 4-fold increase in cellular cyclic AMP. The NaPiT was significantly inhibited at 10(-9) M bPTH, a hormonal concentration which stimulated the cellular cyclic AMP by only 30%. Kinetic analysis of the NaPiT inhibition by 10(-7) M bPTH revealed a decrease in Vmax (from 4.14 +/- 0.32 to 2.41 +/- 0.14 nmol/mg protein X 2 min-1) with no change in Km (0.093 +/- 0.016 versus 0.094 +/- 0.012 mM). The effect of bPTH on NaPiT was not associated with a change in the Na-dependent glucose methylglucopyranoside transport also present in the opossum kidney cell line. The inhibitory influence of bPTH on NaPiT was not affected by blockage of new protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Stimulation of cyclic AMP production by 10(-5) M forskolin, 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin, 10(-5) M prostaglandin E2 or addition of 10(-5) M dibutyryl cyclic AMP mimicked the PTH-induced reduction in NaPiT. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the opossum epithelial cell line is endowed with a Na-dependent Pi transport system which is selectively inhibited by PTH and agents which increase cyclic AMP production."
https://openalex.org/W1499632436,"RBL-2H3 cells (a tumor analog of rat mast cells) have plasma-membrane receptors that bind immunoglobulin E, which when aggregated, initiate degranulation. As in other systems, secretion is preceeded by enhanced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and by a rise in intracellular Ca2+. Unlike the responses of many other cells, however, both of these earlier events require extracellular Ca2+. The relationship of these events to each other and to the subsequent secretory process is thus unclear. By exposing cells to covalent oligomers of IgE one can demonstrate substantial increases in secretion of histamine by increasing the concentration and size of the oligomers or by using heavy water (D2O) in the medium. We have used such maneuvers to examine the quantitative relationships between aggregation of the receptors and the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and secretion. Our principal findings were: all treatments that increased secretion, correspondingly increased the changes that precede degranulation. These early events correlated with the degree of aggregation of the receptors even when the stimulatory conditions resulted in maximal secretion. Although the results were insufficient to prove that the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids is required for the rise in cytosolic Ca2+, the studies with D2O and other observations supported this view. Since a plasma-membrane ion channel for Ca2+ has been implicated in the IgE-mediated rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in RBL 2H3 cells, this in turn suggests a heretofore undescribed role for hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1564763556,"Cartilage proteoglycan monomers associate with hyaluronic acid to form proteoglycan aggregates. Link protein, a glycoprotein interacting with both hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan, serves to stabilize the aggregate structure. The primary structure of the link protein has been determined with a view to defining its interaction with both hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan. Thus, the link protein has been digested with staphylococcal V8 protease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin and the resulting peptides characterized by amino acid composition and sequence. We have determined that the link protein is a single peptide with 339 amino acid residues. The protein core has a molecular weight of 38,564. There is one N-linked oligosaccharide at residue 41 with a molecular weight of approximately 2,500. There are five disulfide bonds which define three loops within the amino acid sequence. The loop nearest to the NH2-terminal contains 78 amino acids and is followed by a section of 42 amino acids between it and the second loop. The second and third loops display considerable homology with each other; they consist of 71 and 70 amino acids, respectively, each contain two disulfide bonds, and both loops possess, approximately centrally, an epitope for the species nonspecific anti-link protein monoclonal antibody, 8A4. These loops are separated by a short section of 27 amino acids. We speculate that these loops are functionally important in the interaction of link protein with hyaluronic acid, as they appear to be the most conserved regions of link protein between species."

https://openalex.org/W1530103068,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against reduced and alkylated thrombospondin (TSP) were screened for the ability to react with Ca2+-replete TSP versus EDTA-treated TSP. Two mAbs designated A6.1 and D4.6 were found to react much more strongly with TSP after EDTA treatment. The dissociation constants for these mAbs were measured in 5 mM EDTA and found to be 6 X 10(-10) M for A6.1 and 7 X 10(-9) M for D4.6. Binding to A6.1 was undetectable in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ while binding of D4.6 occurred with about 100-fold lower affinity. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of A6.1 binding was broad with a midpoint near 50 microM free Ca2+ while that of D4.6 showed a sharp transition below 0.1 microM. Upon dialysis of EDTA-treated TSP into Ca2+ containing buffer, the binding of the mAbs was prevented or decreased, indicating reversibility of the conformational transition induced by the initial removal of Ca2+ . Mg2+ can compete with the Ca2+ binding sites involved in mAb binding, but TSP dialyzed from Ca2+ into Mg2+ binds the two mAbs as well as EDTA-treated TSP, indicating that Mg2+ cannot maintain the Ca2+-replete structure of TSP. The proteolytic fragments of TSP with which the two mAbs react were determined by probing Western blots of digests of TSP with the mAbs. A6.1 reacts with the 70-kDa fragment generated by chymotrypsin in EDTA which contains the interchain disulfide bonds of TSP and the binding site(s) for type V collagen (Mumby, S. M., Raugi, G. J., and Bornstein, P. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 98, 646-652). D4.6 reacts with fragments of 140 and 120 kDa found in digests of Ca2+-replete TSP which are absent from digests in EDTA. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed, carbon-coated replicas of TSP mAb complexes confirms the Ca2+ sensitivity of mAb binding and has been used to localize the epitopes for both mAbs on the three-dimensional structure of TSP."
https://openalex.org/W1966578377,"Nontransformed pre-B cells were induced to differentiate in vitro along several different but predictable pathways with only dendritic cells (DC) and conconavalin A-stimulated T lymphocytes. DC-T from spleen induced secretion of only IgM, whereas DC-T from Peyer's patches induced high levels of IgA and intermediate levels of IgM and IgG. Both the isotype of antibody secreted and the extent of pre-B cell differentiation were determined by the Iymphoid tissue source of DC, not of T cells. The pre-B cells synthesizing detectable levels of only the IgM heavy chain had cytoplasmic RNA transcripts from both light chain constant region genes and from the entire length of the heavy chain constant locus. In cells secreting IgM there were deletions in the DNA flanking the Cμ coding region."
https://openalex.org/W2012411101,"Reverse transcription intermediate forms (minus and plus strong-stop DNA) are detected in Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells for mobile dispersed genetic elements mdg1, mdg3, and mdg4 (gypsy). The mdg elements studied possess a common mechanism of reverse transcription, despite their structural differences, and the comparative analysis of intermediate forms proves that mdg elements pass the same stages of reverse transcription as retroviruses. The length of minus strong-stop DNA that locates the RNA start site coincides with the data obtained from S1 nuclease analysis of transcription initiation. S1 analysis has also revealed that mdg LTRs have a U3-R-U5 structure analogous to that of retroviral LTRs. Transcription of mdg1, mdg3, and mdg4 is initiated within or immediately after the same sequence TCAGTPy. Neither the TATA box nor the CAAT box can be found at their characteristic positions upstream of the 5' ends of mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1510393228,"Abstract NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2) is a widely distributed enzyme which promotes two-electron reductions of quinones and thereby protects cells against damage by reactive oxygen species generated during oxidative cycling of quinones and semiquinone radicals. Quinone reductase activity represents a minor component (about 0.006%) of mouse liver cytosolic proteins under basal (uninduced) conditions. Two isofunctional forms of this quinone reductase have been purified to homogeneity (1700-fold) in 30% yield from the liver cytosols of female CD-1 mice in which the enzymes were induced by administration of 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. The purification involved ion exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity chromatographies. The two enzyme forms have been designated and based on the order of elution from phenyl-Sepharose. The more abundant hydrophilic form has been crystallized in the presence of FAD in the form of macroscopic tetragonal crystals. The two forms have similar isoelectric points (pI 9.2) and subunit molecular weights (Mr = 30,000) and probably exist as dimers in the native state. Purified preparations of the enzymes are equiactive with NADH and NADPH and show almost complete dependence on added FAD for catalytic activity. The Km values for FAD of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic forms are 2.72 and 1.72 nM, respectively. Their catalytic activities are the same and are remarkably high for nicotinamide nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases; maximum velocities (expressed per mg of pure enzyme) approach 4000 units/mg of protein under appropriate assay conditions. When menadione is the electron acceptor, the Km value for this quinone is very low (Km congruent to 2 microM). Both enzyme forms are potently inhibited by dicoumarol. Rabbit antisera against the hydrophilic quinone reductase precipitate quantitatively the entire quinone reductase activity of mouse liver cytosols obtained from animals maintained on a standard diet or those induced with 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. The quinone reductase activity of rat liver cytosols is also quantitatively precipitated by this antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W1491505321,"Colicin B was isolated in pure form from cells of Escherichia coli that contained the colicin activity and immunity genes cloned on a multi-copy plasmid. Active colicin B consisted of a single polypeptide with Mr of about 60,000. The sequence of 44 amino acids from the amino-terminal portion is presented. The isoelectric point of the protein was at 4.5. Colicin B inhibited the membrane potential-dependent transport of proline and enhanced the uptake of alpha-methylglucoside via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Colicin B formed small, ion permeable channels with an average single-channel conductance of 13.7 pS (1 pS = 10(-12) siemens) in 1 M KCl. Channel formation was voltage-dependent in the pH range between 4.5 and 6. At pH 7 the channels were voltage independent. Voltage-dependent channels were only formed when the trans compartment (the protein was added to the cis compartment) was negative by at least 70 mV. Evidence for an asymmetric single channel conductance was obtained. With KCl a hyperbolic conductance-concentration relationship was observed. The conductance for monovalent cations was minimal for Li+ and was maximal for NH+4. The single channel conductance of colicin B was larger than that of colicin A as judged from lipid bilayer experiments under otherwise identical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1605221277,"The effects of inhibitors of protein synthesis upon transcription have been re-examined. Cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) inhibits incorporation of uridine into RNA of P1798.S20 lymphosarcoma cells. Filter hybridization studies indicate that labeling of pre-rRNA is inhibited 60-80% after 1 h and quantitative S1 nuclease mapping reveals a corresponding decrease in the amount of cellular pre-rRNA. Cycloheximide also inhibits labeling of 5 S RNA and tRNA, but incorporation of uridine into poly(A+) RNA is unaffected. Transcription experiments carried out in nuclei from cycloheximide-treated cells indicate that the inhibitor causes a selective decrease in the activity of RNA polymerases I and III. Cell-free extracts from P1798.S20 were used to transcribe the cloned mouse rRNA gene, Syrian hamster 5 S RNA gene, and the Drosophila tRNAArg gene. Extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells were inhibited in this respect. Transcription of rRNA and 5 S RNA genes was inhibited by 90% after 2 h and 50% inhibition occurred within 20-30 min. Transcription of the tRNA gene was inhibited 75% after 2 h with a half-time of approximately 1 h. Inhibition was due neither to a direct effect of cycloheximide nor to the presence of nucleases or diffusible inhibitors of transcription. Moreover, transcription of rDNA in extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells could be restored by the addition of a partially purified initiation factor preparation. The data indicate that inhibition of protein synthesis results in rapid depletion of transcription factors that are required for initiation by RNA polymerases I and III. Among these is the glucocorticoid-regulated rDNA initiation factor designated TFIC."
https://openalex.org/W1985071608,Nucleocapsid-pol fusion proteins have been detected by serological screening hepatocellular carcinoma tissues that contain hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. The existence of these fusion proteins suggests that HBV may synthesize its reverse transcriptase in a fashion analogous to the way that retroviruses synthesize and process a precursor. The accumulation of HBV reverse transcriptase intermediates in tumorous tissues and not in other tissues may be related to the absence of viral core particles and possibly contributes to tumor development.
https://openalex.org/W2071816183,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined for tyrosine kinase activity in vitro because this organism offers molecular and genetic approaches for analyzing the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular growth control that are unavailable in higher eukaryotes. Yeast extracts phosphorylated a random copolymer (glutamic acid:tyrosine, 80:20) at tyrosine in a reaction that was linear with respect to time and protein concentration. In the absence of added copolymer, phosphotyrosine was 0.1 percent of the total phosphoamino acids labeled with [γ-32P]adenosine triphosphate in endogenous yeast proteins. However, specific activities of these reactions were low (approximately 1 percent of those in extracts of chick embryo fibroblasts). Lack of significant incorporation of label from [α-32P]adenosine triphosphate into the copolymer or endogenous yeast proteins demonstrated that nucleotide interconversion, adenylylation, and subsequent hydrolysis could not account for the generation of phosphotyrosine observed."
https://openalex.org/W1481566685,"Sodium butyrate is very often used to alter gene expression in cultured cells. In this study, we examined the effects of this compound on various cellular events in WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts in culture. During a 16-20-h treatment at sodium butyrate concentrations of between 5 and 20 mM, no adverse effects on cell morphology were observed. However, cell division and DNA synthesis were reversibly inhibited, the latter by 85, 80, and 70% at sodium butyrate concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mM, respectively. Although overall protein synthetic activity was not significantly affected, RNA synthesis decreased to 76% of the control values at a sodium butyrate concentration of 5 mM. Butyrate treatment also caused hypermethylation of DNA cytosines as determined by differential digestion by MspI/HpaII restriction endonucleases and by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the DNA. The 5-methylcytosine content of the DNA in untreated WI-38 fibroblasts was 2.94 +/- 0.46% of total cytosine residues, while in cultures treated with 5, 10, and 20 mM sodium butyrate, these values were 5.76 +/- 0.28, 5.91 +/- 0.37, and 6.8 +/- 0.44%, respectively. An interesting feature is that this hypermethylation occurred in DNA which was synthesized in the presence of sodium butyrate (newly synthesized) as well as in DNA which had been synthesized before butyrate administration (pre-existing DNA). The hypermethylated state was conserved only in the former situation, since the methylcytosines were rapidly lost in the subsequent generation in the latter case. It would therefore appear that methylcytosines are maintained after cell replication only if they are generated on newly synthesized DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1642066185,"Abstract We have characterized the 5' and 3' regions of the human albumin gene with respect to nucleotide sequences, mRNA transcription initiation and polyadenylation. There are at least two transcription initiation sites and two polyadenylation sites in the human albumin gene. The multiple transcription initiation sites are utilized almost equally. The two polyadenylation sites are used differentially, with the site proximal to the protein termination codon dominating. The TATA and the CCAAT boxes are present at about 30 and 90 nucleotides upstream of the putative cap sites. About 250 nucleotides immediately 5' to the transcription initiation sites are highly conserved among the human, rat, and chicken. Within the 1-kilobase pair 5' flanking region of the human albumin gene there are 8- and 35-base pair alternating purine/pyrimidine sequences, primarily consisting of dG and dT, and three nucleotide segments exhibiting homology to the proposed progesterone receptor-binding site. In these and other characteristics, the 5' flanking region of the human albumin gene is distinct from the corresponding region of the human alpha-fetoprotein gene. Each of the two polyadenylation sites of the human albumin gene is preceded by a AATAAA hexamer. In addition, the first polyadenylation site has several conserved sequences believed to play a role in the 3'-end formation. The second polyadenylation site lacks these signals which may explain why it is used less frequently. In spite of these differences the two polyadenylation sites show a high overall sequence similarity, suggesting that they arose by duplication. There is no major difference between the normal liver and hepatoma cells in the relative utilization of multiple sites for transcriptional initiation and polyadenylation of the human albumin gene, suggesting that the albumin mRNA polymorphism has no direct relevance to hepatocarcinogenesis."

These components can be used to reconstitute active hybrid enzyme complexes with purified subunits from E. coli RNAase P. The RNA in the HeLa cell fractions employed is enriched for species between 85 and 115 nucleotides long. This reconstitution assay is a convenient means of purifying the functional RNA and protein of HeLa cell RNAase P. Probes derived from the genes for the subunits of E. coli RNAase P hybridize to genomic DNA of gram-negative prokaryotic organisms, but no positive signals are seen with genomic DNA from a variety of eukaryotic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1533306569,"Sodium enters tight epithelia across the apical plasma membrane through a sodium channel, a process inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of amiloride and benzamil. Using membrane vesicles from bovine kidney cortex, we found that sodium transport through the sodium channel was inhibited by benzamil with an IC50 of 4 nM. Amiloride (IC50 = 400 nM) was a weaker inhibitor of sodium transport. [3H]Benzamil bound to the vesicles at a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 5 nM, the similarity of which to the IC50 suggests that these binding sites are associated with the sodium channel. Amiloride displaced bound [3H]benzamil with a Ki of 2,500 nM. Bromobenzamil is a photoactive amiloride analog with potency similar to benzamil in inhibiting sodium transport (IC50 = 5 nM) and binding to the sodium channel (Kd = 6 nM). [3H]Bromobenzamil was specifically photoincorporated into three molecular weight classes of polypeptides with apparent Mr values of 176,000, 77,000, and 47,000. The photoincorporation of [3H]bromobenzamil into these three classes of polypeptides was blocked by addition of excess benzamil and by amiloride in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that these polypeptides are components of the epithelial sodium channel."

https://openalex.org/W1565958037,"Abstract A cDNA clone for muscle adenylate kinase was isolated from a cDNA library of chick skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA, and the DNA sequence was determined. The cDNA insert had 854 nucleotides, which consisted of the 5'-untranslated sequence of 57 nucleotides, the sequence of 582 nucleotides coding for 194 amino acids, and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 163 nucleotides and the poly(A) tail of 52 nucleotides. The amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence was highly homologous with the reported sequences of human, calf, porcine, and rabbit muscle adenylate kinases. RNA blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from various chicken tissues revealed a single species of mRNA of approximately 850 nucleotides and its tissue-specific distribution. The induction of muscle adenylate kinase mRNA synthesis during the chick embryogenesis was also demonstrated by the blot analysis. Southern blot analysis indicated a single gene for muscle adenylate kinase in the chicken genome."
https://openalex.org/W1605837584,"Abstract Crystalline, alpha-glucosidase-free sweet potato beta-amylase was found to catalyze hydration of the enolic bond of maltal (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-2-deoxy-D-glucal) to form 2-deoxymaltose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). The reaction at pH 5.0 showed Vmax 0.082 mumol/min/mg and km 94.5 mM. An exceptionally large solvent deuterium isotope effect, VH/VD = 8, was observed from pH(pD) 4.2 to 5.4; and at pH(pD) 5.0 the effect was found to be directly related to the mole fraction of 2H. The hydration product, isolated from a beta-amylase/maltal digest in acetate-d4/D2O buffer (pD 5.4) was identified through its 1H NMR spectrum as alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-2-deoxy-D-[2(a)-2H]glucose. beta-Amylase in 2H2O thus catalyzes deuteration of the double bond of maltal from a direction opposite that assumed for protonation of the glycosidic oxygen atoms of starch chains and maltosaccharides. This finding confirms the functional flexibility of the enzyme's catalytic groups first demonstrated in studies of the reactions catalyzed with alpha- and beta-maltosyl fluoride (Hehre, E. J., Brewer, C. F., and Genghof, D. S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5942-5950). A possible mechanism of the maltal hydration by beta-amylase involves protonation of substrate from above as the first and rate-limiting step, followed by formation of a transient carbonium ion-enzyme intermediate. Although other possible mechanisms cannot be ruled out, it is clear that this hydration reaction differs from reactions catalyzed with amylaceous substrates and with alpha- and beta-maltosyl fluoride. The ability of beta-amylase to catalyze different types of reactions with different substrates is discussed with respect to observations with other enzymes that, likewise, strongly support the view (Hehre et al.) that the catalytic groups of glycosylases in general may be functionally flexible beyond requirements of the principle of microscopic reversibility."
https://openalex.org/W1595028897,"The metabolism and mode of action of the anti-herpes compound buciclovir [R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-guanine, BCV) has been studied in herpes simplex virus-infected and uninfected Vero cells. In uninfected cells, a low and constant concentration of intracellular BCV was found, while in herpes simplex virus-infected cells, an increasing concentration of BCV phosphates was found due to metabolic trapping. The major phosphorylation product was BCV triphosphate (BCVTP) which was 92% of the total amount of BCV phosphates. BCV phosphates were accumulated to the same extent in cells infected with either a herpes simplex virus type 1 or a herpes simplex virus type 2 strain while thymidine kinase-deficient mutants of herpes simplex virus type 1 were 10 times less efficient in accumulating BCV phosphates. In uninfected Vero cells, the concentration of the phosphorylated forms of BCV was less than 1% of that found in herpes simplex virus-infected cells. The BCVTP formed in herpes simplex virus-infected cells was highly stable, as 80% of the amount of BCVTP was still present even 17 h after removal of extracellular BCV. BCV was a good substrate for herpes simplex virus type 1- and type 2-induced thymidine kinases but not for the cellular cytosol or mitochondrial thymidine kinases. BCV monophosphate could be phosphorylated by cellular guanylate kinase to BCV diphosphate. BCVTP was a selective and competitive inhibitor to deoxyguanosine triphosphate of the purified herpes simplex virus type 1- and type 2-induced DNA polymerases. BCVTP could neither act as an alternative substrate in the herpes simplex virus type 2 or cellular DNA polymerase reactions, nor could [3H]BCV monophosphate be detected in DNA formed by herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA polymerase, or be detected in nucleic acids extracted from herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells. These data indicate that BCVTP may inhibit the herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase without being incorporated into DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1783959144,"Dissociation of alpha beta and alpha gamma dimers of human hemoglobins (Hb) A and F into monomers was studied by alpha chain exchange (Shaeffer, J. R., McDonald, M. J., Turci, S. M., Dinda, D. M., and Bunn, H. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14544-14547). Unlabeled carbonmonoxy-Hb A was incubated with trace amounts of preparatively purified, native, 3H-alpha subunits in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees C. At appropriate times, free alpha monomers were separated from Hb A tetramers by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Transfer of radioactivity from the alpha chain pool into Hb A was measured, yielding a first order dimer dissociation rate constant, k2 = (3.2 +/- 0.3) X 10(-3) h-1. The Arrhenius plot of k2 was linear between 7 and 37 degrees C, yielding an enthalpy of activation of 23 kcal/alpha beta dimer. As the chloride concentration was raised from 0 to 0.2 M, the dissociation rate increased 3-fold; with higher salt concentrations, however, the rate gradually returned to baseline. This rate was not altered by raising the pH from 6.5 to 7.2, but as pH was further raised to 8.4, kappa 2 increased about 3-fold. Hb F, which has an increased stability at alkaline pH, dissociated into alpha and gamma monomers 3 times more slowly than Hb A. Moreover, the dimer-monomer dissociation of Hb F was characterized by a significantly reduced pH dependence. These results demonstrate that both alpha beta and alpha gamma dimers of Hb A and Hb F dissociate reversibly into monomers under physiologic conditions. The differential pH dependence for dimer dissociation between Hb A and Hb F suggests that specific amino acid replacement at the alpha 1 gamma 1 interface confers increased resistance to alkaline denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1573437712,"An antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF), capable of activating its tyrosine kinase has been produced. Antibody 2913 recognizes only the cytoplasmic portion of the EGF receptor in A431 carcinoma cells, in normal human fibroblasts, and in a variety of other human tumor cell lines (Xu, Y.-A., Richert, N., Ito, S., Merlino, G. T., and Pastan, I. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 7308-7313). Indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy show that the antibody binds to intact cells only after membrane permeabilization. Moreover the antibody immunoprecipitates the v-erb-B gene product in avian myeloblastosis virus-infected cells but does not recognize the secreted form (105 kDa) of the A431 cell EGF receptor which lacks the cytoplasmic domain. Antibody 2913 activates the EGF receptor kinase in solubilized A431 membranes causing autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues only. Tryptic peptide maps suggest that antibody 2913 and EGF stimulate phosphorylation of the same amino acid residues. By electron microscopy, the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor was followed throughout its endocytotic pathway. The results show that the kinase domain is rapidly degraded in lysosomes with no accumulation in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1587240085,"Abstract Entry of prebound diphtheria toxin at low pH occurred rapidly in the presence of isotonic NaCl, NaBr, NaSCN, NaI, and NaNO3, but not in the presence of Na2SO4, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid neutralized with Tris, or in buffer osmotically balanced with mannitol. SCN- was the most efficient anion to facilitate entry. Uptake studies with radioactively labeled anions showed that SCN- was transported into cells 3 times faster than Cl-, while the entry of SO2-4 occurred much more slowly. The anion transport inhibitors 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and piretanide inhibited entry at low pH even in the presence of permeant anions. When cells with bound toxin were exposed to low pH in the absence of permeant anions, then briefly exposed to neutral pH and subsequently exposed to pH 4.5 in the presence of isotonic NaCl, toxin entry was induced. The data indicate that efficient anion transport at the time of exposure to low pH is required for entry of surface-bound diphtheria toxin into the cytosol. Since insertion of diphtheria toxin into the membrane occurs even in the absence of permeant anions, the results indicate that low pH is required not only for insertion of fragment B into the membrane, but also for the subsequent entry of fragment A into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1520550605,"Two species of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease have been purified approximately 400-fold from extracts of Drosophila embryos. AP endonuclease I, which flows through phosphocellulose columns, has an apparent subunit molecular weight of 66,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas AP endonuclease II, which is retained by phosphocellulose, has a subunit molecular weight of 63,000. The molecular weight determinations were made possible in part by the finding that both Drosophila enzymes, along with Escherichia coli endonuclease IV, cross-react with an antibody prepared toward a human AP endonuclease (Kane, C. M., and Linn, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3405-3414). The nature of phosphodiester bond breaks produced by the two partially purified AP endonucleases from Drosophila have been investigated. Nicks introduced into partially depurinated PM2 DNA by Drosophila AP endonuclease I did not support DNA synthesis by E. coli DNA polymerase I, whereas nicks created by AP endonuclease II were able to support DNA synthesis, but at a rate far less than that observed for nicks introduced by E. coli endonuclease IV. The priming activity of DNA incised by either of the Drosophila enzymes can be enhanced, however, by an additional incubation with E. coli endonuclease IV, which is known to cleave depurinated DNA on the 5'-side of an apurinic site. These results suggest that the Drosophila enzymes cleave depurinated DNA on the 3'-side of the apurinic site. This suggestion was strengthened by the observation that the combined action of AP endonuclease II and E. coli endonuclease IV resulted in the removal of [32P]dAMP from partially depyrimidinated [dAMP-5'-32P,uracil-3H]poly(dA-dT). Taken together, these results propose that Drosophila AP endonuclease II produces 3'-deoxyribose and 5'-phosphomonoester nucleotide termini. Conversely, the absolute inability to detect priming activity for DNA cleaved by AP endonuclease I alone suggested a different mechanism, possibly the formation of a deoxyribose-3'-phosphate terminus. When apurinic DNA cleaved by AP endonuclease I was subsequently treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, DNA synthesis was now detected at levels similar to that observed for AP endonuclease II alone. Additionally, DNA nicked by AP endonuclease I was susceptible to 5'-end labeling by polynucleotide T4 kinase without prior phosphomonoesterase treatment. These results suggest that AP endonuclease I forms deoxyribose 3'-phosphate and 5'-OH termini upon cleaving depurinated DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1506679044,"Abstract 5 S RNA interactions with transcription factor protein A (TFIIIA) in 7 S particles from Xenopus laevis oocytes (Xlo) have been characterized by the use of an in vitro RNA exchange assay. 32P-labeled Xlo 5 S RNA can rapidly be incorporated into 7 S particles by simple incubation of the RNA with intact particles. Incorporation of the labeled RNA during exchange reaches an equilibrium within 20 min at 20 degrees C. Labeled Xlo 5 S RNA already incorporated in 7 S particles can be chased out by an excess of unlabeled 5 S RNA. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of 7 S particle samples segregates several ribonucleoprotein particles containing TFIIIA and 5 S RNA. Time course experiments reveal incorporation of 32P-labeled 5 S RNA first in a higher molecular weight ribonucleoprotein particle before incorporation into the 7 S particle. In the exchange process, the integrity of the higher order structure of the RNA is essential for a recognition of the 5 S RNA by TFIIIA. Denatured Xlo 5 S RNA exchanges poorly in the presence of EDTA, but can exchange into the particle at a high level if sufficient divalent cations are present to allow the higher order structure of the RNA to reform. Xlo 5 S RNA fragments that have the 5' or 3' ends deleted past helix I markedly lose their ability to exchange. Heterologous eukaryotic and eubacterial 5 S RNAs can exchange into 7 S particles, although the eubacterial 5 S RNAs exchange at a low level."

The first protein (37 kd) is a hybrid containing the N-terminus of large T-Ag and the hydrophobic C-terminus of middle T-Ag. The latter domain is responsible for membrane association, even in the 37 kd hybrid protein. The second protein (43 kd), which contains the N-terminal 75% of middle T-Ag, has an associated protein kinase activity and forms a complex with c-src, but cannot induce a transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1516187847,"The basolateral segment of the rat renal tubular plasma membrane possesses Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity which was independent of Mg2+. Two kinetic forms were found: one, was a high affinity (apparent Km for free Ca2+ of 172 nM) low capacity (Vmax of 144 nmol of Pi X min-1 mg-1 protein) type; the other, had low affinity (apparent Km of 25 microM) and high capacity (896 nmol of Pi X min-1 X mg-1 protein). Mg2+ inhibited both Ca2+-ATPases. The high affinity enzyme exhibited positive cooperativity with respect to ATP, with a n value of 1.6. Ca2+-ATPase activity was not affected by calmodulin and was not inhibited by vanadate. On the other hand, both high and low affinity Ca2+-ATPase activities were increased when 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was given to vitamin D-deficient rats. Kinetically, the enhanced activities were due to an increase in the Vmax values; the apparent affinities for free Ca2+ were not changed. The physiological function of the vitamin D-sensitive, Mg+-independent, Ca2+-ATPase activities remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1594285226,"Antibodies against synthetic peptides derived from the DNA sequence of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) have been tested for their capacity to immunoprecipitate the whole enzyme complex. Antibodies against the COOH-terminal undecapeptide of COII (anti-COII-C), when incubated with a Triton X-100 mitochondrial lysate from HeLa cells pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine under conditions selective for mitochondrial protein synthesis and chased for 18 h in unlabeled medium, precipitated the pulse-labeled three largest subunits (mitochondrially synthesized) of cytochrome c oxidase in proportions close to equimolarity. Antibodies against the NH2-terminal decapeptide of COII (anti-COII-N), although equally reactive as the anti-COII-C antibodies with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized COII, did not precipitate any of the three labeled subunits from the Triton X-100 mitochondrial lysate. In other experiments, all the 13 subunits which have been identified in the mammalian cytochrome c oxidase were immunoprecipitated from a Triton X-100 mitochondrial lysate of cells long-term labeled with [35S]methionine by anti-COII-C antibodies, but not by anti-COII-N antibodies. By contrast, in immunoblots of total mitochondrial proteins dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate, the anti-COII-C antibodies reacted specifically only with COII. These results strongly suggest that, in the native cytochrome c oxidase complex, the epitope recognized by the anti-COII-C antibodies is in the COII subunit and that, therefore, in such complex, the COOH-terminal peptide of COII is exposed to antibodies, whereas the NH2-terminal peptide is not accessible."
https://openalex.org/W1486688825,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle was labeled with a limited (0.625 nmol/mg sarcoplasmic reticulum protein) amount of the fluorescent thiol reagent N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)maleimide (DACM). The fluorescence intensity of the membrane-attached DACM decreased concurrently with (Ca2+ and caffeine)-induced Ca2+ release, depolarization-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+-dependent dependent passive efflux of Ca2+. The decreased DACM fluorescence level initiated by a Ca2+ jump was subsequently reversed under passive efflux conditions when there was no ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake, suggesting spontaneous closing of the channels. Therefore, the higher fluorescence level corresponds to a larger population of closed channels, whereas the lower level represents a larger population of opened channels. Under conditions when the Ca2+ release-coupled fluorescence change was maximal, a stoichiometric incorporation of DACM took place only into a 32-kDa protein. Furthermore, reconstituted vesicles, in which purified DACM-labeled 32-kDa protein was incorporated into unlabeled sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, were capable of both (Ca2+ and caffeine)-induced Ca2+ release and the release-coupled DACM fluorescence change. These results suggest that the 32-kDa protein is a constituent of the Ca2+ release channel or a protein which is in close contact with the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1583688826,"Hamster liver post-nuclear membranes catalyze the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to endogenous dolichyl phosphate and to a second major endogenous acidic lipid. This mannolipid was believed to be synthesized from endogenous retinyl phosphate and was tentatively identified as retinyl phosphate mannose (Ret-P-Man) (De Luca, L. M., Brugh, M. R. Silverman-Jones, C. S. and Shidoji, Y. (1982) Biochem. J. 208, 159-170). To characterize this endogenous mannolipid in more detail, we isolated and purified the mannolipid from incubations containing hamster liver membranes and GDP-[14C]mannose and compared its properties to those of authentic Ret-P-Man. We found that the endogenous mannolipid was separable from authentic Ret-P-Man on a Mono Q anion exchange column, did not exhibit the absorbance spectrum characteristic of a retinol moiety, and was stable to mild acid under conditions which cleave authentic Ret-P-Man. The endogenous mannolipid was sensitive to mild base hydrolysis and mannose was released from the mannolipid by snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion. These properties were consistent with the endogenous acceptor being phosphatidic acid. Addition of exogenous phosphatidic acid, but not phospholipids with a head group blocking the phosphate moiety, to incubations containing hamster liver membranes and GDP-[14C]mannose resulted in the synthesis of a mannolipid with chromatographic and physical properties identical to the endogenous mannolipid. A double-labeled mannolipid was synthesized in incubations containing hamster liver membranes, GDP-[14C]mannose, and [3H]phosphatidic acid. Mannosyl transfer to exogenous phosphatidic acid was saturable with increasing concentrations of phosphatidic acid and GDP-mannose and specific for glycosyl transfer from GDP-mannose. Class E Thy-1-negative mutant mouse lymphoma cell membranes, which are defective in dolichyl phosphate mannose synthesis, also fail to transfer mannose from GDP-mannose to exogenous phosphatidic acid or retinyl phosphate. Amphomycin, an inhibitor of dolichyl phosphate mannose synthesis, blocked mannosyl transfer to the endogenous lipid, and to exogenous retinyl phosphate and phosphatidic acid. We conclude that the same mannosyltransferase responsible for dolichyl phosphate mannose synthesis can also utilize in vitro exogenous retinyl phosphate and phosphatidic acid as well as endogenous phosphatidic acid as mannosyl acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1491933886,"Abstract The Saccharomyces cerevisiae syn- mitochondrial mutant G116-40 isolated by Berlani et al. (Berlani, R. E., Pentella, C., Macino, G., and Tzagoloff, A. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 141, 1086-1097) is shown to have a mutation in the tyrosyl-tRNA gene by genetic data combined with restriction analysis and DNA sequencing of the appropriate rho- mitochondrial DNAs derived from wild-type and mutant strains. The new region sequenced spans 685 base pairs located between 9.5 and 10.4 map units, the gene being located at 10.0 units. The tRNA structure, as deduced from the DNA sequence, is in agreement with the data derived from sequencing the purified tyrosyl-tRNA reported by Sibler et al. (Sibler, A., Dirheimer, G., and Martin, R.P. (1983) FEBS Lett. 152, 153-156). No in vitro tyrosyl-tRNA aminoacylation could be detected using mitochondrial RNA from the mutant. S1 nuclease mapping experiments showed that the mutant produces a transcript that is identical to the wild-type at its 5'-end. The same analysis carried out with the mitochondrial RNA from a rho- strain with the tyrosyl-tRNA region of mitochondrial DNA reveals a 5'-end shorter by about 3 nucleotides. The mutant gene has a single substitution (C----T) at the penultimate nucleotide near the 3'-end of the molecule creating an acceptor stem that lacks the two terminal Watson-Crick base pairs."
