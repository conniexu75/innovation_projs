https://openalex.org/W3025780063,"The Glymphatic System (GS) has been proposed as a mechanism to clear brain tissue from waste. Its dysfunction might lead to several brain pathologies, including the Alzheimer’s disease. A key component of the GS and brain tissue water circulation is the astrocyte which is regulated by acquaporin-4 (AQP4), a membrane-bound water channel on the astrocytic end-feet. Here we investigated the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocyte activity in a mouse brain model through the inhibition of AQP4 channels with TGN-020. Upon TGN-020 injection, we observed a significant decrease in the Sindex, a diffusion marker of tissue microstructure, and a significant increase of the water diffusion coefficient (sADC) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to saline injection. These results indicate the suitability of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocytic activity in vivo and non-invasively."
https://openalex.org/W3025908968,"Literature-based Discovery (LBD) aims to discover new knowledge automatically from large collections of literature. Scientific literature is growing at an exponential rate, making it difficult for researchers to stay current in their discipline and easy to miss knowledge necessary to advance their research. LBD can facilitate hypothesis testing and generation and thus accelerate scientific progress. Neural networks have demonstrated improved performance on LBD-related tasks but are yet to be applied to it. We propose four graph-based, neural network methods to perform open and closed LBD. We compared our methods with those used by the state-of-the-art LION LBD system on the same evaluations to replicate recently published findings in cancer biology. We also applied them to a time-sliced dataset of human-curated peer-reviewed biological interactions. These evaluations and the metrics they employ represent performance on real-world knowledge advances and are thus robust indicators of approach efficacy. In the first experiments, our best methods performed 2-4 times better than the baselines in closed discovery and 2-3 times better in open discovery. In the second, our best methods performed almost 2 times better than the baselines in open discovery. These results are strong indications that neural LBD is potentially a very effective approach for generating new scientific discoveries from existing literature. The code for our models and other information can be found at: https://github.com/cambridgeltl/nn_for_LBD."
https://openalex.org/W3025265821,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection elicits the production of cytotoxic amyloids from lung endothelium, yet molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction that underlie the amyloid production are not well understood. We examined the importance of type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors in the production of cytotoxic amyloids. P aeruginosa possessing a functional T3SS and effectors induced the production and release of cytotoxic amyloids from lung endothelium, including beta amyloid, and tau. T3SS effector intoxication was sufficient to generate cytotoxic amyloid release, yet intoxication with exoenzyme Y (ExoY) alone or together with exoenzymes S and T (ExoS/T/Y) generated the most virulent amyloids. Infection with lab and clinical strains engendered cytotoxic amyloids that were capable of being propagated in endothelial cell culture and passed to naïve cells, indicative of a prion strain. Conversely, T3SS-incompetent P aeruginosa infection produced non-cytotoxic amyloids with antimicrobial properties. These findings provide evidence that (1) endothelial intoxication with ExoY is sufficient to elicit self-propagating amyloid cytotoxins during infection, (2) pulmonary endothelium contributes to innate immunity by generating antimicrobial amyloids in response to bacterial infection, and (3) ExoY contributes to the virulence arsenal of P aeruginosa through the subversion of endothelial amyloid host-defense to promote a lung endothelial-derived cytotoxic proteinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3025651738,"Acute infections of the middle ear are the most commonly treated childhood diseases. Because complications affect children’s language learning and cognitive processes, it is essential to diagnose these diseases in a timely and accurate manner. The prevailing literature suggests that it is difficult to accurately diagnose these infections, even for experienced ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Advanced care practitioners (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician assistants) serve as first-line providers in many primary care settings and may benefit from additional guidance to appropriately determine the diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases. For this purpose, we designed a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system (called OtoMatch) for normal, middle ear effusion, and tympanostomy tube conditions, operating on eardrum images captured with a digital otoscope. We present a method that enables the conversion of any convolutional neural network (trained for classification) into an image retrieval model. As a proof of concept, we converted a pre-trained deep learning model into an image retrieval system. We accomplished this by changing the fully connected layers into lookup tables. A database of 454 labeled eardrum images (179 normal, 179 effusion, and 96 tube cases) was used to train and test the system. On a 10-fold cross validation, the proposed method resulted in an average accuracy of 80.58% (SD 5.37%), and maximum F1 score of 0.90 while retrieving the most similar image from the database. These are promising results for the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a CBIR system for eardrum images using the newly proposed methodology."
https://openalex.org/W3021038269,"Unlike the studies of freshmen entrants, the learning experiences of community college transfer (CCT) students in the receiving university is a topic that has only started to gain attention in recent decades. Little is known about the differences between CCT and freshmen entrants with regard to their study workload stress and its relationship with their perceptions of the teaching and learning environment, approaches to learning, self-efficacy and generic skills. The purpose of our study was to address this gap. This was a cross-sectional survey study conducted from April 2018 to November 2018 in a university in Hong Kong. The HowULearn questionnaire was adapted to local usage and validated for data collection. In total, 841 CCT students and 978 freshmen entrants completed the survey. The respondents were aged between 19 and 52 years (mean = 21.6, SD = 1.92), and 66.0% were women. The HowULearn questionnaire was determined by factor analyses to have eight factors. The reliabilities of the eight factors were found to be acceptable (Cronbach alphas = 0.709-0.918). The CCT students scored significantly higher than the freshmen entrants for perceived study workload stress and surface approaches to learning, but lower on teaching for understanding & encouraging learning, peer support, and self-efficacy beliefs. The surface approach to learning, deep & organized studying, alignment & constructive feedback, and generic skills were found to be predictors of study workload stress in both groups of students, and in the overall student data. This study has shown that CCT students and freshmen entrants differed with regard to their study workload stress and learning experiences. Our findings provide a message, both for educators in higher education and policy makers in the government-there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to different student populations when it comes to enhancing their learning experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3025797021,"Background Sleep problems have become the most common complaints among the elderly. There are a few studies that explored the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its associated factors among the elderly in nursing homes. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its associated factors among the Chinese elderly in nursing homes. Methods A total of 817 elderly residents, from 24 nursing homes, were included in this cross-sectional study. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI >5. Multiple binary logistic regression was used to estimate the strength of the association between risk factors and poor sleep quality in terms of adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and interactions of risk factors for poor sleep quality were also examined. Results The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 67.3% (95% CI: 64.0, 70.5%) among the Chinese elderly in nursing homes. Multiple binary logistic regression results showed that participants with the following characteristics had an increased risk of poor sleep quality after adjustments for other confounders: being 70–79 years old (AOR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.92) or 80 years old and above (AOR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.68, 4.24); having one to two kinds of chronic diseases (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39, 3.01) or three or more kinds of chronic diseases (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.39, 4.00); depression symptoms (AOR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.11), anxiety symptoms (AOR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.18), and social support(AOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99). Additive interactions were detected between age and anxiety symptoms (AOR: 8.34, 95% CI: 4.43, 15.69); between chronic disease and anxiety symptoms (AOR: 8.61, 95% CI; 4.28, 17.31); and between social support and anxiety symptoms (AOR: 6.43, 95% CI: 3.22, 12.86). Conclusions The prevalence of poor sleep quality among the elderly in nursing homes is relatively high. Besides, anxiety symptoms has additive interactions with age, chronic disease and social support for poor sleep quality. These findings have significant implications for interventions that aim to improve sleep quality among elderly residents in nursing homes."
https://openalex.org/W3024050217,"During mammalian blastocyst development, inner cell mass (ICM) cells differentiate into epiblast (Epi) or primitive endoderm (PrE). These two fates are characterized by the expression of the transcription factors NANOG and GATA6, respectively. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of NANOG and GATA6 expressing cells in the ICM of the mouse blastocysts with quantitative three-dimensional single cell-based neighbourhood analyses. We define the cell neighbourhood by local features, which include the expression levels of both fate markers expressed in each cell and its neighbours, and the number of neighbouring cells. We further include the position of a cell relative to the centre of the ICM as a global positional feature. Our analyses reveal a local three-dimensional pattern that is already present in early blastocysts: 1) Cells expressing the highest NANOG levels are surrounded by approximately nine neighbours, while 2) cells expressing GATA6 cluster according to their GATA6 levels. This local pattern evolves into a global pattern in the ICM that starts to emerge in mid blastocysts. We show that FGF/MAPK signalling is involved in the three-dimensional distribution of the cells and, using a mutant background, we further show that the GATA6 neighbourhood is regulated by NANOG. Our quantitative study suggests that the three-dimensional cell neighbourhood plays a role in Epi and PrE precursor specification. Our results highlight the importance of analysing the three-dimensional cell neighbourhood while investigating cell fate decisions during early mouse embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W3024644380,"Almost all standard phylogenetic methods for reconstructing gene trees result in unrooted trees; yet, many of the most useful applications of gene trees require that the gene trees be correctly rooted. As a result, several computational methods have been developed for inferring the root of unrooted gene trees. However, the accuracy of such methods has never been systematically evaluated on prokaryotic gene families, where horizontal gene transfer is often one of the dominant evolutionary events driving gene family evolution. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a thorough comparative evaluation of five different rooting methods using large collections of both simulated and empirical prokaryotic gene trees. Our simulation study is based on 6000 true and reconstructed gene trees on 100 species and characterizes the rooting accuracy of the four methods under 36 different evolutionary conditions and 3 levels of gene tree reconstruction error. The empirical study is based on a large, carefully designed data set of 3098 gene trees from 504 bacterial species (406 Alphaproteobacteria and 98 Cyanobacteria) and reveals insights that supplement those gleaned from the simulation study. Overall, this work provides several valuable insights into the accuracy of the considered methods that will help inform the choice of rooting methods to use when studying microbial gene family evolution. Among other findings, this study identifies parsimonious Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) rooting and Minimal Ancestor Deviation (MAD) rooting as two of the most accurate gene tree rooting methods for prokaryotes and specifies the evolutionary conditions under which these methods are most accurate, demonstrates that DTL rooting is highly sensitive to high evolutionary rates and gene tree error, and that rooting methods based on branch-lengths are generally robust to gene tree reconstruction error."
https://openalex.org/W3024043772,"Mucopolysaccharidoses are a class of lysosomal storage diseases, characterized by enzymatic deficiency in the degradation of specific glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Pathological accumulation of excess GAG leads to multiple clinical symptoms with systemic character, most severely affecting bones, muscles and connective tissues. Current therapies include periodic intravenous infusion of supplementary recombinant enzyme (Enzyme Replacement Therapy–ERT) or bone marrow transplantation. However, ERT has limited efficacy due to poor penetration in some organs and tissues. Here, we investigated the potential of the β-D-xyloside derivative odiparcil as an oral GAG clearance therapy for Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, MPS VI). In vitro, in bovine aortic endothelial cells, odiparcil stimulated the secretion of sulphated GAG into culture media, mainly of chondroitin sulphate (CS) /dermatan sulphate (DS) type. Efficacy of odiparcil in reducing intracellular GAG content was investigated in skin fibroblasts from MPS VI patients where odiparcil was shown to reduce efficiently the accumulation of intracellular CS with an EC50 in the range of 1 μM. In vivo, in wild type rats, after oral administrations, odiparcil was well distributed, achieving μM concentrations in MPS VI disease-relevant tissues and organs (bone, cartilage, heart and cornea). In MPS VI Arylsulphatase B deficient mice (Arsb-), after chronic oral administration, odiparcil consistently stimulated the urinary excretion of sulphated GAG throughout the treatment period and significantly reduced tissue GAG accumulation in liver and kidney. Furthermore, odiparcil diminished the pathological cartilage thickening observed in trachea and femoral growth plates of MPS VI mice. The therapeutic efficacy of odiparcil was similar in models of early (treatment starting in juvenile, 4 weeks old mice) or established disease (treatment starting in adult, 3 months old mice). Our data demonstrate that odiparcil effectively diverts the synthesis of cellular glycosaminoglycans into secreted soluble species and this effect can be used for reducing cellular and tissue GAG accumulation in MPS VI models. Therefore, our data reveal the potential of odiparcil as an oral GAG clearance therapy for MPS VI patients."
https://openalex.org/W3024537383,"The pivotal role of KCC2 and NKCC1 in development and maintenance of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and their implication in severe human diseases arouse interest in posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms such as (de)phosphorylation. Staurosporine (broad kinase inhibitor) and N-ethylmalemide (NEM) that modulate kinase and phosphatase activities enhance KCC2 and decrease NKCC1 activity. Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism for this reciprocal regulation by mass spectrometry and immunoblot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies. Our analyses revealed that application of staurosporine or NEM dephosphorylates Thr1007 of KCC2, and Thr203, Thr207 and Thr212 of NKCC1. Dephosphorylation of Thr1007 of KCC2, and Thr207 and Thr212 of NKCC1 were previously demonstrated to activate KCC2 and to inactivate NKCC1. In addition, application of the two agents resulted in dephosphorylation of the T-loop and S-loop phosphorylation sites Thr233 and Ser373 of SPAK, a critical kinase in the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling module mediating phosphorylation of KCC2 and NKCC1. Taken together, these results suggest that reciprocal regulation of KCC2 and NKCC1 via staurosporine and NEM is based on WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling. The key regulatory phospho-site Ser940 of KCC2 is not critically involved in the enhanced activation of KCC2 upon staurosporine and NEM treatment, as both agents have opposite effects on its phosphorylation status. Finally, NEM acts in a tissue-specific manner on Ser940, as shown by comparative analysis in HEK293 cells and immature cultured hippocampal neurons. In summary, our analyses identified phospho-sites that are responsive to staurosporine or NEM application. This provides important information towards a better understanding of the cooperative interactions of different phospho-sites."
https://openalex.org/W3024686163,"Scientific information extraction is a crucial step for understanding scientific publications. In this paper, we focus on scientific keyphrase extraction, which aims to identify keyphrases from scientific articles and classify them into predefined categories. We present a neural network based approach for this task, which employs the bidirectional long short-memory (LSTM) to represent the sentences in the article. On top of the bidirectional LSTM layer in our neural model, conditional random field (CRF) is used to predict the label sequence for the whole sentence. Considering the expensive annotated data for supervised learning methods, we introduce self-training method into our neural model to leverage the unlabeled articles. Experimental results on the ScienceIE corpus and ACL keyphrase corpus show that our neural model achieves promising performance without any hand-designed features and external knowledge resources. Furthermore, it efficiently incorporates the unlabeled data and achieve competitive performance compared with previous state-of-the-art systems."
https://openalex.org/W3024914467,"Given the close relationship between cytokinins (CKs), photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism, this study assessed the effect of arsenic (As) contamination on these metabolic components in the As-hyperaccumulators Pteris cretica L. var. Albo-lineata (Pc-A) and var. Parkerii (Pc-P) as well as the As-non-hyperaccumulator Pteris straminea Mett. ex Baker (Ps). The ferns were cultivated in a pot experiment for 23 weeks in soil spiked with As at the levels 20 and 100 mg·kg-1. For the purpose of this study, the CKs were placed into five functionally different groups according to their structure and physiological roles: bioactive forms (bCKs; CK free bases); inactive or weakly active forms (dCKs; CK N-glucosides); transport forms (tCKs; CK ribosides); storage forms (sCKs; O-glucosides); and primary products of CK biosynthesis (ppbCKs; CK nucleotides). An important finding was higher CKs total content, accumulation of sCKs and reduction of dCKs in As-hyperaccumulators in contrast to non-hyperaccumulator ferns. A significant depletion of C resources was confirmed in ferns, especially Ps, which was determined by measuring the photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence. A fluorescence decrease signified a reduction in the C/N ratio, inducing an increase of bioactive CKs forms in Pc-P and Ps. The impact of As on N utilization was significant in As-hyperaccumulators. The glutamic acid/glutamine ratio, an indicator of primary N assimilation, diminished in all ferns with increased As level in the soil. In conclusion, the results indicate a large phenotypic diversity of Pteris species to As and suggest that the CKs composition and the glutamic acid/glutamine ratio can be used as a tool to diagnose As stress in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3025203224,"Laminopathies are rare diseases associated with mutations in LMNA, which encodes nuclear lamin A/C. LMNA variants lead to diverse tissue-specific phenotypes including cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, myopathy, neuropathy, progeria, bone/skin disorders, and overlap syndromes. The mechanisms underlying these heterogeneous phenotypes remain poorly understood, although post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, are postulated as regulators of lamin function. We catalogued all known lamin A/C human mutations and their associated phenotypes, and systematically examined the putative role of phosphorylation in laminopathies. In silico prediction of specific LMNA mutant-driven changes to lamin A phosphorylation and protein structure was performed using machine learning methods. Some of the predictions we generated were validated via assessment of ectopically expressed wild-type and mutant LMNA. Our findings indicate phenotype- and mutant-specific alterations in lamin phosphorylation, and that some changes in phosphorylation may occur independently of predicted changes in lamin protein structure. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of phosphorylation in the context of laminopathies will likely require mutant- and kinase-specific approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3024209868,"DNA unwinding is an important process that controls binding of proteins, gene expression and melting of double-stranded DNA. In a series of all-atom MD simulations on two DNA molecules containing a transcription start TATA-box sequence we demonstrate that application of a global restraint on the DNA twisting dramatically changes the coupling between helical parameters and the distribution of deformation energy along the sequence. Whereas only short range nearest-neighbor coupling is observed in the relaxed case, long-range coupling is induced in the globally restrained case. With increased overall unwinding the elastic deformation energy is strongly non-uniformly distributed resulting ultimately in a local melting transition of only the TATA box segment during the simulations. The deformation energy tends to be stored more in cytidine/guanine rich regions associated with a change in conformational substate distribution. Upon TATA box melting the deformation energy is largely absorbed by the melting bubble with the rest of the sequences relaxing back to near B-form. The simulations allow us to characterize the structural changes and the propagation of the elastic energy but also to calculate the associated free energy change upon DNA unwinding up to DNA melting. Finally, we design an Ising model for predicting the local melting transition based on empirical parameters. The direct comparison with the atomistic MD simulations indicates a remarkably good agreement for the predicted necessary torsional stress to induce a melting transition, for the position and length of the melted region and for the calculated associated free energy change between both approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3025128353,"Social campaigns are persuasive messages that attempt to communicate positive ideas and practices. One of the main challenges in designing effective social campaigns is the need to compete with other advertisements for viewers’ attention. One of the most widely used methods of drawing attention to social advertising is the use of negative emotions. However, the effectiveness of negative emotional appeals in social campaigns is still a topic of debates. The aim of the study was to use both declarative and neural (EEG) measures to examine whether increasing the intensity of negative emotions in a social campaign enhances its effectiveness linearly or only to a certain level (curvilinear relation). The experimental study was conducted (N = 62) with road safety campaign, using three different levels of negative emotional intensity. The results showed that even though advertising with the strongest negative stimuli evoked the strongest negative emotions, it had no significantly stronger influence on behavioral intention (driving less risky) than moderately negative stimuli. Moreover, neural reaction to the negative stimuli in advertising depended on driving style–people with risky driving style payed less attention to more threatening message (higher beta oscillations)."
https://openalex.org/W3025566250,"There is growing evidence to suggest the importance of self-regulatory practices amongst older adults to sustain mobility. However, the decision to self-regulate driving is a complex interplay between an individual's preference and the influence of their social networks including spouse. To our best knowledge, the influence of an older adult's spouse on their decisions during driving transition has not been explored.This qualitative descriptive study was conducted amongst married older adults aged 60 years and above. All interview responses were transcribed verbatim and examined using thematic approach and interpretative description method.A total of 11 married couples were interviewed. Three major themes emerged: [1] Our roles in driving; [2] Challenges to continue driving; and, [3] Our driving strategies to ensure continued driving. Older couples adopted driving strategies and regulated their driving patterns to ensure they continued to drive safely. Male partners often took the active driving role as the principal drivers, while the females adopted a more passive role, including being the passenger to accompany the principal drivers or becoming the co-driver to help in navigation. Other coping strategies include sharing the driving duties as well as using public transportation or mixed mode transportation.Our findings suggest spouse play a significant role in their partners' decision to self-regulate driving. This underscores a need to recognise the importance of interdependency amongst couples and its impact on their driving decisions and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3024132919,"Congenital deafness in the domestic dog is usually related to the presence of white pigmentation, which is controlled primarily by the piebald locus on chromosome 20 and also by merle on chromosome 10. Pigment-associated deafness is also seen in other species, including cats, mice, sheep, alpacas, horses, cows, pigs, and humans, but the genetic factors determining why some piebald or merle dogs develop deafness while others do not have yet to be determined. Here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify regions of the canine genome significantly associated with deafness in three dog breeds carrying piebald: Dalmatian, Australian cattle dog, and English setter. We include bilaterally deaf, unilaterally deaf, and matched control dogs from the same litter, phenotyped using the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) hearing test. Principal component analysis showed that we have different distributions of cases and controls in genetically distinct Dalmatian populations, therefore GWAS was performed separately for North American and UK samples. We identified one genome-wide significant association and 14 suggestive (chromosome-wide) associations using the GWAS design of bilaterally deaf vs. control Australian cattle dogs. However, these associations were not located on the same chromosome as the piebald locus, indicating the complexity of the genetics underlying this disease in the domestic dog. Because of this apparent complex genetic architecture, larger sample sizes may be needed to detect the genetic loci modulating risk in piebald dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3024025115,"Global trade and climate change are re-shaping the distribution map of pandemic pathogens. One major emerging concern is Xylella fastidiosa, a tropical bacterium recently introduced into Europe from America. In last decades, X. fastidiosa was detected in several European countries. X. fastidiosa is an insect vector-transmitted bacterial plant pathogen associated with severe diseases in a wide range of hosts. X. fastidiosa through a tight coordination of the adherent biofilm and the planktonic states, invades the host systemically. The planktonic phase is correlated to low cell density and vessel colonization. Increase in cell density triggers a quorum sensing system based on mixture of cis 2-enoic fatty acids—diffusible signalling factors (DSF) that promote stickiness and biofilm. The lipidome profile of Olea europaea L. (cv. Ogliarola salentina) samples, collected in groves located in infected zones and uninfected zones was performed. The untargeted analysis of the lipid profiles of Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) positive (+) and negative (-) plants showed a clustering of OQDS+ plants apart from OQDS-. The targeted lipids profile of plants OQDS+ and OQDS- identified a shortlist of 10 lipids that increase their amount in OQDS+ and X. fastidiosa positive olive trees. These lipid entities, provided to X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca pure culture, impact on the dual phase, e.g. planktonic ↔ biofilm. This study provides novel insights on OQDS lipid hallmarks and on molecules that might modulate biofilm phase in X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca."
https://openalex.org/W3024667929,"Objective To explore what motivates individuals to change their behaviour to reduce their risk of dementia. Methods We conducted secondary qualitative analysis of a UK-based online survey on motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviour for dementia risk reduction. Participants were recruited through social media, the Join Dementia Research network and the National Institute for Health Research Portfolio. Free-text comments from people aged ≥50 years were analysed by two researchers independently using inductive content analysis. Inter-rater agreement was measured through Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. Results Of the 3,948 participants completing the survey, 653 provided free text comments that were included in the analysis (Mean age = 64.1; SD = 8.3 years). The majority of the sample were women (n = 459; 70.3%), Caucasian (n = 625; 95.7%) and married/in partnership (n = 459; 70.3%). Three overarching themes were identified: (1) motivators to changing lifestyle; (2) barriers for lifestyle change; and, (3) quality of the information received. The inter-rater reliability of the coding was high (k = 0.7). Having a family history of dementia or feeling like they had a healthy lifestyle already were motivating factors for behaviour change. Having competing health priorities other than dementia and caring for someone acted as de-motivators as they reduced the time available to dedicate to one’s own health. Evidence-based information around dementia prevention was a motivator, but commonly the information was not trusted. Discussion Aligned with the World Health Organisation (WHO) mandate on dementia prevention, community health campaigns targeting population awareness around behaviour change and dementia risk factor reduction are urgently needed. To be successful, such campaigns will need to be accompanied by individual approaches that can overcome age-related barriers and individual differences in motivation levels, personal barriers and trust in the information received."
https://openalex.org/W3024136821,"Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFR, PDGFR and EGFR, play important roles in renal cancer. In this study, we investigated EGFR knockout as a therapeutic approach in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We showed that a renal cell carcinoma cell line (RC21) has higher expression of EGFR as compared to other frequently used cell lines such as HEK293, A549, Hela and DLD1. Ablation of EGFR by CRISPR/Cas9 significantly restrained tumor cell growth and activated the MAPK (pERK1/2) pathway. The VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitor, sunitinib, attenuated the expression of MAPK (pERK1/2) and pAKT induced by EGFR loss and further inhibited EGFR-/- cell proliferation. We showed that loss of EGFR eventually leads to resistance to SAHA and cisplatin. Furthermore, EGFR loss induced G2/M phase arrest and resulted in an increased resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in renal cell carcinoma. Thus, ablation of overexpressed EGFR by CRISPR/Cas9 alone or in combination with sunitinib may be a new treatment option for renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3024805395,"Susceptibility testing for pyrazinamide (PZA), a cornerstone anti-TB drug is not commonly done in Uganda because it is expensive and characterized with technical difficulties thus resistance to this drug is less studied. Resistance is commonly associated with mutations in the pncA gene and its promoter region. However, these mutations vary geographically and those conferring phenotypic resistance are unknown in Uganda. This study determined the prevalence of PZA resistance and its association with pncA mutations.Using a cross-sectional design, archived isolates collected during the Uganda national drug resistance survey between 2008-2011 were sub-cultured. PZA resistance was tested by BACTEC Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system. Sequence reads were downloaded from the NCBI Library and bioinformatics pipelines were used to screen for PZA resistance-conferring mutations.The prevalence of phenotypic PZA resistance was found to be 21%. The sensitivity and specificity of pncA sequencing were 24% (95% CI, 9.36-45.13%) and 100% (73.54% - 100.0%) respectively. We identified four mutations associated with PZA phenotypic resistance in Uganda; K96R, T142R, R154G and V180F.There is a high prevalence of phenotypic PZA resistance among TB patients in Uganda. The low sensitivity of pncA gene sequencing confirms the already documented discordances suggesting other mechanisms of PZA resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3025355824,"Glioblastoma (GBM) has the highest fatality rate among primary malignant brain tumors and typically tends to recur locally just adjacent to the original tumor site following surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. We conducted a study to evaluate the survival outcomes between a standard dose (≤ 60 Gy) and moderate radiation dose escalation (>60 Gy), and to identify prognostic factors for GBM. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of primary GBM patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 in two referral hospitals in Taiwan. They were identified from the cancer registry database and followed up from the date of diagnosis to October 2018. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two dose groups, and independent factors for survival were analyzed through Cox proportional hazard model. We also affirmed the results using Cox regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach. From our cancer registry database, 142 GBM patients were identified, and 84 of them fit the inclusion criteria. Of the 84 patients, 52 (62%) were males. The radiation dose ranged from 50.0 Gy to 66.6 Gy, but their treatment volumes were similar to the others. Fifteen (18%) patients received an escalated dose boost >60.0 Gy. The escalated group had a longer median PFS (15.4 vs. 7.9 months, p = 0.01 for log-rank test), and a longer median OS was also longer in the escalation group (33.8 vs. 12.5 months, p <0.001) than the reference group. Following a multivariate analysis, the escalated dose was identified as a significant predictor for good prognosis (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.23-0.98; OS: HR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.21-0.78). Using the LASSO approach, we found age > 70 (HR = 1.55), diagnosis after 2010 (HR = 1.42), and a larger radiation volume (≥ 250ml; HR = 0.81) were predictors of PFS. The escalated dose (HR = 0.47) and a larger radiation volume (HR = 0.76) were identified as predictors for better OS. Following detailed statistical analysis, a moderate radiation dose escalation (> 60 Gy) was found as an independent factor affecting OS in GBM patients. In conclusion, a moderate radiation dose escalation (> 60 Gy) was an independent predictor for longer OS in GBM patients. However, prospective studies including more patients with more information, such as molecular markers and completeness of resection, are needed to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3025877212,"Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round."
https://openalex.org/W3025928092,"Most effective strategies designed to improve antimicrobial prescribing have multiple approaches. We assessed the impact of the implementation of a rigorous antimicrobial guide and subsequent multifaceted interventions aimed at improving antimicrobial use in Primary Care.A quasi-experimental study was designed. Interventions aimed at achieving a good implementation of the guide consisted of the development of electronic decision support tools, local training meetings, regional workshops, conferences, targets for rates of antibiotic prescribing linked to financial incentives, feedback on antibiotic prescribing, and the implementation of a structured educational antimicrobial stewardship program. Interventions started in 2011, and continued until 2018. Outcomes: rates of antibiotics use, calculated into defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants-day (DID). An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted. The study ran from January 2004 until December 2018.Overall annual antibiotic prescribing rates showed increasing trends in the pre-intervention period. Interventions were followed by significant changes on trends with a decline over time in antibiotic prescribing. Overall antibiotic rates dropped by 28% in the Aljarafe Area and 22% in Andalusia between 2011 and 2018, at rates of -0.90 DID per year (95%CI:-1.05 to -0.75) in Aljarafe, and -0.78 DID (95%CI:-0.95 to -0.60) in Andalusia. Reductions occurred at the expense of the strong decline of penicillins use (33% in Aljarafe, 25% in Andalusia), and more precisely, amoxicillin clavulanate, whose prescription plummeted by around 50%. Quinolones rates decreased before interventions, and continued to decline following interventions with more pronounced downward trends. Decreasing cephalosporins trends continued to decline, at a lesser extent, following interventions in Andalusia. Trends of macrolides rates went from a downward trend to an upward trend from 2011 to 2018.Multifaceted interventions following the delivering of a rigorous antimicrobial guide, maintained in long-term, with strong institutional support, could led to sustained reductions in antibiotic prescribing in Primary Care."
https://openalex.org/W3024512569,"Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) is a dual-specificity phosphatase that acts as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. INPP4B dephosphorylates phospholipids at the 4th position of the inositol ring and inhibits AKT and PKC signaling by hydrolyzing of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4,5)P2, respectively. INPP4B protein phosphatase targets include phospho-tyrosines on Akt and phospho-serine and phospho-threonine on PTEN. INPP4B is highly expressed in testes, suggesting its role in testes development and physiology. The objective of this study was to determine whether Inpp4b deletion impacts testicular function in mice. In testis, Inpp4b expression was the highest in postmeiotic germ cells in both mice and men. The testes of Inpp4b knockout male mice were significantly smaller compared to the testes of wild-type (WT) males. Inpp4b-/- males produced fewer mature sperm cells compared to WT, and this difference increased with age and high fat diet (HFD). Reduction in early steroidogenic enzymes and luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor gene expression was detected, although androgen receptor (AR) protein level was similar in WT and Inpp4b-/- testes. Germ cell apoptosis was significantly increased in the knockout mice, while expression of meiotic marker γH2A.X was decreased. Our data demonstrate that INPP4B plays a role in maintenance of male germ cell differentiation and protects testis functions against deleterious effects of aging and high fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W3025103332,"Lupus is a debilitating multi-organ autoimmune disease clinically typified by periods of flare and remission. Exposing lupus-prone female NZBWF1 mice to crystalline silica (cSiO2), a known human autoimmune trigger, mimics flaring by inducing interferon-related gene (IRG) expression, inflammation, ectopic lymphoid structure (ELS) development, and autoantibody production in the lung that collectively accelerate glomerulonephritis. cSiO2-triggered flaring in this model can be prevented by supplementing mouse diet with the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A limitation of previous studies was the use of purified diet that, although optimized for rodent health, does not reflect the high American intake of saturated fatty acid (SFA), ω-6 PUFAs, and total fat. To address this, we employed here a modified Total Western Diet (mTWD) emulating the 50th percentile U.S. macronutrient distribution to discern how DHA supplementation and/or SFA and ω-6 reduction influences cSiO2-triggered lupus flaring in female NZBWF1 mice. Six-week-old mice were fed isocaloric experimental diets for 2 wks, intranasally instilled with cSiO2 or saline vehicle weekly for 4 wks, and tissues assessed for lupus endpoints 11 wks following cSiO2 instillation. In mice fed basal mTWD, cSiO2 induced robust IRG expression, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine elevation, leukocyte infiltration, ELS neogenesis, and autoantibody production in the lung, as well as early kidney nephritis onset compared to vehicle-treated mice fed mTWD. Consumption of mTWD containing DHA at the caloric equivalent to a human dose of 5 g/day dramatically suppressed induction of all lupus-associated endpoints. While decreasing SFA and ω-6 in mTWD modestly inhibited some disease markers, DHA addition to this diet was required for maximal protection against lupus development. Taken together, DHA supplementation at a translationally relevant dose was highly effective in preventing cSiO2-triggered lupus flaring in NZBWF1 mice, even against the background of a typical Western diet."
https://openalex.org/W3024119941,"Background Stunting is an indicator of poor linear growth in children and is an important public health problem in many countries. Both nutritional deficits and toxic exposures can contribute to lower height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) and stunting (HAZ < -2). Objectives In a community-based cross-sectional sample of 97 healthy children ages 6–59 months in Kampala, Uganda, we examined whether exposure to Pb, As, Cd, Se, or Zn were associated with HAZ individually or as a mixture. Methods Blood samples were analyzed for a mixture of metals, which represent both toxins and essential nutrients. The association between HAZ and metal exposure was tested using multivariable linear regression and Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression, which uses mixtures of correlated exposures as a predictor. Results There were 22 stunted children in the sample, mean HAZ was -0.74 (SD = 1.84). Linear regression showed that Pb (β = -0.80, p = 0.021) and Se (β = 1.92, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with HAZ. The WQS models separated toxic elements with a presumed negative effect on HAZ (Pb, As, Cd) from essential nutrients with presumed positive effect on HAZ (Se and Zn). The toxic mixture was significantly associated with lower HAZ (β = -0.47, p = 0.03), with 62% of the effect from Pb. The nutrient WQS index did not reach statistical significance (β = -0.47, p = 0.16). Discussion Higher blood lead and lower blood selenium level were both associated with lower HAZ. The significant associations by linear regression were reinforced by the WQS models, although not all associations reached statistical significance. These findings suggest that healthy children in this neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, who have a high burden of toxic exposures, may experience detrimental health effects associated with these exposures in an environment where exposure sources are not well characterized."
https://openalex.org/W3025980734,"Salvage logging in burned forests can negatively affect habitat for white-headed woodpeckers (Dryobates albolarvatus), a species of conservation concern, but also meets socioeconomic demands for timber and human safety. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models can inform forest management activities to help meet habitat conservation objectives. Informing post-fire forest management, however, involves model application at new locations as wildfires occur, requiring evaluation of predictive performance across locations. We developed HSI models for white-headed woodpeckers using nest sites from two burned-forest locations in Oregon, the Toolbox (2002) and Canyon Creek (2015) fires. We measured predictive performance by developing one model at each of the two locations and quantifying discrimination of nest from reference sites at two other wildfire locations where the model had not been developed (either Toolbox or Canyon Creek, and the Barry Point Fire [2011]). We developed and evaluated Maxent models based on remotely sensed environmental metrics to support habitat mapping, and weighted logistic regression (WLR) models that combined remotely sensed and field-collected metrics to inform management prescriptions. Both Maxent and WLR models developed either at Canyon Creek or Toolbox performed adequately to inform management when applied at the alternate Toolbox or Canyon Creek location, respectively (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.61-0.72) but poorly when applied at Barry Point (AUC = 0.53-0.57). The final HSI models fitted to Toolbox and Canyon Creek data quantified suitable nesting habitat as severely burned or open sites adjacent to lower severity and closed canopy sites, where foraging presumably occurs. We suggest these models are applicable at locations similar to development locations but not at locations resembling Barry Point, which were characterized by more (pre-fire) canopy openings, larger diameter trees, less ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and more juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Considering our results, we recommend caution when applying HSI models developed at individual wildfire locations to inform post-fire management at new locations without first evaluating predictive performance."
https://openalex.org/W3024373485,"To achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets at a national level, many countries must accelerate service coverage among key populations. To do this, key population programs have adopted methods similar to those used in respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to expand reach. A deeper understanding of factors from RDS surveys that enhance health service engagement can improve key population programs. To understand the in-depth lives of key populations, acceptance of expanded point-of-care biological testing and determine drivers of participation in RDS surveys, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 111 key population participants (12–65 years) were purposefully selected from six biobehavioral surveys (BBS) in three cities in Papua New Guinea. Key populations were female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender women. Four reasons motivated individuals to participate in the BBS: peer referrals; private, confidential, and stigma-free study facilities; “one-stop shop” services that provided multiple tests and with same-day results, sexually transmitted infection treatment, and referrals; and the desire to know ones’ health status. Biobehavioral surveys, and programs offering key population services can incorporate the approach we used to facilitate key population engagement in the HIV cascade."
https://openalex.org/W3024717388,"Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been shown to predict the coupling of depression and inflammation in adulthood. Trust within intimate relationships, a core element in marital relations, has been shown to predict positive physical and mental health outcomes, but the mediating role of trust in partners in the association between CSA and inflammation in adulthood requires further study. The present study aimed to examine the impact of CSA on inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6 and IL-1β) in adults with depression and the mediating role of trust. A cross-sectional survey data set of adults presenting with mood and sleep disturbance was used in the analysis. CSA demonstrated a significant negative correlation with IL-6 level (r = -0.28, p<0. 01) in adults with clinically significant depression, while trust showed a significant positive correlation with IL-6 level (r = 0.36, p < .01). Sobel test and bootstrapping revealed a significant mediating role for trust between CSA and IL-6 level. CSA and trust in partners were revealed to have significant associations with IL-6 level in adulthood. Counterintuitively, the directions of association were not those expected. Trust played a mediating role between CSA and adulthood levels of IL-6. Plausible explanations for these counterintuitive findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3025048427,"The hindgut protists of wood-feeding termites are usually colonized by prokaryotic symbionts. Many of the hurdles that have prevented a better understanding of these symbionts arise from variation among protist and termite host species and the inability to maintain prominent community members in culture. These issues have made it difficult to study the fidelity, acquisition, and differences in colonization of protists by bacterial symbionts. In this study, we use high throughput amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes to determine the composition of bacterial communities associated with single protist cells of six protist species, from the genera Pyrsonympha, Dinenympha, and Trichonympha that are present in the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes. By analyzing amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), the diversity and distribution of protist-associated bacteria was compared within and across these six different protist species. ASV analysis showed that, in general, each protist genus associated with a distinct community of bacterial symbionts which were conserved across different termite colonies. However, some ASVs corresponding to ectosymbionts (Spirochaetes) were shared between different Dinenympha species and to a lesser extent with Pyrsonympha and Trichonympha hosts. This suggested that certain bacterial symbionts may be cosmopolitan to some degree and perhaps acquired by horizontal transmission. Using a fluorescence-based cell assay, we could observe the horizontal acquisition of surface-bound bacteria. This acquisition was shown to be time-dependent, involve active processes, and was non-random with respect to binding locations on some protists."
https://openalex.org/W3025736760,"A murine model to study the effect of cold-induced stress (CIS) on Chlamydia muridarum genital infection and immune response has been developed in our laboratory. Previous results in the lab show that CIS increases the intensity of chlamydia genital infection, but little is known about the effects and mechanisms of CIS on the differentiation and activities of CD4+ T cell subpopulations and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). The factors that regulate the production of T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines are not well defined. In this study, we examined whether CIS modulates the expressions of beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), transcription factors, hallmark cytokines of Th1 and Th2, and differentiation of BMDCs during C. muridarum genital infection in the murine model. Our results show that the mRNA level of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) compared to β1-AR and β3-AR was high in the mixed populations of CD4+ T cells and BMDCs. Furthermore, we observed decreased expression of T-bet, low level of Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, increased expression of GATA-3, and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) production in CD4+ T cells of stressed mice. Exposure of BMDCs to Fenoterol, β2-AR agonist, or ICI118,551, β2-AR antagonist, revealed significant β2-AR stimulation or inhibition, respectively, in stressed mice. Moreover, co-culturing of mature BMDCs and naïve CD4+ T cells increased the production of IL-4, IL-10, L-17, and IL-23 cytokines, suggesting that stimulation of β2-AR leads to the increased production of Th2 cytokines. Overall, our results show for the first time that CIS promotes the switching from a Th1 to Th2 cytokine environment. This was evidenced in the murine stress model by the overexpression of GATA-3 concurrent with elevated IL-4 production, reduced T-bet expression, and IFN-γ secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3024216829,"The transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a pivotal role in tissue regeneration. HIF-1 is negatively controlled by O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylases with a predominant role of prolyl hydroxylase 2 isoform (Phd2). Transgenic mice, hypomorphic for this isoform, accumulate more HIF-1 under normoxic conditions. Using these mice, we investigated the influence of Phd2 and HIF-1 on the regenerative capability of skeletal muscle tissue after myotrauma. Phd2-hypomorphic and wild type mice (on C57Bl/6 background) were grouped with regeneration times from 6 to 168 hours after closed mechanic muscle trauma to the hind limb. Tissue samples were analysed by immuno-staining and real-time PCR. Bone marrow derived macrophages of wild type and Phd2-hypomorphic mice were isolated and analysed via flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. Phd2 reduction led to a higher regenerative capability due to enhanced activation of myogenic factors accompanied by induction of genes responsible for glucose and lactate metabolism in Phd2-hypomorphic mice. Macrophage infiltration into the trauma areas in hypomorphic mice started earlier and was more pronounced compared to wild type mice. Phd2-hypomorphic mice also showed higher numbers of macrophages in areas with sustained trauma 72 hours after myotrauma application. In conclusion, we postulate that the HIF-1 pathway is activated secondary to a Phd2 reduction which may lead to i) higher activation of myogenic factors, ii) increased number of positive stem cell proliferation markers, and iii) accelerated macrophage recruitment to areas of trauma, resulting in faster muscle tissue regeneration after myotrauma. With the current development of prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors, our findings point towards a potential clinical benefit after myotrauma."
https://openalex.org/W3024725773,"Many women cease breastfeeding earlier than desired. This study examined the cessation of breastfeeding among mothers of preterm infants. Thus, the aim was to describe the cessation of breastfeeding in mothers of preterm infants up to 12 months after birth.This mixed methods study used a convergent design with both qualitative data, consisting of written comments, and quantitative data, on breastfeeding status and breastfeeding satisfaction. The data were collected from questionnaires sent to the mothers at three points during the first year after birth. In total, 270 mothers of preterm infants who breastfed at the time of discharge from the neonatal unit provided data for the study. The quantitative and qualitative data were analysed separately with statistical tests and hermeneutical analysis, respectively and then together according to the convergent mixed methods design.Four themes of the meanings of the cessation of breastfeeding were identified in the qualitative analysis: ""Desire to regain the mother's and the infant's well-being"", ""The mothers interpretation that the infants actively ceased breastfeeding"", ""The mother's body and/or the infants' signals showing the way"" and ""The mother's own will and perceived external obstacles"". Mothers who did not breastfeed as long as they wanted were more likely to report less satisfaction with breastfeeding, a shorter breastfeeding period, and less activity when ceasing breastfeeding. In comparison, mothers who breastfed as long as they wanted were more satisfied with breastfeeding, breastfed for a longer period of time and were more active in decision making in breastfeeding cessation.Maternal passivity or activity influenced the cessation of breastfeeding in mothers of preterm infants who breastfed at the time of discharge from the neonatal unit. Passive behaviour related to breastfeeding may result in early cessation of breastfeeding, and low breastfeeding satisfaction while active behaviour may increase breastfeeding length and satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3025150962,"Despite vulnerability and unsanitary conditions of animal hoarding may predispose environmental contamination and spread of vectors and pathogens, no study to date has focused on their impact on public health and zoonotic diseases. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies and associated factors in individuals with animal hoarding disorder (AHD) and their dogs in Curitiba, Southern Brazil. Blood samples were obtained from 264 dogs (21 households) and 19 individuals with AHD (11 households). Their blood was tested by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Overall, anti-Toxoplasma gondii seropositivity was found in 21/264 dogs (7.95%; 95% CI: 4.69–11.22) with titers ranging from 16 to 4096, and in 7/19 individuals with AHD (36.84%; CI: 15.15–58.53) with titers ranging from 16 to 64. Serological analysis for anti-T. gondii antibodies were considered positive in at least one individual or dog in 9/11 (81.82%; 95% CI: 59.03–100.00) cases that were thoroughly assessed. Surprisingly, the seropositivity of individuals with AHD and their dogs was among the lowest reportedly observed in human and dog populations of Brazil. There was no significant association between positive owners and positive dogs or the presence of cats in the household. Regard epidemiological variables, a significant association was found between dog’s seropositivity and the type of dog food. To the authors’ knowledge, the present study represents the first investigation of T. gondii seroprevalence in individuals with hoarding disorder and their dogs. In conclusion, despite low sanitary conditions, anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies frequency in individuals with AHD and their dogs are lower than the general population likely due to low protozoan load in such isolated households."
https://openalex.org/W3025239286,"Pregnant women are considered as one of the most vulnerable groups for iodine deficiency. The Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan 2013 revealed that the median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of non-pregnant women of child-bearing age of 15–44 years was 124 μg/L, which was adequate in general, but insufficient according to pregnancy criteria. The aim of this study was to determine the iodine nutritional status of pregnant women in an urban area of Northern Taiwan. A hospital-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Random spot urine samples were collected from January to October, 2018 and UIC was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. A food frequency questionnaire was also delivered to the participants. The overall median UIC was 225.3 μg/L (IQR: 109.1–514.2 μg/L) for 257 pregnant women ranging from 21–47 years-old. The distribution of UIC was as follows: 35.4% with UIC <150 μg/L, 17.1% with UIC within 150–249 μg/L, 21.8% with UIC within 250–499 μg/L, and 25.7% with UIC ≥500 μg/L. The use of prenatal multivitamin was very common among the participants: 79.4% (n = 204) took multivitamin either every day or less frequently, with 52.5% (n = 135) taking one pill every day, and only 20.6% (n = 53) never took multivitamin during their pregnancy. Other commonly consumed iodine-containing foods were dairy products and fish. Our results indicate that the iodine status in the studied women is adequate. However, efforts are still needed to avoid iodine deficiency as well as iodine excess."
https://openalex.org/W3025280304,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) is the process by which the ATP synthase conserves the energy released during the oxidation of different nutrients as ATP. The yeast ATP synthase consists of three assembly modules, one of which is a ring consisting of 10 copies of the Atp9 subunit. We previously reported the existence in yeast mitochondria of high molecular weight complexes composed of mitochondrially encoded Atp9 and of Cox6, an imported structural subunit of cytochrome oxidase (COX). Pulse-chase experiments indicated a correlation between the loss of newly translated Atp9 complexed to Cox6 and an increase of newly formed Atp9 ring, but did not exclude the possibility of an alternate source of Atp9 for ring formation. Here we have extended studies on the functions and structure of this complex, referred to as Atco. We show that Atco is the exclusive source of Atp9 for the ATP synthase assembly. Pulse-chase experiments show that newly translated Atp9, present in Atco, is converted to a ring, which is incorporated into the ATP synthase with kinetics characteristic of a precursor-product relationship. Even though Atco does not contain the ring form of Atp9, cross-linking experiments indicate that it is oligomeric and that the inter-subunit interactions are similar to those of the bona fide ring. We propose that, by providing Atp9 for biogenesis of ATP synthase, Atco complexes free Cox6 for assembly of COX. This suggests that Atco complexes may play a role in coordinating assembly and maintaining proper stoichiometry of the two oxphos enzymes"
https://openalex.org/W3037368583,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) used in combination with nanoparticles or scaffolds represent promising candidates for bone engineering. Compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMMSCs), ADMSCs show a relatively low capacity for osteogenesis. In the current study, miR-24 was identified as an osteogenesis- and adipogenesis-related miRNA that performs opposing roles (inhibition in osteogenesis and promotion in adipogenesis) during these two differentiation processes. Through bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays, homeobox protein Hox-B7 (HOXB7) was identified as a potential novel downstream target of miR-24 that contains a miR-24 binding site in the 3′-UTR of its mRNA. Overexpression of HOXB7 could partly halt the inhibitory effect of miR-24 on osteogenesis, and downregulation of HOXB7 could also partly suppress the positive effect of miR-24 on adipogenesis. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments found that HOXB7 and β-catenin formed a functional complex that acted as an essential modulator during osteogenesis and adipogenesis of ADMSCs. After transfecting ADMSCs with an MSNs-PEI-miR-24 agomir or antagomir and loading the cells onto gelatin-chitosan scaffolds, the compounds were assessed for their abilities to repair the critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Comprehensive evaluation, including micro-CT, sequential fluorescent labeling, and immunohistochemistry analysis, revealed that silencing miR-24 distinctly promoted in vivo bone remolding, whereas overexpression of miR-24 significantly repressed bone formation. Taken together, our findings demonstrated opposite roles for the miR-24/HOXB7/β-catenin signaling pathway in the osteogenesis and adipogenesis of ADMSCs, which may provide a novel mechanism for determining the balance between these two biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W3024259750,"Monocytic cells perform crucial homeostatic and defensive functions. However, their fate and characterization at the transcriptomic level in human tissues are partially understood, often as a consequence of the lack of specific markers allowing their unequivocal identification. The 6-sulfo LacNAc (slan) antigen identifies a subset of non-classical (NC) monocytes in the bloodstream, namely the slan+ -monocytes. In recent studies, we and other groups have reported that, in tonsils, slan marks dendritic cell (DC)-like cells, as defined by morphological, phenotypical, and functional criteria. However, subsequent investigations in lymphomas have uncovered a significant heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating slan+ -cells, including a macrophage-like state. Based on their emerging role in tissue inflammation and cancer, herein we investigated slan+ -cell fate in tonsils by using a molecular-based approach. Hence, RNA from tonsil slan+ -cells, conventional CD1c+ DCs (cDC2) and CD11b+ CD14+ -macrophages was subjected to gene expression analysis. For comparison, transcriptomes were also obtained from blood cDC2, classical (CL), intermediate (INT), NC, and slan+ -monocytes. Data demonstrate that the main trajectory of human slan+ -monocytes infiltrating the tonsil tissue is toward a macrophage-like population, displaying molecular features distinct from those of tonsil CD11b+ CD14+ -macrophages and cDC2. These findings provide a novel view on the terminal differentiation path of slan+ -monocytes, which is relevant for inflammatory diseases and lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W3025275587,"Background It is well established that coronary artery disease progresses along with myocardial disease. However, data on the association between coronary artery calcium (CAC) and echocardiographic variables are lacking. Methods and results Among 2,650 Framingham Study participants (mean age 51 yrs, 48% women; 40% with CAC>0), we related CT-based CAC score to left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMi), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), E/e’, global longitudinal strain (GLS), left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), and aortic root diameter (AoR), using multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models. CAC score (independent variable) was used as log-transformed continuous [ln(CAC+1)] and as a categorical (0, 1–100, and ≥101) variable. Adjusting for standard risk factors, higher CAC score was associated with higher LVMi and AoR (βLVMI per 1-SD increase 0.012, βAoR 0.008; P<0.05, for both). Participants with 1≤CAC≤100 and those with CAC≥101 had higher AoR (βAoR 0.013 and 0.020, respectively, P = 0.01) than those with CAC = 0. CAC score was not significantly associated with LVEF, E/e’, GLS or LAEF. Age modified the association of CAC score with AoR; higher CAC scores were associated with larger AoR more strongly in older (>58 years; βAoR0.0042;P<0.007) than in younger (≤58 years) participants (βAoR0.0027;P<0.03). Conclusions We observed that subclinical atherosclerosis was associated with ventricular and aortic remodeling. The prognostic significance of these associations warrants evaluation in additional mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3025330552,"Whole-genome expression data generated by microarray studies have shown promise for quantitative human health risk assessment. While numerous approaches have been developed to determine benchmark doses (BMDs) from probeset-level dose responses, sensitivity of the results to methods used for normalization of the data has not yet been systematically investigated. Normalization of microarray data converts raw hybridization signals to expression estimates that are expected to be proportional to the amounts of transcripts in the profiled specimens. Different approaches to normalization have been shown to greatly influence the results of some downstream analyses, including biological interpretation. In this study we evaluate the influence of microarray normalization methods on the transcriptomic BMDs. We demonstrate using in vivo data that the use of alternative pipelines for normalization of Affymetrix microarray data can have a considerable impact on the number of detected differentially expressed genes and pathways (processes) determined to be treatment responsive, which may lead to alternative interpretations of the data. In addition, we found that normalization can have a considerable effect (as much as ~30-fold in this study) on estimation of the minimum biological potency (transcriptomic point of departure). We argue for consideration of alternative normalization methods and their data-informed selection to most effectively interpret microarray data for use in human health risk assessment."

This study is aimed at determining the changes in malaria occurrence over the last 28 years, from 1989 to 2016 in Dakar, Senegal. Methods Laboratory suspected and confirmed malaria records from 1989 to 2016 were reviewed from the laboratory registers of the Laboratory of Parasitology and Mycology of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was used to estimate the changes by comparing malaria cases post-intervention (2006–2016) with that of the pre-intervention (1989–2005) period. Results A total of 5,876 laboratory confirmed malaria cases were reported out of 29,852 tested cases, with total slide positivity rate (SPR) of 19.7%. Malaria case counts exhibited a fluctuating trend with major peaks occurring in the years 1995 and 2003 with SPR of 42.3% and 42.5%, respectively. Overall, a remarkable decline in the total number of laboratory confirmed malaria cases was observed over the last 28 years. P. falciparum was almost the only reported species, accounting for 99.98% of cases. The highest SPR was observed in the age group of under five years during the pre-intervention period while this shifted to the age group of 6–15 years old for the subsequent years. Two major malaria peak seasons were observed: one in September during the pre-intervention period and the other in November for the post-intervention period. The ITS analysis showed a dramatic decline of 83.6% in SPR following the scale-up of interventions in 2006. Conclusion A remarkable decline in laboratory confirmed malaria cases in Dakar over 28 years was observed. The period of rapid decline in malaria SPR coincided with the scale-up in interventions beginning in 2006 with the introduction of ACTs, followed by the widespread introduction in 2008 of bed nets treated with insecticides. Robust surveillance data should be maintained in the context of malaria elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3024633491,"The estimated 20-year renal survival rate of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is approx. 60%, but it is difficult to determine the 'big picture' for IgA nephropathy because a biopsy is essential for its diagnosis. Here we attempted to determine the longer and more precise renal prognosis of IgA nephropathy. We examined 310 patients with primary IgA nephropathy. Using the patients' clinical records and histological reports from our hospital and other clinics, we surveyed their renal prognoses and treatments within 1 year post-biopsy, and we sent questionnaires to the patients who had stopped visiting any hospital. We set renal death as the primary endpoint and analyzed factors related to renal death. The total patient cohort was 267: 159 males, 108 females; average age at biopsy, 37.7 years; average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 69.7 mL/min/1.73m2; urinary protein, 1.3 g/day. The mean follow-up duration was prolonged to 13.8±8.9 years (vs. 9.2±8.5 years using only medical records). The 10- and 20-year follow-up rates were 61.7% and 27.3%. The 10-, 20-year renal survival rates were 83.6% and 72.5%. Lower eGFR, hypertension, and smoking were revealed as factors independently related to renal death. To study survival of relatively benign diseases such as IgA nephropathy, longer survival rate was affected by many censoring cases. The results regarding the long-term renal prognoses of IgA nephropathy patients (including those with a mild phenotype) obtained by our analysis of a questionnaire sent to the patients provided more precise and longer-term prognoses compared to earlier studies."
https://openalex.org/W3025654594,"The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) and possibly Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) are associated with human and animal diseases. Sii predominate in spontaneously fermented milk products with unknown public health effects. Sii/SBSEC prevalence data from West Africa in correlation with milk transformation practices are limited. Northern Cote d'Ivoire served as study area due to its importance in milk production and consumption and to link a wider Sudano-Sahelian pastoral zone of cross-border trade. We aimed to describe the cow milk value chain and determine Sii/SBSEC prevalence with a cross-sectional study. Dairy production practices were described as non-compliant with basic hygiene standards. The system is influenced by secular sociocultural practices and environmental conditions affecting product properties. Phenotypic and molecular analyses identified SBSEC in 27/43 (62.8%) fermented and 26/67 (38.8%) unfermented milk samples. Stratified by collection stage, fermented milk at producer and vendor levels featured highest SBSEC prevalence of 71.4% and 63.6%, respectively. Sii with 62.8% and 38.8% as well as Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus with 7.0% and 7.5% were the predominant SBSEC species identified among fermented and unfermented milk samples, respectively. The population structure of Sii/SBSEC isolates seems to reflect evolving novel dairy-adapted, non-adapted and potentially pathogenic lineages. Northern Cote d'Ivoire was confirmed as area with high Sii presence in dairy products. The observed production practices and the high diversity of Sii/SBSEC supports in-depth investigations on Sii ecology niche, product safety and related technology in the dairy value chain potentially affecting large population groups across sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3024096348,"Clinical examination and functional assessment are often the first steps to assess outcome of clubfoot treatment. Clinical photographs may be an adjunct used to assess treatment outcomes in lower resourced settings where physical review by a specialist is limited. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of photographic images of patients with clubfoot in assessing outcome following treatment.In this single-centre diagnostic accuracy study, we included all children with clubfoot from a cohort treated between 2011 and 2013, in 2017. Two physiotherapists trained in clubfoot management calculated the Assessing Clubfoot Treatment (ACT) score for each child to decide if treatment was successful or if further treatment was required. Photographic images were then taken of 79 feet. Two blinded orthopaedic surgeons assessed three sets of images of each foot (n = 237 in total) at two time points (two months apart). Treatment for each foot was rated as 'success', 'borderline' or 'failure'. Intra- and inter-observer variation for the photographic image was assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for the photographic image compared to the ACT score.There was perfect correlation between clinical assessment and photographic evaluation of both raters at both time-points in 38 (48%) feet. The raters demonstrated acceptable reliability with re-scoring photographs (rater 1, k = 0.55; rater 2, k = 0.88). Thirty percent (n = 71) of photographs were assessed as poor quality image or sub-optimal patient position. Sensitivity of outcome with photograph compared to ACT score was 83.3%-88.3% and specificity ranged from 57.9%-73.3%.Digital photography may help to confirm, but not exclude, success of clubfoot treatment. Future work to establish photographic parameters as an adjunct to assessing treatment outcomes, and guidance on a standardised protocol for photographs, may be beneficial in the follow up of children who have treated clubfoot in isolated communities or lower resourced settings."

To ensure a safe product for the consumer, an efficient traceability system is required that enables a quick and efficient identification of the potential sources of contamination and proper implementation of mitigation actions. In this study, we explored the use of graph theory to construct a food supply chain network for the broiler meat supply chain in the Netherlands and tested it as a traceability system. To build the graph, we first identified the main actors in the supply chain such as broiler breeder farms, broiler farms, slaughterhouses, processors, and retailers. The capacity data of each supply chain actor, represented by its production or trade volumes, were gathered from various sources. The trade relationships between the supply chain actors were collected and the missing relationships were estimated using the gravity model. Once the network was modeled, we computed degree centrality and betweenness centrality to identify critical nodes in the network. In addition, we computed trade density to get insight into the complexity of sub-networks. We identified the critical nodes at each stage of the Dutch broiler meat supply chain and verified our results with a domain expert of the Dutch poultry industry and literature. The results showed that processors with own slaughtering facility were the most critical points in the broiler meat supply chain."
https://openalex.org/W3026032644,"Severe influenza virus (IV) infections still represent a major challenge to public health. To combat IV infections, vaccines and antiviral compounds are available. However, vaccine efficacies vary with very limited to no protection against newly emerging zoonotic IV introductions. In addition, the development of resistant virus variants against currently available antivirals can be rapidly detected, in consequence demanding the design of novel antiviral strategies. Virus supportive cellular signaling cascades, such as the NF-κB pathway, have been identified to be promising antiviral targets against IV in in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials. While administration of NF-κB pathway inhibiting agents, such as LASAG results in decreased IV replication, it remained unclear whether blocking of NF-κB might sensitize cells to secondary bacterial infections, which often come along with viral infections. Thus, we examined IV and Staphylococcus aureus growth during LASAG treatment. Interestingly, our data reveal that the presence of LASAG during superinfection still leads to reduced IV titers. Furthermore, the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway resulted in decreased intracellular Staphylococcus aureus loads within epithelial cells, indicating a dependency on the pathway for bacterial uptake. Unfortunately, so far it is not entirely clear if this phenomenon might be a drawback in bacterial clearance during infection."
https://openalex.org/W3024779962,"Cervical cancer screening rates are known to be strongly associated with socioeconomic status. Our objective was to assess whether the rate is also associated with an aggregated deprivation marker, defined by the location of family doctors' offices.To access this association, we 1) collected data from the claim database of the French Health Insurance Fund about the registered family doctors and their enlisted female patients eligible for cervical screening; 2) carried out a telephone survey with all registered doctors to establish if they were carrying out Pap-smears in their practices; 3) geotracked all the doctors' offices in the smallest existing blocks of socioeconomic homogenous populations (IRIS census units) that were assigned a census derived marker of deprivation, the European Deprivation Index (EDI), and a binary variable of urbanization; and 4) we used a multivariable linear mixed model with IRIS as a random effect.Of 348 eligible doctors, 343 responded to the telephone survey (98.6%) and were included in the analysis, encompassing 88,152 female enlisted patients aged 25-65 years old. In the multivariable analysis (adjusted by the gender of the family doctor, the practice of Pap-smears by the doctor and the urbanization of the office location), the EDI of the doctor's office was strongly associated with the cervical cancer screening participation rate of eligible patients (p<0.001).The EDI linked to the location of the family doctor's office seems to be a robust marker to predict female patients' participation in cervical cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3025736442,"Pollution source parameter identification (PSPI) is significant for pollution control, since it can provide important information and save a lot of time for subsequent pollution elimination works. For solving the PSPI problem, a large number of pollution sensor nodes can be rapidly deployed to cover a large area and form a wireless sensor network (WSN). Based on the measurements of WSN, least-squares estimation methods can solve the PSPI problem by searching for the solution that minimize the sum of squared measurement noises. They are independent of the measurement noise distribution, i.e., robust to the noise distribution. To search for the least-squares solution, population-based parallel search techniques usually can overcome the premature convergence problem, which can stagnate the single-point search algorithm. In this paper, we adapt the relatively newly presented artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to solve the WSN-based PSPI problem and verifies its feasibility and robustness. Extensive simulation results show that the ABC and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm obtained similar identification results in the same simulation scenario. Moreover, the ABC and the PSO achieved much better performance than a traditionally used single-point search algorithm, i.e., the trust-region reflective algorithm."
