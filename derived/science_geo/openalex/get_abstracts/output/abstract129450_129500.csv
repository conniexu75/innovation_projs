https://openalex.org/W2062214806,"Missense mutations in two related genes, termed presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), cause dementia in a subset of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees. In a variety of experimental in vitro and in vivo settings, FAD-linked presenilin variants influence the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to elevated levels of the highly fibrillogenic Aβ1–42 peptides that are preferentially deposited in the brains of Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. In this report, we demonstrate that transgenic animals that coexpress an FAD-linked human PS1 variant (A246E) and a chimeric mouse/human APP harboring mutations linked to Swedish FAD kindreds (APP swe) develop numerous amyloid deposits much earlier than age-matched mice expressing APP swe and wild-type Hu PS1 or APP swe alone. These results provide evidence for the view that one pathogenic mechanism by which FAD-linked mutant PS1 causes AD is to accelerate the rate of β-amyloid deposition in brain."

https://openalex.org/W2083107042,"We have tested the role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in regulating a group of putatively nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do not express calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and that downregulate the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, after birth. We show that mRNA and protein for the GDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret, are expressed in the DRG in patterns that differ markedly from those of any of the neurotrophin receptors. Most strikingly, a population of small neurons initiates expression of Ret between embryonic day 15.5 and postnatal day 7.5 and maintains Ret expression into adulthood. These Ret-expressing small neurons are selectively labeled by the lectin IB4 and project to lamina IIi of the dorsal horn. Ret-expressing neurons also express the glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-linked (GPI-linked) GDNF binding component GDNFR-alpha and retrogradely transport 125I-GDNF, indicating the presence of a biologically active GDNF receptor complex. In vitro, GDNF supports the survival of small neurons that express Ret and bind IB4 while failing to support the survival of neurons expressing TrkA and CGRP. Together, our findings suggest that IB4-binding neurons switch from dependence on NGF in embryonic life to dependence on GDNF in postnatal life and are likely regulated by GDNF in maturity."

https://openalex.org/W2037921808,"We describe here a novel effect of activity on the subcellular distribution of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons in culture. In spontaneously active neurons, NMDA receptors were clustered at a few synaptic and nonsynaptic sites. Chronic blockade of NMDA receptor activity induced a 380% increase in the number of NMDA receptor clusters and a shift to a more synaptic distribution. This effect was reversible. The distributions of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, and the putative NMDA receptor clustering protein PSD-95 were not affected by blockade. Regulation of the synaptic localization of NMDA receptors by activity may define a novel mechanism by which input controls a neuron's ability to modify its synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2115957711,"To date, more than 300 distinct small deletions, insertions and point mutations, mostly leading to premature termination of translation, have been reported in the breast/ovarian-cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1. The elevated frequencies of some mutations in certain ethnic subpopulations are caused by founder effects, rather than by mutation hotspots. Here we report that the currently available mutation spectrum of BRCA1 has been biased by PCR-based mutation-screening methods, such as SSCP, the protein truncation test (PTT) and direct sequencing, using genomic DNA as template. Three large genomic deletions that are not detected by these approaches comprise 36% of all BRCA1 mutations found in Dutch breast-cancer families to date. A 510-bp Alu-mediated deletion comprising exon 22 was found in 8 of 170 breast-cancer families recruited for research purposes and in 6 of 49 probands referred to the Amsterdam Family Cancer Clinic for genetic counselling. In addition, a 3,835-bp Alu-mediated deletion encompassing exon 13 was detected in 4 of 170 research families, while an deletion of approximately 14 kb was detected in a single family [corrected]. Haplotype analyses indicated that each recurrent deletion had a single common ancestor."

https://openalex.org/W2090477486,"Sodium currents and action potentials were characterized in Purkinje neurons from ataxic mice lacking expression of the sodium channel Scn8a. Peak transient sodium current was approximately 60% of that in normal mice, but subthreshold sodium current was affected much more. Steady-state current elicited by voltage ramps was reduced to approximately 30%, and resurgent sodium current, an unusual transient current elicited on repolarization following strong depolarizations, was reduced to 8%-18%. In jolting mice, with a missense mutation in Scn8a, steady-state and resurgent current were also reduced, with altered voltage dependence and kinetics. Both spontaneous firing and evoked bursts of spikes were diminished in cells from null and jolting mice. Evidently Scn8a channels carry most subthreshold sodium current and are crucial for repetitive firing."

https://openalex.org/W2155584359,"Opitz syndrome (OS) is an inherited disorder characterized by midline defects including hypertelorism, hypospadias, lip-palate-laryngotracheal clefts and imperforate anus. We have identified a new gene on Xp22f MIDI (Midline 1), which is disrupted in an OS patient carrying an X-chromosome inversion and is also mutated in several OS families. MID1 encodes a member of the B-box family of proteins, which contain protein–protein interaction domains, including a RING finger, and are implicated in fundamental processes such as body axis patterning and control of cell proliferation. The association of MID1 with OS suggests an important role for this gene in midline development."

https://openalex.org/W1974387854,"The dopamine D3 receptor is expressed primarily in regions of the brain that are thought to influence motivation and motor functions. To specify in vivo D3 receptor function, we generated mutant mice lacking this receptor. Our analysis indicates that in a novel environment, D3 mutant mice are transiently more active than wild-type mice, an effect not associated with anxiety state. Moreover, D3 mutant mice exhibit enhanced behavioral sensitivity to combined injections of D1 and D2 class receptor agonists, cocaine and amphetamine. However, the combined electrophysiological effects of the same D1 and D2 agonists on single neurons within the nucleus accumbens were not altered by the D3 receptor mutation. We conclude that one function of the D3 receptor is to modulate behaviors by inhibiting the cooperative effects of postsynaptic D1 and other D2 class receptors at systems level."
https://openalex.org/W2082607979,"Using microcultured neurons and hippocampal slices, we found that under conditions that completely block AMPA receptors, kainate induces a reduction in the effectiveness of GABAergic synaptic inhibition. Evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were decreased by kainate by up to 90%, showing a bell-shaped dose-response curve similar to that of native kainate-selective receptors. The down-regulation of GABAergic inhibition was not affected by antagonism of metabotropic receptors, while it was attenuated by CNQX. Kainate increased synaptic failures and reduced the frequency of miniature IPSCs, indicating a presynaptic locus of action. In vivo experiments using brain dialysis demonstrated that kainate reversibly abolished recurrent inhibition and induced an epileptic-like electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. These results indicate that kainate receptor activation down-regulates GABAergic inhibition by modulating the reliability of GABA synapses."

https://openalex.org/W1971627794,"The relationship between the loss of connexin 32 function and clinical manifestations of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMTX) disease is unknown. Here, we report that eight of nine CMTX mutations investigated form channels with measurable electrical conductance. Single-channel studies of two mutations demonstrate reduced junctional permeability caused by a decrease in either pore size (S26L) or open channel probability (M34T) that favors residency in a low-conductance substate. Permeation of second messengers such as cAMP through reflexive gap junctions between adjacent cytoplasmic loops of myelinating Schwann cells is likely to be reduced or absent in these channels. We propose that CMTX mutations impair the transduction of signals arising from normal glial-neuronal interactions and thereby cause demyelination and axonal degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2087693296,"The neuropeptide eclosion hormone (EH) is a key regulator of insect ecdysis. We tested the role of the two EH-producing neurons in Drosophila by using an EH cell-specific enhancer to activate cell death genes reaper and head involution defective to ablate the EH cells. In the EH cell knockout flies, larval and adult ecdyses were disrupted, yet a third of the knockouts emerged as adults, demonstrating that EH has a significant but nonessential role in ecdysis. The EH cell knockouts had discrete behavioral deficits, including slow, uncoordinated eclosion and an insensitivity to ecdysis-triggering hormone. The knockouts lacked the lights-on eclosion response despite having a normal circadian eclosion rhythm. This study represents a novel approach to the dissection of neuropeptide regulation of a complex behavioral program."
https://openalex.org/W2138035300,"Recollecting a past episode involves remembering not only what happened but also when it happened. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to directly contrast the neural correlates of item and temporalorder memory. Subjects studied a list of words and were then scanned while retrieving information about what words were in the list or when they occurred within the list. Item retrieval was related to increased neural activity in medial temporal and basal forebrain regions, whereas temporal-order retrieval was associated with activations in dorsal prefrontal, cuneus/precuneus, and right posterior parietal regions. The dissociation between temporal and frontal lobe regions confirms and extends previous lesion data. The results show that temporal-order retrieval involves a network of frontal and posterior brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2057014056,"Oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (VP) are known to be released from dendrites of magnocellular neurons. Here, we show that these peptides reduced evoked EPSCs by a presynaptic mechanism, an effect blocked by peptide antagonists and mimicked by inhibition of endogenous peptidases. Dendritic release of peptides, elicited with depolarization achieved by high frequency stimulation of afferents or with current injection into an individual neuron, induced short-term synaptic depression similar to that seen following exogenous peptide application and was prevented by peptide antagonists. Thus, dendritically released peptides depress evoked EPSCs in magnocellular neurons by activating presynaptic OXT and/or VP receptors. Such a retrograde modulatory action on afferent excitation may serve as a feedback mechanism to permit peptidergic neurosecretory neurons to autoregulate their own activity."

https://openalex.org/W2072115446,"The hypothesis that synaptic functions can be regulated by neurotrophins secreted from the postsynaptic cell was examined in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures. Neuromuscular synapses formed on myocytes overexpressing neurotrophin-4 (M+ synapses) exhibited a higher level of spontaneous synaptic activity and enhanced evoked synaptic transmission as compared to those formed on normal control myocytes (M− synapses). The NT-4 effects involve a potentiation of presynaptic transmitter secretion as well as a lengthening of the mean burst duration of postsynaptic low conductance acetylcholine channels. Repetitive stimulation of either the presynaptic neuron or the postsynaptic myocyte led to a potentiation of synaptic transmission at M+ synapses. All potentiation effects of NT-4 overexpression were abolished by the extracellular presence of TrkB-IgG but not by the presence of TrkA-IgG, indicating that postsynaptic secretion of NT-4 was responsible for the synaptic modification."

https://openalex.org/W2036497142,Ty virus-like particles consist of a single protein species that can be produced in yeast. Recombinant Ty-VLPs carrying a string of up to 15 defined cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from Plasmodium species prime protective CTL responses in mice following a single administration without adjuvant. Effective processing of epitopes from the string was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo and was not affected by flanking sequences.
