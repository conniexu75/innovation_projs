https://openalex.org/W2125391335,"Approximately 70 percent of the mutations in cystic fibrosis patients correspond to a specific deletion of three base pairs, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 of the putative product of the cystic fibrosis gene. Extended haplotype data based on DNA markers closely linked to the putative disease gene locus suggest that the remainder of the cystic fibrosis mutant gene pool consists of multiple, different mutations. A small set of these latter mutant alleles (about 8 percent) may confer residual pancreatic exocrine function in a subgroup of patients who are pancreatic sufficient. The ability to detect mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene at the DNA level has important implications for genetic diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2002896923,"Since the classification of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) into beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes, additional beta-ARs have been implicated in the control of various metabolic processes by catecholamines. A human gene has been isolated that encodes a third beta-AR, here referred to as the ""beta 3-adrenergic receptor."" Exposure of eukaryotic cells transfected with this gene to adrenaline or noradrenaline promotes the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate; only 2 of 11 classical beta-AR blockers efficiently inhibited this effect, whereas two others behaved as beta 3-AR agonists. The potency order of beta-AR agonists for the beta 3-AR correlates with their rank order for stimulating various metabolic processes in tissues where atypical adrenergic sites are thought to exist. In particular, novel beta-AR agonists having high thermogenic, antiobesity, and antidiabetic activities in animal models are among the most potent stimulators of the beta 3-AR."

https://openalex.org/W2090702802,"The activity of an oncoprotein and the secretion of a pheromone can be affected by an unusual protein modification. Specifically, posttranslational modification of yeast a-factor and Ras protein requires an intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This modification is apparently essential for biological activity. Studies of yeast mutants blocked in sterol biosynthesis demonstrated that the membrane association and biological activation of the yeast Ras2 protein require mevalonate, a precursor of sterols and other isoprenes such as farnesyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, drugs that inhibit mevalonate biosynthesis blocked the in vivo action of oncogenic derivatives of human Ras protein in the Xenopus oocyte assay. The same drugs and mutations also prevented the posttranslational processing and secretion of yeast a-factor, a peptide that is farnesylated. Thus, the mevalonate requirement for Ras activation may indicate that attachment of a mevalonate-derived (isoprenoid) moiety to Ras proteins is necessary for membrane association and biological function. These observations establish a connection between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and transformation by the ras oncogene and offer a novel pharmacological approach to investigating, and possibly controlling, ras-mediated malignant transformations."

https://openalex.org/W1563822695,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), also known as cyclin and DNA polymerase delta auxiliary factor, is present in reduced amounts in nongrowing cells and is synthesized at a greater rate in the S phase of growing cells. The recently discovered involvement of PCNA in DNA replication suggested that this pattern of expression functions to regulate DNA synthesis. We have investigated this possibility further by examining the synthesis, stability, and accumulation of PCNA in HeLa cells fractionated by centrifugal elutriation into nearly synchronous populations of cells at various positions in the cell cycle. In these fractionated cells we found that there is an increase in the rate of PCNA synthesis with a peak in early S phase of the cell cycle, but the magnitude of the increase is only 2-3-fold. This change reflects similar changes in the amount of PCNA mRNA. The fluctuating synthesis of PCNA maintains this protein at a roughly constant proportion of the total cell protein, although the amount doubles/cell in the cell cycle. Consistent with this observation, the stability of PCNA does not differ significantly from that of total cellular protein in synchronized HeLa cells. We also observed that a maximum of one-third of the total PCNA is tightly associated with the nucleus, presumably in replication complexes, at the peak of S phase. We conclude that the cyclic synthesis of PCNA in cycling HeLa cells maintains PCNA in excess of the amount involved directly in DNA replication and the amount of the protein neither fluctuates significantly with the cell cycle nor is limiting for DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1975849939,"The products of the cdc13+ and cdc2+ genes form a stable complex that displays protein kinase activity in vitro. p63cdc13 is a substrate of p34cdc2, the catalytic subunit of the kinase. The histone H1 kinase activity of cdc2 oscillates during the cell cycle. Activation of the preformed cdc2/cdc13 complex at the G2/M transition requires cdc25+ gene function. Post-metaphase inactivation of the kinase is associated with loss of cdc13, which shares sequence homology with mitotic cyclins and, in common with these proteins, is degraded at each cell division. cdc13 and cdc2 co-localize in the cell nucleus. cdc2 is not degraded during mitosis, but in the absence of cdc13 it is not localized in the nucleus. These observations suggest that the cdc13+-encoded cyclin acts to regulate both the catalytic properties and the localization of the protein kinase of which it is a subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2082431893,"The protein product of the rodent neu oncogene, p185neu, is a tyrosine kinase with structural similarity to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Transfection and subsequent overexpression of the human p185c-erbB-2 protein transforms NIH 3T3 cells in vitro. However, NIH 3T3 cells are not transformed by overexpressed rodent p185c-neu. NIH 3T3 transfectants overexpressing EGF receptors are not transformed unless incompletely transformed. Several groups have recently demonstrated EGF-induced, EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of p185c-neu. During efforts to characterize the interaction of p185c-neu with EGFR further, we created cell lines that simultaneously overexpress both p185c-neu and EGFR and observed that these cells become transformed. These observations demonstrate that two distinct, overexpressed tyrosine kinases can act synergistically to transform NIH 3T3 cells, thus identifying a novel mechanism that can lead to transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1580725718,"Abstract Previously we isolated and characterized a differentially expressed gene from mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that encodes stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1; Ntambi, J. M., Buhrow, S. A., Kaestner, K. H., Christy, R. J., Sibley, E., Kelly, T. J., Jr., and Lane, M. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17291-17300). Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated the existence of another closely related gene. Here we report the isolation and characterization of this gene and the corresponding cDNA which encode a second stearoyl-CoA desaturase, SCD2, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. SCD2 cDNA is 5 kilobase pairs in length and encodes a protein of 358 amino acids with greater than 87% amino acid sequence identity to SCD1. RNase protection analysis reveals a 10-fold increase in the expression of SCD2 mRNA during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. SCD2 mRNA is expressed constitutively at a high level in brain, is not expressed in liver, and its expression in kidney, adipose, and lung tissue is increased greatly by shifting mice from a diet containing unsaturated fatty acids to a diet devoid of fat. The tissue distribution and the dietary alteration of SCD1 mRNA expression differs markedly from that of SCD2 mRNA being absent from brain, constitutive in adipose tissue, and subject to negative control in liver by feeding a diet containing unsaturated fatty acids. The SCD2 gene spans approximately 15 kilobase pairs and consists of six exons and five introns, with intron/exon junctions similar to those of SCD1. As determined by primer extension analysis the start site of transcription maps 300 nucleotides upstream of the initiator methionine codon. Unlike the SCD1 gene, SCD2 lacks a typical TATA box in the 5'-flanking region, but has two boxes at positions -90 and -135 relative to the transcription initiation site. The SCD2 promoter contains a 140-base pair sequence (located between nucleotides -54 and -201) which possesses 77% sequence identity to a region (located between nucleotides -472 and -325) in the SCD1 promoter. There is a GC-rich sequence in the SCD2 promoter (at nucleotide -175) similar to the binding site for the nuclear transcription factor Sp1 as well as an element with homology to the core consensus sequence for the glucocorticoid regulatory element position -500 and a potential CCAAT box/enhance binding protein sequence at position -540. The SCD gene family provides a new model system for the study of differentiation-induced as well as tissue-specific metabolite controlled gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2008564146,"Mutagen treatment of mouse P815 tumor cells produces immunogenic mutants that express new transplantation antigens (tum- antigens) recognized by cytolytic T cells. We found that the gene conferring expression of tum- antigen P91A contains 12 exons, encoding a 60 kd protein lacking a typical N-terminal signal sequence. The sequence shows no significant similarity with sequences in current data bases. A mutation that causes expression of the antigen is located in exon 4; it is the only apparent difference between the normal and the antigenic alleles. A short synthetic peptide corresponding to a region of exon 4 located around this mutation makes P815 cells sensitive to lysis by anti-P91A cytolytic T cells. The mutation creates a strong aggretope enabling the peptide to bind the H-2 Ld molecule. Several secondary tumor cell variants that no longer express tum- antigen P91A were found to carry deletions in the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2030701381,"p60 is a cellular protein that binds to the adenovirus E1A protein complex in virally infected or transformed human cells. In both infected and uninfected cells, p60 was found in a complex with the cdc2 protein kinase. Immune complexes containing p60 and cdc2 display a cell cycle-dependent histone H1 kinase activity that is most active in interphase. The previously described cdc2-p62/cyclin complex also acts as a histone H1 kinase but is maximally active in mitotic metaphase. The shift in the timing of activation of different cdc2-containing complexes suggests that each might play a distinct role in regulation of the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2075915920,"Hox-1.1 is a murine homeobox-containing gene expressed in a time- and cell-specific manner during embryogenesis. We have generated transgenic mice that ectopically express Hox-1.1 from the chicken beta-actin promoter. In these mice Hox-1.1 expression was changed to an almost ubiquitous pattern. Ectopic expression of Hox-1.1 leads to death of the transgenic animals shortly after birth and is associated with multiple craniofacial anomalies, such as cleft palate, open eyes at birth, and nonfused pinnae. This phenotype is similar to the effects seen after systemic administration of retinoic acid during gestation. This suggests that retinoic acid embryopathy and the specific developmental defects caused by ectopic expression of a potential developmental control gene share a common pathogenic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2101959682,"Mouse macrophages and lymphocytes express two distinct isoforms of a single class of Fc receptor for IgG. The macrophage isoform (FcRII-B2) is identical to the lymphocyte isoform (FcRII-B1) except for an inframe insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of FcRII-B1 that increases its length from 47 to 94 amino acids. To determine the functional significance of this cytoplasmic domain variation, presumably the result of alternative mRNA splicing, we expressed both isoforms in receptor-negative fibroblasts. While FcRII-B2 mediated the efficient ligand internalization and delivery to lysosomes, endocytosis via FcRII-B1--and via a tailminus mutant--was relatively inefficient. This difference reflected the inability of FcRII-B1 (and the tailminus mutant) to accumulate in clathrin-coated pits. Thus, the FcRII-B2 cytoplasmic tail contains a domain needed for accumulation in coated pits, and this domain is disrupted by the 47 amino acid insertion in FcRII-B1."

Cultured astrocytes were shown to express certain neuropeptide genes, with specificity for both the gene expressed and the brain region from which the cells were prepared. Somatostatin messenger RNA and peptides were detected only in cerebellar astrocytes, whereas proenkephalin messenger RNA and enkephalin peptides were present in astrocytes of cortex, cerebellum, and striatum. Cholecystokinin was not expressed in any of the cells. These results support the hypothesis that peptides synthesized in astrocytes may play a role in the development of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2023584631,"In an electrographic model of seizures in the hippocampal slice, both of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) prevented the progressive development of seizures but did not block previously induced seizures. Thus, a process dependent on the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex establishes a long-lasting, seizure-prone state; thereafter the seizures depend on non-NMDA receptor-ionophore mechanisms. This suggests that there is an important distinction between epileptogenesis and seizure expression and between antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant pharmacological agents."

https://openalex.org/W1599886286,"Abstract We studied transepithelial transport of 3H-labeled hydrophobic cationic drugs in epithelia formed by wild-type and by drug-resistant Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCk) cells that had been infected with a retrovirus carrying the multidrug-resistance (MDR1) cDNA which encodes the P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein is an ATP consuming plasma membrane multidrug transporter responsible for the efflux of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs from resistant cancer cells. Wild-type MDCK cells have small amounts of P-glycoprotein detected by immunoprecipitation. Net transepithelial transport across wild-type MDCK epithelia was demonstrated. Basal to apical flux of 100 nM vinblastine was about six times higher than apical to basal flux. Addition of unlabeled vinblastine reduced basal to apical flux of tracer and increased apical to basal flux of tracer, a pattern expected if there is a saturable pump that extrudes vinblastine at the apical plasma membrane. Daunomycin, vincristine, and actinomycin D were also actively transported and at 20 microM these agents inhibited transport of vinblastine, suggesting that wild-type MDCK cells have a common transporter for all these drugs. Vinblastine transport was also inhibited by 20 microM verapamil, which inhibits the multidrug transporter and reverses multidrug-resistance in non-polarized cells. Net transepithelial transport of all these cytotoxic drugs and of verapamil was much higher in epithelia formed by MDCK cells infected with a human MDR1 virus (MDR-MDCK) which is expressed on the apical surface of MDR-MDCK monolayers. Because the transport of these cytotoxic drugs and verapamil is increased in MDR-MDCK epithelia compared to wild-type MDCK epithelia, transport in both these cell populations can be attributed to P-glycoprotein. These results are consistent with a role for P-glycoprotein in multidrug secretory transport across the epithelium of the proximal tubule since P-glycoprotein is normally expressed on the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells."

https://openalex.org/W1562811405,"Two genes that encode enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and HMG-CoA synthase, and the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor are repressed when sterols accumulate in animal cells. Their 5'-flanking regions contain a common element, designated sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE-1). In the HMG-CoA synthase and LDL receptor promoters, the SRE-1 enhances transcription in the absence of sterols and is inactivated in the presence of sterols. In the HMG-CoA reductase promoter, the region containing the SRE-1 represses transcription when sterols are present. In the current studies, we show that the SRE-1 retains enhancer function but loses sterol sensitivity in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that are resistant to the repressor, 25-hydroxycholesterol. In the absence of sterols, the mutant cells produced high levels of all three sterol-regulated mRNAs, and there was no repression by 25-hydroxycholesterol. When transfected with plasmids containing each of the regulated promoters fused to a bacterial reporter gene, the mutant cells showed high levels of transcription in the absence of sterols and no significant repression by sterols. When the SRE-1 in the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase promoters was mutated prior to transfection into the mutant cells, transcription was markedly reduced. Thus, the 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant cells retain a protein that enhances transcription by binding to the SRE-1 in the absence of sterols, but they have lost the function of a protein that abolishes this enhancement in the presence of sterols. Mutation of a 30-base pair segment of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter that contains the SRE-1 did not reduce transcription in the mutant cells, indicating that this promoter is driven by elements other than the SRE-1. Nevertheless, this promoter failed to be repressed by sterols in the mutant cells. These data suggest that a common factor mediates the effects of sterols on the SRE-1 in all three promoters and that this factor has been functionally lost in the 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514833389,"During investigations of the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by protein phosphorylation, a novel protein kinase activity has been discovered in rat pheochromocytoma. Originally detected as a trace contaminant in preparations of highly purified TH, this novel kinase activity phosphorylated TH at serine 8 in the proline-rich amino-terminal region of the enzyme. This particular site is not phosphorylated by, nor is the amino acid sequence surrounding this site selective for, any of the classical (i.e. well characterized) protein kinases. In this report, we describe the identification, characterization, and partial purification of this novel protein kinase. By utilizing a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal region of TH, a selective assay for this protein kinase was developed. The kinase activity utilized ATP and magnesium, although GTP could also be utilized as a phosphate donor. The kinase activity was found to co-purify with TH activity through ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography and could be only partially resolved from TH by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. Substantial kinase activity could be resolved from TH by phosphocellulose chromatography. The novel kinase migrates as a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa on gel permeation chromatography as well as sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Studies of site specificity indicate that this Ser/Thr kinase activity appears to be directed by an adjacent (carboxyl-terminal) proline residue, exhibiting a minimal recognition sequence of -X-Ser/Thr-Pro-X-. In addition to TH, this proline-directed protein kinase will also phosphorylate synapsin I, histone H1, and glycogen synthase, suggesting that this kinase may have multiple substrates in vivo. Additional findings indicate that the activity of proline-directed protein kinase is increased transiently in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells following treatment with nerve growth factor. Distinctions between this novel kinase and other well characterized protein kinases can be made on the basis of phosphorylation site specificity, chromatographic behavior, and physical characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2000612768,"even-skipped (eve) is a homeodomain-encoding gene that is a genetically defined repressor of Ultrabithorax (Ubx), fushi-tarazu (ftz), and wingless (wg). Here we report that purified eve protein represses transcription in vitro at the Ubx promoter, in a DNA binding site-dependent manner. eve protein represses transcription when bound either upstream or downstream of the RNA start site or when DNA binding sites are in either orientation. We also show that eve represses expression from the Ubx promoter in Drosophila tissue culture cells, again in a binding site-dependent manner. Deletion of eve DNA binding sites does not alter transcription in the absence of eve, and so repression is not likely to be the result of eve competitively inhibiting an activator protein from binding to the same DNA element. Instead, we propose that eve protein is probably interfering with the function of proteins bound at other locations in the promoter. The biochemical demonstration that a Drosophila homeodomain protein can directly regulate RNA synthesis strengthens the view that this class of regulators act as transcription factors to control development."
https://openalex.org/W1581963549,"Abstract The synthesis of is regulated at the translation level in coordination with iron availability. Under conditions of low iron, translation of mRNA is repressed and the majority of mRNA is non-polysomal. Upon an increase in iron, translation of mRNA is derepressed resulting in as much as a 50-100-fold increase in the rate of synthesis. This regulation is mediated at least in part by a specific translational repressor which binds to a conserved sequence, the iron responsive element, located in the 5'-untranslated region of mRNA. In this communication we report the purification of such a repressor from rabbit liver. This repressor, which we call the ferritin repressor protein, has an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. It inhibits translation of mRNA in a highly specific fashion when added to a wheat germ lysate programmed with liver poly(A+) mRNA. In addition, it binds specifically to sequences contained within the first 92 nucleotides of mRNA, most likely the iron responsive element. Analysis of highly purified repressor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that it is composed primarily of a single polypeptide of approximately 90 kDa. Elution of this 90-kDa polypeptide from a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel followed by renaturation and analysis for repressor activity shows that it both binds to the 5'-untranslated region of mRNA and represses its translation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1588194000,"Abstract The family of G-protein-linked receptors includes many important pharmacological targets, of which the beta-adrenergic receptor is one of the best characterized. A better understanding of those factors that determine whether a ligand functions as an antagonist or as an agonist would facilitate the development of pharmaceutical agents that act at these receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor has implicated the conserved Asp113 residue in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor in the interaction with cationic amine agonists and antagonists (Strader, C. D., Sigal, I. S., Candelore, M. R., Rands, E., Hill, W. S., and Dixon, R. A. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem, 263, 10267-10271). We now report that substitution of Asp113 with a glutamic acid residue results in a mutant beta-adrenergic receptor which recognizes several known beta-adrenergic antagonists as partial agonists. This partial agonist activity requires the presence of a carboxylate side chain on the amino acid residue at position 113 and is not observed when an asparagine residue is substituted at this position. These observations support the existence of overlapping binding sites for agonists and antagonists on the beta-adrenergic receptor and demonstrate that genetic engineering of receptors can complement structure-activity studies of ligands in defining the molecular interactions involved in receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1538045792,"Cathepsin G is a 26,000-Da serine protease that is found in the azurophil granules of neutrophils and monocytes. The cathepsin G gene is expressed at high levels in U937 promonocytic cells, but is down-regulated with phorbol-induced differentiation. To characterize the genomic sequences responsible for the regulated expression of this gene, we screened a human genomic fibroblast library using cathepsin G cDNA, and obtained two lambda clones that contained the cathepsin G locus. The cathepsin G gene spans 2.7 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. The genomic organization of cathepsin G is similar to that of human neutrophil elastase, rat mast cell protease II, murine adipsin, and murine cytotoxic T-cell serine proteases, with protease catalytic residues located near the borders of exons 2, 3, and 5. Using in situ hybridization techniques, we localized cathepsin G to chromosome 14q11.2, a site that is near the alpha/delta T-cell receptor complex. Cathepsin G transcription is abolished in U937 nuclei with 2 micrograms/ml alpha-amanitin, indicating that this gene is probably transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The 5' end of the cathepsin G gene was defined by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays. A TATA box is found at position -29, and a CAAT box is found at -69 with respect to the transcription initiation site. Having defined the genomic structure and chromosomal location of cathepsin G, we are now attempting to identify the DNA elements in or near this gene that mediate its tissue and development-specific pattern of expression."

The tctex-1 gene family produces an abundant, virtually germ cell-specific transcript that is 8-fold overexpressed in t homozygotes. The aberrant expression of tctex-1 is solely dependent on the t haplotype genes and occurs only in germ cells. The chromosomal location and pattern of expression of tctex-1 make it a candidate for involvement in male sterility."
https://openalex.org/W1966834718,"Previous experiments have suggested that negative charge is an important aspect of the activating region of lambda repressor as it is for at least one class of eukaryotic transcriptional activators. Here we randomize amino acids in the activating region of repressor and assay the function of over 100 variants. We find that acidic residues at the four solvent-exposed positions on the surface of an α helix (helix 2 in the structure) together comprise a strong activating region. Only one of these acidic residues, however, is critical for activation, and at this position glutamate is strongly preferred to aspartate. At the three remaining positions, certain uncharged residues (different ones at each position) function as well as or better than the acidic residues. Basic residues, however, are highly detrimental to function at all four positions. Our mutagenesis studies also suggest limitations on amino acid substitutions that allow formation of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif found in repressor and in many other DNA binding regulatory proteins."

These cells could be grown in culture for at least 25 generations and required anemic chicken serum as a source of erythropoietic growth factors. XJ12 can infect erythrocyte progenitor cells in vivo but is not sufficient to induce erythroleukemia.

https://openalex.org/W1517567121,"Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used to demonstrate coordinate regulation of three enzymes of cholesterol synthesis under a variety of conditions. Addition of either delipidized serum and mevinolin or low density lipoprotein, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or mevalonic acid to HepG2 cells resulted in rapid changes both in the levels of the mRNAs and in the rates of synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (prenyltranferase). In all cases, the changes in mRNA levels were paralleled by changes in the rates of specific protein synthesis. Pulse-chase techniques were used to determine the half-lives of all three proteins. Addition of low density lipoprotein to the media during the chase increased the rate of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase 4.6-fold but had no affect on the half-lives of HMG-CoA synthase or prenyltransferase. Therefore, we conclude that the coordinate regulation of these three enzymes under a variety of conditions occurs at the level of enzyme synthesis and not at the level of protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1506739165,"The multidrug transporter is a 170,000-dalton membrane glycoprotein which confers multidrug resistance through its activity as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for hydrophobic, cytotoxic drugs. To determine the essential structural components of this complex membrane transporter we have altered an MDR1 cDNA in an expression vector by deletion and insertion mutations. The structure of the transporter deduced from its amino acid sequence suggests that it consists of two homologous, perhaps functionally autonomous, halves each with six transmembrane segments and a cytoplasmic ATP-binding domain. However, several carboxyl-terminal deletions, one involving 53 amino acids, the second removing 253 amino acids, and an internal deletion within the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, totally eliminate the ability of the mutant transporter to confer drug resistance. An internal deletion of the amino-terminal half, which removed residues 140-229, is also nonfunctional. Small carboxylterminal deletions of up to 23 amino acids leave a functional transporter, although the removal of 23 COOH-terminal amino acids reduces its ability to confer colchicine resistance. Insertions of 4 amino acids in a transmembrane domain, and in one of the two ATP-binding regions, have no effect on activity. These studies define some of the limits of allowable deletions and insertions in the MDR1 gene, and demonstrate the requirement for two intact halves of the molecule for a functional multidrug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1537223245,"Elongation Factor 1α (EF-1α), an important eukaryotic translation factor, transports charged aminoacyl-tRNA from the cytosol to the ribosomes during poly-peptide synthesis. Metabolic radiolabeling with [3H] ethanolamine shows that, in all cells examined, EF-1α is the major radiolabeled protein. Radiolabeled EF-1α has an apparent Mr = 53,000 and a basic isoelectric point. It is cytosolic and does not contain N-linked oligosaccharides. Trypsin digestion of murine EF-1α generated two major [3H]ethanolamine-labeled peptides. Three peptides were sequenced and were identical to two distinct regions of the human EF-1α protein. Blank sequencing cycles coinciding with glutamic acid in the human cDNA-derived sequence were also found to release [3H]ethanolamine, and compositional analysis of these peptides confirmed the presence of glutamic acid. Dansylation analysis demonstrates that the amine group of the ethanolamine is blocked. These results indicate that EF-1α is posttranslationally modified by the covalent attachment of ethanolamine via an amide bond to at least two specific glutamic acid residues (Glu-301 and Glu-374). The hydroxyl group of the attached ethanolamine was shown by mass spectrometry and compositional analysis, to be further modified by the addition of a phosphoglycerol unit. This novel posttranslational modification may represent an important alteration of EF-1α, comparable to the regulatory effects of posttranslational methylation of EF-1α lysine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1536728263,"Abstract The structures of the complexes of carboxypeptidase A with the amino acids D-phenylalanine and D-tyrosine are reported as determined by x-ray crystallographic methods to a resolution of 2.0 A. In each individual study one molecule of amino acids binds to the enzyme in the COOH-terminal hydrophobic pocket: the carboxylate of the bound ligand salt links with Arg-145, and the alpha-amino group salt links with Glu-270. The carboxylate of Glu-270 must break its hydrogen bond with the native zinc-bound water molecule in order to exploit the latter interaction. This result is in accord with spectroscopic studies which indicate that the binding of D or L amino acids (or analogues thereof) allows for more facile displacement of the metal-bound water by anions (Bicknell, R., Schaffer, A., Bertini, I., Luchinat, C., Vallee, B. L., and Auld, D. S. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1050-1057). Additionally, we observe a significant movement of the zinc-bound water molecule (approximately 1 A) upon the binding of D-ligands. We propose that this unanticipated movement also contributes to anion sensitivity. The structural results of the current x-ray study correct predictions made in an early model building study regarding the binding of D-phenylalanine (Lipscomb, W. N., Hartsuck, J. A., Reeke, G. N., Jr., Quiocho, F. A., Bethge, P. H., Ludwig, M. L., Steitz, T. A., Muirhead, H., and Coppola, J. C. (1968) Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 21, 24-90)."
https://openalex.org/W1600940333,"Synthetic peptides including the gamma-carboxylation recognition site and acidic amino acids were compared as substrates for vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation by bovine liver carboxylase. The 28-residue proPT28 (proprothrombin -18 to +10) and proFIX28 (pro-Factor IX -18 to +10) were carboxylated with a Km of 3 microM. The Vmax of proPT28 was 2-3 times greater than that of proFIX28. An analog of proFIX28 that contained the prothrombin propeptide had a Vmax 2-3-fold greater than an analog of proPT28 that contained the Factor IX propeptide. proFIX28/RS-1, based upon Factor IX Cambridge, proFIX28/RQ-4, based upon Factor IX Oxford 3, and proFIX28 had equivalent Km and Vmax values. Analogs of proPT28 containing Ala6-Glu7 or Glu6-Ala7 were carboxylated at equivalent rates. A peptide containing Asp6-Asp7 was carboxylated at a rate of about 1% of that of Glu carboxylation. Carboxylation of peptides containing Asp6-Glu7 and Glu6-Asp7 yielded results identical with peptides containing Ala6-Glu7 and Glu6-Ala7. Carboxymethylcysteine was not carboxylated when substituted for Glu6 in a peptide containing Asp7. These results indicate that the prothrombin propeptide is more efficient in the carboxylation process than is the Factor IX propeptide, but that both propeptides direct carboxylation; the gamma-carboxylation recognition site does not include residues -4 and -1; aspartic acid and carboxymethylcysteine are poor substrates for the carboxylase, but aspartic acid does not inhibit the carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1548765484,"Abstract Swelling of S49 mouse lymphoma cells in hyposmolar medium was used to examine the effects of cellular deformation on cAMP metabolism. In S49 wild type mouse lymphoma cells incubated in a defined medium, progressive reductions in medium osmolarity of 5-50% resulted in proportionate expansion of cell volume. Increases in cell volume were accompanied by incremental increases in intracellular cAMP and calcium. These responses in S49 cells occurred rapidly, with increases in calcium concentration and cAMP content occurring within 1-2 min. Swelling of S49 cells in the absence of ions (hyposmolar versus normosmolar sorbitol) resulted in a significant accumulation of cAMP. Inclusion of papaverine or isobutyl methylxanthine amplified cAMP accumulation, and omission of calcium, sodium, or magnesium from the medium attenuated, but did not prevent accumulation of cAMP in S49 cells in response to swelling. Exposure to propranolol or nadolol attenuated the ability of swelling to increase cAMP concentration, while treatment with 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine or phentolamine had no effect on swelling-induced cAMP accumulation. It is concluded that cellular deformation of S49 wild type mouse lymphoma cells stimulates rapid accumulation of intracellular calcium and cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1593474768,"Abstract In multidrug-resistant murine J774.2 cells, the mdr1a and mdr1b genes encode the 120- and 125-kDa P-glycoprotein precursors, respectively (Hsu, S. I., Lothstein, L., and Horwitz, S.B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12053-12062). It is shown here that a J774.2 cell line selected for vinblastine resistance (J7.V3) switched from the 125- to 120-kDa precursor when cells that were maintained in 20 nM vinblastine were grown in 40 nM vinblastine for 20 months. The rate of switching was accelerated by growing cells in higher levels of vinblastine. These findings suggest that cells which express mdr1a have a selective growth advantage compared to cells which express mdr1b. Consistent with this hypothesis, the switching event that occurs in cells maintained at 40 nM vinblastine was correlated with 3.5-5-fold higher levels of resistance to vinblastine, taxol, and doxorubicin in the absence of any detectable increase in the amount of immunoreactive P-glycoprotein. These findings suggest that P-glycoproteins derived from mdr1a and mdr1b are functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1603228900,"The observation that aliphatic diamines become poor substrates as the carbon chain length decreases and that ethylenediamine, the shortest diamine, is an irreversible inhibitor of lysyl oxidase led to the investigation of the mechanism of inhibition by ethylenediamine. The cis but not the trans isomer of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane was also a potent irreversible inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, consistent with the interaction of both amino groups of vicinal diamines with an enzyme moiety. Both cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane and ethylenediamine but not trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane markedly perturbed the spectrum of free pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a covalently linked form of which is the carbonyl cofactor of lysyl oxidase. cis-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane also induced similar changes in the spectrum of lysyl oxidase. The perturbations of the spectra of PQQ or of lysyl oxidase by cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane or ethylenediamine as well as the development of irreversible inhibition of the enzyme by cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane or ethylenediamine were all markedly reduced under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, approximately 1 mol of H2O2 was released per mol of PQQ or lysyl oxidase upon aerobic incubation with cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, while approximately 2 mol of 3H+ were released from cis-[1,2-3H] 1,2-diaminocyclohexane per mol of PQQ or lysyl oxidase under corresponding conditions. A proposal for the mechanism of inhibition of lysyl oxidase by vicinal diamines is presented which involves limited oxidation of the diamine linked to PQQ at the active site so that the PQQ-diamine complex is finally stabilized by a conjugated 6-membered ring."

https://openalex.org/W1521169732,"Previous studies have shown that palytoxin, a non-(12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-type tumor promoter, is able to down-modulate the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor through a sodium-dependent pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells. A role for sodium is supported by the observation that the sodium proton exchanger monensin and the sodium-conducting ionophore gramicidin mimic palytoxin action by causing a decrease in both high and low affinity EGF binding. However, in addition to causing sodium influx, these agents can induce other cellular effects including changes in membrane polarization, intracellular pH, and macromolecular synthesis. To determine whether any of these factors might be responsible for palytoxin action in our system, we examined the role of each of them in palytoxin-induced inhibition of EGF binding. Although palytoxin depolarizes the membrane, the observation that potassium-induced depolarization of the membrane does not cause a decrease in EGF binding, in conjunction with the fact that monensin hyperpolarizes the membrane, indicates that depolarization of the membrane is not responsible for palytoxin-induced changes in the EGF receptor. An investigation of intra-cellular pH suggests that the palytoxin effects are not mediated by proton flux. In addition, nigericin-mediated changes in intracellular pH do not cause an inhibition of EGF binding. Finally, studies conducted in the presence of cycloheximide indicate that protein synthesis is not required for palytoxin action and that inhibition of EGF receptor biosynthesis does not account for palytoxin-induced loss of EGF-binding sites. These results suggest that sodium may act as a second messenger in the signal transduction mechanism by which palytoxin modulates the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1543415469,"Abstract The two major dietary sugars, fructose and sucrose, were found to suppress effectively the biosynthetic renewal of brush border enzymes in the gut. When studied in cultured explants of pig small intestine mucosa, 10-50 mM concentrations of fructose completely prevented the expression of mature aminopeptidase N and severely reduced that of sucrase-isomaltase. The instantly occurring and reversible suppressive effect manifested itself as a leupeptin-sensitive degradation of newly synthesized brush border enzymes. The likely mechanism of action of the dietary sugar is by causing an abnormal cotranslational glycosylation that in turn triggers a rapid proteolytic breakdown. Our findings suggest that renewal of digestive brush border enzymes is transiently suppressed during intake of fructose- or sucrose-rich meals."
https://openalex.org/W1502454614,"Abstract The regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in isolated rat pinealocytes was studied using the fluorescent pH indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Resting pHi was 7.09 when the extracellular pH (pHe) was 7.2. Treatment of pinealocytes with the physiological regulator of pineal function, norepinephrine, resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in pHi. Further analysis indicated that norepinephrine is probably acting via an alpha 1-adrenergic----[Ca2+]i----Ca2+/phospholipid- dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) mechanism to activate the Na+/H+ antiporter, thereby causing cytoplasmic alkalization. A potential influence of cytosolic alkalization on the responsiveness of cyclic nucleotides to adrenergic agonists was also studied. Five analogs of the antiporter inhibitor amiloride reduced norepinephrine stimulation of cGMP accumulation with the same relative potency as they act on the antiporter. In contrast, although inhibitory effects of these compounds on cAMP accumulation were detectable, they occurred at 10-100-fold higher concentrations, and the relative potency of these inhibitors did not indicate they were acting via the antiporter. These findings provide evidence that 1) alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation increases pinealocyte pHi through Ca2+----protein kinase C-dependent activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter; and 2) norepinephrine stimulation of cGMP accumulation is pHi-dependent. It would appear that alpha 1-adrenergic regulation of pHi via the Na+/H+ antiporter may be of general importance in the control of cGMP accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1579801351,"Abstract alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors (alpha 2-AR) are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase via the GTP-binding protein Gi. However, inhibition of adenylylcyclase does not account for many effector cell responses to alpha 2-AR agonists, suggesting that the receptor can couple to other signal transduction pathways. One potential pathway may be the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange elicited by alpha 2-AR activation in renal proximal tubule cells, platelets, and the NG-10815 cell line. To determine whether the various receptor-effector coupling mechanisms operate in a tissue-specific manner, we studied the effect of alpha 2-AR activation on basal and stimulated Na+/H+ exchange in epithelial cells isolated from human colon (HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells). Na+/H+ exchange was measured by quantitation of intracellular hydrogen ion concentration (acetoxymethyl ester 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)carboxyfluorescein) and 22Na+ uptake. HT-29 cells expressed an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger that was activated by reduction of intracellular pH (pHi) to 6.0 but was quiescent at a physiological pHi. The rapid alkalinization observed after acid loading (0.57 +/- 0.07 pH units/min/10(4) cells) was dependent on external sodium and was blocked by amiloride (Ki approximately 2.1 microM). Although epinephrine and the selective alpha 2-AR agonists clonidine and UK-14304 inhibited forskolin-activated adenylylcyclase, these compounds did not alter basal Na+/H+ exchange. Stimulated Na+/H+ exchange was similarly unaffected by epinephrine. In contrast, stimulated Na+/H+ exchanger activity was completely inhibited by the selective alpha 2-agonists clonidine, UK-14304, and guanabenz. This inhibitory effect was not blocked by the alpha 2-AR antagonist rauwolscine, and it is likely due to a direct interaction with the exchanger molecule itself. Structure/activity studies indicated that the compounds inhibiting exchanger activity possess either an imidazoline or guanidinium moiety. Although these molecules bear structural similarity to amiloride, they did not inhibit the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel in toad urinary bladder, suggesting that these compounds may be useful as amiloride-like ligands selective for the Na+/H+ exchanger. These data indicate that in the HT-29 intestinal cell line, in contrast to observations in other tissues, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are not coupled to the Na+/H+ exchanger, suggesting that the cell-signaling mechanisms utilized by the alpha 2-AR are tissue specific."
https://openalex.org/W1529915648,"Deletions within the structural exotoxin A gene of 27 or 119 amino acids in domain I of the mature polypeptide, or of 88 or 105 amino acids in domains I and II, resulted in the synthesis of exotoxin A (ETA) polypeptides that were not secreted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa hosts but were localized in the cell membrane. Insertions of a hexanucleotide sequence, either pCGAGCT or pCGAATT, at TaqI sites within the gene resulted in variant exotoxin A polypeptides which were secreted normally. pCGAGCT causes insertion of either Glu-Leu or Ser-Ser in the amino acid sequence of the toxin, while pCGAATT causes insertion of either Glu-Phe or Asn-Ser dipeptides. Although the cytotoxicity of eight variants was unimpaired, that of four others was reduced, and one variant which had a Glu-Phe insert between residues 60 and 61 (ETA-60EF61) was 500-fold less cytotoxic than wild-type exotoxin A. Purified ETA-60EF61 dissociated much faster from mouse LMTK- cells than wild-type ETA, suggesting that the insertion impaired the ability of ETA-60EF61 to interact with exotoxin A receptors. The location of the insert is within a major concavity on the surface of domain I of the exotoxin A molecule, suggesting that this concavity is important for toxin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1533050181,"Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of aspartate transcarbamoylase bound with CTP have detected molecular asymmetry in the interface between the catalytic and regulatory subunits (Kim, K. H., Pan, Z., Honzatko, R. B., Ke, H.-M., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 863-875). In three of the six interfaces, a salt link occurs between Arg130 of the regulatory chain and Glu204 of the catalytic chain; however, these same residues are 15 A apart in the other three interfaces. In order to determine if this is important for the function of the enzyme, two mutant versions of aspartate transcarbamoylase were created by site-specific mutagenesis. Glu204 of the catalytic chain was converted to a glutamine (Glu204c----Gln) and Arg130 of the regulatory chain was converted to a glycine (Arg130r----Gly). The thermal stability of the Arg130r----Gly enzyme is dramatically reduced, whereas the thermal stability of the Glu204c----Gln enzyme is unaltered compared to the wild-type enzyme. The maximal velocity of both mutant enzymes is identical with that of the wild-type enzyme, however both mutant enzymes have altered substrate affinity and regulatory properties. Based on these studies, the link between Glu204 of the catalytic chain and Arg130 of the regulatory chain is important for the heterotropic properties of the enzyme. Furthermore, the interface between the domain of the regulatory chain which binds zinc and the domain of the catalytic chain which binds aspartate may be more important for CTP inhibition than ATP activation. These data also suggest that heterotropic cooperativity is very sensitive to alterations in the catalytic-regulatory interface. However, no clear relationship has been observed between the structural asymmetry and the function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1576022716,"Abstract The effects of modifying individual lysyl, aspartyl, or glutamyl residues in calmodulin on its ability to bind to the neural phosphatase calcineurin have been investigated using a competitive binding method termed label selection. Samples of calmodulin were radiochemically labeled at a low level (0.03-0.6 group/molecule) by acetylation of amino groups or coupling carboxyl groups with ethanolamine to produce preparations containing predominantly single-site modified and unmodified molecules. These preparations were incubated in a 5-10-fold molar excess with bovine calcineurin under conditions appropriate for complex formation. The bound population was isolated, and the level of modification of each reactive residue was compared with the level in the corresponding group in the intial unselected preparation to determine if molecules modified at specific sites had been selected for or against during the competition for complex formation. Significant selection was observed against molecules modified at Lys21, Asp64, Glu67, Lys75, Glu84, Glu114, Asp118, or Lys148, whereas modification of Glu83 increased binding. The modification of other groups, including components of the four Ca2+-binding sites, had no effect on the interaction. Glu67, a Ca2+-liganding residue in Ca2+-binding site II that may regulate the orientation of this site in relation to the central helix, had the strongest influence on complex formation. Most of the residues identified form a nearly linear array in the three-dimensional structure of calmodulin and indicate the location of an extended surface for interaction with calcineurin and other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1630304437,"Liver mitochondria from rats treated with gluconeogenic hormones or subjected to vigorous exercise consume oxygen more rapidly than do mitochondria from control rats. These treatments result in elevated mitochondrial malate concentrations, which facilitate the entry of added substrate into the mitochondria. In this paper we describe experiments conducted to determine the source of the extra malate. Injections of glutamate plus alanine, two amino acids that are increased in blood after exercise and hormone treatment, caused liver mitochondrial malate to be increased. Injections of glucagon, cortisol, or both hormones elevated liver mitochondrial malate concentrations in both adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats."
