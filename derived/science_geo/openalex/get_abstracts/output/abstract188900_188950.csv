https://openalex.org/W2042994480,"Several cell surface molecules have been proposed as receptor candidates, mediating cell entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) on the basis of their physical association with virions or with soluble HCV E2 glycoproteins. However, due to the lack of infectious HCV particles, evidence that these receptor candidates support infection was missing. Using our recently described infectious HCV pseudotype particles (HCVpp) that display functional E1E2 glycoprotein complexes, here we show that HCV is a pH-dependent virus, implying that its receptor component(s) mediate virion internalization by endocytosis. Expression of the CD81 tetraspanin in non-permissive CD81-negative hepato-carcinoma cells was sufficient to restore susceptibility to HCVpp infection, confirming its critical role as a cell attachment factor. As a cell surface molecule likely to mediate endosomal trafficking, we demonstrate that the human scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein-internalization molecule that we previously proposed as a novel HCV receptor candidate due to its affinity with E2 glycoproteins, is required for infection of CD81-expressing hepatic cells. By receptor competition assays, we found that SR-B1 antibodies that blocked binding of soluble E2 could prevent HCVpp infectivity. Furthermore, we establish that the hyper-variable region 1 of the HCV E2 glycoprotein is a critical determinant mediating entry in SR-B1-positive cells. Finally, by correlating expression of HCV receptors and infectivity, we suggest that, besides CD81 and SR-B1, additional hepatocyte-specific co-factor(s) are necessary for HCV entry.

About 170 million individuals are infected with HCV. The predominant site of replication and probably infection is the liver, yet several studies have suggested that HCV may infect other cell types, such as B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells (2Lerat H. Rumin S. Habersetzer F. Berby F. Trabaud M.A. Trepo C. Inchauspe G. Blood. 1998; 91: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Navas M.C. Fuchs A. Schvoerer E. Bohbot A. Aubertin A.M. Stoll-Keller F. J. Med. Virol. 2002; 67: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where it could induce immune dysfunctions. Understanding the molecular basis by which HCV targets liver cells and extra-hepatic sites is critical to unravel the mechanisms of its pathogenesis and disease chronicity. Although substantial progresses have been made on the molecular knowledge of HCV proteins and genomic replication, there is still no efficient and reliable cell culture system available to amplify this virus (4Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 991-1042Google Scholar). This represents a major hurdle for the characterization of some steps of HCV lifecycle, such as viral assembly and cell entry. Several surrogate models of HCV virions have been developed to facilitate the study of the steps of cell entry. Production of HCV virus-like particles in insect cells has already been reported (5Baumert T.F. Ito S. Wong D.T. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3827-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Owsianka A.

J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yet, although useful to analyze interactions with the cell surface, these particles were not infectious and did not permit functional investigation of the putative HCV receptors. Alternatively, generation of viral pseudotypes is one of the most widely used methods for assaying functional receptors, allowing attachment, penetration, and uncoating to be studied. Thus, pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles have been engineered with chimeric E1 and/or E2 HCV glycoproteins whose transmembrane domains were modified to allow transport to and assembly at the cell surface (9Buonocore L. Blight K.J. Rice C.M. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6865-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Flint M. Thomas J.M. Maidens C.M. Shotton C. Levy S. Barclay W.S. McKeating J.A. J.

Suzuki T. Asakura H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, as such modifications disturb conformation and functions of the E1E2 complexes (12Matsuura Y. Tani H. Suzuki K. Kimura-Someya T. Suzuki R. Aizaki H. Ishii K. Moriishi K. Robison C.S. Whitt M.A. Miyamura T. Virology. 2001; 286: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), their use as a tool to investigate HCV assembly and cell entry remains controversial (9Buonocore L. Blight K.J. Rice C.M. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6865-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, we have successfully generated infectious HCV pseudotype particles that were assembled by displaying unmodified and functional HCV glycoproteins onto retroviral and lentiviral core particles (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The presence of a marker gene packaged within these HCV pseudotype particles (HCVpp) allowed reliable and fast determination of infectivity mediated by the HCV glycoproteins. Our current knowledge of these particles indicates that they mimic the early infection steps of parental HCV as they exhibit a preferential tropism for hepatic cells and as they are specifically neutralized by anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies as well as sera of HCV-infected patients. Our results indicate that the E1 and E2 HCV glycoproteins represent the envelope glycoproteins of wild-type HCV and are both required for infection (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The infectivity of E1E2-pseudotyped retroviruses for similar cells was confirmed by others, as was the ability of monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the viral particles (15Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7271-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These pseudotype particles may therefore allow for the first time to decipher the mechanisms of HCV entry into cells. We recently identified the human scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein-binding molecule, as a putative HCV receptor because of its affinity to soluble E2 glycoproteins (17Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Here, we used HCVpp to determine the role of SR-B1 in HCV entry. We show that SR-B1 is required for infection of cells that also express the CD81 tetraspanin and the density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), two other previously proposed HCV receptor candidates (18Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 19Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we establish that the hyper-variable region 1 of the HCV E2 glycoprotein is a critical determinant mediating entry in SR-B1-positive cells. Finally, our data indicate that, in addition to LDLr, CD81, and SR-B1, liver-specific co-factor(s) are necessary for HCV entry. Expression Constructs and Production of HCV Pseudotype Particles—Expression vectors for E1E2 glycoproteins of 1a and 1b genotypes have been described previously (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). They were used to construct by PCR-mediated and oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (details and sequences available upon request) the expression vectors for the mutant E2 glycoproteins that harbor the deletion of the hyper-variable region 1 (del384–410) and/or the V514M and L615H point mutations. The CMV-Gag-Pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, encoding the MLV gag and pol genes, and the MLV-GFP plasmid, encoding an MLV-based transfer vector containing the GFP marker gene, have been described previously (20Nègre D. Mangeot P. Duisit G. Blanchard S. Vidalain P. Leissner P. Winter A. Rabourdin-Combe C. Mehtali M. Moullier P. Darlix J.-L. Cosset F.-L. Gene. Ther. 2000; 7: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The phCMV-G, phCMV-4070A, phCMV-HA, and phCMV-RD (21Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Nègre D. LeGrand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) expression vectors encode the VSV G protein, the amphotropic MLV glycoprotein, the fowl plague virus hemagglutinin, and the feline endogenous virus RD114 glycoprotein, respectively. Production of HCV pseudotype particles was carried out as described previously (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the viral components, i.e. E1E2 glycoproteins, retroviral core proteins, and packaging-competent GFP-containing retroviral transfer vectors, using a calcium-phosphate transfection protocol (Clontech, Le Pont de Claix, France). Supernatants containing the pseudotype particles were harvested 24 h later, filtered through 0.45-μm pore-sized membranes, and used in infection assays. Cells and Infection Assays—Huh-7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (22Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar), PLC/PRF/5 human hepatoma (CRL-8024), Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma (HB-8064), HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HB-8065), 293 human embryo kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1573), HOS human osteosarcoma (CRL-1543), TE671 human rhabdomyosarcoma (CRL-8805), Molt-4 human lymphoblastic leukemia (CRL-1582), HeLa human cervix adenocarcinoma (CCL-2), SW-13 human adreno-cortical carcinoma (CCL-105), and CHO Chinese hamster ovary (CCL-61) were grown as recommended by the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). 293-SR-B1 cells were derived from 293 cells by transfection with pcDNA3-SRB1, an expression vector encoding SR-B1 (or CLA-1), the human scavenger receptor class B type 1 (GenBank™ accession number Z22555) (23Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-SR-B1 cells were described previously (17Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). CHO-CD81/SR-B1 and HepG2-CD81 cells were obtained by infection of CHO-SR-B1 and HepG2 cells, respectively, with a retroviral vector containing the human CD81 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_004356). Construct details are available upon request. Infection assays were performed as described previously (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, dilutions of viral supernatants containing the pseudotype particles were added to the cells seeded the day before and plates were incubated for 3 h. The supernatants were then removed and the cells incubated in regular medium for 72 h at 37 °C. The infectious titers, expressed as transducing units (TU)/ml, were deduced from the transduction efficiencies, determined as the percentage of GFP-positive cells measured by FACS analysis (21Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Nègre D. LeGrand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Antibodies—E1 and E2 glycoproteins were detected with the A4 (24Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and H52 (25Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. HCVpp core proteins were detected with an anti-capsid (MLV CA) antiserum (ViroMed Biosafety Laboratories). These reagents were used in Western blot analysis of purified pseudotype particles as previously described (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). JS-81 (BD Biosciences) is a monoclonal antibody reactive with CD81. 15C8 (Oncogene-Science, France) is a monoclonal antibody reactive with the human LDL receptor. The mouse SR-B1 polyclonal serum was raised by muscle genetic immunization of BALB/c mice, using plasmid pVJ-hSR-B1 harboring the full-length human SR-B1 cDNA. Immunization protocol and plasmid vector have been previously described (26Zucchelli S. Roccasecca R. Meola A. Ercole B.B. Tafi R. Dubuisson J. Galfre G. Cortese R. Nicosia A. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The preimmune sera were collected from the same mice bleeded before immunization. The rat monoclonal antibody 9/27 recognizes an epitope contained in the hypervariable region of the E2 protein of genotype 1a (6Owsianka A. Clayton R.F. Loomis-Price L.D. McKeating J.A. Patel A.H. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cell Binding Assays of E2 Glycoproteins—E2 soluble proteins harboring a C-terminal histidine tag were produced in the supernatants of 293 cells, as previously described (27Roccasecca R. Ansuini H. Vitelli A. Meola A. Scarselli E. Acali S. Pezzanera M. Ercole B.B. McKeating J. Yagnik A. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Cortese R. Nicosia A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Binding of E2 to the cell surface was analyzed using a FACS-based assay. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes (FACS buffer). Then, 4 × 105 cells were allowed to bind E2 concentrated supernatants at room temperature for 1 h. After one washing, a biotinylated anti-penta-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) was added at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed again, and cell-bound antibodies were revealed by Streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin conjugated antibodies (Qiagen). For inhibition of binding, cells were pre-incubated with anti-SR-B1 serum, 30 min at 4 °C, as described previously (27Roccasecca R. Ansuini H. Vitelli A. Meola A. Scarselli E. Acali S. Pezzanera M. Ercole B.B. McKeating J. Yagnik A. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Cortese R. Nicosia A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cell Entry of HCVpp Is pH-dependent—Enveloped viruses penetrate the host cells by a process of fusion between the viral and cell membranes that is catalyzed by a fusogenic activity harbored by viral surface glycoproteins. Activation of such fusion properties occurs in an acid pH-dependent manner, via acidified endosomal vesicles into which the virions are routed following receptor binding (28Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), or, alternatively, in a pH-independent manner via direct interaction of the viral glycoproteins with their receptors. These two cell entry pathways can be distinguished by assessing the effect in infection assays of drugs that inhibit endosomal-pH acidification, such as weak bases (e.g. chloroquine), and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitors (e.g. bafilomycin A1) (28Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We determined whether entry of HCVpp in Huh-7 hepato-carcinoma cells is likely to proceed via internalization by treating target cells before and during infection with bafilomycin A1. Infectivity of control pseudotype particles generated with pH-independent glycoproteins from MLV-A or RD114 was not affected by bafilomycin A1, at concentrations of up to 50 nm (Fig. 1), consistent with the pH-independent entry route adopted by these retroviruses (29McClure M.O. Sommerfelt M.A. Marsh M. Weiss R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). That bafilomycin A1 seemingly reduced the infectivity of these two control viruses at 100 nm could be clearly attributed to cell toxicity of the drug (data not shown). In contrast, bafilomycin A1 reduced in a dose-dependent manner the infectious titers of HCVpp, as well as the infectivity of pseudotype particles generated with pH-dependent glycoproteins from fowl-plague virus, an avian influenza virus, or from VSV. At 100 nm of bafilomycin A1, the titers of the HCVpp and the pseudotype particles coated with FPV hemagglutinin were reduced by a factor of 30–50-fold (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with chloroquine and when using Hep3B as alternative target cells (data not shown). These data indicated that the fusion-activation of HCV E1E2 glycoproteins is pH-dependent and that cell entry of HCVpp most likely occurs by endocytosis. Thus some of the receptors used by HCV to infect the target cells may be responsible for virion internalization. CD81 and SR-B1 Co-expression Is Not Sufficient for HCVpp Cell Entry—The LDLr, the CD81 tetraspanin, and the SR-B1 have been proposed as putative HCV receptors mediating entry into hepatic cells (17Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 18Agnello V. Abel G.

Thomssen R. J. Med. Virol. 1999; 57: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) on the basis of their physical association with virions or with soluble E2 glycoproteins. Although virion association to LDLr is most likely due to indirect interaction, via virion-bound apolipoproteins (31Andre P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Brechot C. Paranhos-Baccala G. Lotteau V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6919-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), direct interaction between soluble E2 and CD81 or SR-B1 could be demonstrated (17Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 27Roccasecca R. Ansuini H. Vitelli A. Meola A. Scarselli E. Acali S. Pezzanera M. Ercole B.B. McKeating J. Yagnik A. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Cortese R. Nicosia A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of infectious HCV particles, evidence that these receptor candidates could support infection was missing. By receptor competition assays, we recently provided evidence that CD81 was involved in the early steps of infection, but was not sufficient to permit infection (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Indeed, non-hepatic human cells that express CD81 were found to be not or very poorly permissive to infection (Table I), with infectious titers of HCVpp more than 100-fold lower than those measured on Huh-7 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of human CD81 in non-permissive murine cells did not restore infection (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Thus, hepato-carcinoma cells, which coexpress LDLr, CD81, and SR-B1, exhibited the maximal levels of infectivity. Therefore, because SR-B1 is expressed in most cells types, though at highly variable levels (Table I), non-permissiveness to infection may be due to lack of sufficient levels of SR-B1 expression, or, alternatively, to lack of a critical hepatocyte factor(s). To address either of these possibilities, we performed infection assays in CHO cells and 293 human embryo kidney cells that expressed no and low levels of SR-B1, respectively (Table I). CHO cells, which are not permissive to HCVpp infection (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), were engineered to allow stable and constitutive expression of CD81 alone, SR-B1 alone, or both molecules. Expression of either molecule was sufficient to allow binding of E2 soluble glycoproteins (17Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 27Roccasecca R. Ansuini H. Vitelli A. Meola A. Scarselli E. Acali S. Pezzanera M. Ercole B.B. McKeating J. Yagnik A. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Cortese R. Nicosia A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All these CHO-derived cells were highly permissive to infection with control pseudotype particles generated with the VSV-G glycoprotein, which binds a non-related receptor. However, despite densities of CD81 and/or SR-B1 molecules similar if not higher than that of the highly permissive Huh-7 cells (Table I), we found no evidence for infection with HCVpp based on genotype 1a (H77 strain) and 1b (J strain) (Fig. 2). In contrast, over-expression of SR-B1 in the poorly permissive 293 cells (14Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), which naturally express abundant levels of CD81 but very low levels of SR-B1 (Table I), resulted in increased levels of infection for both HCVpp-1a and -1b. Using HCVpp harboring a lacZ marker gene that allows the precise determination of low levels of infectivity in contrast to the GFP marker gene, over 10-fold increased infectivity were detected in 293-SR-B1 cells; yet the infectious titers remained below 103 TU/ml (Table I). Furthermore, we found that several human cells of non-hepatic origin, e.g. HeLa and SW13, expressed LDLr, CD81, and SR-B1 at levels comparable with those detected in hepato-carcinoma cells but were poorly permissive to infection, with infectious titers of HCVpp lower than 103 TU/ml (Table I). Altogether these results indicate that although hCD81 and/or SR-B1 bind HCV E2 glycoproteins and might play a role in cell surface attachment and internalization of HCV, their co-expression in a non-hepatic cell background is not sufficient to support efficient HCVpp infection. Additional interactions between the virions and hepatic cell surface components are likely necessary to allow HCVpp cell entry.Table IExpression of CD81 and SR-B1 and permissivity to infectionCell linesTissueHLDLraDetection of human LDLr using 15C8 antibodies on the surface of the indicated cells by flow cytometry. -, MFI (mean fluorescent intensity) shift of 1; +/-, MFI shift between 2 and 4; +, MFI shift between 4 and 10; ++, MFI shift over 10.hCD81bDetection of human CD81 using JS-81 antibodies on the surface of the indicated cells by flow cytometry. -, MFI shift of 1; +, MFI shift between 1 and 50; ++, MFI shift over 50.hSR-B1cDetection of human SR-B1 using mouse SR-B1 serum diluted 1/100 on the surface of the indicated cells by flow cytometry. -, MFI shift of less than 2; +/-, MFI shift between 2 and 6; +, MFI shift between 6 and 20; ++, MFI shift over 20.InfectivitydInfectivity of HCVpp of genotype 1a and 1b harboring the GFP marker gene. ++, titers higher than 105 TU/ml; +, titers between 103 and 105 TU/ml; +/-, titers between 102 and 103 TU/ml; -, titers lower than 102 TU/ml, which corresponds to the threshold of detection of infected cells by FACS analysis.Huh-7Hepatocellular carcinoma++++++PLC/PRF/5Hepatoma+++++Hep3BHepatocellular carcinoma+/-+++HepG2-CD81Hepatocellular carcinoma++++++HepG2Hepatocellular carcinoma+-+++/-SW-13Adrenocortical carcinoma++++/-293-SR-B1Embryo kidney+/-++++/-eOverexpression of SR-B1 in 293 cells resulted in ca. 10-fold increased infectious titers of HCVpp harbouring a lacZ marker gene.

https://openalex.org/W2079466993,"Histone H2AX becomes phosphorylated in chromatin domains flanking sites of DNA double-strand breakage associated with gamma-irradiation, meiotic recombination, DNA replication, and antigen receptor rearrangements. Here, we show that loss of a single H2AX allele compromises genomic integrity and enhances the susceptibility to cancer in the absence of p53. In comparison with heterozygotes, tumors arise earlier in the H2AX homozygous null background, and H2AX(-/-) p53(-/-) lymphomas harbor an increased frequency of clonal nonreciprocal translocations and amplifications. These include complex rearrangements that juxtapose the c-myc oncogene to antigen receptor loci. Restoration of the H2AX null allele with wild-type H2AX restores genomic stability and radiation resistance, but this effect is abolished by substitution of the conserved serine phosphorylation sites in H2AX with alanine or glutamic acid residues. Our results establish H2AX as genomic caretaker that requires the function of both gene alleles for optimal protection against tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058706417,"Phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate [PI(4)P] is essential for secretion in yeast, but its role in mammalian cells is unclear. Current paradigms propose that PI(4)P acts primarily as a precursor to phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2), an important plasma membrane regulator. We found that PI(4)P is enriched in the mammalian Golgi, and used RNA interference (RNAi) of PI4KIIalpha, a Golgi resident phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase, to determine whether PI(4)P directly regulates the Golgi. PI4KIIalpha RNAi decreases Golgi PI(4)P, blocks the recruitment of clathrin adaptor AP-1 complexes to the Golgi, and inhibits AP-1-dependent functions. This AP-1 binding defect is rescued by adding back PI(4)P. In addition, purified AP-1 binds PI(4)P, and anti-PI(4)P inhibits the in vitro recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 to normal cellular membranes. We propose that PI4KIIalpha establishes the Golgi's unique lipid-defined organelle identity by generating PI(4)P-rich domains that specify the docking of the AP-1 coat machinery."
https://openalex.org/W99705021,"We employed gene targeting to study H2AX, a histone variant phosphorylated in chromatin surrounding DNA double-strand breaks. Mice deficient for both H2AX and p53 (H(delta/delta)P(-/-)) rapidly developed immature T and B lymphomas and solid tumors. Moreover, H2AX haploinsufficiency caused genomic instability in normal cells and, on a p53-deficient background, early onset of various tumors including more mature B lymphomas. Most H2AX(delta/delta)p53(-/-) or H2AX(+/delta)p53(-/-) B lineage lymphomas harbored chromosome 12 (IgH)/15 (c-myc) translocations with hallmarks of either aberrant V(D)J or class switch recombination. In contrast, H2AX(delta/delta)p53(-/-) thymic lymphomas had clonal translocations that did not involve antigen receptor loci and which likely occurred during cellular expansion. Thus, H2AX helps prevent aberrant repair of both programmed and general DNA breakage and, thereby, functions as a dosage-dependent suppressor of genomic instability and tumors in mice. Notably, H2AX maps to a cytogenetic region frequently altered in human cancers, possibly implicating similar functions in man."
https://openalex.org/W2014620140,"Here we describe how patterns of gene expression in human tumors have been deconvoluted to reveal a mechanism of action for the cyclin D1 oncogene. Computational analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes across hundreds of tumor specimens suggested that a transcription factor, C/EBPbeta/Nf-Il6, participates in the consequences of cyclin D1 overexpression. Functional analyses confirmed the involvement of C/EBPbeta in the regulation of genes affected by cyclin D1 and established this protein as an indispensable effector of a potentially important facet of cyclin D1 biology. This work demonstrates that tumor gene expression databases can be used to study the function of a human oncogene in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2008628928,"Selection of active origins and regulation of interorigin spacing are poorly understood in mammalian cells. Using tricolor analysis of combed DNA molecules, we studied an amplified locus containing the known origin, oriGNAI3. We visualized replication firing events at this and other discrete regions and established a strict correlation between AT richness and initiation sites. We found that oriGNAI3 is the prominent origin of the domain, the firing of which correlates with silencing of neighboring sites and establishes large interorigin distances. We demonstrate that cells reversibly respond to a reduction in nucleotide availability by slowing the rate of replication fork progression; in addition, the efficiency of initiation at oriGNAI3 is lowered while other normally dormant origins in the region are activated, which results in an overall increase in the density of initiation events. Thus, nucleotide pools are involved in the specification of active origins, which in turn defines their density along chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2026574531,"The transcription elongation factor TFIIS induces mRNA cleavage by enhancing the intrinsic nuclease activity of RNA polymerase (Pol) II. We have diffused TFIIS into Pol II crystals and derived a model of the Pol II-TFIIS complex from X-ray diffraction data to 3.8 Å resolution. TFIIS extends from the polymerase surface via a pore to the internal active site, spanning a distance of 100 Å. Two essential and invariant acidic residues in a TFIIS loop complement the Pol II active site and could position a metal ion and a water molecule for hydrolytic RNA cleavage. TFIIS also induces extensive structural changes in Pol II that would realign nucleic acids in the active center. Our results support the idea that Pol II contains a single tunable active site for RNA polymerization and cleavage, in contrast to DNA polymerases with two separate active sites for DNA polymerization and cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1964545403,"Vitamin E is a generic term for tocopherols and tocotrienols. This work is based on our striking evidence that, in neuronal cells, nanomolar concentrations of α-tocotrienol, but not α-tocopherol, block glutamate-induced death by suppressing early activation of c-Src kinase (Sen, C. K., Khanna, S., Roy, S., and Packer, L. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 13049–13055). This study on HT4 and immature primary cortical neurons suggests a central role of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in executing glutamate-induced neurodegeneration. BL15, an inhibitor of 12-LOX, prevented glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, neurons isolated from 12-LOX-deficient mice were observed to be resistant to glutamate-induced death. In the presence of nanomolar α-tocotrienol, neurons were resistant to glutamate-, homocysteine-, and l-buthionine sulfoximine-induced toxicity. Long-term time-lapse imaging studies revealed that neurons and their axo-dendritic network are fairly motile under standard culture conditions. Such motility was arrested in response to glutamate challenge. Tocotrienol-treated primary neurons maintained healthy growth and motility even in the presence of excess glutamate. The study of 12-LOX activity and metabolism revealed that this key mediator of glutamate-induced neurodegeneration is subject to control by the nutrient α-tocotrienol. <i>In silico</i> docking studies indicated that α-tocotrienol may hinder the access of arachidonic acid to the catalytic site of 12-LOX by binding to the opening of a solvent cavity close to the active site. These findings lend further support to α-tocotrienol as a potent neuroprotective form of vitamin E."
https://openalex.org/W2063564139,"Overexpression of upstream of growth and differentiation factor 1 (uog1), a mammalian homolog of the yeast longevity assurance gene (LAG1), selectively induces the synthesis of stearoyl-containing sphingolipids in mammalian cells (Venkataraman, K., Riebeling, C., Bodennec, J., Riezman, H., Allegood, J.

Analysis of sphingolipids by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry revealed that TRH4 overexpression elevated mainly palmitic acid-containing sphingolipids whereas TRH1 overexpression increased mainly stearic acid and arachidic acid, which in both cases were further elevated upon incubation with FB1. A similar fatty acid specificity was obtained upon analysis of (dihydro)ceramide synthase activity in vitro using various fatty acyl-CoA substrates, although in a FB1-sensitive manner. Moreover, in homogenates from TRH4-overexpressing cells, sphinganine, rather than sphingosine was the preferred substrate, whereas no preference was seen in homogenates from TRH1-overexpressing cells. These findings lend support to our hypothesis (Venkataraman, K., and Futerman, A. H.

Lipids were visualized using I2 and recovered from the TLC plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials. 1 ml of methanol and 5 ml of Optima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Downers Groove, IL) were added to each vial for scintillation counting, and radioactivity determined using a Packard 2100 beta radiospectrometer equipped with the Transformed Spectral Index of the External Standard/Automatic Efficiency Control (tSIE/AEC) program for quench correction. Electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry—293T cells were transfected, and after 24 h treated with or without 20 μm FB1 for a further 24 h, harvested by trypsinization, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. SLs were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) on a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray source as described previously (24Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Sci STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1PubMed Google Scholar). The orifice and ring voltages were kept low (40 V and 220 V, respectively) to prevent collisional decomposition of molecular ions prior to entry into the first quadrupole; the orifice temperature was set to 500 °C. N2 was used to collisionally induce dissociations in Q2, which was offset from Q1 by 40–50 V. Q3 was then set to pass molecularly distinctive product ions (N ions) of m/z 264.4 and 266.4 for sphingosine- and sphinganine-containing SLs, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans were acquired by setting Q1 and Q3 to pass the precursor and product ions of the most abundant SL molecular species. For example, for the ceramides, these transitions occur at m/z 538.7/264.4, 566.5/264.4, 622.7/264.4, 648.7/264.4, 650.7/264.4, 676.5/264.4, and 678.5/264.4, which correspond to ceramides with a d18:1 sphingoid base (sphingosine) and C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1, and C26:0 fatty acids, respectively. Quantitation was achieved by spiking the samples prior to extraction with the C12-fatty acid homologs of ceramide, SM, and GlcCer. (Dihydro)ceramide Synthase Assay—293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and removed from culture dishes using trypsin (0.05% w/v). After centrifugation for 4 min at 150 g av, cell pellets were washed twice using 6 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation (4 min, 150 g av) and then homogenized in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml anti-pain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 KIU/ml aprotinin), and protein determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Homogenates (500 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with 1.46 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine/15 μm sphinganine/20 μm defatted-bovine serum albumin (18Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys.

The reaction was initiated by adding 50 μm fatty acyl-CoA (in some cases containing the 14C-fatty acyl CoAs, as above), and incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and (dihydro)ceramide synthesis was analyzed by TLC using chloroform/methanol/2 m ammonium hydroxide (40:10:1; v/v/v) as the developing solvent. Lipids were visualized using a phosphorimager screen (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), recovered from TLC plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Immunolocalization—Eighteen hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated with MitoTracker® Deep Red (25 nm) for 15 min and chased for 3 min in fresh medium that did not contain MitoTracker® Deep Red. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (20 min, 37 °C), and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti-PDI, dilution of 1:200; rat anti-HA, 1:500) were applied for 2 h at room temperature. A rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was diluted 1:200, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was diluted 1:500. After 1 h incubation, slides were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus Fluoview FV500 imaging system. Fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine fluorescence, and MitoTracker® Deep Red were viewed using an argon and two helium-neon laser with excitation wavelengths of 488, 543, and 633 nm, respectively. Images were acquired in sequential mode and analyzed using Fluoview 3 imaging software. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Mice (males, 3-month-old) were sacrificed, tissues removed, rapidly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from whole tissues using the TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturers' instructions. RT-PCR was performed as described (26Pelled D. Lloyd-Evans E. Riebeling C. Jeyakumar M. Platt F.M. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29496-29501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primers were designed using the MacMolly Tetra program (Softgene, Berlin, Germany) and PCR cycling performed using the conditions described in Table I, which gives the primers for all six Lag1p family members (16Venkataraman K.

Metabolic Labeling of trh1- and trh4-transfected Cells—To determine whether TRH1 and TRH4 affect SL synthesis, trh1 and trh4 were subcloned into a pcDNA3.0 vector and used to transiently transfect 293T cells prior to metabolic labeling for 24 h with l-[3-3H]serine, a substrate for the first enzyme of SL biosynthesis, serine palmitoyl transferase (27Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hanada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A 1.8-fold and a 1.5-fold increase in [3H](dihydro)ceramide labeling was observed in trh1- and trh4-transfected 293T cells, respectively, compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1). FB1 inhibited (dihydro)ceramide labeling in mock-transfected cells, but [3H](dihydro)ceramide was 3–4-fold higher in both TRH1 and TRH4 overexpressing 293T cells upon FB1 treatment (Fig. 1). A 1.8-fold increase in [3H]GlcCer labeling was observed in TRH1-overexpressing 293T cells and a small increase in [3H]GlcCer in TRH4-overexpressing cells 2Upon TLC, GlcCer separates into two bands using chloroform/methanol/water (24:7:1; v/v/v) as developing solvent. The lower band, which consists of shorter acyl chain fatty acids (i.e. C16) and α-hydroxy fatty acids (46van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was elevated 2.8-fold whereas [3H]GlcCer in the upper band was reduced by 0.8-fold. This variation was not due to changes in levels of α-hydroxy fatty acids as no change in their levels could be detected by ESI-MS/MS. The increase in [3H]GlcCer synthesis represents the mean change taking into account the different amounts of [3H]GlcCer detected in each band. (Fig. 1), which were further elevated upon FB1 treatment. In contrast, no change in [3H]SM labeling was observed (Fig. 1), although [3H]SM labeling was not inhibited by FB1 in trh1- and trh4-transfected cells (Fig. 1). [3H]Ceramide dihexoside, [3H]ceramide trihexoside, and [3H]globoside labeling were also increased in TRH1- and to a lesser extent in TRH4-overexpressing cells, and not inhibited by FB1 (not shown). [3H]Ganglioside labeling was much lower in 293T cells than neutral [3H]GSL labeling and only moderately affected by overexpression, but also showed FB1 resistance. The distribution of [3H](dihydro)ceramide showed a slight preference for incorporation into neutral GSLs for TRH1-overexpressing cells and for acidic GSLs in TRH4-overexpressing cells (not shown). SL Amounts and Fatty Acid Composition in trh1- and trh4-transfected 293T Cells—We next examined long chain base and SL amounts by ESI-MS/MS. Consistent with the metabolic labeling results (Fig. 1), a ∼2-fold increase in dihydroceramide and ceramide mass was observed in trh1- and trh4-transfected cells (Table II), and ceramide monohexosides and SM were also elevated. Upon incubation of mock-transfected cells with FB1, dihydroceramide and ceramide amounts decreased to 47% and 21% of non-treated cells, whereas in TRH1- and TRH4-overexpressing cells, dihydroceramide mass was increased by 18–20-fold, and ceramide by ∼2.5-fold.Table IIAmounts of long chain bases and SLs in trh1- and trh4-transfected cellsMockTRH1TRH4Mock + FB1TRH1 + FB1TRH4 + FB1long chain base (pmol/mg protein)Sphinganine5.8 ± 1.413 ± 5 (220)5.7 ± 2.6 (98)1650 ± 450 (28,444)760 ± 190 (13,084)840 ± 180 (14,357)Sphingosine570 ± 200720 ± 370 (125)270 ± 60 (46)660 ± 380 (116)1030 ± 490 (179)680 ± 200 (119)Sphinganine-1-phosphaten.d.an.d., not detected.n.d.n.d.237 ± 62105 ± 8145 ± 13Sphingosine-1-phosphate2.4 ± 0.73.8 ± 1.0 (158)2.3 ± 0.7 (96)6.9 ± 2.7 (285)8.1 ± 1.6 (334)8.1 ± 0.9 (335)SL (nmol/mg protein)Dihydroceramide0.46 ± 0.100.93 ± 0.21 (202)1.1 ± 0.5 (227)0.22 ± 0.04 (47)7.9 ± 5.6 (1721)9.0 ± 5.6 (1963)Ceramide1.5 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.3 (170)2.2 ± 1.1 (145)0.31 ± 0.07 (21)3.5 ± 1.5 (233)4.1 ± 1.2 (277)Ceramide monohexosides0.64 ± 0.201.4 ± 0.4 (218)1.3 ± 0.7 (205)0.34 ± 0.05 (54)0.99 ± 0.64 (156)1.3 ± 0.4 (199)SM5.2 ± 0.97.4 ± 0.5 (141)5.5 ± 2.2 (105)3.3 ± 0.3 (63)4.6 ± 1.2 (89)5.2 ± 0.9 (100)a n.d., not detected. Open table in a new tab In both mock- and TRH1- or TRH4-transfected cells, a large increase in sphinganine was detected, presumably due to inhibition of an endogenous FB1-sensitive dihydroceramide synthase (9Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a greater increase in sphinganine levels was seen in mock-compared with TRH1- or TRH4-transfected cells. Sphinganine 1-phosphate was only detected in FB1-treated cells, and similar to sphinganine, sphinganine 1-phosphate was lower in TRH1- and TRH4-transfected cells than in FB1-treated mock-transfected cells (Table II). Analysis of the fatty acid composition of SLs in TRH1- and TRH4-overexpressing cells revealed major changes compared with mock-transfected cells. TRH1-overexpressing cells exhibited a strong increase in N-linked stearoyl-(C18), arachidoyl-(C20), and to a lesser extent behenoyl (C22) ceramides, mono- and dihexosyl ceramides, and SM (Fig. 2). In TRH4-overexpressing cells, N-linked palmitoyl (C16) SLs were strongly increased (Fig. 2), and there were no notable differences in other fatty acids. Changes were also observed in the ratio of sphinganine-versus sphingosine-containing SLs. C16-ceramide and C16-dihydroceramide were increased to a similar extent in TRH4-overexpressing cells, and after FB1 treatment, C16-dihydroceramide was ∼2-fold higher than C16-ceramide. Likewise, after FB1-treatment, C18- and C20-dihydroceramide were significantly higher than C18- and C20-ceramide in TRH1-overexpressing cells. In contrast, complex SLs (mono- and dihexosyl ceramide and SM) contained mainly ceramides rather than dihydroceramides with or without FB1 treament (Fig. 2). Analysis of (Dihydro)ceramide Synthase in Vitro—A similar selectivity toward fatty acids was obtained upon analysis of dihydroceramide synthase activity in vitro (18Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Using the same concentration of each fatty acyl-CoA (50 μm) in the reaction mixture, and using [4,5-3H]sphinganine, dihydroceramide synthase activity was increased 13- and 16-fold in homogenates from trh1-transfected cells using either stearoyl-CoA or arachidoyl-CoA, respectively, but no increases were apparent using other fatty acyl-CoAs (Fig. 3). In homogenates from trh4-transfected cells, a 31- and 17-fold increase in dihydroceramide synthase activity was obtained using palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA, with no increase using other fatty acyl-CoA donors (Fig. 3). Thus, the specificity of the dihydroceramide synthase reaction in vitro is entirely consistent with the data obtained by ESI-MS/MS on the fatty acid composition of dihydroceramide. In vitro assays using 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA (for TRH4) or 1-[14C]stearoyl-CoA (for TRH1) revealed similar levels of incorporation of sphingosine and sphinganine into (dihydro)ceramide in homogenates from TRH1-overexpressing cells, and an ∼2-fold greater incorporation of sphinganine compared with sphingosine in homogenates from TRH4-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that both gene products may be, or may modulate (dihydro)ceramide synthases with different preferences for long chain bases. The in vitro (dihydro)ceramide synthase activity of both TRH1- and TRH4-overexpressing cells was FB1 sensitive in vitro (Fig. 4), in contrast to the FB1 resistance observed in intact cells. mRNA Expression of Lag1p Homologs in Mouse Tissues— Analysis of the tissue distribution of trh1 and trh4 by semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that trh1 and trh4 are ubiquitously expressed in the tissues investigated, but both show low expression in liver and trh1 is found"
https://openalex.org/W2015574865,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which have been shown to be heparin-binding proteins, induce osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of heparin on the BMP activities in C2C12 myoblasts. Heparin dose dependently enhanced the osteoblast differentiation induced by not only homodimers of BMP-2 or BMP-4 but also heterodimers of BMP-2/6 or BMP-2/7. However, the osteoblast differentiation induced by the constitutively active BMPR-IA, a functional BMP type I receptor, was not affected by heparin. Heparan sulfate and dextran sulfate also enhanced the BMP-2 activity, although the chemically desulfated heparin-derivatives have lost this stimulatory capacity. Heparin dose-dependently suppressed the accumulation of BMP-2 from the culture media into the cell layer or BMPR-IA, and retained a large amount of BMP-2 in the culture media. The biological activity of BMP-2, which was evaluated using a BMP-responsive reporter gene expression, was prolonged in the presence of heparin. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfated polysaccharides enhance the biological activity of both homodimers and heterodimers of BMPs by continuously serving the ligands to their signaling receptors expressed on cell membranes.

Both the ectopic bone-inducing activity and the osteoblast differentiation-inducing activity appear to be unique for BMPs among members of the TGF-β superfamily.

In contrast, dominant-negative BMP type I receptor, in which the kinase domain was truncated, blocked the response to BMPs (22Namiki M. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Yamaji N. Rosen V.

Using these mutant receptors, BMPR-IA was identified as a functional type I receptor for BMP-2 in C2C12 cells (22Namiki M. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Yamaji N. Rosen V. Wozney J.M.

A large number of extracellular molecules were reported to regulate positively and negatively the biological activities of BMPs in vivo and in vitro (6Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J.

Sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin and heparan sulfate are macromolecules associated with the cell surface and the extracellular matrix (23Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M.

These polysaccharides have been shown to interact directly with a number of growth factors, including BMPs, via highly negative charged polysaccharide chains. Indeed, heparin-affinity chromatography was used to purify the BMP activity from extracts prepared from demineralized bone matrix (29Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Wang E.A. Rosen V. Cordes P. Hewick R.M. D'Alessandro J.S. Baudy M. Cordes P. Harada T. Israel D. Hewick R.M. Kerns K.M.

Heparin enhances the anticoagulation and the growth promoting activities of antithrombin III and FGFs, respectively (31Barrowcliffe T.W. Johnson E.A. Thomas D. Br. Med. Bull. 1978; 34: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Björk I. Lindahl U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 48: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 33Yayon A. Klagsbrun M.

Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), and the anticoagulation activity of heparin is widely used clinically. We report here that sulfated polysaccharides including heparin, heparan sulfate and dextran sulfate, but not desulfated heparin, enhance the osteoblast differentiation induced by homodimers and heterodimers of BMPs. Heparin reduced the amounts of BMP-2 bound to the cell layer or its receptor and maintained that level in the culture medium. The biological activity of BMP-2 was prolonged in the presence of heparin. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfated polysaccharides enhance the biological activity of BMPs by continuously serving the ligands to their signaling receptors expressed on the cell membranes. BMPs and Polysaccharides—Purified recombinant human BMP-2 and BMP-4 were obtained from Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Conditioned media of COS7 cells containing BMPs were prepared as described below. Heparin prepared from porcine intestine, heparan sulfate prepared from bovine intestine and kidney, synthetic dextran sulfate with different molecular weights (5,000 (DS 0.5), 10,000 (DS 1.0), and 500,000 (DS 50)) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Chemically modified heparin derivatives, CDSNAc, CDSNS, and NDSNAc, were purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids—Human BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 cDNAs and mouse ALP-FLAG cDNA were cloned from human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells and mouse C2C12 cells stimulated with BMP-2 by RT-PCR using appropriate primers; 5′-ATGAATTCATGGTGGCCGGGACCCGCTG-3′ (BMP2-S) and 5′-TTCTAGACTAGCGACACCCACAACCCT-3′ (BMP2-AS), 5′-CAAGACACCATGATTCCTGG-3′ (BMP4-S), and 5′-TTCTAGATCAGCGGCACCCACATCCCT-3′ (BMP4-AS), 5′-CGGGATCCGCGGGGGCAGCC-3′ (BMP6-S) and 5′-TTCTAGATTCGAGTTAGTGGC-3′ (BMP6-AS), 5′-GAGCCGGCGCGATGCACGTG-3′ (BMP7-S), and 5′-GGTCTAGATTCTCGGAGGAG-3′ (BMP7-AS), and 5′-TTGAATTCAGCGAGGGACGAATCTCAGG-3′ (ALP-S) and 5′-TTCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGAACAGGGTCGGTAGGGAGA-3′ (ALP-FLAG-AS). The BMP cDNAs and the ALP cDNA obtained were subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors, pcDEF3 (36Goldman L.A. Curone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), respectively. FLAG-BMP-2 was generated by inserting the FLAG epitope sequence (-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-) between His286 and Lys287 of human BMP-2 using a standard PCR protocol. Expression plasmid for ΔBMPR-IA-His and constitutively active BMPR-IA-His were also generated by RT-PCR from C2C12 cells using the following primers; 5′-TACTCGAGCGCGTGCGAATCAGACAATG-3′ (BMPRIA-5) and 5′-TACTCGAGTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGATAGCAAAAGCAGC-3′ (ΔBMPRIA-3His), and the BMPRIA-5 primer and 5′-TAACTAGTTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGAATCTTTACATCCTGGG-3′ (BMPR-3-His). All of the sequences of the PCR products were verified using a GeneRapid DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). The FLAG-Smad1 expression vector was described previously (19Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Gene Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures for Treatment with BMPs—C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. ST2 bone marrow stromal cells and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma Chemical Co.) containing 15% FBS (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. ST2 and MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-MEM (Sigma Chemical Co.) containing 10% FBS. Cells were inoculated at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 1 day before treatment with BMPs. BMPs were pre-incubated with heparin or heparan sulfate in siliconized tubes for 20 min at room temperature, then added to the fresh culture media of the cells. To analyze osteoblast and myogenic differentiation histochemically, cells were stained for the ALP activity and the MHC as described previously (13Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The ALP activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate (13Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Northern blot was performed with 15 μg of total RNA and 32P-labeled cDNA probe for mouse osteocalcin as described (13Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation capacity was determined using MTS assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Measurement of Sulfur in Polysaccharide Chains—The amount of sulfur in the polysaccharides was measured as described previously (35Dodgson K.S. Price R.G. Biochem. J. 1962; 84: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). In brief, the polysaccharide was hydrolyzed with 2 m hydrochloric acid for 5 h at 105 °C. Then trichloroacetic acid was added and further incubated with barium chloride-gelatin reagent at room temperature for 20 min. The extinction of the solution was measured at 500 nm. Transfection and Preparation of Conditioned Media Containing BMPs—C2C12 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well 1 day before transfection, and they were transiently transfected with 0.2 μg/well of DNA and 0.75 μl/well of a cationic liposome reagent (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated for 3 h with the DNA-liposome complex, then the culture media were changed to DMEM containing 2.5% FBS with or without 4 μg/ml of heparin, and cultured for an additional 3 days. Cells were fixed and histochemically stained for ALP as described previously (13Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). To prepare conditioned media containing BMPs, COS7 cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at 4.5 × 105 cells/well in DMEM containing 15% FBS 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg/well of DNA, 4 μl/well of LipofectAMINE and 6 μl/well of Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation, the culture media were changed to DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and further cultured for an additional 2 days. Conditioned media were recovered from the cultures, and cell debris and other precipitates were removed by centrifugation. The conditioned media were diluted to 50% with fresh DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and added to the C2C12 cell cultures. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—For the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, FLAG-BMP-2 was produced for 2 days in the conditioned media of COS7 cells. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with ΔBMPR-IA by LipofectAMINE 2000 as described above, and cultured for an additional 2 days in DMEM at 15% FBS. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the conditioned media containing FLAG-BMP-2 in the presence or absence of 4 μg/ml of heparin. The cell layer was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mm MgCl2, (PBS (+)), and then the cell surface components were cross-linked with 1 mm BS3 (Pierce) in PBS (+) for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell layer was lysed in TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The FLAG-BMP-2 and ΔBMPR-IA-His complex was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma) for 15 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed with Western blotting using an anti-His antibody (H15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The primary antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL-plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Monitoring of BMP-responding Cells—C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with Id985-EGFPd2 plasmid (19Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Gene Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and treated with BMP-2 in the presence or absence of 4 μg/ml of heparin as described above. EGFP (+) cells were monitored using a BX50 fluorescent microscope with a DP50 digital CCD camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Heparin Enhances the BMP-induced Osteoblast Differentiation in Myoblasts and Osteoblast Lineage Cells—First we examined the effect of heparin on the BMP-induced cell differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts, which was evaluated histochemically based on ALP activity and MHC expression as markers for osteoblast and myogenic differentiation, respectively (Fig. 1A). BMP-2 inhibits the MHC expression and induces the ALP activity at 100 ng/ml or greater in C2C12 cells. BMP-4 also showed similar effects in these cells (Fig. 1A). Treatment cells with 100 or 300 ng/ml of BMP-2 or BMP-4 in the presence of heparin markedly increased the number of ALP (+) cells. This stimulatory capacity of heparin on the ALP activity induced by BMP-2 was dose-dependent up to 30 μg/ml (Fig. 1B). Moreover, heparin also enhanced the BMP-2-induced suppression of the MHC expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In both cases, ED50 of heparin was roughly estimated at 4 μg/ml. Heparin itself did not show significant induction of the ALP activity or the inhibition of the MHC expression up to 30 μg/ml (Fig. 1, A–C). The expression of osteocalcin mRNA, another marker for osteoblast differentiation, was induced by BMP-2 at 300 ng/ml in the absence of heparin. These levels of osteocalcin mRNA were increased by heparin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the minimal dosage of BMP-2 to induce osteocalcin mRNA was decreased from 300 ng/ml to 100 and 30 ng/ml in the presence of 1.2 and 30 μg/ml of heparin, respectively (Fig. 1D). However, heparin alone failed to induce the osteocalcin mRNA, suggesting that C2C12 cells do not express BMPs even in the presence of heparin. Heparin gradually suppressed the proliferation capacity of C2C12 cells up to 30 μg/ml, but no significant difference was observed in the presence and absence of BMP-2 (Fig. 1E). The stimulatory effect of heparin on the osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP-2 was also observed in the bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, ST2, and osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1 (Fig. 1F). Heparin Stimulates Biological Activity of Homodimers and Heterodimers of BMPs—BMPs act as dimers consisting of monomers that belong to the same or different BMP subfamily. We examined the activity of homodimers and heterodimers of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 by cotransfecting each in C2C12 cells, and their activity was evaluated by ALP staining after 3 days. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, or BMP-7 induced a few ALP (+) cells. In contrast, cotransfection of BMP-2 and BMP-6, BMP-2 and BMP-7, BMP-4 and BMP-6, and BMP-4 and BMP-7 markedly induced the ALP (+) cells (Fig. 2A). To examine whether BMPs act as homodimers or heterodimers in these cultures, we prepared conditioned media from COS7 cells transfected with BMP-2, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-2/BMP-6, and BMP-2/BMP-7. Again, the conditioned media cotransfected BMP-2/BMP-6 or BMP-2/BMP-7 strongly induced the ALP activity in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, mixed conditioned media of BMP-2, BMP-6 or BMP-7, which were prepared individually and combined immediately before treatment of the cells, showed no significant synergism, suggesting that only heterodimers of BMPs have higher activity. Heparin also increased the number of ALP (+) cells induced by BMP-2/BMP-6 or BMP-2/BMP-7 (Fig. 2, B and C). However, heparin failed to increase the number of ALP (+) cells in the cultures treated with conditioned media of BMP-6 or BMP-7 (Fig. 2, B and C). Other Types of Sulfated Polysaccharide Also Enhance the BMP Activities—To determine the structural features of the heparin, we examined the structurally related but less sulfated polysaccharide, heparan sulfate, prepared from intestine or kidney. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, only intestine-derived heparan sulfate showed a stimulatory capacity on the BMP-2 activity in C2C12 cells. However, the ALP activity enhanced by the intestine-derived heparan sulfate was significantly lower than heparin (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined the effects of chemically modified heparins on the BMP-2-induced cell differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts. In this experiment, three heparin derivatives, CDSNAc, CDSNS, and NDSNAc, were compared with heparin at 4 μg/ml. All of these derivatives almost completely lost the stimulatory capacity on the BMP-2-induced ALP activity (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that both the O- and N-sulfate groups of heparin play important roles in the stimulatory activity. We further examined the effects of 3 types of dextran sulfate, which are synthetic sulfated polysaccharides, on the biological activity of BMP-2. High MW dextran sulfate (DS 50) increased the ALP activity at 0.1 μg/ml and low MW dextran sulfate molecules (DS 1.0 or DS 0.5) increased it at 1.0 μg/ml or greater (Fig. 3, E and F). However, treatment with dextran sulfate alone failed to induce the ALP activity (Fig. 3F). Next, we measured the total amounts of sulfur in the polysaccharides. Although heparin and 3 types of dextran sulfate contained 250 μg of sulfur mg–1 of polysaccharide, CDSNAc contained less than 15 μg of sulfur mg–1 of polysaccharide (Fig 3G). Other types of polysaccharides examined, including kidney- and intestine-derived heparan sulfate, CDSNS, and NDSNAc, contained sulfur greater than 50% heparin. Molecular Mechanism of the Stimulatory Effect of Heparin on BMP Activity—Next, we examined the molecular mechanism of heparin in the BMP signaling pathway. For this purpose, we examined the effects of heparin on the ALP activity induced by the different conditions in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, heparin failed to stimulate the ALP activity in the cultures transfected with the expression vector of ALP itself or the constitutively active BMP receptor and Smad1. In contrast, heparin clearly increased the number of ALP (+) cells induced by transfection of a BMP-2 expression vector in C2C12 cells, suggesting that heparin affects primarily BMPs rather than intracellular signaling or the ALP enzyme (Fig. 4). To examine the effect of heparin on the BMP-receptor binding, we generated FLAG-BMP-2, in which a FLAG epitope sequence was inserted in the mature domain, and then transfected into COS7 cells. FLAG-BMP-2 was recovered in the conditioned media and also stimulated the ALP activity in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown). We examined the amounts of complex consisting of FLAG-BMP-2 and ΔBMPR-IA receptor in C2C12 cells in the presence and absence of heparin. Surprisingly, heparin decreased the amounts of the ligand-receptor complex in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained using constitutively active BMPR-IA-His (data not shown). It was noticed that the amounts of FLAG-BMP-2 bound to the cell/extracellular matrix fraction, which were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody without immunoprecipitation, were also decreased by heparin (Fig. 5A). Thus, we monitored the amounts of FLAG-BMP-2 in the culture media. As shown in Fig. 5B, FLAG-BMP-2 disappeared from the culture media within 48 h in the absence of heparin. In the presence of heparin, however, a significant amount of FLAG-BMP-2 was still detected at 48 h (Fig. 5B). Finally, we examined the effects of heparin on the BMP signaling using an EGFP reporter, Id985-EGFPd2, in which a destabilized EGFP was driven under the control of a BMP-responsive element in the human Id1 gene (19Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Gene Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When the Id985-EGFPd2 plasmid was transfected into C2C12 cells and treated with BMP-2 in the absence of heparin, the EGFP (+) cells transiently appeared at 4 h but disappeared at 30 h (Fig. 5C). Heparin did not increase the number of the EGFP (+) cells at 4 h. However, large numbers of EGFP (+) cells were observed in the cultures treated with BMP-2 in the presence of heparin (Fig. 5C). In the present study, the effects of heparin on the biological activities of homodimers and heterodimers of BMPs were examined. We found that not only heparin but also heparan sulfate and dextran sulfate enhanced the biological activities of BMPs. The glypican family proteoglycans, which contain heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains, have been reported to play important roles in the BMP signaling in vertebrates and flies (37Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Recently, loss of the function mutation in glypican-3 was identified as the mutation responsible for Simpson Golabi Behmel syndrome in humans and mice, in which polydactyly and other skeletal abnormalities were observed (38Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Babayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 39Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Zupicich J. Skarnes W.C. Saunders S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that highly sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin and heparan sulfate physiologically regulate the BMP activities in vivo. It was suggested that sulfated polysaccharide chains are essential for the stimulatory capacity because desulfated heparin-derivatives have lost it. However, the total amount of sulfur in the chains did not parallel the capacity among various types of polysaccharides. These results suggest that not only the total amounts of sulfur but also its position and/or structure is important to modify the stimulatory capacity of BMP activity. The basic amino acid stretch found in the BMP-2 and BMP-4 subfamily may be involved in the interaction with the negatively charged polysaccharides (discussed below). It was also suggested that clinical application of the sulfated polysaccharides with BMPs locally stimulates their bone-inducing activity in vivo. This possibility is currently under investigation in our laboratories. Both heparin and heparan sulfate enhance the biological activities of FGFs. In these cases, the polysaccharides were reported to act as co-receptors and stimulate ligand binding to the signaling receptors (33Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar, 34Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, heparin also did not primarily affect the intracellular signaling of BMPs. Thus, it was initially suggested that heparin also acts as a co-receptor in this case. However, heparin decreased the BMP-2 binding to the functional receptor in the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, suggesting that another novel mechanism is involved in this case. We found that heparin retained the amounts of BMP-2 in the culture media and suppressed the accumulation of BMP-2 into the cell/extracellular fraction. To examine the biological activity of BMP-2 retained in the media, we used an EGFP reporter gene, Id985-EGFPd2, in which a destabilized EGFP was driven under the control of a BMP-2 responsive element in the human Id1 gene (19Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Gene Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results in the ligand-receptor binding assay, we did not see any increase in the number of EGFP (+) cells even in the presence of heparin at 4 h after treatment. However, large numbers of the EGFP (+) cells were observed only in the presence of heparin at 30 h. These results clearly suggest that BMP-2 retained in the culture media by heparin had not lost its biological activity and was still capable of binding to the signaling receptors. Crystal structural analysis of BMPs and their receptors suggested that the conserved region in the mature domain of BMPs over seven cysteine residues is critical for binding to the receptors (40Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 41Scheufler C. Sebald W. Hulsmeyer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 42Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, the basic amino acid stretch at the amino-terminal region, which is located outside this receptor-binding domain and conserved only in the BMP-2 and BMP-4 subfamily, was suggested as the heparin-binding site in this BMP subfamily (23Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 43Ohkawara B. Iemura S. ten Dijke P. Ueno N. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 205-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, heparin bound to BMPs may not prevent their binding capacity to the receptors. We previously reported that continuous stimulation by BMP-2 was required for the osteoblast differentiation in C2C12 cells (13Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Moreover, in our preliminary experiments, frequently changing the culture media to maintain the BMP concentration in the media markedly stimulated the BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation of C2C12 cells as in the case of the treatment with heparin. Taken together with the present results, it is suggested that heparin enhances the BMP activities by making complexes with BMPs in the culture media to prevent their accumulation into the cell/extracellular fraction, and continuously serving the ligands to their signaling receptors. Recently, it was reported that exogenous BMP-2 and TGF-β were internalized by endocytosis after binding to their specific receptors expressed on the cell surfaces (44Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 45Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 46Rauch C. Brunet A.C. Deleule J. Farge E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C235-C243Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The BMP-2 activity, including the induction of ALP activity, was enhanced in C2C12 cells when the cells were treated with inhibitors for endocytosis or a hyposmotic condition (46Rauch C. Brunet A.C.

These results suggest that not only the binding affinity of a ligand to the receptor but also stability of the ligand-receptor complex on the cell surface is one of the key factors to control the biological activity of the ligand in the target cells. It is also suggested that the sulfated polysaccharides inhibit endocytosis of BMP-2 in C2C12 cells. Further studies are necessary to clarify further the molecular mechanisms of the stimulatory capacity of the sulfated polysaccharides on the BMP activity. BMPs were originally purified from crude extracts of demineralized bone matrix using heparin-affinity chromatography (29Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the amino acid sequences of several BMPs have been identified in active fractions, it is still unclear that BMPs act physiologically as homodimers or heterodimers. In the developing tissues during embryogenesis, some BMP transcripts were expressed in the overlapping regions (47Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1995; 50: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 48Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 49Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T.

Moreover, crossing heterozygous BMP mutant mice to generate a doubly heterozygous strain showed more severe skeletal abnormalities than that of each single mutation (50Storm E.E. Kingsley D.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3969-3979PubMed Google Scholar, 51Katagiri T. Boorla S. Frendo J.L. Hogan B.L. Karsenty G. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Some of the recombinant BMP heterodimers such as BMP-2/6, BMP-2/7, and BMP-4/7 were shown to have more potent bone-inducing activity in vivo than their homodimers (8Hazama M. Aono A. Ueno N. Fujisawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Israel D.I. Nove J. Kerns K.M. Kaufman R.J. Rosen V. Cox K.A. Wozney J.M. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that BMP-4/6 also has potent activity to induce osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that heterodimers of BMPs consist of two different types of monomers, which belong to the BMP-2 and BMP-4 subfamily and the BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, and BMP-8 subfamily, have potent bone-inducing activity. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that cotransfection of two types of the same BMP subfamilies did not cause any synergism, at least in the present assay system. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the differences in the biological activities between homodimers and heterodimers of BMPs. In conclusion, we found that heparin and heparan sulfate enhance the biological activities of homodimers and heterodimers of BMPs. These sulfated polysaccharides form complexes with BMPs via negatively charged polysaccharide chains and a basic amino acid stretch in BMPs in the culture media, and continuously serve the ligands to their signaling receptors.

The structure of Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase bound to GreB was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and image processing of helical crystals to a nominal resolution of 15 Å, allowing fitting of high-resolution RNA polymerase and GreB structures. In the resulting model, the GreB N-terminal coiled-coil domain extends 45 Å through a channel directly to the RNA polymerase active site. The model leads to detailed insights into the mechanism of Gre factor activity that explains a wide range of experimental observations and points to a key role for conserved acidic residues at the tip of the Gre factor coiled coil in modifying the RNA polymerase active site to catalyze the cleavage reaction. Mutational studies confirm that these positions are critical for Gre factor function."
https://openalex.org/W2149187994,"The generation of biologically active proteins by regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a highly conserved mechanism in cell signaling. Presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity is responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of selected type I membrane proteins, including β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. A small fraction of intracellular domains derived from both APP and Notch translocates to and appears to function in the nucleus, suggesting a generic role for γ-secretase cleavage in nuclear signaling. Here we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) undergoes presenilin-dependent intramembrane proteolysis to yield the soluble p75-intracellular domain. The p75NTR is a multifunctional type I membrane protein that promotes neurotrophin-induced neuronal survival and differentiation by forming a heteromeric co-receptor complex with the Trk receptors. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of p75NTR occurs at a position located in the middle of the transmembrane (TM) domain, which is reminiscent of the amyloid β-peptide 40 (Aβ40) cleavage of APP and is topologically distinct from the major TM cleavage site of Notch 1. Size exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that TrkA forms a molecular complex together with either full-length p75 or membrane-tethered C-terminal fragments. The p75-ICD was not recruited into the TrkA-containing high molecular weight complex, indicating that γ-secretase-mediated removal of the p75 TM domain may perturb the interaction with TrkA. Independent of the possible nuclear function, our studies suggest that γ-secretase-mediated p75NTR proteolysis plays a role in the formation/disassembly of the p75-TrkA receptor complex by regulating the availability of the p75 TM domain that is required for this interaction.

Recent studies demonstrate that the p75NTR participates in more diverse biological events including cell death, migration, and axonal elongation. Given a widely postulated role in neuronal cell survival, the p75NTR is also thought to be associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Ref. 5Sofroniew M.V. Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). For instance, the p75NTR is a marker for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that undergo selective and severe degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (6Coyle J.T. Price D.L. DeLong M.R.

Limited homology among the putative cleavage sites of known γ-secretase substrates indicates that the intramembrane cleaving γ-secretase activity is not dependent on a specific amino acid target sequence immediately adjacent to the cleavage site.

Although γ-secretase is incapable of processing the full-length form of its substrates, it efficiently cleaves membrane-anchored truncated C-terminal derivatives produced by ectodomain shedding (26Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Early reports showed that the truncated p75 extracellular domain that contains the NGF-binding region is released into the culture medium and biological fluids, indicating that the p75NTR undergoes ectodomain shedding (27DiStefano P.S.

We predicted that there may be cell-associated C-terminal proteolytic fragments resulting from ectodomain shedding of the full-length p75 receptor in addition to the corresponding extracellular domain that is released from the cell. Because extracellular cleavage of type I membrane proteins is a pre-requisite for their subsequent γ-secretase-mediated cleavage (26Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether the p75NTR could be subjected to γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis. Here we report that p75NTR is a novel substrate of the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase and that intramembrane proteolysis of the p75NTR may play a role in the formation or disassembly of the neurotrophin receptor complex containing the p75NTR and Trk receptors. Plasmids—To generate constructs encoding C-terminal V5/His-tagged p75NTR and Trk receptors, coding sequences from the pCMV constructs (32Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) coding for the full-length human p75NTR, rat TrkA, rat TrkB, or rat TrkC were amplified by PCR using High Fidelity PCR Master (Roche Applied Science) and subcloned into pEF-V5/His vector using TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). To generate constructs encoding truncated p75 lacking the entire ectodomain (p75-ΔE14), the following primers were used: a 5′ primer consisting of the KpnI restriction site fused to Kozak and start codons followed by the preprotrypsin signal peptide, HA recognition sequence, and the 5′ region of p75 consisting of the first extracellular amino acid only (5′-taaggggtaccccaccatgtctgcacttctgatcctagctcttgttggagctgcagttgcttatccatatgatgttccagattatgctaacctcattcctgtctattgc-3′). The 3′ primer consisted of the 3′ region of p75 inclusive of the endogenous stop codon followed by an EcoRI site (5′-atacggaattcctcacactggggatgtggcagtgg-3′). The expression construct encoding full-length rat p75 with the N-terminal signal peptide followed by the Streptag II and HA epitope tag (St75) was generated by PCR amplification using N-terminal signal peptide and HA-tagged full-length rat p75 as template. The primers used were 5′-St75 (gctactgcagttgctTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAAggcgcctatccatatgatgttccagattatgctaaggagac) and 3′-St75 (gtcctggcaggagaacacgagtcccgagcc). Capital letters denote the incorporated Strep-tag II (St2) sequence (NH2-WSHPQFEKCOOH). PCR products were digested with PstI and subcloned into PstI-digested N-terminal signal peptide and the HA-tagged full-length rat p75 construct. All constructs were fully verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—HEK293 and SN56 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen). For stable or transient transfection, Superfect (Qiagen) transfection reagents were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting 293 cells with the indicated plasmids (e.g. St75 or p75V5) and screening individual Zeocin-resistant colonies by Western blot using anti-HA. The p75/TrkA double stable line (St75A1) was generated by co-transfecting 293 cells with Strep75-pcDNA3.1-Zeo(+) and TrkA-pEF6 that has a V5-His tag at the C-terminal of TrkA. Individual Zeocin and blasticidin-resistant colonies were screened by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-V5. Compound E was synthesized and provided by T. Golde, A. Fauq, and C. Ziani-Cherif. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed using buffer IP (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Protein quantification, SDS-PAGE (4-20 or 8%), and Western blot analyses were carried out as described previously (10Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: polyclonal anti-p75-ICD (Promega) 1:1000; monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen) 1:5000; and monoclonal HA.11 (Covance) 1:2000. Affinity Isolation of Secreted p75 Ectodomain—Media from cultured p75 stable cells (St75 or St75A1) were subjected to affinity isolation using Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (IBA, Germany) as recommended by manufacturer. Briefly, the samples were incubated with Strep-Tactin-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed four times with Wash buffer. Affinity binding proteins were eluted with elution buffer. Eluents were concentrated using Speed-vac, resuspended in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purification of p75-ICD and Mass Spectrometry—Active membrane preparation and cell-free generation of the p75-ICD were performed as described (10Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions from 60 150-mm dishes of 293 cells stably transfected with p75-pEF6/V5-His were incubated 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the soluble p75-ICD was separated by centrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were loaded onto a Q Fast Flow Hitrap column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.0 to 1.0 m NaCl and column fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. Fractions containing p75-ICD were pooled and further purified by using Talon metal affinity beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). After analyzing the affinity purified proteins by Western blot analysis and silver staining using SilverQuest stain kit (Invitrogen), eluents were concentrated and separated on 8-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. The protein band corresponding to p75-ICD was subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described (33Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Ha S.H. Yoo J.S. Du G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21295-21301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI-TOF MS was compared with theoretical masses of trypsin-digested p75 fragments. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed 3 times with PBS, and blocked for 4 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in PBS. Cells were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies under the following conditions: polyclonal anti-p75-ICD (Promega, 1:300) in 10% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS; monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500) in 4% normal goat serum, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. Alexa 568-labeled anti-mouse or Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:1000) were used for detection. Samples were mounted and fluorescence images were captured using an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with Spot-RT™ cooled digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Immunoprecipitation—After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed with IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The pre-cleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 (1:300, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with IP buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Size Exclusion Chromatography—St75A1 cells were harvested with IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were filtered and fractionated using a Superose 6 gel filtration FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) that was pre-equilibrated with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. The standard protein markers were as follows: blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). Ectodomain shedding of many cell surface receptors has been shown to be promoted by treatment with phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (34Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether TPA-induced ectodomain shedding of the full-length p75NTR produces truncated C-terminal fragments that may serve as putative substrate fragments of γ-secretase. Treatment of the p75NTR-transfected 293 cells with TPA resulted in ∼30-kDa transgene-derived p75NTR C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1A). However, NGF treatment did not cause any detectable accumulation of these fragments. Cell fractionation studies corroborated that these fragments are tightly associated with the membrane (data not shown). To detect the soluble p75 extracellular domain, 293 cells were stably transfected with expression constructs encoding the p75NTR with an N-terminal affinity tag. Constitutively released p75 ectodomain was detectable in the control medium and greatly increased by TPA treatment (Fig. 1B). Release of the soluble p75 ectodomain was blocked efficiently by TAPI-2, a general metalloprotease inhibitor, indicating that a metalloprotease, such as tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme, is responsible for p75 ectodomain shedding. Antibody raised against the p75-ICD failed to detect these fragments in the medium (data not shown). We next tested whether the C-terminal fragments derived from ectodomain shedding are subject to γ-secretase cleavage. It has been shown that synthetic γ-secretase inhibitors enhance accumulation of substrate fragments by inhibiting γ-secretase-mediated turnover (9Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G.

The levels of full-length p75NTR were not affected by the γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. Overnight treatment of compound E caused a similar accumulation of p75 C-terminal fragments even in the absence of TPA stimulation, suggesting that both ectodomain shedding and subsequent γ-secretase cleavage occur in the cells constitutively (Fig. 2B). Another unrelated γ-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458 (36Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), gave rise to similar effects (data not shown). However, γ-secretase inhibitor treatment did not confer any detectable effects on C-terminal fragment accumulation in cells transfected with constructs encoding TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC (Fig. 2B). Although γ-secretase inhibition led to the accumulation of putative substrate fragments of p75, the predicted intracellular domain derived from p75NTR (p75-ICD) was not readily detectable by Western blot analysis, suggesting that the p75-ICD is unstable in the intact cells. We therefore attempted to detect the p75-ICD by inhibiting a proteasomal pathway that has been shown to mediate degradation of Notch intracellular domain (22Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 37Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M. Lendahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35847-35853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Treatment of p75-transfected 293 cells with MG132 caused the accumulation of ∼25-kDa fragments (Fig. 2C). MG132-induced accumulation of 25-kDa p75 fragments could be efficiently inhibited by treatment with compound E, indicating that this fragment represents the p75-ICD. Additional proteasome inhibitors, including lactacystin, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, proteasome inhibitor I, and epoxomicin, all caused the accumulation of the p75-ICD, whereas calpain inhibitors did not exhibit any detectable effects on p75-ICD accumulation (Fig. 2D). The effects of lactacystin, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and epoxomicin on the p75-ICD accumulation were saturated at 1 μm concentration (data not shown). These data indicate that γ-secretase-generated p75-ICD is rapidly removed via proteasomal degradation. To demonstrate a direct γ-secretase-dependent generation of p75-ICD from p75 C-terminal fragments (versus full-length), we expressed a p75-ΔE14 construct, which encodes a truncated p75 protein that lacks the entire ectodomain but contains the entire cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the p75NTR immediately following the signal sequence (Fig. 2E). Thus, the p75-ΔE14 proteins are predicted to undergo constitutive cleavage by γ-secretase in the absence of ectodomain shedding, similar to the previously reported constitutive Notch ΔE constructs (22Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The p75-ICD was detectable in 293 cells transfected with p75-ΔE14 constructs under the condition described in Fig. 1E, indicating that the p75-ICD is constitutively generated directly from the truncated p75-ΔE14 proteins. To demonstrate γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of endogenous p75NTR, we utilized cholinergic SN56 cells (38Blusztajn J.K. Venturini A. Jackson D.A. Lee H.J. Wainer B.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 793-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the endogenous p75-ICD was stabilized and detected in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2F). TPA treatment caused the added accumulation of membrane-associated p75 C-terminal fragments and subsequent generation of p75-ICD in SN56 cells (Fig. 2F). Our data show that the p75-ICD is produced endogenously in intact SN56 cells. We next studied whether functional presenilins are required for γ-secretase cleavage of the p75NTR. For this purpose, we first examined the accumulation of the p75 C-terminal fragments in the stable 293 cells expressing the dominant-negative forms of PS1 and PS2 (10Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative mutations in conserved aspartate residues (e.g. PS1-D385 and PS2-D366) abolish the biological activities of PS1 and PS2, including γ-secretase cleavage (39Wolfe M.S. Xia W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In cells expressing dominant-negative presenilins, the accumulation of the p75 C-terminal fragments was dramatically elevated as compared with cell lines expressing comparable levels of wild-type forms of PS1 and PS2 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). TPA treatment further increased the accumulation of p75 C-terminal fragments in dominant-negative presenilin cells, indicating that γ-secretase-mediated turnover of the p75 C-terminal fragments requires functional presenilins (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Similar increases in the levels of the p75 C-terminal fragments were also observed in fibroblasts lacking both PS1 and PS2 (data not shown). To directly demonstrate presenilin-dependent generation of p75-ICD, we assayed the generation of p75-ICD from membrane fractions prepared from 293 cells expressing either wild-type or dominant-negative presenilins by incubating at 37 °C in the presence or absence of compound E. The generation of p75-ICD was impaired in the membrane fractions from dominant-negative presenilin cells and by the wild-type cell membrane fractions treated with compound E in Fig. 3B. Our data indicate that presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage is responsible for the generation of p75-ICD and inhibition of this cleavage leads to enhanced accumulation of membrane-associated p75 C-terminal substrate fragments. Because the p75-ICD is unstable in intact cells (Fig. 2), to isolate sufficient amounts of the p75-ICD for determining the major γ-secretase cleavage site, we utilized a cell-free γ-secretase assay system (10Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) using membrane fractions prepared from stable 293 transfectants overexpressing the p75NTR with C-terminal V5 and His6 (V5/His) affinity tags. Membrane fractions were prepared on a large scale and subjected to in vitro γ-secretase cleavage (Fig. 4A). The p75-ICD fragments containing V5/His tags were subsequently generated in a γ-secretase inhibitor-sensitive manner and a portion of the p75-ICD was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 4B). The ICDs generated from cells and in vitro co-migrated on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the p75-ICD in the soluble fraction is likely to have an identical N-terminal end to the p75-ICD generated in intact cells (Fig. 4C). The p75-ICD-containing soluble fraction was collected and subjected to chromatographic separations using ion exchange and metal-affinity (Talon) resins. Column fractions positive for the p75-ICD were pooled, separated on SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained (Fig. 4D). The silver-stained bands corresponding to the p75-ICD were subjected to in-gel digestion and MALDITOF mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 4D). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a major peak of molecular mass of 1855.0, as well as many minor peaks (Fig. 4E). Eight different tryptic peptides derived from the p75-ICD were identified in our MALDI-TOF analysis (Table I). The major peak (P1) and a minor peak (P2) were detected at 1855.0 and 1236.6, which correspond to the peptide sequences of VGLVAYIAFKRWNSCK and VGLVAYIAFKR, respectively (Fig. 4E; Table I). Predicted mass values were 1855.0 for P1 and 1236.7 for P2. Both peptides start at Val-236 of the human p75NTR (Fig. 4, E and F), indicating that the p75-ICD is generated as a result of proteolysis between amino acids Val-235 and Val-236. Interestingly, the major cleavage site of the p75NTR is located immediately after the amino acid sequence AAVV, similar to the Aβ40 cleavage site that resides immediately following an analogous sequence (GGVV) (Fig. 4E). Our data indicate that the major intramembrane cleavage site of the p75NTR is located in the middle of the transmembrane domain that is reminiscent of the Aβ40 cleavage of APP and is topologically distinct from the major transmembrane cleavage site of mouse Notch 1 (S3 site) (22Schroeter E.H.

We noticed that the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the p75NTR appear to be the essential structural regions for its interaction with the Trk receptor (45Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) as well as for forming a high affinity NGF receptor (44Esposito D. Patel P. Stephens R.M. Perez P. Chao M.V. Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32687-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the extracellular and/or intramembrane cleavage of the p75NTR (and subsequent domain truncations) may directly influence its interaction with Trk receptor. We first tested whether TrkA co-localizes with truncated p75NTR variants produced by deletion constructs (Fig. 5A). 293 cells were co-transfected with TrkA constructs (with C-terminal V5/His epitope tag) along with constructs encoding vector alone (data not shown), p75 full-length, ΔE14 (containing the TM and cytoplasmic domains but not the extracellular domain; Fig. 2E), and p75-ICD (a predicted γ-secretase product). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both full-length p75NTR and truncated ΔE14 are distributed in membranous structures and display an overall colocalization with TrkA (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the p75-ICD was distributed ubiquitously in the cell and appears to be concentrated in the nucleus as depicted by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining. The distribution of p75-ICD was clearly different from that of TrkA. Treatment with compound E appeared to redistribute the co-localization patterns (indicated by the area of overlapping fluorescence signal) of TrkA and ΔE14 to include the trans-Golgi network/Golgi-like structures as well as the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). We next tested whether TrkA can interact with truncated p75NTR variants expressed by deletion constructs (Fig. 6A). 293 cells were co-transfected with TrkA constructs along with the p75 constructs mentioned above: full-length, ΔE14, and p75-ICD. A full-length ErbB4 construct was included as a negative control (10Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The lysates were then subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analyses using anti-V5 antibodies under detergent conditions (1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40) previously described for the co-immunoprecipitation between full-length forms of TrkA and p75NTR (45Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Both full-length and ΔE14 were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-V5 antibody, indicating that TrkA associates with both p75NTR full-length and the predicted metallo-protease generated C-terminal fragments (ΔE14) (Fig. 6A). Our data imply that the ectodomain-shedded p75NTR C-terminal fragments may still be complexed with TrkA and are predicted to serve as a high affinity NGF receptor (44Esposito D. Patel P. Stephens R.M. Perez P. Chao M.V. Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32687-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p75-ICD (Fig. 6A) and ErbB4 (Fig. 6B) failed to interact with TrkA, indicating that TrkA interacts with membrane-tethered p75NTR but not with the p75-ICD. These data suggest that γ-secretase cleavage slashes the TM domain that is required for the association of p75NTR with the Trk receptor. To further investigate the molecular interaction between TrkA and cell-generated p75 proteolytic fragments, we next performed size exclusion chromatographic analyses using the detergent lysates prepared from stable 293 cells co-expressing TrkA and full-length p75NTR. To promote the generation and detection of the p75 C-terminal fragments and p75-ICD (derived from the full-length p75NTR), the cells were incubated with TPA and lactacystin in the absence (Fig. 7A) or presence (Fig. 7B) of compound E. The full-length p75NTR and TrkA exhibited virtually identical distribution in size exclusion chromatography fractions and the p75 C-terminal fragments exhibited an overlapping elution profile with TrkA (Fig. 7, A and B). The molecular mass of the high molecular weight complexes harboring TrkA and p75 full-length or C-terminal fragments was estimated as the size ranging between ∼300 and 800 kDa. In contrast, p75-ICD migrated as a low molecular weight species, indicating that the p75-ICD is not recruited into the TrkA-bearing high molecular weight complex. In the parallel analyses, treatment with TPA, lactacystin, or compound E alone did not alter the distribution of TrkA and full-length p75NTR in the size exclusion chromatography fractions (data not shown). We showed herein that p75NTR is the only γ-secretase substrate identified so far that undergoes intramembrane proteolysis at the site precisely corresponding to the Aβ40 cleavage. Although it is still possible that the minor γ-secretase cleavage(s) might occur in alternate site(s) that were not detected in our MALDI-TOF analysis, our studies indicate that the single cleavage in the middle of the TM domain was sufficient to cause the release of the p75-ICD, without a need for additional cleavage near the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, such as γ49 or Notch S3 cleavage (Fig. 4). Given a widely postulated role for neurotrophin receptors in cholinergic neuronal survival, our studies further raise the possibility that, like APP, altered proteolytic processing of p75NTR may contribute to the selective dysfunction and/or degeneration of p75-expressing neurons in Alzheimer's disease (e.g. basal forebrain cholinergic neurons) (6Coyle J.T. Price D.L. DeLong M.R. Science. 1983; 219: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 7Auld D.S. Kornecook T.J. Bastianetto S. Quirion R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 68: 209-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is conceivable that therapeutic reagents based on general inhibition of γ-secretase activity may potentially affect p75 signaling and p75-associated cholinergic neuronal survival and differentiation. The intracellular domains derived from APP and Notch appear to function commonly as nuclear signaling proteins. It remains to be determined whether the p75-ICD would also function as a nuclear transcriptional modulator like Notch and APP. Our data suggest that the main role of the γ-secretase is to remove the p75 TM domain that is an essential domain for molecular interaction with the Trk receptor (Fig. 8). γ-Secretase-mediated conversion of p75NTR from membrane-tethered p75 fragments to p75-ICD may occur while the p75 is bound to TrkA. Alternatively, p75 ectodomain shedding may occur without Trk receptors and additional cleavage by γ-secretase would remove the membrane-tethered p75 fragments, thereby precluding interaction with Trk (Fig. 8). Independent of the possible nuclear function, our studies suggest that γ-secretase-mediated p75NTR proteolysis plays a role in the formation/disassembly of this receptor complex by regulating the availability of the TM domain that is required for interaction with the Trk receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2061737733,"Olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor (OR) project with precision to specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, generating a topographic map. In this study, we demonstrate that neurons expressing different ORs express different levels of ephrin-A protein on their axons. Moreover, alterations in the level of ephrin-A alter the glomerular map. Deletion of the ephrin-A5 and ephrin-A3 genes posteriorizes the glomerular locations for neurons expressing either the P2 or SR1 receptor, whereas overexpression of ephrin-A5 in P2 neurons results in an anterior shift in their glomeruli. Thus the ephrin-As are differentially expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurons and are likely to participate, along with the ORs, as one of a complement of guidance receptors governing the targeting of like axons to precise locations in the olfactory bulb."

Although their biochemical and physiological roles are still unclear, it has been suggested that dehydrins may play a role in stabilizing proteins or membrane structures under environmental stresses through interactions with an amphipathic α-helix (9Koag M.C. Fenton R.D. Wilkens S. Close T.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Calcium levels control a variety of plant developmental and signal transduction processes (14Bush D.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), and in particular, calcium signaling is requisite for plant responses to environmental signals (16Knight H. Trewavas A.J.

A transient change in cytosolic calcium levels is one of the initial responses of some plants to adverse environmental conditions such as low temperature, drought, and salinity (16Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 19Knight H. Brandt S. Knight M.R.

Several studies show that the ability of plants to withstand calcium level changes is essential for them to survive different abiotic stresses (16Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 24Minorsky P.V. Plant Cell Environ. 1989; 12: 119-135Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Minorsky P.V. Spanswick R.M.

Typically, cytosolic free calcium is maintained at submicromolecular levels (∼200 nm) by homeostatic mechanisms involving a variety of calcium channels, pumps, and secondary transporters in a variety of cell organelles such as vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplasts and mitochondria, and cell wall (14Bush D.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 95-122Crossref Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 15Sanders D. Brownlee C. Harper J.F.

Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium homeostasis is also maintained in plant cells by a variety of calcium-binding proteins, such as calsequestrin (27Xing T. Williams L.E. Nelson S.J. East J.M. Hall J.L. Protoplasma. 1994; 179: 158-165Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Persson S. Wyatt S.E. Love J. Thompson W.F. Robertson D. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1092-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), calnexin (29Li X. Su R.T. Hsu H.T. Sze H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and calreticulin (30Nelson D.E. Glaunsinger B. Bohnert H.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Calcium levels in the cytosol increases by several orders of magnitude upon signaling; however, sustained elevation of calcium can be toxic (31Hepler P.K. Wayne R.O. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1985; 36: 397-439Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cold-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases are caused by calcium leakage across membranes initiated at the plasma membrane and perpetuated by calcium release mainly from vacuole and endoplasmic reticulum (16Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 17Polisensky D.H. Braam J.

The connection between stress-induced increases in cytosolic calcium and the accumulation of dehydrins has suggested to us that a potential physiological role for dehydrins in cold stress management could be ion binding. It was recently determined by our laboratory that a celery protein, similar in sequence to dehydrins (VCaB45), binds calcium (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that another dehydrin-like protein found in castor bean has metal binding capability (34Kruger C. Berkowitz O. Stephan U.W. Hell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25062-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The present study is a characterization of a known Arabidopsis dehydrin, ERD14, its ion binding activity, and its regulation by phosphorylation. Plant Materials and Extractions—Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) seedlings were grown with 16/8 h light/dark period at 20 °C. Low temperature treatment was performed on 3–4-week-old plants for 2 days 4.7 °C. Total protein extracts of Arabidopsis plants were obtained from cold-treated and control tissues (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In some cases low density membranes were isolated from cold-treated A. thaliana in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described in Heyen et al. (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 (0.2% w/w) was used to release the contents of the membrane vesicles (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Supernatants derived from the permeabilized membranes were heat-treated in an 85 °C water bath for 20 min and quickly cooled in an ethanol bath (–50 °C) for 5 min. The soluble fraction was then obtained after ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Anion exchange chromatography was performed on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 at 4 °C. ERD14 Cloning and Expression—A λ-PRL2 expression library (obtained from Ohio State Plant Resource Center) was subcloned into the pHEP2 vector (50Biermann B.J. Morehead T.A. Tate S.E. Price J.R. Randall S.K. Crowell D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25251-25254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the PstI and XbaI sites. Bacterial colonies were screened on replicate lifts after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as reported previously (50Biermann B.J. Morehead T.A. Tate S.E. Price J.R. Randall S.K. Crowell D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25251-25254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the antibody raised against the celery dehydrin-like protein, VCaB45 (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), using a secondary antibody of anti-mouse/alkaline phosphatase. Blots were developed with the colorimetric substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The fusion protein was expected to be ∼5 kDa greater than ERD14 due to the inclusion of v-Ras sequences (50Biermann B.J. Morehead T.A. Tate S.E. Price J.R. Randall S.K. Crowell D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25251-25254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the induced ERD14 was present as two bands. A minor band (of the expected size for the fusion protein) and an ∼5-kDa smaller band (major band) were obtained. The major band was purified and sequenced by Edman degradation from the amino terminus. This revealed that the v-Ras portion of the fusion was missing, and additionally, the two amino-terminal amino acids (methionine-alanine) of ERD14 had been removed by proteolysis. The presence of the predicted amino-terminal tryptic peptide (lacking Met-Ala) was also confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). This product, ERD14 lacking the amino-terminal two residues, was used for all the studies described here. Purification of ERD14 —Induced cells (1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) were harvested and resuspended in 2× homogenizing buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Samples were sonicated for 5 min and heat-treated as described before. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were treated with 0.2% protamine sulfate to precipitate DNA and ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on a 40-ml packed bed of diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (1 ml/min flow rate). ERD14 fractions were further concentrated on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting—Antibodies raised against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. Anti-dehydrin antiserum was kindly supplied by Dr. Timothy J. Close (3Close T.J. Fenton R.D. Moonan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Mid-West Scientific). For anti-dehydrin antibody, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. When anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine were used, membranes were blocked with 5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, respectively, in Tris-buffered saline. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (goat) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies. Antibody detection procedures were with SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). ERD14 in Vitro Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation—Purified E. coli-expressed ERD14 (∼7.5 μg) was incubated with 10 units of casein kinase II in 1× kinase buffer (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc.) and 1 mm ATP at 30 °C in a total of 10 μl. In some cases, 1 mm Staurosporine (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc.) was added after 30 min to inhibit protein kinase activity. Dephosphorylation was performed with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were boiled for 5 min. For the 32P incorporation experiments, purified ERD14 was phosphorylated in the presence of 0.8 mm ATP (0.17 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). 32P incorporation was visualized with a PhosphorImager (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics). In some cases, reactions were terminated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, and precipitates were collected on GFA glass fiber filters (Mid-West Scientific) and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and then 100% acetone. In such cases, the incorporated 32P was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphorylation of ERD14 by A. thaliana Protein Extract—Extracts from whole A. thaliana plants treated for 2 days at 4 or 20 °C were incubated with or without the bacterial-purified ERD14 (final concentration of 95 ng/μl), 0.1 mm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaF at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Calcium Binding Activity Assays—Calcium binding activity was determined by ligand blotting and equilibrium dialysis (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis assays were performed with Teflon Micro Dialyzer cells (QuizSep, Mid-West Scientific) and Spectra/Por MWCO 6–8,000 membranes (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples (purified from E. coli) were mixed with an equal volume of 8 m urea and incubated for 30 min at 55 °. To reduce the urea concentration to 1 m, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, was added. Protein was then digested overnight with shaking at 37 °C with 1 μg of freshly prepared sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, V511A) dissolved in 50 mm acetic acid. A C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore) was used to remove urea and desalt the digestion solution. ERD14 purified from Arabidopsis was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and Coomassie-stained. Protein bands corresponding to ERD14 were excised and manually processed. Samples were destained with 50% acetonitrile in water for 15 min at 20 °C, 50% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min at 20 °C and 100% acetonitrile for 10 min at 20 °C. After removing the destain solution, 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces and incubated for 45 min at 50 °C. For alkylation, dithiothreitol was replaced with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 20 °C. Gel pieces were rinsed twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min at 20 °C. Protein bands were digested overnight at 37 °C with 150 ng of freshly prepared sequencing grade trypsin. Equal volumes of water and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate were added to the digestion solution to give a final trypsin solution of 1 ng/μl. After a C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore) purification, the protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Sigma) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS (MALDI LR™, Micromass, UK, located at the Indiana University, Purdue University Indianapolis Proteomic Core Facility). The mass of peptides obtained from each band were compared with the computer-generated list of deduced tryptic fragments to identify the 80-Da shift corresponding to phosphorylation using the FindMod site (ca.expasy.org/tools/findmod) for single phosphorylation sites and a Command Prompt program written to find multiple phosphorylations on single peptide fragments. Genomic Solutions™ (65.219.84.5/index.html) web site was used to search for protein identification (ProFound™) and to identify the theoretical phosphorylation sites on ERD14 (Protein Association Work Station, PAWS™). In Vitro Phosphorylation and Calcium Binding of ERD14 — ERD14 was cloned from an Arabidopsis expression library using antibody raised against celery VCaB45, a dehydrin-like protein (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the purified E. coli-expressed ERD14, as estimated by 10% SDS-PAGE, was 37 kDa (See Figs. 1, 2, and 3B). The molecular mass of ERD14, deduced from the amino acid sequence, is 20.9 kDa. The mass of the protein used in these studies is predicted to be 20.6 kDa (lacks the amino-terminal two amino acids). The anomalous migration resulting in the overestimation of mass by SDS-PAGE is commonly found in other dehydrins (5Welin B.V. Olson A. Nylander M. Palva E.T. Plant Mol.

Purified E. coli-expressed ERD14 was treated for 3 h at 30 °C with or without CKII. One portion of the phosphorylated ERD14 was then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 5 units of SAP. After SDS-PAGE analyses, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Panel A, purified E. coli-expressed ERD14 is phosphorylated on at least two sites. ERD14 was in vitro phosphorylated at 30 °C with casein kinase II in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. At the indicated times reactions were terminated with 25% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected on GFA glass fiber filters and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 100% acetone. 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data are the average of three experiments. S.D. are shown as error bars. Panel B, purified E. coli expressed ERD14 is phosphorylated by CKII in threonine and serine sites. After SDS-PAGE, blots were probed with anti-phosphothreonine (top panel) and anti-phosphoserine (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous work with a dehydrin-like protein (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the presence of potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites on ERD14 and other dehydrins suggested that ERD14 might be a substrate for CKII. Indeed, treatment of the purified E. coli-expressed ERD14 with CKII resulted in a shift in the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE gels (Figs. 1A and 2), with an apparent increase of ∼5 kDa. The shifted polypeptides were confirmed to be ERD14 with a dehydrin-specific antibody, raised against the conserved K-domain of dehydrins (Fig. 1A). The ERD14 gel shift was nearly completed after a 30-min phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Dephosphorylation of CKII-phosphorylated ERD14 with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) resulted in a quantitative return to the smaller molecular mass (Fig. 2). We have utilized this gel shifting phenomena to routinely assess the phosphorylation status of ERD14, as demonstrated for other phosphorylated proteins (33Heyen B.J. Alsheikh M.K. Smith E.A. Torvik C.F. Seals D.F. Randall S.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 39Kitta K. Clement S.A. Remeika J. Blumberg J.B. Suzuki Y.J. Biochem.

To quantitate ERD14 phosphorylation, ERD14 was phosphorylated with CKII in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. A rapid increase in phosphorylation of ERD14 was observed in the first 30 min of CKII treatment and approached a plateau after 1 h. Phosphorylation of ERD14 correlated temporally with the gel shifting of ERD14 on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the E. coli-expressed ERD14 bound calcium and whether this activity was regulated by phosphorylation, ERD14 was in vitro phosphorylated with CKII and separated on SDS-PAGE. Calcium binding activity was then assessed by calcium (45CaCl2) ligand blots and visualized by phosphorimaging. Fig. 1C demonstrates that E. coli-expressed ERD14 binds calcium only when phosphorylated. Quantitative analysis of the calcium ligand blot showed an increase in ERD14 calcium binding with increased phosphorylation and that ERD14 calcium binding activity approached saturation after 1 h (Fig. 1C). Calcium binding, as measured by a calcium-ligand blot (Fig. 1C), correlated well with the gel shifting of ERD14 on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1A) and with the extent of phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To analyze the extent of phosphorylation of the E. coli-expressed ERD14, CKII-phosphorylated ERD14 (with [γ-32P] ATP) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and collected on glass fiber filters. Approximately two mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of ERD14 after 3 h of phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), indicating at least 2 possible phosphorylation sites on ERD14. No further 32P was incorporated into ERD14 for up to 5 h of phosphorylation. In some experiments fresh CKII was added after 3 h, 2M. K. Alsheikh and S. K. Randall, unpublished data. with no further incorporation observed. Western blots probed with antibodies raised against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine indicated that both threonine and serine were possible phosphorylation sites on ERD14 (Fig. 3B). Because phosphothreonine was detected only after 3 h of phosphorylation it is unlikely the phosphorylation requisite for the gel shifting and calcium binding activation was due to phosphorylation on a threonine. Western blots probed with anti-phosphoserine showed a subtle increase in serine phosphorylation over time (15–120 min). However, the anti-phosphoserine antibodies used were not specific for serine phosphorylation (Sigma, catalog number P3430, and Zymed Laboratories Inc., catalog number 61-8100) because they reacted with non-phosphorylated ERD14. Because dehydrins seem to lack significant secondary structure and have been considered to be intrinsically unstructured proteins (41Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar), we thought it was possible that activation of calcium binding could be due to a rapid phosphorylation but require a slower induced structural change. To test this hypothesis ERD14 was treated for 30 min with CKII, further phosphorylation was prevented by adding staurosporine, and the incubation was continued. No further increase in calcium binding occurred with further incubation in the presence of staurosporine (Fig. 4). These results suggest that gel shifting requires an enzymatically active kinase and that calcium binding activity of the purified ERD14 does not require slow phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes. The quantitative effect of the phosphorylation on ERD14 calcium binding activity is illustrated by equilibrium dialysis experiments, which show saturable binding of calcium to native ERD14 (see Fig. 5). Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 5B) indicated that CKII-phosphorylated ERD14 binds ∼3 mol of calcium per mol of ERD14 with relatively low affinity, having an apparent Kd for calcium of 120 μm. W"

Here we report that the swift and profound cytotoxicity induced by purified ExoU or by an ExoU-expressing strain of P. aeruginosa is blocked by various inhibitors of cytosolic (cPLA2) and Ca2+ -independent (iPLA2) phospholipase A2 enzymes. In contrast, no cytoprotection is offered by inhibitors of secreted phospholipase A2 enzymes or by a number of inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. This suggests that phospholipase A2 inhibitors may represent a novel mode of treatment for acute P. aeruginosa infections. We find that 300–600 molecules of ExoU/cell are required to achieve half-maximal cell killing and that ExoU localizes to the host cell plasma membrane in punctate fashion. We also show that ExoU interacts in vitro with an inhibitor of cPLA2 and iPLA2 enzymes and contains a putative serine-aspartate catalytic dyad homologous to those found in cPLA2 and iPLA2 enzymes. Mutation of either the serine or the aspartate renders ExoU non-cytotoxic. Although no phospholipase or esterase activity is detected in vitro, significant phospholipase activity is detected in vivo, suggesting that ExoU requires one or more host cell factors for activation as a membrane-lytic and cytotoxic phospholipase.

Treatment is often problematic due to antibiotic resistance of this pathogen. A number of bacterial factors have been implicated in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, and prominent among these is the type III secretion system (TTSS). 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2; iPLA2, Ca2+-independent PLA2; sPLA2, secreted PLA2; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TX-100, Triton X-100; PAPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; Lyso-PC, lysophosphatidylcholine; PPPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; ATK, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; PTK, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2; iPLA2, Ca2+-independent PLA2; sPLA2, secreted PLA2; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TX-100, Triton X-100; PAPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; Lyso-PC, lysophosphatidylcholine; PPPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; ATK, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone; PTK, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Approximately three-quarters of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa express one or more TTSS proteins when tested in vitro (5Roy-Burman A. Savel R.H. Racine S. Swanson B.L. Revadigar N.S. Fujimoto J.

Ehrmantraut M.E. Banwart B.D. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa strains that express TTSS proteins are associated with greater mortality rates in patients and increased severity of disease (5Roy-Burman A. Savel R.H. Racine S. Swanson B.L. Revadigar N.S. Fujimoto J. Sawa T. Frank D.W. Wiener-Kronish J.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Hauser A.R. Cobb E. Bodi M. Mariscal D. Valles J. Engel J.N. Rello J. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additionally, vaccination with a TTSS component (PcrV) has been shown to decrease lung inflammation and injury in challenged mice (8Sawa T. Yahr T.L. Ohara M. Kurahashi K. Gropper M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Frank D.W. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The proteins ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY are exported directly into the cytosol of host mammalian cells through the TTSS of P. aeruginosa (9Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), although most strains generally do not express all four at the same time (5Roy-Burman A. Savel R.H. Racine S. Swanson B.L. Revadigar N.S. Fujimoto J. Sawa T. Frank D.W. Wiener-Kronish J.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Hauser A.R. Cobb E. Bodi M.

Microbiology (Reading). 2001; 147: 2659-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). ExoS and ExoT are highly related and have dual functions, acting as both a GTPase-activating protein (11Krall R. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6066-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Goehring U.M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol.

Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ExoY has been identified as an adenylate cyclase (16Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13899-13904Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ADP-ribosyl transferase activities of ExoS and ExoT and the adenylate cyclase activity of ExoY are dependent on host cell factors, the 14-3-3 protein FAS for ExoS and ExoT (17Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and unidentified factors for ExoY (16Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13899-13904Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Of these four effectors, ExoU (74 kDa) is the most cytotoxic, but its biochemical function is not known (18Finck-Barbancon V. Goranson J. Zhu L. Sawa T. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Fleiszig S.M. Wu C. Mende-Mueller L. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 19Hauser A.R. Kang P.J. Engel J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).ExoU is found in about one-third of clinical isolates, and these ExoU-expressing strains are associated in 90% of cases with severe disease (6Hauser A.R. Cobb E. Bodi M. Mariscal D. Valles J. Engel J.N. Rello J. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 10Feltman H. Schulert G. Khan S. Jain M. Peterson L. Hauser A.R. Microbiology (Reading). 2001; 147: 2659-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). ExoU has been shown to cause fatality in a mouse model of lung infection (18Finck-Barbancon V. Goranson J. Zhu L. Sawa T. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Fleiszig S.M. Wu C. Mende-Mueller L. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and expression of ExoU in P. aeruginosa strains lacking it increases virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia (20Allewelt M. Coleman F.T. Grout M. Priebe G.P. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The exact role of ExoU in virulence is uncertain, but it is implicated along with ExoT in the onset of septic shock (21Kurahashi K. Kajikawa O. Sawa T. Ohara M. Gropper M.A. Frank D.W. Martin T.R. Wiener-Kronish J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Septic shock, alveolar epithelial injury, and bacteremia are caused in a rabbit model of pneumonia by the wild-type P. aeruginosa clinical isolate PA103, which expresses ExoU and ExoT (but not ExoS and ExoY) (14Garrity-Ryan L. Kazmierczak B. Kowal R. Comolli J. Hauser A. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7100-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). By comparison, deletion of ExoU and ExoT in PA103 abrogates these effects. Sepsis appears to arise from epithelial cell damage and subsequent leakage of proinflammatory cytokines into the bloodstream, giving rise to a systemic inflammatory response. The combined actions of ExoU as a cytotoxin and ExoT in its ability to inhibit bacterial internalization and wound repair are also seen to be important in a mouse model of acute pneumonia (14Garrity-Ryan L. Kazmierczak B. Kowal R. Comolli J. Hauser A. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7100-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Geiser T.K. Kazmierczak B.I. Garrity-Ryan L.K. Matthay M.A. Engel J.N. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).We sought to determine whether inhibitors that block the cytotoxic action of ExoU could be identified. We report that cytotoxicity caused by purified ExoU internalized into mammalian cells or by P. aeruginosa PA103 is effectively blocked by inhibitors of cytosolic and Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 and iPLA2) enzymes. Importantly, this suggests that inhibitors of phospholipase A2 enzymes may serve as potential modes of treatment for acute pneumonias caused by ExoU-expressing cytotoxic strains of P. aeruginosa. In addition, we provide mutagenesis evidence consistent with ExoU functioning as a phospholipase and biochemical evidence indicating ExoU to be the direct target of inhibition. Although we find that ExoU lacks detectable phospholipase or esterase activity in vitro, experiments in vivo demonstrate significant phospholipase activity, indicating that one or more host cell factors are required for activation of ExoU as a membrane-lytic phospholipase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and PurificationExoU, cloned from P. aeruginosa PA103 chromosomal DNA by PCR, was expressed in pET28b (Novagen) with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal histidine tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAS). DNA sequencing verified the integrity of this and other constructs. ExoU expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (25 °C) in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and bacteria were lysed by sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase. ExoU, present in the supernatant from the centrifuged lysate, was purified by metal chelation chromatography (Poros MC/M), and the histidine purification tag was removed by thrombin digestion. ExoU was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) and concentrated to ∼21 mg/ml (in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and stored at –80 °C.ExoU variants S142A, D344A, ExoU-(45–687), ExoU-(45–657), and ExoU-(45–667) were generated by PCR using standard means. ExoU-GFP, ExoU(S142A)-GFP, and ExoU-(45–667)-GFP fusion proteins contain a 6-residue linker sequence (GSGTSG) separating N-terminally located histidine-tagged ExoU and C-terminally located green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFPUV, Clontech). Unfused GFP contains an N-terminal histidine tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASLEAGSGTSG). These proteins were expressed in pET28b and purified as above, except that no thrombin cleavage was carried out. The cytotoxic activity of ExoU is not altered by the histidine tag.Syringe LoadingApproximately 106 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in 900 μl of culture medium (Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum), 100 μl of 20% Pluronic F-68, and 50 μl of 1.0 mg/ml ExoU (in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) were drawn up and expelled slowly (∼0.2 ml/s) through a 30-gauge syringe needle six times (23Clarke M. McNeil P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 533-541PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged (700 × g, 5 min), and the syringe-loading supernatant was quantified for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (Cytotox Kit, Promega). Culture medium (1 ml) was added to the cells, which were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were again centrifuged, and the incubation supernatant was also quantified for LDH. Reported LDH activity (100 × A 490) is a sum of syringe loading and incubation supernatants and is corrected for background LDH activity from buffer alone. ExoU has no LDH activity. Cells were then plated and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Percentage of cell death was determined by counting trypan blue-excluding cells prior to syringe loading and after the 16-h incubation following syringe loading. Papain-digested ExoU (digested at 50:1 ExoU:papain, 25 °C, 20 h) contains no polypeptides >14 kDa, as visualized by SDS-PAGE. In all cases, inhibitors syringe-loaded in the absence of ExoU showed no cytotoxicity.Quantification and Visualization of Syringe-loaded ExoUApproximately 106 CHO cells were syringe-loaded with 50 μl containing 5, 50, or 250 μg of ExoU(S142A)-GFP and were lysed by a 1-h incubation in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.9% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). Fluorescence (excitation, 395 nm; emission, 509 nm) was quantified from the clarified lysate (centrifuged 15,800 × g, 5 min) using a JY Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter, corrected for background fluorescence, and evaluated using a linear standard constructed using ExoU(S142A)-GFP. The detection limit is ∼5 ng of ExoU(S142A)-GFP. Incubation of ExoU(S142A)-GFP with cells in the absence of syringe loading results in no detectable fluorescence, and the presence of the cell lysate does not alter GFP fluorescence. For visualization by fluorescence microscopy, ∼106 cells were syringe-loaded with 15 μm ExoU(S142A)-GFP or 15 μm GFP, plated on coverslips, and incubated for 16 h and then fixed for visualization with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min.Infection AssaysCHO cells were infected as described previously (24Hauser A.R. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5530-5537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with PA103 or PA103ΔU at a multiplicity of infection of ∼35:1, and an LDH assay was carried out 3 h after infection. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) was used at 67.5 μm, and cells were supplemented with 67.5 μm MAFP every hour.MAFP PretreatmentExoU (13.5 μm) was incubated with 1.35 mm MAFP (MAFP-pretreated ExoU) or without MAFP (mock-pretreated ExoU) for ∼16 h at 4 °C and dialyzed extensively over 2 days (in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, using a 6-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane). Samples were syringe-loaded without further MAFP treatment. A sample of MAFP (1.35 mm) was incubated and dialyzed in the absence of ExoU and then used in a syringe-loading experiment with ExoU (ExoU + dialyzed MAFP). A sample of MAFP (1.35 mm) was incubated for 2 days without dialysis and used at 67.5 μm in a syringe-loading experiment with ExoU (ExoU + mock dialyzed MAFP). MAFP-pretreated ExoU was also syringe-loaded with a fresh aliquot of MAFP (67.5 μm) (MAFP-pretreated ExoU + MAFP).In Vitro Activity AssaysPAPC:TX-100 —ExoU (10 μg) or cPLA2 α (1 μg) in 50 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 200 μm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mm DTT) was added to 250 μl of buffer and 200 μl of mixed micelles, which were composed of 1 mm [14C]PAPC (200,000 cpm at sn-2) and 3 mm Triton X-100 (TX-100). Samples were vortexed and incubated at 40 °C for 60 min. Products of this and following radio-assays were quenched and analyzed using a modified Dole protocol (25Kokotos G. Kotsovolou S. Six D.A. Constantinou-Kokotou V. Beltzner C.C. Dennis E.A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2891-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mixed micelles were made in the following way: 190 μl of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, were added to phospholipids and vortexed followed by addition of 10 μl of 150 mm TX-100 and vortexing.PIP2:PAPC:TX-100 —ExoU (10 μg) or cPLA2 α (5 ng) in 50 μl of assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 2 mm DTT) was added to a solution containing 400 μl of assay buffer and 50 μl of a 10× concentrated stock of mixed micelles, whose final concentration contained 97 μm [14C]PAPC (100,000 cpm at sn-2), 3 μm PIP2, and 400 μm TX-100. The reaction was carried out as above, except that the incubation time was 30 min. The micelles were prepared as above, except that phospholipids were resuspended in assay buffer (48.7 μl) as a 10× concentrated stock, and TX-100 (1.3 μl of 150 mm) was then added.PPPC:TX-100 —ExoU (10 μg) or cPLA2 α (1 μg) in 50 μl of assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm DTT) was added to a solution containing 400 μl of assay buffer (containing 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA) and 50 μl of a 10× concentrated stock of mixed micelles, whose final concentration contained 100 μm [14C]PPPC (100,000 cpm at sn-2) and 400 μm TX-100. The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 40 °C. Mixed micelles were made as for PIP2:PAPC:TX-100.LysoPC—ExoU (10 μg) or cPLA2 α (1 μg) in 50 μl of assay buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm DTT) was added to a solution of 400 μl of assay buffer (containing 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA) and 50 μl of a 10× concentrated stock of pure micelles, whose final concentration contains 1 mm [14C]LysoPC (200,000 cpm on palmitic acid at sn-1 or sn-2). The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 40 °C. The LysoPC micelles were formed by thorough vortexing after addition of buffer (100 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7) to LysoPC to make a 10× concentrated solution.Thin Layer Chromatography Assay—Approximately 2.1 g of of liver polar lipid extract (Avanti) per sample was dried down and resuspended in 4.4 ml of reaction buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) by alternating between vortexing and warming in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. Lipids were sonicated on ice until no residual lipids could be seen on the glass and the solution became clear. The lipid sample (400 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of enzyme and incubated ∼18 h at 37 °C with shaking. The following enzyme amounts were used: 0.25 μg of secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) (Naja naja venom, Sigma), 172 μg of PLC (Clostridium perfringens, Sigma), 2 μg of PLD (Streptomyces chromofuscus, Sigma), 890 μg of ExoU. Replicate samples were supplemented with 3 mm CaCl2. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh-Dyer procedure. Briefly, 1.5 ml of 1:2 CHCl3:MeOH was added to samples followed by 0.5 ml of CHCl3 and by 0.5 ml of 60 mm HCl; samples were vortexed vigorously at each addition. The lower organic layer was transferred into glass tubing and dried down to one-fifth of the original volume under an N2 stream.Approximately 25 μl of each sample was spotted onto a TLC plate (20 × 20 cm), as were standards (oleic acid, LysoPC, POPC, and dioleoylglycerol). The chromatographic separation was run for 2.5 h in 65:25:4 CHCl3:MeOH:H2O. Development of the spots was achieved by incubation in an iodine chamber for 10 min, and Sigma spray reagent molybdenum blue was used for detection of phosphorus-containing compounds.Phenyl Valerate Esterase Assay—ExoU (1.65 mg) or cPLA2 α (45 μg) in 1 ml of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) was added to 1 ml of phenyl valerate (0.5 mg/ml) (Oryza Laboratories, Chelmsford, MA) in 0.03% TX-100. Phenyl valerate was initially solubilized at 15 mg/ml in dimethylformamide and diluted into 0.03% TX-100. Reactions were incubated for 20 min or 3 h at 37 °C and stopped through addition of 1 ml of 3.4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in assay buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml 4-aminoantipyrine (Sigma). The reactions were mixed with 500 μl of 0.4% K3Fe(CN)6 (Sigma) and incubated for 10 min, and absorbance at 510 nm was measured.In Vivo Phospholipase Activity AssaysTritiated arachidonic acid or palmitic acid (60–100 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added (∼0.5 μCi/106 cells) directly to CHO cells (in Ham's F-12 medium), and cells were incubated for 24 h. Medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Approximately 106 cells were syringe-loaded as described above, except that cells were incubated in the syringe-loading solution for 20 min and then centrifuged at 720 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was used for LDH quantification and extracted using the modified Dole protocol (25Kokotos G. Kotsovolou S. Six D.A. Constantinou-Kokotou V. Beltzner C.C. Dennis E.A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2891-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the sample extracted by the Dole protocol was quantified by scintillation counting. Dole extraction was seen to be successful in separating free fatty acids from phospholipids. This was done by addition of exogenous [3H]arachidonic acid or [14C]PAPC to medium from buffer-loaded or hypotonically lysed cells, and it was found that >89% of [3H]arachidonic acid is extracted as compared with only <2% of [14C]PAPC.RESULTSExoU Cytotoxicity—To investigate the mechanism of ExoU-induced cytotoxicity, we purified recombinantly produced ExoU and introduced it into the cytoplasm of CHO cells by syringe loading (23Clarke M. McNeil P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 533-541PubMed Google Scholar). A swift and marked cytotoxicity, as measured by exclusion of trypan blue or release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase, is observed (Fig. 1A). ExoU-mediated cytotoxicity is reported to occur through necrosis rather than apoptosis (24Hauser A.R. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5530-5537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with our observations. Cytotoxicity occurs almost immediately after syringe loading (∼10 min), and after 16 h, less than 5% of cells are viable. ExoU exhibits no cytotoxicity when added to the surface of cells, even at concentrations 10-fold higher than those used for syringe loading (data not shown), confirming that intracellular localization is required (18Finck-Barbancon V. Goranson J. Zhu L. Sawa T. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Fleiszig S.M. Wu C. Mende-Mueller L. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic effect is specific to ExoU, as demonstrated by papain-digested ExoU, bovine serum albumin, or buffer alone lacking cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A). Similar results are observed in the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 (data not shown).Specificity of ExoU action is also confirmed by its dose-dependence (Fig. 1B). Half-maximal killing is observed with ∼3 million ExoU molecules added per cell during syringe loading. However, the number of molecules internalized by CHO cells is much lower, estimated at ∼0.01–0.02%. Therefore, half-maximal cytotoxicity appears to require only ∼300–600 ExoU molecules internalized per cell, setting a value on the magnitude of export required of the TTSS in vivo to achieve cell killing. To determine the efficiency of internalization, a construct containing a non-cytotoxic variant of ExoU (S142A, see below) fused to GFP was produced, purified, and syringe-loaded into CHO cells. Fluorescence from internalized ExoU(S142A)-GFP was then quantified (data not shown). ExoU-GFP and ExoU are internalized in quantitatively similar ways, as shown by ExoU-GFP (containing wild-type ExoU) having the same half-maximal killing dose as ExoU (data not shown).Internalized ExoU(S142A-GFP) was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, revealing localization to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). This contrasts with the diffuse localization pattern seen for syringe-loaded GFP. Furthermore, the localization of ExoU(S142A-GFP) occurs in punctate fashion (Fig. 1C, Focal Plane 2), as observed by varying the focal plane, and is indicative of possible ExoU interaction with host cell components.Inhibition of ExoU-mediated Cytotoxicity—Strikingly, ExoU-induced cytotoxicity is entirely eliminated or greatly reduced by specific inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes (26Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). MAFP, an irreversible inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2, also called Group IVA PLA2) and Ca2+-independent PLA2s (iPLA2, also called Group VIA PLA2) (28Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Notably, sPLA2s differ mechanistically from cPLA2s and iPLA2s in that the former enzyme family uses a catalytic histidine, whereas the latter two families similarly use a catalytic serine.

Interestingly, although ATK blocks cell killing (96% protection) even more efficiently than MAFP, PTK is only partially protective (60% protection), implying a preference for arachidonate over palmitate in the target of these inhibitors.Fig. 2Effects of PLA2 inhibitors (a and b) or non-PLA2 inhibitors (c) in syringe-loading experiments or infection assays.

https://openalex.org/W2150821575,"Increasing evidence suggests that iron-mediated oxidative stress might underlie the development of neurodegeneration in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive ataxia caused by decreased expression of frataxin, a protein implicated in iron metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that, in fibroblasts of patients with FRDA, the cellular redox equilibrium is shifted toward more protein-bound glutathione. Furthermore, we found that actin is glutathionylated, probably as a result of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, generated by iron overload in the disease. Indeed, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of control fibroblasts in vivo treated with FeSO4 showed a significant increase in the protein-bound/free GSH ratio, and Western blot analysis indicated a relevant rise in glutathionylation. Actin glutathionylation contributes to impaired microfilament organization in FRDA fibroblasts. Rhodamine phalloidin staining revealed a disarray of actin filaments and a reduced signal of F-actin fluorescence. The same hematoxylin/eosin-stained cells showed abnormalities in size and shape. When we treated FRDA fibroblasts with reduced glutathione, we obtained a complete rescue of cytoskeletal abnormalities and cell viability. Thus, we conclude that oxidative stress may induce actin glutathionylation and impairment of cytoskeletal functions in FRDA fibroblasts.

FRDA is characterized by degeneration of the large sensory neurons and spinocerebellar tracts, cardiomyopathy, and increased incidence of diabetes. Most patients (95%) are homozygous for the hyperexpansion of a GAA repeat sequence in the first intron of the frataxin gene; a few are heterozygous for a GAA expansion and a point mutation (1Puccio H.

Data from yeast suggest that frataxin deficiency results in iron accumulation within mitochondria and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (4Knight S.A.B. Kim R. Pain D. Dancis A. Am. J. Hum.

Furthermore, a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain has been found in FRDA tissues, in association with iron accumulation and moderate decreases in mtDNA levels (9Bradley J.L. Blake J.C.

Iron is a crucial reagent in the Fenton reaction, as it can react with mitochondrially generated superoxide anion ( O2˙- ) to produce the toxic hydroxyl radical (OH.) , and iron-mediated oxidative stress has been hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of the disease. Increased levels of oxidative stress markers such as plasma malondialdehyde and urine 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine have been found in patients with FRDA, and improvement of cardiac and skeletal muscle bioenergetics has been observed after antioxidant treatment (11Edmond M.

Moreover, we found an impairment in vivo of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and decreased levels of free glutathione in the blood of patients with FRDA (16Tozzi G.

In cells, exposure to acute oxidative stress triggers a sequence of events characterized by depletion of antioxidant defenses and oxidative modification of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Protein thiols are particularly susceptible to oxidation and may represent important targets in redox signaling. Recently, protein glutathionylation has gained attention as a possible means of protein function redox regulation. One proposed mechanism leading to protein S-glutathionylation in vivo is the thiol/disulfide exchange mechanism (18Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), which occurs when an oxidative insult changes the GSH/GSSG ratio and induces GSSG to bind to protein thiols.

Also transcription factors such as c-Jun appear to be redox-regulated by mechanisms that include protein S-thiolation (27Klatt P. Molina E.S. Lacoba M.C. Padilla C.A. Mrtinez-Glaisteo E. Barcena J.A.

A reversible glutathionylation was found to regulate actin polymerization in human epidermal carcinoma cells (30Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Cock B. J. Biol.

Jones A.D. Cross C.E. Wong P.S.Y. Van der Vliet A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently found an increase in glutathionyl-hemoglobin in the blood of patients with FRDA, accompanied by a significant decrease in free glutathione (17Piemonte F. Pastore A. Tozzi G. Tagliacozzi D. Santorelli F.M. Carrozzo R. Casali C. Damiano M. Federici G. Bertini E. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 31: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Free glutathione concentration, mainly represented by its reduced form, is a limiting factor in many detoxifying processes by protecting protein thiol groups from oxidation, directly as a free radical scavenger or as a cosubstrate for a number of important enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferases (32Hayes J.D. McLellan L.I. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 273-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Under conditions of increased oxidant stress such as ischemia/reperfusion, chronic ethanol ingestion, tumor necrosis factor-induced cytotoxicity, and bile acid retention in cholestasis, glutathione status is a critical factor in determining loss of mitochondrial function and cell viability as well as transcription factor activation and gene regulation (33Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relation existing among glutathione, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration was recently reviewed by Schulz et al. (34Schulz J.B. Lindenau J. Seyfried J. Dichgans J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4904-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), and an important role for glutathione has been proposed for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, where a decrease in GSH concentrations in the substantia nigra was observed in preclinical stages of the disease (35Sofic E. Lange K.W. Jellinger K. Riederer P. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 142: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Although the pathogenesis of FRDA is still unclear, one possibility is that the presence of unbound (free) reactive iron, via the Fenton reaction, generates free radicals within the mitochondria, leading to oxidative damage. Thus, in light of accumulating evidence indicating a crucial role for glutathione in the regulation of cellular signaling in response to oxidative and nitrosative stress (36Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 37Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3505-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), we analyzed the redox status of glutathione in fibroblasts of patients with FRDA and identified a protein that undergoes glutathionylation in these patients. For this purpose, we cultured skin biopsies obtained from nine patients with FRDA and determined total, free, reduced, oxidized, and protein-bound glutathione concentrations by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. In addition, we analyzed the glutathionylated protein pattern by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-GSH antibody. Materials—Monoclonal anti-GSH antibody was obtained from Virogen. Polyclonal anti-actin antibody and 6-carboxyfluorescein (apoptosis detection kit) were from Sigma. Rhodamine phalloidin was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Protein G PLUS-agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The BCA protein assay was obtained from Pierce. All materials for cell cultures were from Invitrogen; all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Skin biopsies were taken from nine clinically affected (and genetically proven) FRDA patients (four males and five females) and four age-matched controls. Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4% (v/v) amphotericin B (250 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Fibroblasts were grown to 90% confluence. The assays were performed in triplicate, and each fibroblast strain was separately grown and processed twice. Cells were used at similar passage numbers. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O, sonicated three times for 2 s (Sonics Vibra Cell, Sonics & Material Inc., Newtown, CT), and subjected to biochemical analysis. HPLC Determination of Various Forms of Glutathione—The cells (treated differently) were sonicated three times for 2 s in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After sonication, 50 μl of 12% sulfosalicylic acid were added, and the GSH content in the acid-soluble fraction was determined (free GSH). The protein pellet was dissolved in 150 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and protein-bound GSH was determined. To measure oxidized glutathione (GSSG), cells were sonicated three times for 2 s in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Total GSH was determined in fibroblast lysates before adding 12% sulfosalicylic acid. GSH levels were calculated by subtracting GSSG concentrations from free GSH values. Protein concentrations were quantified by the BCA protein assay. Derivatization and chromatography procedures were carried out as previously reported (38Pastore A. Piemonte F. Locatelli M. Lo Russo A. Gaeta L.M. Tozzi G. Federici G. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Analysis of Glutathione Conjugates by Western Blotting—40 μg of lysate sample were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 70 mA. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature and probed with monoclonal anti-GSH antibody (1:500) and/or polyclonal anti-actin antibody (1:1000). Identification of Glutathionylated Actin by Immunoprecipitation—Fibroblasts (resuspended in 150 μl of H2O and sonicated) were incubated with 50 μl of anti-actin antibody (1 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the resuspended volume of protein G PLUS-agarose were added to the solution and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocker platform. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. After a final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, loaded onto a nonreducing 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis, and revealed with anti-GSH antibody (1:500). Quantification of Glutathionylated Actin—The extent of glutathionylation was quantified by analyzing nitrocellulose filters with a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer. Data were analyzed using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst™ software (Version 1.3) and normalized to the quantity of protein loaded on the gels and to total glutathione content in fibroblasts. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis of Rhodamine Phalloidin-stained Fibroblasts—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin. Fluorescent images were monitored using a Zeiss microscope (Axoskobe 50) equipped with epifluorescence and a ×40 objective. Cell Morphology—Cells grown on Falcon chamber slides (BD Biosciences) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 10 min, and stained with Harris hematoxylin for 7 min. After treatment with 0.1% (v/v) HCl, cells were washed with H2O for 10 min, stained with eosin for 20 s, dried with ethanol (70, 95, and 100%, v/v), and washed with xylol. Images were monitored using the Axoskobe 50 microscope equipped with a ×40 objective. Effect in Vivo of GSH, Ethyl Ester-reduced Glutathione (EE-GSH), and Acivicin on Actin Glutathionylation and Cell Morphology and Viability—Fibroblasts of three patients with FRDA were incubated for 30 days at 37 °C with 10 mm (final concentration) GSH and 10 mm (final concentration) EE-GSH in both the absence and presence of 150 μm (final concentration) acivicin, a γ-glutamyltranspeptidase inhibitor. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described above to determine the extent of actin glutathionylation. GSH-treated FRDA cells were subjected to fluorescence and light microscopy by staining with rhodamine phalloidin and hematoxylin/eosin, respectively (see above). Cell viability was measured using 6-carboxyfluorescein, a non-fluorescent compound that becomes fluorescent in live cells by the action of esterases. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the results were analyzed using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Effect in Vivo of FeSO 4 Treatment on Actin Glutathionylation—The effect of FeSO4 treatment was studied by incubating control fibroblasts in vivo with 100 μm (final concentration) FeSO4 or H2O at 37 °C for 6, 24, 48, 96, and 192 h. Protein-bound/free GSH levels were determined by HPLC analysis as described above. Western blot analysis was performed on cells treated with 100 μm FeSO4 at 37 °C for 24 and 192 h. Effect in Vivo of FeSO 4 Treatment on Cell Morphology—Control fibroblasts were treated in vivo with 100 μm (final concentration) FeSO4 for 1 month and subjected to fluorescence microscopy by staining with rhodamine phalloidin (see above). We analyzed the glutathione content in fibroblasts of nine FRDA patients and determined the GSH/GSSG ratios (Fig. 1A) and protein-bound/total GSH and protein-bound/free GSH ratios (Fig. 1B). The GSH/GSSG ratio was 129 ± 18.8 in controls and decreased to 45 ± 8.6 in FRDA fibroblasts (p < 0.05). The protein-bound/total GSH ratio was 0.05 ± 0.01 in control cells and increased to 0.12 ± 0.03 in FRDA cells (p < 0.05). The protein-bound/free GSH ratio was 0.056 ± 0.013 in control fibroblasts and increased to 0.25 ± 0.12 in FRDA patients (p < 0.05). These results indicate that FRDA fibroblasts undergo oxidative stress, with the cellular redox equilibrium shifted toward more protein-bound glutathione with respect to fibroblasts of healthy subjects. Monoclonal anti-GSH antibody was used to investigate the glutathionylation state of FRDA fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of fibroblasts obtained from three patients revealed a 42-kDa band (Fig. 2A), which was also detected by anti-actin antibody (Fig. 2B). To identify the 42-kDa protein, we immunoprecipitated the fibroblast lysates with anti-actin antibody and probed them with anti-GSH antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, we obtained a 42-kDa band corresponding to glutathionylated actin. The extent of glutathionylation was increased by 4.7-fold in FRDA patients with respect to controls (7.47 ± 3.5 versus 1.6 ± 0.51; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). Equal amounts of loaded protein were verified by Coomassie Blue staining of an equivalent SDS gel (data not shown). To investigate whether the unexpected increase in actin glutathionylation in FRDA fibroblasts is related to changes in the cytoskeletal organization, we stained fibroblasts with the filamentous actin indicator rhodamine phalloidin. The fluorescent images revealed a significant disarrangement of F-actin in FRDA patients (Fig. 3B), with clear attenuation of the fluorescent signal compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Under light microscopy, FRDA fibroblasts (Fig. 3E) appeared to be enlarged with respect to fibroblasts of healthy subjects (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these observations suggest that glutathionylation of actin leads to a disarray of actin filaments, inducing size and shape abnormalities in FRDA fibroblasts. To determine whether there is an in vivo reversibility of glutathionylation in FRDA fibroblasts, we treated FRDA cells with 10 mm (final concentration) GSH and 10 mm (final concentration) EE-GSH for 30 days at 37 °C. Fig. 4A illustrates the results from HPLC analysis, showing a 17 ± 3.7% decrease in the protein-bound/free GSH ratio in EE-GSH-treated FRDA fibroblasts and a 56 ± 6.8% reduction in GSH-treated FRDA fibroblasts compared with untreated cells. HPLC analysis of GSH and GSSG levels (Fig. 4B) revealed increases in GSH/GSSG ratios to 113 ± 53.5 upon GSH treatment and to 115 ± 57 upon EE-GSH treatment with respect to untreated FRDA cells (45 ± 8.6; p < 0.05), thus becoming comparable to those in controls (129 ± 18.8). Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed a 20 ± 5.5% decrease in glutathionylated proteins in EE-GSH-treated cells (Fig. 4C, lane 3) and a 60 ± 15% decrease in GSH-treated cells (lane 4) compared with untreated FRDA fibroblasts (lane 2). To elucidate how medium GSH is available to the cells, we performed in vivo experiments by treating FRDA fibroblasts with acivicin (150 μm), an inhibitor of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. Our findings show that acivicin blocked the protection obtained by GSH treatment, whereas EE-GSH, which is membrane-permeable, was not affected by the inhibitor (data not shown). The fluorescent images of FRDA fibroblasts after 1 month of in vivo GSH treatment showed an increase in the rhodamine phalloidin signal of F-actin (Fig. 3C) and a rescue of cell size and shape (Fig. 3F). Flow cytometric analysis using the cell viability indicator 6-carboxyfluorescein showed a 15.5 ± 5.6% (p < 0.05) increase in the fluorescent signal in GSH-treated FRDA cells (Fig. 5C) with respect to untreated cells (Fig. 5B), comparable to that in controls (Fig. 5A). Finally, to determine whether there is an in vivo association between iron overload, which underlies the pathogenesis of FRDA, and actin glutathionylation, we treated control fibroblasts with 100 μm FeSO4 for 6, 24, 48, 96, and 192 h. HPLC analysis showed 1.12-, 1.34-, 1.44-, 1.85-, and 2.3-fold increases in the protein-bound/free GSH ratio, respectively, compared with H2O treatments (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis of fibroblasts incubated with 100 μm FeSO4 for 24 and 192 h at 37 °C showed 1.7-fold (Fig. 6B, lane 2) and 2-fold (lane 3) increases in glutathionylated actin, respectively, compared with H2O-treated cells (lane 1). Moreover, to determine whether FeSO4 induces morphological changes characteristic of FRDA, we treated in vivo control cells with FeSO4 for 1 month without obtaining any significant morphological changes resembling those in FRDA fibroblasts (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Fluorescent images of control fibroblasts after in vivo FeSO4 treatment. Control cells (A) were treated in vivo with 100 μm FeSO4 for 30 days at 37 °C (B), and actin was visualized by rhodamine phalloidin staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The prevailing hypothesis underlying the pathogenesis of FRDA supposes that frataxin is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron export and that impaired intramitochondrial iron metabolism results in iron overload and oxidative stress (1Puccio H.

Iron deposits are observed consistently in some heart myofibrils of FRDA patients upon autopsy, and recent magnetic resonance imaging data indicate that iron also accumulates in the dentate nucleus (9Bradley J.L.

In previous studies, we reported a significant increase in glutathionyl-hemoglobin in the blood of patients with FRDA, together with an imbalance between the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase antioxidant enzyme activities, thus supporting the presence of a systemic oxidative stress in the disease (16Tozzi G. Nuccetelli M. Lo Bello M. Bernardini S. Bellincampi L. Ballerini S. Gaeta L.M. Casali C. Pastore A. Federici G. Bertini E. Piemonte F. Arch. Dis.

Therefore, in light of these recent advances in the pathogenesis of FRDA, our study has focused on the analysis of glutathione metabolism in fibroblasts of FRDA patients. Furthermore, as the oxidized and reduced glutathione redox ratios affect the state of glutathionylated proteins, we also studied the glutathionylated protein pattern in FRDA fibroblasts. Our findings show, for the first time, that fibroblasts of patients with FRDA undergo oxidative stress, with a significant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio. In addition, the cellular redox equilibrium is shifted toward more protein-bound glutathione, with significant increases in protein-bound/total GSH and protein-bound/free GSH ratios. Furthermore, we used monoclonal anti-GSH antibody to investigate protein glutathionylation in fibroblasts, and we found that proteins are glutathionylated in FRDA, with a 5-fold increase in FRDA patients. Protein glutathionylation occurs also in normal fibroblasts, but to a lower extent. The fact that some proteins are constitutively glutathionylated under basal conditions has already been observed by Fratelli et al. (37Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In normal liver, for instance, 20-30 nmol of glutathione/g of liver are present as disulfides mixed with proteins (41Brigelius R. Muckel C. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2529-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Many proteins can undergo glutathionylation under oxidative stress (36Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2043821463,"N-Myristoylation is an irreversible modification that affects the membrane binding properties of crucial cytoplasmic proteins from signal transduction cascades. We characterized the two putative N-myristoyltransferases of Arabidopsis thaliana as a means of investigating the entire N-myristoylation proteome (N-myristoylome) in a higher eukaryote. AtNMT1 compensated for the nmt1 defect in yeast, whereas AtNMT2 and chimeras of the two genes did not. Only AtNMT1 modified known N-myristoylated proteins in vitro. AtNMT1 is therefore responsible for the A. thaliana N-myristoylome, whereas AtNMT2 does not seem to have usual myristoylation activity. We began with the whole set of N-myristoylated G proteins in the A. thaliana proteome. We then used a reiterative approach, based on the in vitro N-myristoylation of more than 60 different polypeptides, to determine the substrate specificity of AtNMT1. We found that the positive charge on residue 7 of the substrate was particularly important in substrate recognition. The A. thaliana N-myristoylome consists of 437 proteins, accounting for 1.7% of the complete proteome. We demonstrated the N-myristoylation of several unexpected protein families, including innate immunity proteins, thioredoxins, components of the protein degradation pathway, transcription factors, and a crucial regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. The role of N-myristoylation is discussed in each case; in particular, this process may underlie the “guard” hypothesis of innate immunity.

In A. thaliana, 56% of the proteins of the cytoplasmic proteome are predicted to undergo NME. The molecular basis of NME was recently elucidated in A. thaliana. This pathway involves (i) organellar peptide deformylases (2Giglione C. Meinnel T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 566-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Serero A.

We need to compare NME substrate characterization data with functional genomics data if we are to understand this process in all the compartments in which it occurs. For example, NME was recently shown to be essential in the plastid, where it stabilizes a small subset of key proteins (8Giglione C. Vallon O. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, NME leads to a small number of posttranslational N-acylations (9Utsumi T. Sato M. Nakano K. Takemura D. Iwata H.

For example, protein N-terminal myristoylation (MYR) results in the irreversible addition of a saturated C:14 fatty acid to the N-terminal glycines of some proteins. Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of myristate to a number of eukaryotic and viral proteins (for a review on MYR, see Ref. 11Bhatnagar R.S. Ashrafi K. Futterer K. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Vol. XXI. Academic Press, San, Diego2001: 241-289Google Scholar). NMT is essential for viability in protozoans and fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Duronio R.J. Towler D.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7206-7214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that MYR involves important protein components of signal transduction cascades and apoptotic proteins (15de Jonge, H. R., Hogema, B., and Tilly, B. C. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/63/pe1.Google Scholar). The requirement for the unmasking, by NME, of glycine as the N-terminal residue for the initiation of MYR may account for NME being essential in the cytoplasm of lower and higher eukaryotes. Our studies aim to identify the molecular basis of the requirement for NME in higher eukaryotes. To achieve this goal, we need to characterize all the myristoylated proteins (MYR proteome or N-myristoylome), to identify the most sensitive, primary targets. Recent efforts at N-myristoylome prediction resulted in fine definition of the substrate sequence motif, by reanalysis of comprehensive kinetic and structural data (16Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This led to the development of a computer program, Predictor, which predicts N-myristoylation by means of two types of analysis, for fungi or higher eukaryotes (17Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, regardless of the organism studied, approximately half of all bioinformatic predictions of potential substrates fall into the so-called “twilight zone.” This precludes MYR prediction for these candidates. Therefore, kinetic measurements on N-terminal peptides or full-length proteins are required to obtain definitive data on a given NMT in higher eukaryotes. We recently developed a rapid and reliable MYR diagnostic to achieve this (7Boisson B. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A straightforward approach to studies of the N-myristoylome is possible as only approximately 0.5% of cytoplasmic proteins are thought to undergo MYR (i.e. approximately 30–200 proteins in a eukaryotic proteome 17). In this study, we aimed to determine the pattern of N-myristoylated proteins in a higher eukaryote proteome (that of A. thaliana) using experimental data obtained directly from the complete proteome. This method was first applied to one class of important signal proteins, GTP-binding proteins (G proteins; GP), and was then extended to several other natural protein substrates for which it was possible to make reliable N-myristoylome predictions. We identified a number of unexpected myristoylated proteins. This study was the first direct analysis of the N-myristoylome of a higher eukaryote. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Stock Myr-CoA solutions (200 μm) were dissolved in 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at MWG Biotech SA (Courtaboeuf, France), and peptides were synthesized at Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). In each case, 2–5 mg of peptide was synthesized, and peptides (85% pure) were dissolved in H2O to give 4 mm solutions. We defined the initiator methionine in polypeptide sequences as Met-1, although this residue is removed by NME. Thus, in peptide sequences, the N-terminal residue, usually a Gly, was numbered as amino acid 2. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the Big-Dye Terminator V3 method, with a 16-capillary ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). We obtained pBB131, which encodes Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMT (ScNMT1), from Jeffrey I. Gordon (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). ScNMT1 was excised from this plasmid and inserted into pET16b as previously described (7Boisson B. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for both the NMT of A. thaliana (AtNMT1 and AtNMT2) were cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from a cDNA library prepared from 2-week-old A. thaliana seedlings as previously described (4Giglione C. Serero A. Pierre M. Boisson B. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of AtNMT1 and AtNMT2 are available from GenBank™, under the accession numbers AF250956 and AF250957, respectively. NMT open reading frames (ORFs) were recloned in pQE31 (Qiagen), to generate N-terminal fusions with a His6 tag, and were then inserted into pET16b. NMT fusions were also inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the yeast URA3 galactose-inducible plasmid pYES (Invitrogen). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains YB332 (MATα ura3 his3Δ200 ade2 lys2–801 leu2) and its thermosensitive derivative YB336 (MATα nmt1–181 ura3 his3Δ200 ade2 lys2–801 leu2) (18Johnson D.R. Duronio R.J. Langner C.A. Rudnick D.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 483-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by J. I. Gordon. YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) supplemented with 2% dextrose was used as the standard yeast liquid medium. Yeasts were transformed as described elsewhere (19Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) and cultured at 24 °C. Transformed cells were selected on SD medium (1.8% agar, 1.43 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, Clontech yeast dropout amino acid supplement without uracil, 2% dextrose). We checked for effective complementation by culturing cells for 4 days on SD plates supplemented with 2% raffinose and then restreaking them on SD and YP plates supplemented with 2% galactose and incubating them at 24 and 35 °C. Protein production in Escherichia coli was achieved by transforming BL21-pRares (Rosetta; Novagen) cells with a given plasmid construct. Cells were grown at 22 °C for 6 h in 2× TY medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, to reach an A 600 of 0.9. They were then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside and incubated for another 12 h, with shaking, for AtNMT1 and ScNMT1 (7Boisson B. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For AtNMT2, we used the same conditions, except that the growth medium was supplemented with 3% ethanol and the induction time was 5 h. In all cases, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10–20 ml of buffer A, which consisted of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl, plus 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (5–15 ml) was applied to a Hi-Trap chelating HP (0.7 × 2.5 cm; AP-Biotech) nickel affinity column equilibrated in buffer A. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, in two steps, with buffer B (buffer A plus 0.5 m imidazole) followed by a linear 0.35 mm/min imidazole gradient. The pool of purified protein (5 ml) was first dialyzed against buffer A for 12 h and then against buffer A plus 55% glycerol for 24 h before storage at –20 °C. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis (MS Facility, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Jouy, France) of purified AtNMT1 and AtNMT2 indicated that these two proteins were full-length, with molecular masses of 51.3 ± 0.5 and 50.8 ± 0.5 kDa, respectively. These values are entirely consistent with the theoretical values of 50.9 and 50.7 kDa, indicating that the purified enzyme corresponded to the full-length product of the corresponding ORF. Proteins were overproduced in yeast cultured in YP medium containing raffinose (2%) until an A 600 of 0.9 was reached and then induced with 2% galactose. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the equivalent of 5 A 600 was extracted with glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and anti-protease mixture (Roche). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS denaturing gels (10% polyacrylamide gels; 0.75 mm thickness) was performed using the Mini-PROTEAN III system (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto membranes, which were probed with anti-His antibodies (AP Biotech), as previously described (4Giglione C. Serero A. Pierre M. Boisson B. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NMT activity was assayed at 30 °C by continuously monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm of NADH, by coupling the reaction to pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (7Boisson B. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The standard assay was performed in a final volume of 200 μl, in 1-cm optical-path quartz cuvettes. Changes in absorbance over time were followed using an Ultrospec-4000 spectro-photometer (AP Biotech), equipped with a temperature control unit and a 6-position Peltier heated cell changer. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.193 mm EGTA, 0.32 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 2 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5–1000 μm peptide, 2.5 mm NAD+, and 0.125 unit/ml porcine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase (2 units/mg). A radioactive discontinuous assay (20King M.J. Sharma R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was also used to confirm some results (detailed protocol available in Ref. 7Boisson B. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein Data—NMT sequences were identified, translated and annotated in several data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/genom_table_cgi; www.sanger.ac.uk/DataSearch/omniblast.shtml). Pre liminary sequence data were obtained from (i) the Institute for Genomic Research web site (www.tigr.org) or (ii) the Sanger Institute (www.sanger.ac.uk/). Protein sequences were aligned, using ClustalX software (21Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was constructed with N-J Tree (21Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G.

Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) and drawn with TreeView1.65 (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html; Ref. 22Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The original A. thaliana proteome data base (23Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7211) Google Scholar) was progressively purged of redundant and incorrect entries with the improved annotation developed by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (last update February 2003). This was achieved by cross-comparison of the data available at the The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org) and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html). We extracted ORFs with given patterns from the data base, with the Pattern Matching program (www.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl; see Ref. 24Cockwell K.Y. Giles I.G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 227-232PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern syntax used was: “<M” constrains the pattern to the N-terminal residue (i.e. an initiator M), “[^Y]” means that residue Y (or a subset list) is excluded and “[Z]” means that residue Z (or a subset list) is included. X means any normal amino acid. The Predictor scores corresponding to each ORF of the B4 library were calculated at mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/myristate/. To obtain the Arabidopsis Predictor score, the “Higher Eukaryote” option was used. Only the profile score taking into account essentially the physical properties of the peptide was used, and we did not consider the special weight parameters (terms T9–T11) originally used to add penalties deduced from various parameters, including kinetic measurements (17Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Instead, we included a special T12 enthalpic parameter derived from our kinetic measurements and analysis (Tables I, II, III). Corrections to create the Arabidopsis score were as follows. For position 3: N, bonus +5; Q, bonus +2. For positions 3–5: if only A, C, G, S, T, and V, penalty –3. For position 5: F and Y, bonus +2. For position 6: S, bonus +2. For position 7: K and R, bonus +5; H, bonus +3; L, I, and V, bonus +2: A, C, G, P, and S, penalty –2. Finally, a value of 0.8 was added to all scores.Table IAnalysis of the MYR by AtNMT1 of putative substrates and their derivativesSequenceaThe amino acid sequence of each peptide is indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2093916539,"The translational repressor protein eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, also termed PHAS-I) is regulated by phosphorylation through the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. Recent studies have identified two regulatory motifs in 4E-BP1, an mTOR-signaling (TOS) motif in the C terminus of 4E-BP1 and an RAIP motif (named after its sequence) in the N terminus. Other recent work has shown that the protein raptor binds to mTOR and 4E-BP1. We show that raptor binds to full-length 4E-BP1 or a C-terminal fragment containing the TOS motif but not to an N-terminal fragment containing the RAIP motif. Mutation of several residues within the TOS motif abrogates binding to raptor, indicating that the TOS motif is required for this interaction. 4E-BP1 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites in intact cells. The effects of removal or mutation of the RAIP and TOS motifs differ. The RAIP motif is absolutely required for phosphorylation of sites in the N and C termini of 4E-BP1, whereas the TOS motif primarily affects phosphorylation of Ser-64/65, Thr-69/70, and also the rapamycin-insensitive site Ser-101. Phosphorylation of N-terminal sites that are dependent upon the RAIP motif is sensitive to rapamycin. The RAIP motif thus promotes the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of multiple sites in 4E-BP1 independently of the 4E-BP1/raptor interaction.

Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). eIF4E binds the 5′-cap structure of the mRNA, which contains the 7-methyl-GTP (m7GTP) moiety. It also interacts with the scaffold protein eIF4G and thereby recruits 40 S ribosomal subunits to the mRNA (2Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). A large body of evidence shows that eIF4E plays key roles in cell proliferation (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and cell survival/apoptosis (3Clemens M.J. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2001; 5: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of eIF4E can transform cells (4De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 5Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), and many human tumor cells express high levels of this protein (6De Benedetti A. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Nuclear eIF4E seems to be important in the export of certain mRNAs to the cytoplasm such as that for cyclin D1 (7Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), which is important in cell cycle progression. The transforming abilities of eIF4E may be linked to this effect (8Hashemolhosseini S. Nagamine Y. Morley S.J. Desrivieres S. Mercep L. Ferrari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9Lai H.K. Borden K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1623-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The availability of eIF4E for binding to eIF4G is regulated by its interaction with heat-stable proteins termed eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). 4E-BP1 is by far the best understood of these. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 leads to its release from eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to form initiation complexes with eIF4G (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Expression of 4E-BP1 reverses the transforming ability of increased levels of eIF4E (10Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by insulin or other agents is blocked by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (11Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 143-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 undergoes phosphorylation at up to seven sites in intact cells; phosphorylation is complex, hierarchical, and, at some sites, is required for the subsequent modification of others (12Mothe-Satney I.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Regulatory motifs have been identified in the N and C termini of 4E-BP1. The N terminus contains the so-called “RAIP” motif (from the single letter code for its amino acid sequence; Ref. 16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mutation of this motif results in a low basal level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 that is barely affected by insulin. The extreme C terminus contains a TOR-signaling (TOS) motif that is similar to a sequence in the N terminus of the S6 kinases (S6Ks; see below) and which is required for their regulation (17Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of this motif impairs the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr.

Signaling through mTOR also regulates the phosphorylation of other proteins involved in controlling mRNA translation, such as the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1/2; Ref. 19Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Across the Eukaryotae, TOR homologs are also involved in controlling a wide range of cellular functions (20Abraham R.T. Cell. 2002; 111: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 26: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and effectors of mTOR signaling, such as the S6Ks and 4E-BP1, regulate animal cell size (24Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L.

Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is currently a high level of interest in mTOR signaling. Recent studies have identified a novel component of the mTOR pathway, a scaffold protein termed “raptor” for which homologs exist in other eukaryotes (30Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar, 31Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3021-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Raptor binds to mTOR and 4E-BP1 and may act to promote signaling from mTOR to 4E-BP1, although the actual function of the raptor/4E-BP1 interaction is unclear. Here, we confirm that the TOS motif of 4E-BP1 is required for binding to raptor but find no evidence that the RAIP motif interacts with this scaffold protein. Despite this, mutation of the RAIP motif has more drastic effects on the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in living cells than does mutation of the TOS motif. The RAIP motif thus seems to mediate insulin and mTOR-dependent inputs into 4E-BP1 independently of an interaction with raptor. Vectors—Expression vectors for His/Myc-tagged versions of 4E-BP1 have been described earlier (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Vectors for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-N-BP1 (encoding residues 1-24 of rat 4E-BP1 fused to GST) and GST-C-BP1 (last 20 amino acids of rat 4E-BP1 fused to GST) were created by PCR using primers containing restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI and were inserted using these sites into pGEX3X. The F113A and E114A,D116A mutants of these fusion proteins were created by PCR and cloned into pGEX3X. The F113A mutant of rat 4E-BP1 was generated by PCR. The mutated DNA fragment was cut with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pcDNA3.1His/Myc (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The F114A and E115A,D117A mutants of human 4E-BP1 were created by PCR using the human cDNA for wild-type 4E-BP1 as template. The resulting mutated fragment was excised using BamH1 and EcoR1 and ligated into a vector providing N-terminal hexahistidine and Myc tags, just as for the wild-type protein used here. Cells and Transfections—HEK293 cells were cultured, transfected, treated, and lysed (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as described earlier. Isolation of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 on m7GTP-Sepharose was performed as described (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—These procedures were performed as described previously (32Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3021-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Far Western and Dot Blot Analyses—For the dot blot analyses, 0.1 μg of protein was applied in a small (2 mm) dot to Immobilon (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) defatted milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were probed with 100 μl of lysate from cells transfected with a vector encoding Myc-raptor or (as a negative control) the empty vector, which had been diluted 1:1 with extraction buffer containing our standard mix of protease inhibitors (33Wang X. Janmaat M. Beugnet A. Paulin F.E.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and 5% (w/v) defatted milk. This step was performed overnight at 4 °C. Further development of the blots was done exactly as for standard Western blots (33Wang X. Janmaat M. Beugnet A. Paulin F.E.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some cases, His/Myc-tagged 4E-BP1 was isolated from cell lysates by binding to Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) beads prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described previously (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The sources of the antisera have also been described previously (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Raptor Binds to the C Terminus of 4E-BP1 but Not to the N Terminus Containing the RAIP Motif—Raptor has been described previously as interacting with both mTOR and 4E-BP1, as assessed in pull-down experiments (29Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 30Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). In trying to use such approaches to study the interaction between 4E-BP1 and raptor, we experienced substantial difficulties of non-specificity. In view of these difficulties, we tested two alternative approaches to investigating the interaction between 4E-BP1 and raptor. These involve simple dot blot and far Western techniques which have been used previously, e.g. to study the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (34Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). To confirm that raptor binds to 4E-BP1 using such methods, we performed a dot blot using either 4E-BP1, expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria, or GST itself as a negative control. Samples were applied to a membrane that was then blocked and subsequently probed with extract from HEK293 cells expressing raptor as a Myc-tagged fusion. Any raptor associated with the 4E-BP1 or GST was detected using anti-Myc antibody. A clear signal was seen for GST-4E-BP1 but not for GST (Fig. 1A). No signal was seen when blots were probed with extracts from cells not expressing Myc-raptor (showing that anti-Myc does not bind to 4E-BP1). Thus, the dot blot technique can be used to detect an interaction between 4E-BP1 and raptor. A very faint signal was seen when eIF4E was applied to the membrane, and this was then probed with cell extract containing Myc-raptor. However, a signal of similar strength was seen on the negative control membrane probed with control extract, indicating a weak interaction of anti-Myc with eIF4E. Thus, raptor does not bind detectably to eIF4E itself, at least in this type of analysis. To assess whether the regions of 4E-BP1 that contain the RAIP or TOS motifs of 4E-BP1 can bind to raptor, we expressed the N and C termini of rat 4E-BP1 as GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. These fusions contained either the first 24 (GST-N-BP1) or the final 20 (GST-C-BP1) amino acids of 4E-BP1 fused to GST. Residues adjacent to the motifs were included in these fusions in case they were also required for intermolecular interactions. We anticipated that, because the RAIP motif is required for phosphorylation of all the mTOR-regulated sites in 4E-BP1 (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), raptor might interact with the N-terminal fragment. Therefore, we also made a variant N-terminal fusion protein in which the RAIP motif was altered to AAAA, which abrogates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 within intact cells (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the dot blot analyses, we found that raptor bound to full-length 4E-BP1 and GST-C-BP1. However, despite repeated attempts, we were consistently unable to detect any binding of raptor to the N-terminal fragment (Fig. 1B). Our data suggest that raptor binds the C terminus of 4E-BP1 but cannot interact with its N-terminal region. Other recent studies also suggest that the TOS motif is the critical region of 4E-BP1 for this interaction (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). However, our data contrast with other findings, suggesting that both the TOS and RAIP motifs are involved in the binding of raptor to 4E-BP1 (36Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A potentially important point is that our experiment involved studying the binding of raptor to fragment of 4E-BP1 made in E. coli. Thus, it was possible that the interaction of raptor with the RAIP motif requires a modification of 4E-BP1 that does not take place in bacteria. Therefore, we transfected HEK293 cells with vectors encoding GST-NBP1, GST-C-BP1, or GST itself. Samples of the resulting cell lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon, where it was probed using cell lysate containing Mycraptor. Raptor bound to GST-C-BP1 but not GST-N-BP1 or GST in this type of “far Western” assay (Fig. 1C), and the interaction was not affected by pretreatment of the cells with insulin. The bottom panel of Fig. 1C confirms that similar levels of all three proteins were expressed in the HEK293 cells, again indicating that the final 20 amino acids of 4E-BP1 bind to raptor but that the N terminus cannot. The reason for the difference from the data of Choi et al. (36Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is unclear. Because they expressed full-length 4E-BP1, their findings could be explained if the RAIP motif were needed for a modification (e.g. phosphorylation) elsewhere in 4E-BP1 necessary for the binding of raptor. Mutation of Conserved Residues in the TOS Motif Abrogates Raptor Binding—The C-terminal fusion protein contains residues other than those of the TOS motif. Upon comparing the TOS motifs of the S6Ks and 4E-BPs (Fig. 2A), it is evident that the initial phenylalanine is completely conserved, whereas the 2nd and 4th positions are always occupied by acidic residues. To examine whether this motif is required for the interaction, we altered either the Phe (to Ala, F113A) or both the acidic residues (also to Ala, E115A,D117A). As shown in Fig. 2B, raptor failed to bind to either of these variants, indicating that the integrity of the TOS motif is essential for this interaction. These data confirm recent findings (35Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 36Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that the phenylalanyl residue is critical for binding of raptor and show for the first time that the acidic residues are also important for the interaction of 4E-BP1 with raptor. They are consistent with the finding of Schalm et al. (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) that the corresponding residues in the TOS motif of S6K1 (F, D/D; Fig. 2A) play a crucial role in its regulation within cells. The TOS and RAIP Motifs Play Distinct Roles in Regulating the Phosphorylation of mTOR-dependent Sites in 4E-BP1— Although the RAIP motif does not interact with raptor, earlier data showed it is critical for the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, e.g. in response to insulin (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered it important to compare directly and in parallel the individual contributions of these two motifs to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 within intact cells. We used point mutants in rat 4E-BP1 in which the RAIP motif was altered to AAAA (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or the conserved Phe of the TOS motif was altered to Ala (F113A). The AAAA mutation abolished the basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-36/45 and the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation at Ser-64 and Thr-69. In other words, phosphorylation of all four sites was lost, in agreement with our earlier data (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the F113A mutation had little effect on basal or insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-36/45, although it abolished the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation at Ser-64 and almost eliminated phosphorylation of Thr-69 (Fig. 3A). We also wished to study the effects of mutations in the TOS motif of the human protein upon its phosphorylation within cells. Reasons for this included our recent findings (i) that removal of the last six residues (including the TOS motif) from human 4E-BP1 affects its phosphorylation at multiple sites, and (ii) that phosphorylation of Ser-65 in human 4E-BP1 requires a novel “constitutive” phosphorylation site (Ser-101; Ref. 15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Rat 4E-BP1 also contains a serine at this position. The F114A 2Amino acid sequence differences mean that residue numbers of the TOS motif and phosphorylation sites in human 4E-BP1 are shifted by +1 relative to the rat protein. Corresponding phosphorylation sites in rat and human proteins are shown by Ser-64/65. mutation had effects on the phosphorylation of the human 4E-BP1 similar to those seen for F113A mutation in the rat protein. Again, insulin can still increase the phosphorylation of the N-terminal threonyl sites in the F114A mutant. To test further the role of the TOS motif, we also altered the acidic residues within it to Ala (E115A,D117A). Unexpectedly, this double mutation had much less effect on the phosphorylation of any of the four sites studied in human 4E-BP1 than did the F113A mutation (Fig. 3B). Although their basal levels of phosphorylation were decreased, insulin can still markedly enhance the phosphorylation of all of them. Comparison with the loading (anti-Myc) control reveals that the E115A,D117A mutation does impair the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Thr-70, a site that is believed to be particularly important in regulating the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (12Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The small effect of the E115A,D117A mutation on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is surprising, given that this mutation abolishes raptor binding (Fig. 2B). In another study (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), the I → A mutation at the extreme C terminus of 4E-BP1 almost abolished binding of 4E-BP1 to raptor but had only a modest effect on phosphorylation of Ser-65, the only site studied by Schalm et al. (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus far, the phenylalanine seems to be the most important residue in the TOS motif of 4E-BP1. Our data contrast with the effects of mutating the two acidic residues in the TOS motif of S6K1, which completely prevented its activation (17Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To study the effects of the mutations in the TOS motif on the regulation by insulin of the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, we transfected cells with vectors encoding wild-type 4E-BP1 or the F113A or E115A,D117A mutants. After serum starvation of the cells, and in some cases insulin treatment, the cells were lysed, and the resulting samples were subjected to affinity chromatography on m7GTP-Sepharose, which retains eIF4E and associated proteins. The bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, insulin treatment caused the release of the wild-type 4E-BP1, as expected. In the case of the F113A mutant, which fails to undergo phosphorylation at Ser-65 and Thr-70 in response to insulin, no release at all was seen in response to insulin (Fig. 3C). For the E115A,D117A mutant, when expressed at very low levels, some partial release was sometimes observed, but generally little effect of insulin was seen. This result is despite the fact that insulin is able to induce phosphorylation of all the sites studied here (Fig. 3B). However, as noted above, the extent of phosphorylation of Thr-70 was markedly decreased relative to the wild-type protein. This finding likely explains why release is poor, because this site plays a key role in this event (12Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The continued presence of a proportion of the mutant 4E-BP1 that is not phosphorylated at this site probably provides a sufficiently large pool of 4E-BP1 in a form that can still bind to eIF4E. Disruption of the TOS Motif in 4E-BP1 Interferes with Phosphorylation of Ser-101, a Rapamycin-insensitive Site—A major effect of the F114A mutation is on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Ser-65. Because this is dependent on the presence (and likely phosphorylation) of Ser-101 (16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we wondered whether this mutation affected phosphorylation of Ser-101. Ser-65 and Ser-101 lie in similar sequence contexts, and phosphospecific antisera designed to detect one also react with the other (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To eliminate this problem, we used an S65A variant, so that the phosphospecific antisera now only recognize phospho-Ser-101 (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We also created an F114A variant of this protein. The level of signal for phosphorylation of Ser-101 in the F114A mutant was markedly reduced relative to that observed for the protein with the wild-type TOS motif (Fig. 3D). This effect is surprising in view of our earlier observation that Ser-101 phosphorylation is insensitive to rapamycin (15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is confirmed by the present data (Fig. 3D, data for S65A protein). It is nonetheless possible that phosphorylation of Ser-101 is mediated by mTOR/raptor, as some mTOR outputs may be insensitive to rapamycin (by analogy with yeast TOR; Ref. 31Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The drastic effect of the F114A mutation on Ser-65 phosphorylation may be an indirect one arising from the substantially reduced phosphorylation of the two priming sites required for its modification, i.e. Thr-70 and Ser-101. Rapamycin Still Affects the Phosphorylation of a 4E-BP1 Variant Lacking an Intact TOS Motif—These data showed that mutation of the TOS motif mainly affected phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites in 4E-BP1, whereas mutation of the RAIP motif apparently also prevents phosphorylation at the N-terminal threonines as well. Given that the TOS motif binds the mTOR partner raptor, it was important to assess (i) the extent to which phosphorylation of all these sites is actually dependent upon mTOR, and (ii) whether rapamycin affected the residual phosphorylation observed in mutants lacking a functional TOS motif. In wild-type rat 4E-BP1, the phosphorylation of all of these sites is sensitive to rapamycin, which eliminates or severely impairs the increase seen in response to insulin (all sites tested) and reduces the level of any basal phosphorylation (Thr-36/45) (Fig. 4A). As shown above and in Fig. 4A, insulin can still increase phosphorylation of Thr-69 and Thr-36/45 in the F113A mutant, and this remains sensitive to rapamycin. Very similar data were obtained for the corresponding human proteins (wild type and F114A, data not shown). Thus, mTOR still provides inputs to the phosphorylation of a 4E-BP1 variant that cannot bind raptor, indicating the operation of raptor-independent mechanisms that contribute to its regulation. Our data confirm that, as recently reported (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the TOS motif in 4E-BP1 is essential for its interaction with raptor, but contrary to another recent report (36Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we find no evidence for an interaction between raptor and the N-terminal region of 4E-BP1 containing the RAIP motif. Mutating the TOS motif in full-length 4E-BP1 abolishes its ability to bind raptor (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), again indicating that the RAIP motif is insufficient to mediate binding to raptor (because if the still-intact RAIP motif could also bind raptor, binding would have been seen). The RAIP motif, therefore, apparently regulates 4E-BP1 independently of an interaction with raptor. Consistent with this, mutation of the RAIP and TOS motifs has distinct effects on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in cells. Loss of the TOS motif primarily affects the C-terminal sites, whereas mutation of the RAIP motif also has a drastic effect on the N-terminal threonyl sites. Because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 shows a marked hierarchy, it is possible that the effects of the RAIP motif on phosphorylation of Ser-64/65 and Thr-69/70 are indirect, e.g. because of the loss of phosphorylation of the N-terminal sites. The present data provide an important advance over two recent reports (35Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 36Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have studied the roles of the TOS and RAIP motifs on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in intact cells, whereas other workers only examined their importance for phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR in vitro. Their data and those reported in Ref. 18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar showed that disruption of the TOS motif greatly decreased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR in vitro. Our data for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in intact cells show that the loss of the TOS motif has relatively little effect on phosphorylation of the N-terminal threonyl sites. Interestingly, these are the sites that are primarily phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro (37Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ser-64/65, which is hardly phosphorylated by mTOR at all in vitro, is the site most sensitive to disruption of the TOS motif within cells. These data must cast doubt on a simple model in which raptor, via the TOS motif, recruits mTOR to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly. Our findings for the TOS motif confirm and extend those of Schalm et al. (18Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), which appeared when this paper was in preparation but do not include data on the role of the RAIP motif. The F113A mutation completely abrogates the ability of insulin to induce release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (Fig. 3C). The E115A,D117A mutation also almost completely blocked this effect. This seems surprising because this mutant can still undergo insulin-induced phosphorylation at many sites. As discussed above, this effect likely reflects the fact that the E115A,D117A mutation does significantly impair the phosphorylation of Thr-70, a site critical for the release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (12Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Thus, the site-by-site analysis of the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 using the phosphospecific antisera is actually more informative than the m7GTP-Sepharose pull-down experiment in terms of analyzing in detail the effects of point mutations on the regulation of 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation of Thr-36/45 (Thr-37/46) is substantially blocked by rapamycin, and their residual phosphorylation in the TOS mutant (e.g. Fig. 4A, F113A) remains sensitive to rapamycin. Similarly, although loss or mutation of the TOS motif reduces the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Thr-69/70, it does not abolish it completely, and the remaining phosphorylation is still blocked by rapamycin (Fig. 4A and Ref. 15Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This indicates that mTOR makes a contribution to their phosphorylation that does not require an intact TOS motif and may instead be mediated by means of the RAIP motif. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser-64/65 is completely dependent upon the TOS motif. Our data suggest that this likely reflects the greatly decreased levels of phosphorylation of Ser-101 and Thr-70 in the F114A mutant. These data thus indicate that insulin/mTOR signaling to 4E-BP1 is not mediated solely by means of the TOS motif or, presumably, via raptor. Given the drastic effects of the loss of the RAIP motif, it seems that it plays an important but different role in the mTOR-dependent inputs that regulate several sites in 4E-BP1 (see Fig. 4B). However, the S6Ks lack a recognizable RAIP motif, suggesting that it is not essential for mTOR signaling per se and may perform a function specific to 4E-BP1/2 (4E-BP3 also lacks a RAIP motif; Ref. 16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A clear priority now is to identify how the RAIP motif regulates 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. It may, for example, interact with (unidentified) scaffold proteins other than raptor. It is likely that phosphorylation of the other sites in 4E-BP1 (e.g. in human 4E-BP1, Ser-65, Thr-70, and Ser-101) is mediated by so far unidentified kinases, the action of which on 4E-BP1 requires phosphorylation of priming sites and/or the TOS motif. Such kinases may conceivably be part of the multicomponent mTOR complex. We thank members of the Proud laboratory for their help and advice."
https://openalex.org/W2024701933,"Fertilization, a critical step in animal reproduction, is triggered by a series of specialized sperm-egg interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fertilization are not well understood. Here, we identify a sperm-enriched C. elegans TRPC homolog, TRP-3. Mutations in trp-3 lead to sterility in both hermaphrodites and males due to a defect in their sperm. trp-3 mutant sperm are motile, but fail to fertilize oocytes after gamete contact. TRP-3 is initially localized in intracellular vesicles, and then translocates to the plasma membrane during sperm activation. This translocation coincides with a marked increase in store-operated calcium entry, providing an in vivo mechanism for the regulation of TRP-3 activity. As C. elegans oocytes lack egg coats, our data suggest that some TRPC family channels might function to mediate calcium influx during sperm-egg plasma membrane interactions leading to fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2072080280,"A yeast gene has been identified that encodes a novel, evolutionarily conserved N α-acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of the N-terminal residues of histones H4 and H2A.

Eukaryotic proteins are subject to two cotranslational modifications as the nascent polypeptides emerge from the ribosome, methionine cleavage by methionine aminopeptidase, and acetylation of the α-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Removal of the methionine occurs only if the second amino acid is a small one such as serine, alanine, or glycine. Acetylation of the α-amino group on either methionine, or on the N-terminal residue resulting from methionine cleavage, occurs in the great majority of (but not all) eukaryotic proteins, and is accomplished by one of several N α-acetyltransferases (NATs) 1The abbreviations used are: NAT, N α-acetyltransferase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; ACTH, adrenocorticotropin. (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A number of years ago we identified the genes for a yeast NAT, now called NatA, that consists of two subunits, Ard1 and Nat1 (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Subsequent work showed that NatA was responsible for the acetylation of many, but not all, yeast proteins beginning with small residues such as serine, alanine, or glycine (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Takakura H. Tsunasawa S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Yeast ard1 and nat1 mutants are viable and the many proteins that are no longer N-terminally acetylated in the mutant strains are as stable as they are in a wild type strain (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no evidence that N-terminal acetylation serves to protect proteins from degradation in yeast. Ard1 protein has an acetyl-CoA binding motif found in members of the GNAT superfamily, enzymes that acetylate amino groups on proteins and other molecules (6Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, Ard1 is very likely to be the catalytic subunit of NatA. Two other NATs have been identified in yeast, called NatB and NatC, with catalytic subunits Nat3 and Mak3, respectively (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NatB and NatC both acetylate proteins with N-terminal methionine residues, although they have different specificities dictated by the nature of the subsequent amino acids (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Histone H4 is a highly conserved protein with an N-terminal serine residue that is acetylated in both mammals and yeast (8Brandt W.F. Patterson K. von Holt C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9DeLange R.J. Fambrough D.M. Smith E.L. Bonner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 319-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial paper on NatA, we noted that H4 from ard1 or nat1 mutants had the same mobility on Triton-acid-urea gels as when isolated from wild type strains (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that H4 was not acetylated by NatA. But, as noted above, NatB and NatC only acetylate proteins beginning with methionine, not serine, so the question arose as to whether another yeast NAT existed that was responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of H4. We therefore examined uncharacterized yeast genes that are members of the GNAT superfamily of acetyltransferases (6Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to see if one of them might be the NAT that acetylates H4. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved yeast protein, encoded by the gene we call NAT4, that N-terminally acetylates not only histone H4, but also H2A. Nat4 Expression Plasmid and nat4 Mutant—The NAT4 coding sequence was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into the expression vector, pET28a, as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment. This led to the expression of full-length Nat4 protein with a His-tag at the N terminus. The protein was expressed well in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Yeast Δnat4 mutants were constructed by replacing the entire NAT4 open reading frame either with the kanMX6 gene (strain OS1) or with the S. pombe his5 + gene (strain OS4), as described previously (10Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Acetylation Reactions—Histones or peptides were acetylated in 40-μl reactions with 75 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.8), 135 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml chicken erythrocyte histones or 50 μm peptide, 1 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences, 4.2 Ci/mmol), and Nat4 or Hat1 enzymes. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reactions were spotted to Whatman P81 cation-exchange paper and air dried. The dried papers were washed for 5 min three times with 1 m sodium carbonate (pH 9.0), followed by a wash in acetone. Papers were air-dried, and radioactivity was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. Histone Purification—Yeast histones were purified for sequencing as described previously (11Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The histones were separated by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed with water five times for 5 min and then stained with 0.2% Ponceau S for 1 min to visualize the proteins, followed by a wash in water. Sections of the membrane with specific histone bands were excised, soaked briefly in 50% methanol, and washed with water five times. The membrane fragments were air dried and subjected to protein sequencing. For the acid-urea gels, histones were purified as described previously (12Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In Vivo [35S]Methionine Labeling and Protein Extraction—Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking methionine to 2 × 107/ml. A 1-ml culture was labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi of trans-[35S]methionine (ICN) and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold water and resuspended in 100 μl of water containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by vortexing with the same volume of glass beads. A 0.1-ml solution with 0.6% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), which has been kept at 100 °C, was immediately added to the disrupted cell mixture and vortexed for 1 min. After a brief centrifugation 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml RNase, 1 mg/ml DNase, 500 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.0), and 50 mm MgCl2. Protein extracts were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and later analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The sequence of the protein encoded by yeast ORF, YMR069w, has the acetyl-CoA binding motifs characteristic of members of the GNAT superfamily (6Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein has sequence similarity to the catalytic subunits of the three known NATs, Ard1, Nat3, and Mak3, and is of similar size (Fig. 1). We expressed and purified the protein encoded by YMR069w in E. coli. The recombinant protein (that we call Nat4 based on the results to be presented below) was able to acetylate a peptide with a sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 28 amino acids of H4, but not a corresponding H3 peptide or an unrelated peptide, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH; Fig. 2A). We chose ACTH because NatA is able to acetylate this peptide in vitro (13Park E.C. Szostak J.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Notably, Nat4 protein could not acetylate chicken histones even though a known histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Hat1, could acetylate both the H4 peptide and histones (Fig. 2A). The observation that Nat4 could acetylate a synthetic H4 peptide but not chicken histones suggested that the protein might be a NAT for H4, because chicken H4 is already fully acetylated on its N-terminal serine. Further support for this idea came from studies comparing in vitro acetylation of a completely unacetylated H4 peptide with one internally acetylated on all four acetylatable lysines, namely residues 5, 8, 12, and 16. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, Nat4 could acetylate the internally tetraacetylated peptide almost as well as the unacetylated peptide, whereas Hat1 could only acetylate the peptide with internal unacetylated lysines.Fig. 2In vitro assays with Nat4 and Hat1. Assays were done in duplicate, and the error bars indicate the spread in the data. A, recombinant Nat4 acetylates an unacetylated H4 peptide, but not H3 or ACTH peptides or chicken histones. Recombinant Hat1 acetylates both the H4 peptide and chicken histones. B, recombinant Nat4 acetylates both completely unacetylated (un Ac) and internally tetraacetylated (tetra Ac) H4 peptides, whereas Hat1 acetylates only the unacetylated peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we constructed a mutant with a complete deletion of the ORF for Nat4, YMR069w. The mutant was viable and grew at a normal rate. Histones were purified from the mutant, as well as from a wild type and an ard1 strain (Fig. 3). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the bands at the positions of H4 and H3 excised and subjected to Edman degradation and protein sequencing. Histone H3, which is known to be unblocked (i.e. not acetylated) at its N terminus, gave the expected N-terminal sequence, Ala-Arg-Thr-Lys. Histone H4 gave no readable sequence from the wild type and the ard1 strains, as expected if the protein was blocked by acetylation. However, a sequence corresponding to the first four amino acids of H4, Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly, was obtained for H4 from the strain with a deletion of ORF YMR069w (Fig. 3 and Table I). This strongly suggested that this gene encodes a NAT that acetylates the N terminus of H4, and thus the gene was named NAT4.Table IN-terminal sequences of yeast histones H4, H2A, and H2A.ZGeneProteinNo. of amino acidsN-terminal sequenceHHF1H4102SGRGKGGKGHHF2H4102SGRGKGGKGHTA1H2A131SGGKGGKAGHTA2H2A131SGGKGGKAGHTZ1H2A.Z133SGKAHGGKG Open table in a new tab Next, yeast histones were purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography from four strains, wild type, an ard1 mutant, a nat4 mutant, and an ard1-nat4 double mutant. The histones were analyzed on an acid-urea gel, which separates them by size and by charge. As shown in Fig. 4, H4 showed the same pattern of isoforms in wild type and in the ard1 strain, thus confirming our previous conclusion that NatA does not acetylate H4. On the other hand, the H4 isoforms from the nat4 and nat4-ard1 strains migrated more rapidly than from the NAT4 strains, consistent with one extra positive charge due to one less acetylated amino group. Taken together with the H4 sequencing data described above, this experiment convincingly demonstrates that the H4 N-terminal serine is acetylated by Nat4. H3 exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility in all four strains, as expected, given that H3 is not N-terminally acetylated (Fig. 4). In addition, the electrophoretogram confirmed our previous result that histone H2B is a substrate for Nat1-Ard1 (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Note that some, but not all, of the H2B isoforms migrate more rapidly in both ard1 mutant strains. This is discussed below. To our surprise, H2A isoforms also migrated more rapidly when isolated from both nat4 mutant strains as compared with the NAT4 strains (Fig. 4). This suggested that H2A, which has an N-terminal serine residue, just as H4 does, also is a substrate for Nat4. We therefore sequenced purified yeast H2A from wild type and the nat4 mutant. H2A from the wild type strain gave no readable sequence, while H2A from the mutant gave the sequence Ser-Gly-Gly-Lys, which corresponds exactly to the first four amino acids of H2A (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus, H2A also is N-terminally acetylated by Nat4. To examine whether other proteins were substrates for Nat4, we labeled yeast proteins with [35S]methionine in both a wild type strain and a nat4 mutant. A protein extract from each strain was then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. We used this method previously to show that many yeast proteins gain an extra positive charge, and thus shift to the basic side, in ard1 mutants (2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, a careful comparison showed that the pattern of protein spots on the gels from the NAT4 and the Δnat4 strains were almost identical (data not shown). The one visible difference was that the Δnat4 mutant had a missing spot at a molecular weight consistent with the predicted size of Nat4 protein. Thus, we saw no evidence that other proteins were substrates for Nat4. Histones H4 and H2A do not contain methionine and thus would not have been seen in the autoradiogram. Also, highly basic proteins like histones are not well resolved by the usual two-dimensional gel methods (14O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the Δnat4 mutant was viable. The mutant grew normally at all temperatures tested on both rich medium and synthetic medium. The strain grew normally on galactose or glycerol medium. A nat4/nat4 homozygous diploid underwent normal sporulation and meiosis, leading to four viable haploids per spore. Three experiments failed to uncover any transcription defects for nat4 mutants. First, the strain could grow on a medium lacking inositol. This is a sensitive test, because many viable mutants in genes for HATs or other transcriptional coactivators are defective in transcription of the INO1 gene, leading to an inositol auxotrophy (15Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Second, a nat4 mutation was introduced into a strain with an HO-lacZ reporter gene. No defect in lacZ expression was seen. Many mutations affecting the Gcn5 HAT complexes or the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex have a defect in transcription of the HO gene (16Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 17Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Finally, the nat4 mutation was moved into a strain with a his4δ mutation to check for an Spt– phenotype (18Fassler J.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1988; 118: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The strain remained His–, indicating the lack of an Spt phenotype. Three experiments demonstrated that Nat4 protein acetylates the N terminus of H4. First, the recombinant protein acetylated an H4 peptide in vitro, even one already acetylated on the four acetylatable lysines (Fig. 2). Second, and most convincing, H4 isolated from a nat4 mutant could be sequenced by Edman degradation and yielded the expected N-terminal sequence, whereas H4 from a wild type yeast strain was blocked and could not be sequenced (Fig. 3). Third, H4 from the mutant had an altered mobility on acid-urea gels, consistent with an extra positive charge (Fig. 4). The fact that all the H4 shifted position in the nat4 mutant suggested that all the H4 was acetylated by Nat4 in wild type yeast and that no other NAT could acetylate it. All of the H2A from the nat4 mutant also shifted position in acid-urea gels (Fig. 4). This prompted us to sequence H2A. As with H4, H2A gave the expected sequence when isolated from the nat4 mutant and gave no sequence from wild type (Fig. 3). Interestingly, H2A has an N-terminal sequence that is quite similar to that of H4 (Table I). Only one other yeast protein is similar to H4 and H2A, comparing the first 9 amino acids, and that is the H2A variant, H2A.Z (Table I). It is quite possible that H2A.Z is also a substrate for Nat4, but, like H4 and H2A, H2A.Z has no methionine residues and thus could not have been seen in the two-dimensional gel analysis. Interestingly, recombinant H2A.Z purified from E. coli (as an H2A.Z-H2B dimer) was an excellent substrate for in vitro acetylation by Nat4, while H2B was not acetylated (data not shown). In addition to H4, H2A, and H2A.Z, there are 61 other yeast proteins predicted to begin with (Met)-Ser-Gly. As noted above, we did not observe any mobility shifts comparing proteins from wild type and nat4 mutant strains by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. Therefore, we tentatively conclude that Nat4 is dedicated to the acetylation of histones H4 and H2A (and perhaps H2A.Z) and does not act on other proteins. Since all the H4 and H2A isoforms had an altered mobility on the acid-urea gel, we conclude that all of the H4 and H2A in yeast are acetylated by Nat4 (Fig. 4). But, as noted, some, but not all, of the H2B isoforms had an altered mobility on acid-urea gels when isolated from ard1 mutants (Ref. 2Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). One explanation for this result is that NatA (with the catalytic subunit, Ard1) acetylates H2B inefficiently. Another explanation takes note of the fact that the two yeast H2B genes code for slightly different proteins, one starting with Ser-Ser-Ala and the other starting with Ser-Ala-Lys. Perhaps NatA can only acetylate one of these two H2Bs, and the other one either is not acetylated or is acetylated by another, as yet unidentified, NAT. Nat4 is well conserved from yeast to mammals, not just in the acetyl CoA binding domain, but throughout the length of the protein (Fig. 5). We predict that those homologs from larger eukaryotes also will acetylate the N terminus of H4 and H2A, and possibly H2A.Z. Both H4 and H2A are known to be blocked from N-terminal sequencing in all species in which they have been examined, and in the case of the bovine proteins, N-terminal acetylation has been directly demonstrated by elegant biochemistry (9DeLange R.J. Fambrough D.M. Smith E.L. Bonner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 319-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is surprising that nat4 mutants did not exhibit readily observable phenotypes, especially, since every nucleosome in the mutant cell will have four extra positive charges, one for each H4 and H2A present in the octamer. And yet the mutant grew normally under all conditions tested. Furthermore, the mutant had no observable transcription defects using tests that do exhibit phenotypes for mutants affecting the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex, the Gcn5 HAT complexes and the various Spt proteins involved in transcription. To try to uncover phenotypes, we constructed nat4-ard1 and nat4-hat1 double mutants. We also constructed a strain with the nat4 mutation plus only one copy of the duplicate H3-H4 genes (either HHT1-HHF1 or HHT2-HHF2). None of those strains had phenotypes over and above that of the single mutants (data not shown). Nevertheless, since acetylation of the N-terminal serine on H4 and H2A is conserved, the modification must be important under some environmental conditions. Additional phenotypic studies or a synthetic lethal screen may uncover the role(s) for N-terminal acetylation of H4 and H2A. We thank Aaron Neiman for suggesting that this gene might encode a NAT, Tom Fischer of the Center for Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules at Stony Brook for protein sequencing, Michael Grunstein for peptides, and Ann Sutton for advice."

As a test of the “affinity gradient” model for Kap translocation, we measured the apparent affinity of Kap95p to FG Nups representing three distinct regions of the S. cerevisiae NPC. We find that the affinity of Kap95p-Kap60p-cargo complexes to Nup1p (a nuclear basket Nup) is 225-fold higher than to Nup100p (a central scaffold Nup) and 4000-fold higher than to Nup42p (a cytoplasmic filament Nup), revealing a steep gradient of affinity for Kap95p complexes along the yeast NPC. A high affinity binding site for a Kap95p import complex was mapped to the C terminus of Nup1p, and, surprisingly, deletion of all FG repeats in that region did not eliminate binding of the complex. Instead, a 36-amino acid truncation of the C terminus of Nup1p reduced its affinity for the Kap95p import complex by 450-fold. Mutant yeast that express Nup1pΔ36 instead of full-length Nup1p display specific defects in Kap95p localization and Kap95p-mediated nuclear import. We conclude that a high affinity binding site for Kap95p at the nuclear basket increases the translocation efficiency of Kap95p import complexes across the NPC.

Mutant yeast that express Nup1pΔ36 instead of full-length Nup1p display specific defects in Kap95p localization and Kap95p-mediated nuclear import. We conclude that a high affinity binding site for Kap95p at the nuclear basket increases the translocation efficiency of Kap95p import complexes across the NPC. The karyopherin family of proteins mediates nucleocytoplasmic transport by moving proteins and ribonucleoproteins (cargo) 1The abbreviations used are: cargo, a protein containing a nuclear transport signal; FG, phenylalanine-glycine; FG Nup, nucleoporin containing phenylalanine-glycine repeats; IBB, importin β binding; Kap, karyopherin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NPC, nuclear pore complex; Nup, nucleoporin; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; cNLS, classic nuclear localization signal.1The abbreviations used are: cargo, a protein containing a nuclear transport signal; FG, phenylalanine-glycine; FG Nup, nucleoporin containing phenylalanine-glycine repeats; IBB, importin β binding; Kap, karyopherin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NPC, nuclear pore complex; Nup, nucleoporin; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; cNLS, classic nuclear localization signal. across the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Karyopherins (Kaps) bind to nuclear localization or nuclear export signals of cargo molecules and tether them to nucleoporins (Nups) along the NPC during translocation. The transport process is regulated by a GTPase (Ran/Gsp1p), which controls the binding of karyopherins to Nups and cargo. Exactly how karyopherins use their interaction with nucleoporins to move cargo along the NPC remains a mystery.One prominent feature of the NPC is its peculiar composition, with almost half of its 30 Nups containing peptide repeats that feature phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs at their core. FG repeat regions in Nups provide binding sites for karyopherins (for example see Ref. 1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The structure of a karyopherin bound to peptides containing FG repeats shows that the phenyl side chains play a critical role in the binding reaction (2Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Strawn L.A. Wente S.R.

Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). With 13 different FG Nups in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC, and 8-32 copies of each per NPC (4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), there may be as many as 150 or more FG Nups throughout the NPC. This multitude of docking sites for karyopherins may provide a continuum of steps that biases movement of karyopherins in one direction along the NPC. The particular direction of Kap movement (import or export) may be dictated by the differences in binding strength to proximal versus distal Nups that are asymmetrically distributed across the NPC (5Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Blobel G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In yeast, there are 15 different karyopherins (7Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimer is responsible for import of cargoes containing classical nuclear localization signals (cNLSs) (8Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In general, Kap60p binds to the cNLS of the cargo molecule and Kap95p interacts with Nups at the NPC to mediate translocation (9Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Nuclear import in this pathway is terminated by binding of Gsp1p-GTP to Kap95p, which accelerates the dissociation rate of Kap95p from the Kap60p-cargo complexes (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and reduces binding of Kap95p to Nups (1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar).The mammalian homologue of Kap95p (karyopherin β, importin β) displays a higher affinity to nucleoporins that reside in the nuclear basket of the NPC than to those in the central scaffold region or in the cytoplasmic filaments (5Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the notion that a gradient of affinities along the NPC contributes to movement of karyopherin β. In this study, we demonstrate that a similar, but much steeper, gradient of binding affinities exists between Kap95p and FG Nups in S. cerevisiae. We investigate the role of this gradient in Kap95p-mediated nuclear import in vivo by disrupting a high affinity binding site for Kap95p import complexes in Nup1p. Nup1p is one of three Nups located in the nuclear basket of the yeast NPC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—Table I contains a list of yeast strains used. Genomic deletion of the 3′ end of NUP1 was achieved by homologous recombination (11Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar) in strains BY4741/BY4742, yielding strains MRY120/MRY121. This deletion resulted in expression of amino acids (aa) 1-1040 of Nup1p (Nup1pΔ36), which was verified by Western blot analysis of total cell extracts with anti-Nup1p antibodies. Strains MRY122 through MRY133 were obtained by transforming the indicated yeast strains with the following NLS-GFP constructs: pCu416-cNLS-YFP, copper-inducible expression of the SV40 T-antigen NLS fused to YFP and inserted into the BamHI site of pCu416 (ATCC); Pho4p-NLS-GFP (pNLS), constitutive expression of Pho4p aa 140-166 fused to three copies of GFP (12Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); Nab2p-NLS-GFP (rgNLS), Nab2p aa 198-252 fused to the C terminus of GFP (13Shulga N. Mosammaparast N. Wozniak R. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); pGAD-cNLS-GFP, constitutive expression of the SV40 T-antigen NLS fused to the Gal4p activation domain and GFP (14Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of total cell extract with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies. cNLS-YFP was induced with 100 μm CuSO4 for 2 h. MRY128 was obtained by mating YD05244 to MRY121, followed by selection of His+ kanR sporulants and verification by Western blot using anti-Nup1p and anti-Nup2p antibodies. Other double mutants (MRY129-131) were obtained in a similar manner.Table IYeast strainsNameGenotypeSourceBY 4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Research GeneticsBY4742MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3DΔ0Research GeneticsYD05244MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 Δnup2::kanMX4Research GeneticsYD00407MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 Δnup60::kanMX4Research GeneticsYD04917MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 Δnup100::kanMX4Research GeneticsYD03551MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 Δnup42::kanMX4Research GeneticsMRY120MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 nup1Δ36::HIS3This studyMRY121MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3DΔ0 nup1Δ36::HIS3This studyMRY122BY4741 + pCu416-cNLS-YFPThis studyMRY123MRY120 + pCu416-cNLS-YFPThis studyMRY124BY4741 + Pho4-NLS-GFPThis studyMRY125MRY120 + Pho4-NLS-GFPThis studyMRY126BY4741 + Nab2-NLS-GFPThis studyMRY127MRY120 + Nab2-NLS-GFPThis studyMRY128BY4741 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY129MRY120 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY130YD03551 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY131YD04917 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY132YD00407 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY133YD05244 + pGAD-cNLS-GFPThis studyMRY134MAT? his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2? ura3DΔ0 met15?

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. Nup1p fragments were constructed by PCR amplification of regions encoding the amino acids depicted in Fig. 4. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the Stratagene QuickChange™ kit. Wild-type HIS-Gsp1p was purified and charged with GTP as described previously (9Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar).Solution Binding Assay—All solution binding assays were performed using purified recombinant proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) as described previously (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Nups were incubated in batch with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and aliquots were incubated with soluble proteins as indicated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were sedimented and unbound proteins collected. After brief washing, bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Bound and unbound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue.Nucleoporin competition experiments were conducted as described above, except that Kap95p and Kap60p were pre-incubated with immobilized GST-Nup100pΔC prior to adding the soluble competitor. Competition experiments using Nup100p-Kap complexes formed in yeast extracts were performed as follows. GST-Nup100pΔC was immobilized on glutathione beads, and the beads were incubated with yeast extract. Unbound proteins were washed off as described in Ref. 1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, and soluble Nups were incubated with pre-assembled Nup100pΔC-Kap complexes for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound (and released) proteins were collected, the beads were washed, and bound proteins remaining were extracted from the beads with 1 m NaCl. All proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue.For the Gsp1p-GTP competition assays, GST-Nups were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with radiolabeled Kap95p (with or without Kap60p and cargo) for 20 min at room temperature. Unbound proteins were washed away, and equal volumes of buffer with or without Gsp1p-GTP were added. After 1 h at room temperature, beads were collected, washed briefly, and bound Kap95p was quantified by liquid scintillation. The amount of Kap95p bound to Nups was normalized to the amount bound after the addition of buffer only.Equilibrium Affinity Assay—Affinities were calculated using purified radiolabeled Kap95p in solution binding assays. Kap95p was phosphorylated at an engineered site in the N terminus using bovine heart kinase and [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unincorporated nucleotide was removed in a G-25 desalting spin column (Bio-Rad). For each experiment, a GST-Nup was immobilized on beads and incubated with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled Kap95p (with or without a molar excess of unlabeled Kap60p and cargo). The cargo used was the NLS of CBP80 (aa 1-30) fused to the maltose-binding protein. Incubations were for 2 h at room temperature in binding buffer with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml PMSF) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Beads were then washed quickly, and bound radiolabeled Kap95p was quantified by liquid scintillation. Binding curves were fit to the data using GraphPad Prism™ software (Biosoft). Each curve was fit using duplicate points of 6-8 different Kap95p concentrations. Experiments were repeated for each pair using different concentrations of Nup within the bead volume; these gave similar K D values. Nup42p affinities were measured in the presence of 5 μm Kap60p and 5 μm cargo; Nup100pΔC affinities were measured in the presence of 1 μm Kap60p and 1 μm cargo; mcNup1p affinities were measured in the presence of 25 nm Kap60p and 50 nm cargo; and mcNup1pΔ36 affinities were measured in the presence of 2.5 μm Kap60p and 2.5 μm cargo.Direct GFP Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast expressing GFP fusions were grown to mid-log phase in SCD-URA culture media and visualized live under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Images were captured and assembled using QED and Photoshop 7.0 software. Three different counters examined over 100 cells for each strain. Only fluorescent cells were counted. Cells were scored as “nuclear” if there was more fluorescence in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Because of higher expression levels in the nup1Δ36 strain than in the wild-type strain, pNLS-GFP pictures were not taken at the same exposure times.In Vivo cNLS-GFP Import Assay—In vivo nuclear import assays were performed as described by Shulga et al. (14Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, strains carrying the cNLS-YFP-expressing plasmid (encoding the SV40 NLS fused to YFP) were grown at 30 °C to an A 600 = 0.5. After sedimentation, cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium containing 20 mm sodium azide and 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose. After 1 h at 4 °C, yeast were sedimented, washed, resuspended in 100 μl of medium containing 2% dextrose, and incubated at 4 °C. Nuclear import was initiated by transferring 5 μl of the cell suspension onto a microscope slide at room temperature. Localization of the cNLS-YFP fusion protein was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Only cells showing fluorescence were scored. Approximately 30 cells were counted in 1-min intervals, and results were pooled from four separate experiments. The relative rates of recovery were calculated by drawing linear regression lines through the initial portion of the time course (0-5 min) using GraphPad Prism™ software (Biosoft).Preparation of S. cerevisiae Cell Extracts—For total cell extracts, 4 × 107 cells were harvested, washed with 1 ml of TE buffer, and resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer. 50 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C. After vortexing with glass beads for 3 min, the liquid was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. 15 μl of the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Cytosol extracts were prepared using French press cell lysis as described previously (1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Yeast were grown to early log phase at 30 °C in YPD media and were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. For Kap95p and Kap60p localizations, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate buffer (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 500 μm MgCl2) with 3.7% formaldehyde, and fixed further for 1 h at 30 °C. For Nup1p localizations, this 1-h fix was omitted. All cells were washed twice in phosphate buffer and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1.2 m sorbitol. Cell walls were digested with Zymolase 100T (ICN) for 20 min at 30 °C, and yeast spheroplasts were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-treated glass slides. Spheroplasts were post-fixed for 6 min in dry ice-cold methanol followed by 30 s in acetone. Antibody incubations were done as described previously (15Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N.P. Huang L. Al B. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using anti-Kap95p and anti-Kap60p antibodies at a 1:2000 dilution, and anti-Nup1p antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution.RESULTSYeast Nups have been mapped to their general location within the NPC. Most of the 13 FG Nups are located in the central region, and only 5 are located on the cytoplasmic filaments or the nuclear basket (4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 16Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F.

To examine whether the Kap95p binding preference for FG Nups correlates with their location within the NPC, we reconstituted binding of a Kap95p-Kap60p-cargo complex (a Kap95p import complex) to immobilized FG Nups representing three distinct regions of the NPC (Fig. 1A). The cargo protein used is a fusion between the yeast Cbp80p NLS (aa 1-30) and the maltose-binding protein (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We found that the amount of Kap95p complexes bound to each FG Nup varied, falling roughly into three categories: little binding to Nup42p and Nup159p (located in the cytoplasmic filaments), more binding to Nup100p and Nup116p (located in the central region), and best binding to Nup1p and Nup2p (located in the nuclear basket) (Fig. 1A and data not shown).Fig. 1Characterization of Kap95p binding to FG Nups. A, reconstituted binding of Kap95p to Nup42p, Nup100pΔC, and mcNup1p in the presence and absence of Kap60p and cargo. Each GST-Nup was immobilized on glutathione-coated beads (1 μm Nup within the bead volume) and incubated with similar amounts (250-500 nm) of purified Kap95p, Kap60p, and cargo, as indicated. Proteins in the bound (left panels) and unbound fractions (right panels) were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue. B, affinity of Kap95p to GST-Nups in the presence of Kap60p and cargo. GST-Nup-coated beads were incubated with the indicated concentrations of radiolabeled Kap95p for 2 h at 25 °C in binding buffer in the presence of a molar excess (in relation to Kap95p) of Kap60p and cargo, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors. The amount of Kap95p bound was quantified by liquid scintillation and used to calculate affinities. The graphs show representative curves, and each data point was obtained in duplicate. Error is the calculated standard error of the best fit K D value. For each case, different concentrations of Nup within the bead volume gave similar K D values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Equilibrium Binding Affinities of Kap95p to FG Nups—To further characterize the observed difference in binding between Kap95p complexes and FG Nups, their relative binding affinities were quantified (Fig. 1B). Nup42p, Nup100p, and Nup1p were chosen to represent the three regions of the NPC (see above). For Nup100p and Nup1p, full-length proteins were not used because of poor solubility. Instead, the regions containing all of the FG repeats were used and are referred to as mcNup1p (aa 332-1076) and Nup100pΔC (aa 1-640). mcNup1p, Nup100ΔC, and Nup42p are functional as they efficiently capture karyopherins from yeast extracts (1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As Kap95p is likely in a complex with Kap60p and its cargo during translocation across the NPC in vivo, we also measured the affinity of Kap95p to FG Nups in the presence of Kap60p and cargo. In all cases, the concentrations of unlabeled Kap60p and cargo added were well above the K D of Kap95p-Kap60p complexes (K D ≤ 0.15 nm) and Kap60p-cargo complexes (K D = 2.8 nm) (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and were in molar excess of the highest concentration of radiolabeled Kap95p used in each experiment. Therefore, all Kap95p molecules should be bound to Kap60p or Kap60p-cargo complexes at the concentrations used.We find that Kap95p-Kap60p-cargo complexes bind to bead-immobilized Nup42p with a K D = 1.7 ± 0.3 μm, to Nup100p with a K D = 90 ± 9 nm, and to Nup1p with a K D = 0.4 ± 0.02 nm (Fig. 1B and Table II). Each value measured remains constant at multiple Nup concentrations (data not shown). Given the number of FG repeats in each Nup (22 for Nup42p, 44 for Nup100pΔC, and 28 for Nup1pΔN), and assuming that Kap95p can bind to any FG repeat, it seems possible that multiple Kap95p molecules bind simultaneously to a Nup. However, the maximal stoichiometry of Kap95p-Nup complexes in the solution binding assay always appears to be 1:1 as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). It is also interesting that the strength of Kap95p-Nup interactions measured does not correlate with the number of FG repeats present in each Nup; instead, the strength correlates to the location of each Nup within the NPC, with the weakest binding to Nup42p of the cytoplasmic filaments, intermediate binding to Nup100p of the central scaffold region, and the strongest binding to Nup1p of the nuclear basket (Table II). The difference in affinity is pronounced: a 4,000-fold increase in affinity for Kap95p import complexes from the cytoplasmic side of the NPC to the nucleoplasmic side.Table IIApparent affinity measured for Kap95p to FG Nups in the presence or absence of Kap60p or Kap60p-cargo complexesNucleoporinaGST-tagged Nups immobilized on glutathione-coated beads.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Kap60p and Kap60p-Cargo Complexes on the Affinity of Kap95p to FG Nups—We also measured the affinity of Kap95p monomers and Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimers to the same three Nups, to examine how Kap60p and cargo modulate binding of Kap95p to Nups. We find that Kap60p increases 1.5-fold the affinity of Kap95p to Nup42p, but does not change the affinity of Kap95p to Nup100p (Table II). In stark contrast, Kap60p increases ≥160-fold the affinity of Kap95p to Nup1p (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The presence of cargo decreases 2-fold the affinity of Kap95p-Kap60p to Nup42p, increases 3-fold the affinity to Nup100pΔC, and lowers ≥8-fold the affinity to Nup1p (Table II) (10Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, Nup1p is the most sensitive to the presence of Kap60p or Kap60p-cargo complexes when binding Kap95p. Despite the effects of Kap60p and cargo, the relative binding trend between Kap95p complexes and the FG Nups remains the same in all situations: weak binding to Nup42p, moderate binding to Nup100p, and strongest binding to Nup1p (Table II).Effect of Gsp1p-GTP on the Binding of Kap95p Complexes to Nup1p—In general, the binding of Kap95p to FG Nups is disrupted by the presence of Gsp1p-GTP (1Allen N.P.

Among the three FG Nups tested here, Nup1p is the only one that resides exclusively in the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Thus, we assume that binding of Kap95p import complexes to Nup1p in vivo could only happen if it occurs prior to the import complex contacting a free Gsp1p-GTP molecule, or in spite of the presence of Gsp1p-GTP. Two observations support the latter statement. First, Kap95p-Kap60p can be recovered bound to Nup1p in yeast extracts that have been supplemented with 1.2 μm Gsp1pQ71L-GTP under conditions that diminish binding of Kap95p-Kap60p to most other FG Nups (1Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Second, the C terminus of Nup1p (aa 963-1076) has the unusual property of enhancing the Kap60p-mediated disassembly of Kap95p-Gsp1p-GTP complexes (19Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we explored this subject further by comparing the relative sensitivity of the various Kap95p-Nup1p complexes to Gsp1p-GTP.GST-Nup1p was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with 0.2 μm Kap95p-Kap60p-cargo complexes. The amount of radiolabeled Kap95p bound was then measured in the absence and presence of 0.2 or 1 μm Gsp1p-GTP. Binding of Kap95p import complexes to Nup1p was hardly affected by the presence of up to 1 μm Gsp1p-GTP (Fig. 2A), which approximates the estimated concentration of Gsp1p-GTP in the nucleoplasm. However, a 36-aa deletion of the C terminus of Nup1p (Nup1pΔ36) caused Kap95p binding to Nup1pΔ36 to be more responsive to Gsp1p-GTP, rendering nearly half of the Kap95p unable to bind Nup1pΔ36 when the concentrations of Gsp1p-GTP and Kap95p were equivalent (Fig. 2A). To examine this issue further, we repeated the binding of Kap95p to mcNup1p using higher ratios of Gsp1p-GTP to Kap95p with or without Kap60p and cargo (Fig. 2B). We found that a 2-3-fold molar excess of Gsp1p-GTP was sufficient to prevent over 90% of the binding of Kap95p monomers to Nup1p, but a ≥60-fold molar excess of Gsp1p-GTP over Kap95p was required for the same effect in the presence of Kap60p or Kap60p-cargo complexes. Thus, the presence of Kap60p reduced the effects of Gsp1p-GTP on Kap95p-Nup1p interaction,"

SP-A exhibits both calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding, a characteristic of the collectin family, and specific interactions with lipid membrane components. The crystal structure of the trimeric carbohydrate recognition domain and neck domain of SP-A was solved to 2.1-Å resolution with multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing from samarium. Two metalbinding sites were identified, one in the highly conserved lectin site and the other 8.5 Å away. The interdomain carbohydrate recognition domain-neck angle is significantly less in SP-A than in the homologous collectins, surfactant protein D, and mannose-binding protein. This conformational difference may endow the SP-A trimer with a more extensive hydrophobic surface capable of binding lipophilic membrane components. The appearance of this surface suggests a putative binding region for membrane-derived SP-A ligands such as phosphatidylcholine and lipid A, the endotoxic lipid component of bacterial lipopolysaccharide that mediates the potentially lethal effects of Gram-negative bacterial infection.

Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of phospholipids and proteins that lines the distal airways and stabilizes the gas-exchanging alveolar units of the lung (1Goerke J. Clements J.A. Macklen P.T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8424-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) suggest that the protein serves multiple roles in surfactant function. However, recent evidence that SP-A is also a pulmonary host defense protein includes reports that SP-A binds to, aggregates, opsonizes, and permeabilizes microorganisms (8McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and that the SP-A-deficient gene-targeted mouse is susceptible to lung infection with multiple organisms (9LeVine A.M.

One view that reconciles these apparently divergent functions of SP-A is that its high affinity for surfactant membranes is a mechanism for concentrating the protein at the front lines of defense against inhaled pathogens (8McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). SP-A belongs to the structurally homologous family of innate immune defense proteins known as collectins (10Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1143-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), so named for their collagen-like and lectin domains. Collectins compose a subset of the C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins, a functionally diverse and phylogenetically ancient family of carbohydrate binding proteins (12Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The binding of collectins to glycoconjugates on the surface of microorganisms results in enhanced clearance through a variety of mechanisms, including reduction of epithelial adherence, agglutination, and opsonization (13Epstein J. Eichbaum Q. Sheriff S. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All known collectin family members bind more avidly to mannose and glucose, which most microbial ligands contain, than to galactose, fructose, and sialic acid, which are common in glycoproteins from higher organisms. Three collectins are known in humans: pulmonary proteins SP-A, surfactant protein D (SP-D), and serum mannose-binding protein (MBP).

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), known as the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), at the C terminus is linked to an extended collagen-like domain of tripeptide Gly-X-Y repeats. The collectin linker, an extended α-helical “neck,” forms a coiled coil with the necks of two other monomers and serves as the nucleus for trimerization in the N-terminal direction through the collagen domain (21Zhang P.

Larger aggregates form by means of disulfide bond formation within a short N-terminal segment containing two cysteine residues (23Zhang M. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16481-16488Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs show that SP-A and MBP assemble as six trimers arrayed in parallel and in register, resembling a bouquet of tulips (24Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas SP-D is cruciform, formed by radial arrangements of four trimers (25Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A and SP-D exhibit high affinity binding interactions with lipid as well as carbohydrate ligands. SP-A binds specifically to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the most abundant phospholipid species in surfactant (26Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas SP-D binds to the minor surfactant component phosphatidylinositol (27Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol.

Both bind to the lipopolysaccharide moieties that decorate bacterial surfaces; SP-A recognizes the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide (29van Iwaarden J.F. Pikaar J.C. Storm J. Brouwer E.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 3267-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs and other data indicate that the globular CRD and collagen-like domains in both surfactant proteins are oriented proximal and distal, respectively, to the membrane surface (32Palaniyar N. Ridsdale R.A. Holterman C.E. Inchley K. Possmayer F. Harauz G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Palaniyar N. McCormack F.X. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochemistry. 2002; 39: 6310-6316Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the molecular details of the membrane association. The present study was undertaken to determine the three-dimensional structure of the SP-A CRD and neck domain and to address questions related to its functional properties, especially with respect to specific interactions with surfactant phospholipids and membrane components, such as the endotoxin lipid A, derived from pathogenic bacteria. A recombinant rat SP-A containing only the amphipathic linking domain and the CRD and lacking the consensus for asparagine-linked glycosylation (ΔN1-P80,N187S) was synthesized in insect cells using baculovirus vectors, as described previously (34McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ΔN1-P80,N187S was purified by mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography, dialyzed against 5 mm Tris and 50 mm NaCl and concentrated to at least 3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. P63 crystals (a = 97.680 Å, c = 44.538 Å) containing one monomer per asymmetric unit were grown by vapor equilibration in sitting droplets at 17 °C over mother liquor containing 1.6 m LiSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 7% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of SP-A:trimannose. Crystallographic data were collected at the X8C beam-line at Brookhaven National Labs. Native and Sm MAD data sets were collected from the same crystal. For the native data set, an additional 5% (v/v) glycerol was added to ensure cryoprotection, and data were collected to 2.07 Å using a wavelength of 1.072 Å. The native crystal was then recovered and thawed into a 50-μL sitting drop of mother liquor/5% glycerol. To this droplet was added 0.5-μL aliquots of 200 mm SmCl3, layered on the surface to float and gradually diffuse through the drop down to the crystal. Five aliquots were added over a 1-h period, giving a final concentration of 10 mm SmCl3. The droplet was then allowed to sit undisturbed for 7 h. The Sm-soaked crystal was refrozen in the beam and MAD data were collected at three wavelengths (Table I). The crystal still diffracted to 2.0 Å with good mosaicity (0.56 versus 0.65° for the native data set). However, the detector distance required to accommodate the long wavelength of the Sm edge gave only a 2.8-Å resolution at the edge of the imaging plate, limiting MAD phasing to that resolution. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (48Otwinowksi Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Phases were determined for the Sm MAD data with SOLVE (49Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The solvent-flattened MAD-phased electron density map calculated at 2.8-Å resolution presented very well defined electron density in which secondary structure, particularly the three α-helices and longer β-strands, were clear and unambiguous. Secondary structure was fit manually in O (50Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O–The Manual. Uppsala Software Factory, Uppsala, Sweden1992Google Scholar). After the chain tracing was completed in O, the model was positionally refined using crystallography NMR software (51Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The model was then further refined to 2.1-Å resolution against the native data using simulated annealing protocols. Iterative cycles of rebuilding and refinement, using difference Fourier and simulated annealing omit maps, were used to produce the final model. Broken density at the N terminus precluded unambiguous positioning of residues 81–83, which were eventually omitted. For the structure of the SP-A/samarium complex, 2.5-Å resolution data at the remote wavelength (λ = 1.771 Å) were reprocessed and refined against the fully refined coordinates of the native SP-A structure. The few differences between the two models as observed in composite omit and difference Fourier maps were localized to the metal ion binding loops, which were carefully rebuilt. In both final models (native SP-A and its complex with samarium), 92.7 and 7.3% of residues occur in the core and allowed regions, respectively, of the Ramachandran plot, as calculated in PRO-CHECK (52Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Figures (except for Fig. 1A) were prepared using Swiss PDB Viewer (53Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar) and POVRAY. Fig. 1A was prepared using ALSCRIPT (54Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The crystal structure is derived from the Δ1–80/N187S fragment, which encompasses the extended, helical neck region (residues 81–108) and the globular CRD (residues 111–228) of the SP-A monomer. The N187S substitution eliminates the only site of N-linked glycosylation in the CRD. The fragment forms a stable non-covalent trimer in solution (34McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the crystal, the monomers of the trimer are related by crystallographic symmetry. The secondary structure of the CRD includes three α-helices and 11 short (3–7 residue) strands of β-sheet (Fig. 1). The overall fold of the CRD in SP-A is similar to that of SP-D and MBP. The main structural differences are restricted to the region that includes surface loops and calcium binding sites. Excluding the variable regions, which contain insertions or deletions, the root-mean-square deviation for C-α atoms in SP-A is 0.67 Å when compared with SP-D (over 104 atoms representing 92% of the structure) and 1.29 Å compared with MBP (96 atoms, or 85%). The neck region consists of a single amphipathic α-helix (residues 84–108) culminating in a reverse turn (residues 108–111) that leads into the first β-sheet of the CRD domain. The three N-terminal residues (81–83) of the fragment are disordered because of high mobility and are omitted from the structure. The neck regions of three monomers are intertwined around a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis to form the coiled-coil trimer (Fig. 1). The trimer is held together primarily by means of the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix from the neck of each monomer. This hydrophobic face is composed of the side chains of Leu-87, Leu-91, Ile-94, Ile-98, Thr-101, Met-102, and Leu-105. The reverse turn is situated around the three-fold symmetry axis such that the polar side chains of Gln-108 and Ser-110 form H-bonds with their counterparts in the other two monomers. Three intermolecular salt bridges linking Glu-90 and Lys-95 of adjacent monomers provide additional stabilization. Intramolecular contacts between the neck and CRD are minimal in the SP-A monomer. In the SP-A trimer, the interface between domains does not have the appearance of a freely mobile hinge region as it does in the monomer. Major contacts between the two domains are primarily intermolecular and mostly hydrophilic. In one such contact, the carboxylate group of the C terminus, Phe-228, of one monomer forms a salt bridge and an H-bond with the side chains of neck residues His-96 and Gln-100, respectively, of another monomer. All three residues are invariant in mammalian SP-A sequences. The neck and CRD domains are oriented nearly perpendicularly to each other in SP-A, in contrast to both SP-D and MBP, where the interdomain angles are greater (i.e. “T” versus “Y” shapes, respectively) (Fig. 2). This difference in tertiary structure likely plays a role in the recognition of different classes of macromolecular substrates by these otherwise homologous proteins: in particular, the extensive planar surface of SP-A is better suited for binding membrane lipids than that of the other collectins. Calcium Binding Sites—Crystallographic and solution studies have identified two classes of calcium-binding sites in collectin CRDs. SP-D and MBP crystal structures show a single, high affinity C-lectin type site (designated herein as the primary site), composed of highly conserved acidic or amide ligands from the protein. Lower affinity (designated auxiliary) sites are situated 8 and 12 Å from the primary site. The SP-A crystal structure was determined in the presence of calcium. One bound calcium ion was observed, and that is in the primary site. This site is very similar overall to those found in the SP-D and MBP (Fig. 3). The SP-A protein donates five oxygen ligands: Glu-195 (side chain), Arg-197 (main chain), Asn-214 (side chain), and Asp-215 (main chain and side chain). All are highly conserved except for Arg-197, which is replaced by asparagine in MBP and SP-D. Yet the Arg-197 carbonyl oxygen assumes the coordination position that is, in the other two collectins, occupied by the asparagine side-chain carbonyl oxygen, thus preserving the common architecture of the site despite the substitution. The coordination of calcium via the main-chain oxygen in Arg-197 suggests that substitutions at this position (e.g. by alanine in human SP-A or by site-directed mutagenesis) will retain calcium binding capabilities even if other properties are affected (35Pattanajitvilai S. Kuroki Y. Tsunezawa W. McCormack F.X. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The present structure also shows that the highly conserved residue Pro-196 adopts the cis conformation associated with calcium binding, as demonstrated for MBP (36Ng K.K. Park-Snyder S. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17965-17976Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Isomerization of the equivalent proline in MBP from trans to cis permits the flanking residues (equivalent to Glu-195 and Arg-197 in SP-A) to adopt the conformation required to coordinate the calcium ion (37Ng K.K. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17977-17989Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the lectin sites of collectins, the calcium coordinated shell is completed by exogenous non-protein ligands (38Hakansson K. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In complexes of MBP-mannose, two coordination positions are occupied by vicinal carbohydrate oxygens. In structures of MBP or SP-D in the absence of carbohydrate, the corresponding calcium ligands are solvent water molecules. In the SP-A crystal structure, mannose binding is not observed, despite its presence in the crystallization medium, presumably because of competition with the cryoprotectant glycerol (39Ng K.K. Kolatkar A.R. Park-Snyder S. Feinberg H. Clark D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16088-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The electron density at these positions is poorly defined, however, and has been modeled in the present structure as two water molecules. Although calcium binding only occurs at the C-lectin (primary) site in the SP-A/Ca2+ complex, an additional (auxiliary) site is revealed in the SP-A/Sm3+ complex. Samarium ions, which provided MAD phasing for the SP-A crystal structure, occupy both the primary site and an auxiliary site 8.5 Å away (Fig. 4A). The primary and auxiliary sites in SP-A are situated on opposite sides of the highly flexible 198–203 loop. The location and architecture of the SP-A auxiliary site differs from those observed in SP-D and MBP, which are homologous with each other but are not conserved in SP-A (Fig. 4B). The crystallographic occupancy of the “auxiliary” Sm3+ ion is approximately half that of the “primary” Sm3+ ion, and its coordination shell contains fewer ligands. The lanthanide is bound by the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Lys-201 and in a bidentate manner by the Glu-171 carboxylate moiety. The oxygen-Sm3+ bond lengths are all between 2.66–2.75 Å. It is conceivable that under ionic conditions more favorable for metal ion binding, additional oxygen ligands from neighboring residues could be recruited for metal ion coordination. The flexible 198–203 loop surrounds this auxiliary site, and a conformational change could bring the backbone oxygens of Gly-198, Gly-200, or Glu-202 into closer proximity to the metal ion. The SP-A complexes with either calcium or samarium indicate that the primary site is filled before the auxiliary site, whereas the reverse is true of MBP (39Ng K.K. Kolatkar A.R. Park-Snyder S. Feinberg H. Clark D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16088-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Metal ion binding in the SP-A auxiliary site affords some stabilization of the conformation of the flexible 198–203 loop. This stabilization in turn affects the primary metal binding site. The major difference between the calcium and samarium complexes at the primary site involves Glu-202. If metal ion is not bound at the auxiliary site, as in the SP-A complex with calcium, the Glu-202 side-chain position is not close enough to coordinate the primary metal ion. In contrast, in the SP-A complex with samarium, where both metal binding sites are occupied, the Glu-202 side chain can be clearly identified as one of the samarium-coordinating ligands. The finding that alanine substitution of Glu-202 blocks binding to calcium, phospholipid, and carbohydrate ligands is consistent with an important ligand-binding role for this residue (40McCormack F.X. Stewart J.J. Voelker D.R. Damodarasamy M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41McCormack F.X. Festa A.L. Andrews R.P. Linke M. Walzer P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8092-8099Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and suggests that the fully functional state contains calcium bound at both sites. Solution binding studies have suggested that SP-A contains an additional calcium-binding site outside the CRD (42Haagsman H.P. Sargeant T. Hauschka P. Benson B.J. Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data suggest that a potential location for this site is a distinctive anionic patch in the neck region. The patch is composed of Asp-84, Glu-85, and Glu-86, invariant residues in mammalian SP-A sequences that are not conserved in SP-D or MBP. These acidic residues are not involved in intra- or intermolecular contacts, suggesting they may play a more specialized role in SP-A function. Neither calcium nor lanthanide is observed crystallographically to bind at this location; however, it is possible that further oligomerization or macromolecular ligand binding may be required to complete a functional calcium-binding site at this location. Lipid Binding by SP-A—Mutagenesis studies have revealed that the phospholipid binding domain of SP-A overlaps with the carbohydrate binding domain (40McCormack F.X. Stewart J.J. Voelker D.R. Damodarasamy M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 43Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Findings that SP-A discriminates between saturated and unsaturated acyl chains and exhibits specificity for the choline head group (26Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) imply that discrete binding sites exist for these moieties on the SP-A molecule. Surface electrostatics calculations (Fig. 5) of SP-A and SP-D show that, as might be expected, calcium binding neutralizes some of the negative charge observed in the protein surfaces when calcium is omitted from the model. However, when calcium is included in the model, the SP-A CRD surface is considerably less polar than that of SP-D. This distinction may be consistent with the preference of SP-A for hydrophobic ligands. In considering possible epitopes on SP-A for phospholipid binding, it is useful to note that many of the short stretches of highly variable sequence (Fig. 1) that distinguish the collectins from each other occur on one face of the CRD surface, proximal to the C-lectin binding site. One such sequence is Y-N-N-Y (residues 161–164). The Tyr-161 ring, together with those of Tyr-164, Tyr-208, and Tyr-192, form a strip of aromatic rings across the CRD surface (Fig. 6) that could serve as a binding site for lipid acyl chains. None of these four residues is conserved in SP-D or MPD (Fig. 1A), which lack this extended hydrophobic surface. It is interesting that in the SP-A crystal structure, a MES buffer molecule binds so that its morpholino ring stacks over that of Tyr-164. The zwitterionic MES molecule bears a striking resemblance to phosphocholine in its overall size, shape, and charge (Fig. 6, inset), and MES binding at this location might be indicative of choline binding near Tyr-164. However, this suggestion remains speculative until structural information can be obtained from SP-A lipid complexes. Further evidence supporting a role for this hydrophobic strip in SP-A/lipid interactions is provided by the crystal structure of the bacterial outer membrane protein, FhuA, bound to lipopolysaccharide (46Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code 1PFC). In this complex, the acyl chains of the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide bind noncovalently to the FhuA surface via a very similar aromatic region composed of four phenylalanine side chains (analogous to Tyr-161, Tyr-164, Tyr-208, and Tyr-192 in SP-A). As in SP-A, the aromatic residues in FhuA belong to discontinuous β-sheet structure forming the floor of the lipid A-binding surface. Numerous electrostatic interactions are formed between the phosphorylated glucosamine and other polar moieties of lipid A and basic or amine side chains on FhuA (47Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Structure. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These include a cluster composed of two arginines and a glutamine (residues 382, 384, and 353, respectively). In SP-A, a similarly situated cluster is created by the side chains of Arg-216, Arg-222, and Gln-220, and additional basic residues are present in the vicinity. Although these similarities do not presuppose any evolutionary relationship between the two proteins, they point to possible regions on SP-A that could mediate high affinity binding of the common substrate, lipid A. We thank Linda Brinen, Sam Hawgood, and Mathew Caughron for their contributions in the earliest stages of this project and Sarah Head for assistance with the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1965202946,"Phagocyte NADPH oxidase is critical for defense against pathogens and contributes to inflammatory tissue injury. One component of the NADPH oxidase complex is the small GTP-binding protein Rac. There are two isoforms of Rac, and Rac2 is the predominant isoform in neutrophils and has been shown to be essential for NADPH oxidase activity. In primary human monocytes we report that in contrast to neutrophils, Rac1 is the predominantly expressed isoform. Upon monocyte activation by a variety of agents, we found that Rac1 dissociates from Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) and translocates to the membrane. We also found that Rac1 interacts with two other NADPH oxidase components, p67phox and p47phox, upon monocyte activation. These data indicate that Rac1, and not Rac2, is a component of the activated NADPH oxidase in monocytes. This finding suggests that it may be possible to selectively interfere with either monocyte or neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity, thereby selectively targeting chronic versus acute inflammatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2006365527,"DNA is damaged in vivo by the Fenton reaction mediated by Fe2+ and cellular reductants such as NADH, which reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and allow the recycling of iron. To study the response of Escherichia coli to such cycling, the activities of several enzymes involved in nicotinamide nucleotide metabolism were measured following an H2O2 challenge. NADPH-dependent peroxidase, NADH/NADP+ transhydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were most strongly induced, increasing 2.5-3-fold. In addition, the cellular ratios of NADPH to NADH increased 6- or 92-fold 15 min after exposure to 0.5 or 5 mm H2O2, respectively. In vitro, NADH was oxidized by Fe3+ up to 16-fold faster than NADPH, despite their identical reduction potentials. To understand this rate difference, the interactions of Fe3+ and Ga3+ with NAD(P)H were examined by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Association with NADH occurred primarily with adenine at N7 and the amino group, but for NADPH, strong metal interactions also occurred at the 2′-phosphate group. Interaction of M3+ (Fe3+ or Ga3+) with the adenine ring would bring it into close proximity to the redox-active nicotinamide ring in the folded form of NAD(P)H, but interaction of M3+ with the 2′-phosphate group would avoid this close contact. In addition, as determined by absorbance spectroscopy, the energy of the charge-transfer species was significantly higher for the Fe3+·NADPH complex than for the Fe3+·NADH complex. We therefore suggest that upon exposure to H2O2 the NADH pool is depleted, and NADPH, which is less reactive with Fe3+, functions as the major nicotinamide nucleotide reductant.

The utilization of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for aerobic respiration results in exposure to toxic reactive oxygen species that arise as incompletely reduced byproducts of respiratory electron transport (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar) or as side products of enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, NADH/NADPH oxidase, monooxygenases, and cyclooxygenases (2Fridovich I.

In addition, environmental agents such as ionizing or near-UV radiation (4Tyrrell R.M. Pidoux M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and chemicals such as paraquat, plumbagin, and menadione can generate O2˙- and H2O2 in the cell (5Prieto-Alamo M.J. Abril N. Puyeo C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species cause damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids and are implicated in a variety of human pathologies including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arteriosclerosis, and aging (6Barja G. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Halliwell B. Drugs Aging. 2001; 18: 635-716Crossref Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 8Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M.

These complex kinetics are also observed for DNA damage in vitro. This toxicity is attributable to DNA damage by reactive oxygen species generated via the Fenton reaction (10Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). H2O2+Fe2++H+→Fe3++[ -OH]+H2O Reaction 1REACTION 1 The hydroxyl radical is an extremely powerful oxidant that reacts with most organic substrates at nearly diffusion-limited rates (11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). Studies of oxidative DNA damage by the Fenton reaction have indicated that the species [ -OH] is not free hydroxyl radical, but is likely stabilized by coordination to the DNA-bound iron (12Qian S.Y. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Lloyd R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).To continue DNA damage, a reductant must be present in vivo to regenerate Fe2+ from Fe3+. Genetic studies suggested that NADH might act as this reductant, and biochemical studies showed that NADH could drive DNA damage by iron and peroxide in vivo (10Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 14Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The level of NAD(H) drops severely in glucose-starved E. coli cells, and these cells are remarkably resistant to H2O2 (14Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Alternatively, raising the NADH level in vivo by eliminating or negatively regulating NADH dehydrogenase activity either genetically or chemically by inhibiting electron transport with KCN, dramatically sensitizes E. coli to killing by H2O2. KCN does not further enhance the sensitivity of an NADH dehydrogenase mutant to H2O2 (14Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Acceleration of DNA damage in isolated nuclei also increases dramatically in the presence of NAD(P)H and Fe3+ bound to EDTA or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (15Peskin A.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).NADPH is an essential cofactor for the catalytic activities of glutathione peroxidase (16Sinha B.K. Mimnaugh E.G. Rajagopalan S.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, the majority of NADPH in mammalian cells is bound to catalase, which it reactivates after the enzyme is inactivated by H2O2 (18Kirkman H.N. Gaetani G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4343-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 20Hillar A. Nicholls P. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It might be expected that, besides NAD(P)H, glutathione could facilitate redox cycling for the Fenton reaction. However, glutathione synthase and glutathione reductase mutants exhibit normal sensitivity to Mode I killing (21Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As a result of the induction of the soxRS regulon under oxidative stress, the expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 1The abbreviations used are: G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; M3+, Fe3+ or Ga3+; NMNH, nicotinamide mononucleotide, reduced form.1The abbreviations used are: G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; M3+, Fe3+ or Ga3+; NMNH, nicotinamide mononucleotide, reduced form. increases, resulting in the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH and making these cells resistant to oxidants (23Demple B.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although it was initially believed that reduced glutathione was responsible for the antioxidant effects of the soxRS response, it was shown that the redox state of NADPH, not glutathione, modulates oxidative sensitivity (25Scott M.D. Zuo L. Lubin B.H. Chiu D.T.-Y. Blood. 1991; 77: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antioxidant role of G6PD was substantiated further by observations that disruption of the gene encoding G6PD in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in greatly enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stresses (26Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and that Saccharomyces cerevisiae G6PD null mutants also are sensitive and unable to adapt to hydrogen peroxide (27Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

The introduction of an intracellular NADPH-generating system restored substantial oxidative stress resistance to the G6PD-deficient yeast (25Scott M.D. Zuo L. Lubin B.H. Chiu D.T.-Y. Blood. 1991; 77: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sum, NADPH is clearly important for protection against oxidative stress (26Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar).To understand better the role of NADPH in resistance to oxidative stress, the effects of H2O2 on the activities of several enzymes involved in the synthesis and utilization of NAD(P)H and changes in the nicotinamide nucleotide pools have been monitored following exposure of E. coli to H2O2. In addition, the relative abilities of NADH and NADPH to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, as well as the nature of Fe3+ interactions with NAD(P)H, were studied.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Buffers, and Reagents—E. coli strains AB1157 (F-thr-1 leuB proA2 his-4 thi-1 argE2 lacY1 galK2 rpsL supE) and UM1 (LacY rpsL thi-1 katE1 katG14) were grown with vigorous shaking in K medium (1% glucose, 1% casamino acids, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and M9 salts) unless otherwise noted. Water was double distilled before use. H2O2 (30%) was from Fisher Scientific, NADH (disodium salt), NADPH (tetrasodium salt), and NMNH (disodium salt) were from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Solutions of Fe3+ and Ga3+ salts were freshly prepared prior to use and stored at pH 2.5. Elemental analyses were performed by Desert Analytics (Tucson, AZ).Spectroscopic Measurements—1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer at 500, 125, and 202 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts for 1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} NMR spectra are reported in ppm (δ) relative to SiMe4 and 40% H3PO4, respectively. Absorbance spectra for NAD(P)H were acquired on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer with a diode array detector or a Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer. Kinetics measurements of NAD(P)H oxidation utilized the Cary spectrophotometer.Chromatography—Nicotinamide nucleotides were resolved on a PerkinElmer 250 HPLC apparatus equipped with a guard column and a Jordi reverse phase C18-DVB column (250-mm length × 4.6-mm inner diameter). The mobile phase was 98% 25 mm tributylammonium bicarbonate, pH 10, 2% acetonitrile (eluent A) and 80% acetonitrile, 20% water (eluent B). A gradient program was initially set to 100% eluent A, increasing over 20 min to 65% eluent A and 35% eluent B, then finally increasing over 40 min to 50% each of eluents A and B. Absorbances of the nucleotides were monitored at 327 nm with a diode array detector.Enzyme Assays—E. coli cells in K medium were challenged with 50 μm H2O2 at a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml. After 15 min at 37 °C, the bacteria were chilled, washed, and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the suspensions were sonicated four times for 15 s and then cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).NAD+ kinase activity was assayed by a procedure similar to that of Zercz et al. (30Zercz C.R. Moul D.E. Gomez E.G. Lopez V.M. Andreoli A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 184-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but [32P]NAD+ was the substrate, and NADP+ was monitored by radioactivity after isolation with thin layer chromatography on silica plates with ethanol and 1 m ammonium acetate (1:1) as solvent. G6PD and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities were assayed according to the protocols described in the Worthington Manual (31Worthington C.C. Worthington Manual: Enzymes and Related Biochemicals. Worthington Biochemical Company, Freehold, NJ1988Google Scholar). The assay of NADH transhydrogenase activity was based on the method of Zercz et al. (30Zercz C.R. Moul D.E. Gomez E.G. Lopez V.M. Andreoli A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 184-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase and NAD(P)H oxidases were assayed as described by Cavari et al. (32Cavari B.Z. Avi-Dor Y. Grossowicz N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 751-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NAD(P)H-dependent peroxidases were partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography and assayed following the method of Coves et al. (33Coves J. Eschenbrenner M. Fontecave M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out under aerobic conditions and in the presence of an NADH-generating system. The activity was determined from the appearance of absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. NAD+ pyrophosphatase activity was determined as described previously (34Kornberg A. Pricer W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 182: 763-778Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The assay of DNA ligase activity was based on the method of Olivera et al. (35Olivera B.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1700-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and NAD+ glycohydrolase assays were based on the method of Barbieri et al. (36Barbieri J.T. Moloney B.K. Mendo-Mueller L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4362-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of E. coli Nicotinamide Nucleotide Pools—Intracellular NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+ concentrations were determined by a modification of the method of Klaidman et al. (37Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). E. coli AB1157 was grown in 50 ml of K medium plus 1 μg/ml thiamine at 37 °C to an A 600 of ∼0.5, and then H2O2 was added to the culture medium, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Anaerobic cultures were grown with bubbling 95% N2 and 5% CO2 prior to and after the addition of H2O2. After H2O2 challenge, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 m KCN, 0.3 n KOH, 5 mm EDTA and then mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm tributylammonium bicarbonate, pH 10, to give a final volume of ∼2.5 ml. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and analyzed by HPLC. Amounts of nicotinamide nucleotides were determined by measuring areas of the HPLC peak traces at 327 nm and comparing these with standard 3-nmol samples of each of the nicotinamide nucleotides run under identical conditions. Sample traces are given in the supplementary data (Fig. S1). Cellular concentrations were calculated assuming that an A 600 = 1.0 corresponds to 109 cells/ml and that the volume of a cell is 10-12 ml (38Norland S. Hedal M. Tumyr O. Microb. Ecol. 1987; 13: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Metal Titrations of NADH and Its Analogs Monitored by NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra of freshly prepared 0.5-ml solutions of NAD(P)H, NMNH, or ADP-ribose between 10 and 100 mm in D2O, pD ∼ 7.5, were acquired after incremental addition of FeCl3·6 H2O or Ga(NO3)3 in D2O as indicated. Addition of DCl at pH 2.5 to a D2O solution of NADPH in the same amounts as those added for Fe3+ or Ga3+ resulted in no significant shifting of the NMR resonances. Spectra were acquired within 30 min of the addition of Fe3+. Percent broadening of NMR resonances upon addition of Fe3+ was calculated using Equation 1. &x0025;broadening=100×(1-(peakheightwithFe3+)/(initialpeakheight))(Eq. 1) A broadening of 100% indicates that no resonance was visible. K d values and fractional occupancy of Ga3+ were determined as described previously (39Rai P. Cole T.D. Wemmer D.E. Linn S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Percentages of NAD(P)H in linear and folded forms were calculated as described by Oppenheimer et al. (40Oppenheimer N.J. Arnold Jr., L.J. Kaplan N.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Elemental Analyses of Ga 3+ /NAD(P)H Precipitates—20 mg of NAD(P)H was dissolved in 0.4 ml of H2O, and 1 eq of Ga(NO3)3 in 7.5 μl was added. A white precipitate formed immediately for the NADH sample, but an additional 1 eq of Ga(NO3)3 was added to the NADPH sample to obtain sufficient precipitate for analysis. Both samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitates were washed three times by centrifugation with 1 ml of water and dried under vacuum.For the NADH sample, the best fit formula was Na[(NADH)Ga2(OH)5]·3H2OCalculated:x0026;C26.1&x0025;H3.97&x0025;N10.2&x0025;Ga14.5&x0025;Found:x0026;C26.7&x0025;H3.87&x0025;N10.1&x0025;Ga13.7&x0025;For the NADH sample, the best fit formula was Na0.7[(NADH)Ga2.3(OH)3.6]·4H2OCalculated:x0026;C24.0&x0025;H3.61&x0025;N9.33&x0025;Ga15.3&x0025;Found:x0026;C23.4&x0025;H3.40&x0025;N8.90&x0025;Ga15.7&x0025;Metal Titrations of NAD(P)H Monitored by Absorbance Spectroscopy—Absorbance spectra of freshly prepared solutions of NAD(P)H were acquired after incremental addition of Fe(NO3)3 to 50 or 500 μm solutions of NAD(P)H, or Ga(NO3)3 to 66 μm solutions of NADPH. All spectra were acquired within 30 min of the addition of M3+.Kinetic Measurements of NAD(P)H Oxidation—Freshly prepared solutions of 16 μm NAD(P)H were brought to 100 mm ethanol, 1.25 μm H2O2, and/or 80 μm FeCl3 as indicated. A 340 was measured at 25 °C every 0.2 s for 7 min and corrected with appropriate blanks. Best fit lines were calculated from the initial rates. For anaerobic measurements, the water used to prepare the samples was degassed with argon for 3 h prior to use, and the samples were prepared and sealed under an argon atmosphere. The initial rates were very dependent on concentration, so care was taken to use the same solutions and order of addition of reactants for both the NADH and NADPH trials.Molecular Modeling—Molecular models for Fe3+ binding to NADPH were constructed using Spartan 02 (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA). The NADPH conformation was obtained from the most probable folded conformation as predicted by NMR spectroscopy (41Oppenheimer N.J. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Vol. A. John Wiley and Sons, New, York1987: 185-230Google Scholar): 4′-5′-gg and 5′-O-gg rotamers for both the adenyl and reduced nicotinamide ribose units, 2′-endo conformation for the nicotinamide ribose, and 3′-endo conformation for the adenine ribose. To ensure that the molecule remained in the folded conformation, the distance between the adenine and reduced nicotinamide rings was restrained to 3.6 Å. This NADPH conformation was energy minimized using MMFF94 force field calculations (42Kong J. White C.A. Krylov A.I. Sherrill D. Adamson R.D. Furlani T.R. Lee M.S. Lee A.M. Gwaltney S.R. Adams T.R.

Cryst. 2000; 30: 61-63Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to the adenine N7. Because of steric hindrance resulting from the close contacts between the adenine N7-bound Fe3+ and the adenine amino group, a bond between the Fe3+ and the amino group was included and restrained to a distance of 2.3 Å.RESULTSNicotinamide Nucleotide Enzyme Levels after H 2 O 2 Challenge of E. coli—Because of a possible involvement of NAD(P)H in mediating H2O2 toxicity, the activities of several enzymes involved in nicotinamide nucleotide metabolism (Table I) were measured before and after challenge with H2O2 (Table II). In consideration of the existence of the “early” H2O2 induction of proteins, the activities of which are induced during the first 10-18 min but return to normal within 30 min after the addition of hydrogen peroxide (44Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the activities were measured 15 min after challenge of catalase-deficient cells with 50 μm H2O2. Catalase is the major enzyme for removing hydrogen peroxide, but catalase-deficient mutants are not more sensitive to killing by H2O2 than are wild type cells (22Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, catalase mutants were used in this study to elucidate other defense systems against hydrogen peroxide. E. coli G6PD, which specifically reduces NADP+, is one of the major sources of cellular NADPH. Upon H2O2 challenge, the activity of G6PD was induced by about 2.9-fold (Table II). Meanwhile, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which also reduces NADP+, was not induced.Table IEnzymatic activities assayedEnzymes that synthesize NADPHGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenased-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP+ → NADPH + d-glucono-δ-lactone 6-phosphateIsocitrate dehydrogenaseIsocitrate + NADP+ → α-ketoglutarate + NADPHNADH/NADP+ transhydrogenaseRespiration-dependentNADH + NADP+ + energy produced by respiration → NAD+ + NADPHATP-dependentNADH + NADP+ + ATP → NAD+ + NADPH + ADP + PiEnzymes that oxidize NAD(P)HIn the respiratory chainNADH dehydrogenaseNADH + ubiquinone → NAD+ + ubiquinolIn the peroxidase reactionNAD(P)H-dependent peroxidasesNAD(P)H + 2 H2O2 → NAD(P)+ + 2 H2O + O2NAD(P)H oxidaseNAD(P)H + O2 + H+ → NAD(P)+ + H2O2Enzymes that deplete NAD+NAD+ glycohydrolaseNAD+ → nicotinamide + ADP-riboseNAD+ pyrophosphataseNAD+ → NMN + AMPDNA ligaseNAD+ → NMN + AMPNAD+ kinaseNAD+ + ATP → NADP+ + ADP Open table in a new tab Table IIChanges in enzymatic activities after H2O2 challengeEnzymePercentage activity 15 Min after challenge%Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.286 ± 28Isocitrate dehydrogenase100 ± 4NADH/NADP+ transhydrogenaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.Respiration-dependent280 ± 16ATP-dependent99 ± 7NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquitin-dependent)aAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.94 ± 8PeroxidaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.NADH-dependent (195 units/mg)138 ± 10NADPH-dependent (46 units/mg)248 ± 29NAD(P)H oxidaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.NADH (240 units/mg)140 ± 13NADPH (39 units/mg)145 ± 7NAD+ glycohydrolaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.93 ± 3NAD+ pyrophophatase98 ± 7DNA ligaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.102 ± 18NAD+ kinaseaAssays were performed using catalase-deficient cells.99 ± 8a Assays were performed using catalase-deficient cells. Open table in a new tab NADH/NADP+ transhydrogenases reversibly transfer a hydrogen atom between NADH and NADP+ (Table I). Upon membrane energization either by respiration or by ATP hydrolysis, the rate of reduction of NADP+ by NADH is increased severalfold, and the equilibrium constant for the reaction increased from 0.79 for the non-energy-dependent reaction to 480 (45Lee C.-P. Ernster L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 81: 187-190Google Scholar). Presumably the physiological function of these transhydrogenases is to provide NADPH for biosynthesis and detoxification (46Bragg P.D. Davies P.L. Hou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 47: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate whether either of these energy-linked transhydrogenase activities is increased upon hydrogen peroxide exposure, they were assayed in catalase-deficient E. coli cells after exposure to 50 μm H2O2 for 15 min (Table II). The assays included an NADH-regenerating system. The respiration-driven transhydrogenase activity was increased almost 3-fold, but the ATP-dependent transhydrogenase activity showed no increase. Likewise, no induction of NADH dehydrogenase activity was observed.In addition to alkylhydroperoxidase (19McKie J.H. Douglas K.T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and o-dianisidine peroxidase (47Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli contains an NADH-dependent peroxidase (33Coves J. Eschenbrenner M. Fontecave M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although the former enzymes do not utilize H2O2 as substrate, the latter one does. The NADH-dependent peroxidase activity was elevated by only 38% after exposure to peroxide. However, NADPH-dependent peroxidase activity increased by 248% upon H2O2 challenge. NADH and NADPH oxidase activities were induced to only 140% of normal activity.The turnover of NAD+ is very rapid in the cell, and it is 4-fold faster under aerobic conditions than anaerobic conditions (48Park U.E. Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Hillyard D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2173-2180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in mammalian cells, DNA breaks caused by oxidative stresses can deplete NAD+ via the NAD+ glycohydrolase activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, whereas in E. coli, DNA ligase hydrolyzes NAD+. Thus, it was proposed that the turnover of NAD+ might have important functions under conditions of oxidative stress (48Park U.E. Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Hillyard D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2173-2180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three enzymatic activities initiate NAD+ turnover in E. coli: NAD+ glycohydrolase, NAD+ pyrophosphatase, and DNA ligase. However, none of the activities of these enzymes changed after hydrogen peroxide exposure (Table II). Finally, NAD+ kinase activity was unchanged. In conclusion, the changes in the enzyme activities indicate that H2O2 is depleted by NADPH-dependent peroxidases in the absence of catalase and predict that cellular NADPH levels might be increased relative to those of NADH.Measurement of Nicotinamide Nucleotide Pools in E. coli—The determination of nicotinamide nucleotide pools is complex because of the sensitivity of NAD(P)H to degradation or oxidation during isolation. Lundquist and Olivera (49Lundquist R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) estimated the concentrations of NAD(P)+ in E. coli but did not include the reduced nicotinamide nucleotides. Bochner and Ames (50Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used an acid extraction procedure for purification of the nicotinamide nucleotides which probably resulted in oxidation of NAD(P)H prior to quantitation. Therefore, we modified the method used for brain cells by Klaidman et al. (37Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to measure the effect of oxidative stress upon the free pools"
https://openalex.org/W2029030025,"MEKK2 and MEKK3 are MAPK kinase kinases that activate the ERK5 pathway by phosphorylating and activating the MAPK kinase, MEK5. Activated MEK5 then phosphorylates and activates ERK5. PB1 domains were first defined in the p67 phox and Bem1p proteins and have been shown to mediate protein-protein heterodimerization. A PB1 domain is encoded within the N-terminal portion of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5. Herein, we analyze the functional role of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5 PB1 domains in the ERK5 activation pathway. The PB1 domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3 bind the PB1 domain of MEK5 but do not significantly homo- or heterodimerize with one another in vitro. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of MEKK2 and MEK5 from cell lysates shows that they form a complex in vivo. Deletion or mutation of the MEKK2 PB1 domain abolishes MEKK2-MEK5 complexes, demonstrating that the PB1 domain interaction is required for MEKK2-MEK5 interactions. Expression in cells of the MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain inhibits ERK5 activation, whereas expression of a mutant MEKK2 unable to bind the MEK5 PB1 domain or expression of the p67 phox PB1 domain has no effect on ERK5 activation. These findings demonstrate that the PB1 domain mediates the association of MEKK2 and MEKK3 with MEK5 and that the respective PB1 domains of these kinases are critical for regulation of the ERK5 pathway. The free PB1 domain of MEKK2 or MEKK3 functions effectively to inhibit the ERK5 pathway but not the p38 or JNK pathways, demonstrating the specific and unique requirement of the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domain in regulating ERK5 activation.

The PB1 domain is found in proteins of yeast, plants, and metazoans. The PB1 domain was first identified in p67 phox , which is involved in activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase (2Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H.

Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Within the sequence of most PB1 domains is encoded the PC motif (phox and Cdc motif) (5Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), also called OPR (octicosapeptide repeat motif) (6Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), or AID (atypical PKC interaction motif) (7Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which has been recently renamed the OPCA (OPR/PC/AID) motif (1Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). OPCA motifs are encoded in the C-terminal region of most PB1 domains. PB1 domains have been shown to heterodimerize using a β grasp topology in a “front-to-back” arrangement (8Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Acidic clusters of amino acids in the OPCA motif interact electrostatically with basic clusters in the PB1 domain. Of the mouse and human PB1 domain-encoding proteins, five are serine-threonine kinases: MEKK2, MEKK3, MEK5, and two atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) enzymes, PKCλ and PKCζ. MEK5 is the MAPK kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK5 in response to growth factors, oxidative stress, and hyperosmotic conditions (9Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using yeast two-hybrid analysis had shown that the N terminus of MEKK2 is required for its binding to MEK5 (15Sun W. Kesavan K. Schaefer B.C. Garrington T.P. Ware M. Johnson N.L. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The PB1 domain of MEKK2 is encoded within the N terminus of MEKK2, suggesting that the PB1 domain contributes to MEKK2 interaction with MEK5. Therefore, we hypothesized that the PB1 domains were involved in the interaction of MEKK2 and MEKK3 with MEK5. Herein, we demonstrate that the PB1 domain of MEKK2 or MEKK3 specifically interacts with the PB1 domain of MEK5. Furthermore, expression of the MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain in cells inhibits ERK5 activation. Taken together, our findings show that the PB1 domain confers specificity in the interaction of MEKK2 and MEKK3 with MEK5 and that an isolated MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain behaves as an inhibitor of the ERK5 pathway. Cell Culture and Reagents—Wild type and MEKK2–/–mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated as described previously (18Garrington T.P. Ishizuka T. Papst P.J. Chayama K. Webb S. Yujiri T. Sun W. Sather S. Russell D.M. Gibson S.B. Keller G. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5387-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—The cDNAs for the conserved PB1 domains of MEKK2 (amino acids (aa) 35–127), MEKK3 (aa 36–128), MEK5 (aa 10–102), and p67 phox (aa 342–433) were amplified using PCR and ligated into pGEX, pRSET, and pMSCVpuro vectors. For the pMSCV-puro constructs, a FLAG tag was inserted upstream of the PB1 domain coding sequence. For the MEKK2 PB1 domain mutation constructs, amino acid residue lysine (Lys) 47 was replaced by alanine (Ala) using a site directed mutagenesis. Wild type, Lys to Ala mutant (K-A MEKK2), and PB1 domain deleted MEKK2 (ΔPB1 MEKK2) (aa 123–619) were subcloned into the pMSCVpuro vector. FLAG-MEK5, HA-MEKK2, and HA-MEKK3 constructs were described previously (15Sun W. Kesavan K. Schaefer B.C. Garrington T.P. Ware M. Johnson N.L. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Generation of Cell Lines Expressing FLAG-PB1 Domains and MEKK2 Proteins—Phoenix cells were used as packaging cells for the retroviral gene transfer system (19Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pMSCVpuro vectors were transfected into Phoenix cells using Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the supernatants were collected and diluted with the same volume of fresh complete IMDM, and polybrene was added to the infection medium at 8 μg/ml. The infection mixtures were added to MEF cultures seeded on 6-cm dishes, incubated overnight, and then replaced with fresh complete IMDM containing 50 μg/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant cells were isolated and propagated for use in the experiments. PB1 Domains of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5—Previously, we demonstrated in a yeast two-hybrid screening that the N terminus of MEKK2 encoding amino acids 1–188 bound to MEK5 (15Sun W. Kesavan K.

Furthermore, truncation of the first 125 amino acids of MEKK2 resulted in loss of MEK5 binding. The PB1 domain of MEKK2 is encoded within amino acids 43–122, consistent with this region of MEKK2 being important for the interaction between MEKK2 and MEK5. Fig. 1A shows the sequence alignment of the MEKK2, MEKK3, MEK5, p67 phox PB1 domains compared with yeast Bem1p PB1 sequence. Although the PB1 domain structure is highly similar to the Ras binding domain of c-Raf1 (4Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), PB1 domains have not been found to bind Ras proteins. PB1 dimers have recently been described as having a β grasp topology with a front-to-back binding arrangement (8Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The OPCA motif is a conserved sequence in the C-terminal moiety of the PB1 domain (1Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that MEKK2 and MEKK3 have rather weak consensus OPCA motifs. Acidic clusters of amino acids in the OPCA motif of one PB1 domain bind to basic amino acids including the conserved Lys residue in the N-terminal moiety of a different PB1 domain. Mutation of the conserved Lys residue in Bem1p and p67 phox was shown to completely disrupt its binding to Cdc24p and p40 phox , respectively (2Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The defined function of PB1 domains appears to compose heterodimerization of the cognate proteins. To characterize the properties of the MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5 PB1 domains, we expressed each PB1 domain as a GST-fusion and His/Xpress-tagged recombinant protein (Fig. 1, B–D). The p67 phox PB1 domain was also expressed as a control for binding studies presented below. In addition, to see the role of the conserved Lys residue, a MEKK2 PB1 domain construct having Ala substituted for Lys47 was also prepared. The recombinant PB1 domain proteins were then used to define their ability to form hetero- or homodimeric complexes using pull-down assays and immunoblotting (Fig. 1, B and C). The MEKK2 PB1 domain bound MEK5. However, the association seemed less stable when the MEKK2 PB1 domain was expressed as a His/Xpress-tagged protein and MEK5 PB1 domain as a GST fusion than the reciprocal expression of the fusion proteins (compare Fig. 1, B and C). The reason for this difference is unclear but may be related to some differential interfering effect of GST and His/Express tag portions on PB1 domain function. Importantly, the K-A MEKK2 mutant PB1 domain or the p67 phox PB1 domain did not bind to MEK5. The MEKK3 PB1 domain also bound the MEK5 but not the p67 phox or MEKK2 PB1 domain. Cumulatively, these findings indicate a selective interaction of the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domains with the MEK5 PB1 domain. Pull-down of MEK5 from Lysates of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts— Fig. 2A shows that the PB1 domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3 bind to endogenous MEK5 from lysates of wild type MEFs. The p67 phox , K-A MEKK2 mutant, and MEK5 PB1 domains failed to bind and pull-down MEK5 from MEF lysates. To verify the binding of endogenous MEK5 to MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domain, a FLAG-tagged MEK5 was expressed in MEFs (Fig. 2B). Similar to endogenous MEK5, expressed MEK5 could be selectively pulled down by the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domains but not the p67 phox , K-A MEKK2 mutant, or MEK5 PB1 domain. Similarly when MEKK2 or MEKK3 were expressed in cells, the MEK5 PB1 domain was able to pull down MEKK2 (Fig. 2C) and MEKK3 (Fig. 2D). These data clearly demonstrate that in mammalian cells the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domains selectively bind to MEK5 and vice versa, the MEK5 PB1 domain selectively binds MEKK2 and MEKK3. The PB1 domains do not appear to significantly bind to themselves (homodimeric interactions). The modest pull-down of HA-MEKK3 with the MEKK3/MEKK2 PB1 domains in Fig. 2D may suggest that an in vivo complex of MEK5 and MEKK3/MEKK2 proteins exists in cells, since bacterially expressed, recombinant MEKK3 PB1 domain did not bind itself, MEKK2, or p67 phox PB1 domains (Fig. 1). MEKK2 PB1 Domain Is Required for Co-immunoprecipitation of MEKK2 and MEK5—MEKK2–/–MEFs (18Garrington T.P. Ishizuka T. Papst P.J. Chayama K. Webb S. Yujiri T. Sun W. Sather S. Russell D.M. Gibson S.B. Keller G. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5387-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were used to add back wild type MEKK2, K47A mutated MEKK2 (K-A MEKK2), or a MEKK2 protein whose PB1 domain had been deleted (ΔPB1 MEKK2). A MEKK2 monoclonal antibody was then used to immunoprecipitate the different MEKK2 proteins. Fig. 3 shows that only the wild type MEKK2 protein was capable of constitutively associating with MEK5 for co-immunoprecipitation. Neither the K-A mutant that disrupts PB1 domain binding nor the ΔPB1 MEKK2 protein bound MEK5. These findings indicate that the MEKK2 PB1 domain is required for stable association of MEKK2 and MEK5. MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 Domains Bind MEK5 in Vivo and Inhibit ERK5 Activity—To examine the functional consequence of expressing the free PB1 domains of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5 on the ERK5 signaling pathway, FLAG-tagged MEKK2, K-A MEKK2, MEKK3, and p67 phox PB1 domains were expressed in MEFs. Unfortunately, we were unable to express the FLAG-tagged MEK5 PB1 domain in MEFs (data not shown). The MEKK2, K-A MEKK2, MEKK3, and p67 phox FLAG-tagged proteins were efficiently expressed in MEFs. FLAG-MEKK2 and FLAG-MEKK3 PB1 domains bound endogenous MEK5 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, neither the mutant K-A MEKK2 nor p67 phox PB1 domain interacted with MEK5 (Fig. 4A). Total cell lysates prepared from the different FLAG-PB1 domain expressing cells were used to measure ERK5 activity. The level of ERK5 activity was assessed by a mobility shift of the ERK5 band in the gels (Fig. 4B). The slower migrating band of the ERK5 doublet has been shown to be caused by ERK5 phosphorylation that correlates with its activation (16Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Chayama K. Papst P.J. Garrington T.P. Pratt J.C. Ishizuka T. Webb S. Ganiatsas S. Zon L.I. Sun W.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10% serum, ERK5 activation was readily observed in MEFs. Neither FLAG-K-A MEKK2 nor FLAG-p67 phox PB1 domain showed any inhibitory activity toward the ERK5 mobility shift. In contrast, both FLAG-MEKK2 and FLAG-MEKK3 PB1 domains completely blocked ERK5 activation. FLAG-MEKK2 and FLAG-K-A MEKK2 PB1 domain expressing cells were further analyzed with sorbitol stimulation, a hyperosmotic stress that activates ERK5 in a MEKK2-dependent manner (14Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T.P. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S.M. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Sorbitol induced an ERK5 mobility shift in control and FLAG-p67 phox PB1 domain expressing MEFs. This mobility shift was abolished by expression of a FLAG-MEKK2 PB1 domain, but not by expression of the FLAG-K-A MEKK2 PB1 domain. Cumulatively, these data indicate that an expressed MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain binds to endogenous MEK5 and induces a refractory state of the MEKK2 or MEKK3/MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway so that ERK5 is not activated. Importantly, sorbitol activation of p38 MAPK or JNK was not inhibited by expression of the MEKK2 PB1 domain (Fig. 4C). Thus, the inhibitory effect of the MEKK2 PB1 domain is specific for the ERK5 pathway. MEKK2 and MEKK3 are unique among the MAPK kinase kinases in their ability to regulate the ERK5 pathway (15Sun W. Kesavan K. Schaefer B.C. Garrington T.P. Ware M. Johnson N.L. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). No other MAPK kinase kinase has been shown to regulate MEK5 and activation of the ERK5 pathway. Interestingly, it has been reported that PKCζ phosphorylates MEK5 and activates the ERK5 pathway (22Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although this result has been recently disputed (17Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our work indicates that the specificity of MEKK2 and MEKK3 regulation of the ERK5 pathway resides in the PB1 domains encoded in the N-terminal region of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5. The PB1 domain of MEKK2 or MEKK3 specifically heterodimerize with the PB1 domain of MEK5. A functional PB1 domain is absolutely necessary for interaction of full-length MEKK2 with endogenous MEK5. Mutation of the conserved Lys residue, which inhibits PB1 domain binding, or deletion of the PB1 domain in MEKK2 abolishes MEKK2 binding to MEK5. Furthermore, a free MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain inhibits ERK5 activation in response to serum or hyperosmotic stress. This result is striking and strongly suggests that the PB1 domain interaction of MEKK2 or MEKK3 with MEK5 is required for MEK5 activation of ERK5. Disruption of the MEKK2 and MEKK3 interaction with MEK5 using the free PB1 domains appears to be sufficient to inhibit the ERK5 pathway. It should be noted that when we overexpressed wild type MEKK2, K-A MEKK2, or ΔPB1 MEKK2, ERK5 became activated (data not shown). This indicates that overexpression of MEKK2 proteins even lacking a functional PB1 domain could still activate the ERK5 pathway, suggesting that the overexpression of these proteins predictably bypasses the need for normal assembly of a regulatory complex. It is clear from our previous studies that MEKK2 expression is required for the activation of the ERK5 pathway by growth factors and oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses (14Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K.

The targeted gene disruption of MEKK2 abolishes ERK5 activation to these stimuli (14Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T.P. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S.M. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and we now demonstrate that the free MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain inhibits endogenous ERK5 activation. Our studies with MEKK2–/–MEFs, where we created a MEKK2 knockout by targeted disruption of the MEKK2 gene, has shown that MEKK2 coordinately regulates the ERK5 and JNK pathways (14Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T.P. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S.M. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). MKK7, the MAPK kinase that regulates JNK, has been characterized to bind to the C-terminal region of MEKK2 (20Chayama K. Papst P.J. Garrington T.P. Pratt J.C. Ishizuka T. Webb S. Ganiatsas S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas MEK5 binds to the N-terminal PB1 domain of MEKK2. Thus, the MAPK kinases for the JNK and ERK5 pathways bind different regions of MEKK2. Loss of MEKK2 expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts results in loss of ERK5 activation in response to growth factors such as FGF-2 and both oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses (18Garrington T.P. Ishizuka T. Papst P.J. Chayama K. Webb S. Yujiri T. Sun W. Sather S. Russell D.M. Gibson S.B. Keller G. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5387-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Normal JNK activation in the presence of free MEKK2 PB1 domain demonstrates that MEK5 PB1 domain interaction with the PB1 domain of MEKK2, MEKK3, or other proteins is not needed for the MEKK2-mediated regulation of JNK activation. Similarly, expression of MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domains has no inhibitory effect on p38 activation, consistent with the PB1 domain of MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEK5 functioning in the regulation of ERK5, but not JNK or p38 activation. During the course of these studies, Lamark et al. (17Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) reported that MEK5 bound to the adapter protein, p62, via PB1-PB1 domain interactions. The p62 adapter protein has been shown to be important in forming a complex with TrkA, the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase, and to be critical for neurotrophin activation of the ERK5 pathway (24Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p62 is critical for forming a signaling complex in endosomes that also includes the aPKCs (25Sanchez P. De Carcer G. Sandoval I.V. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3069-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and that these responses are critical for neuronal differentiation (24Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear if MEKK2 or MEKK3 is associated with the p62-aPKC-MEK5 complex. Certainly, a model could easily be envisioned where PB1 domains of p62, MEK5, MEKK2, and/or MEKK3 along with the aPKCs might form an oligomeric signaling complex. In conclusion, our results, for the first time, show the specific interaction of the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domains with the MEK5 PB1 domain. Expression of the MEKK2 or MEKK3 PB1 domain selectively inhibited ERK5 but not JNK or p38 activation. The fact that mutation of the conserved Lys to Ala in the MEKK2 and MEKK3 PB1 domains inhibited interaction with the MEK5 PB1 domain, and resulted in the failure to inhibit ERK5 activation in cells, is consistent with very specific sequence requirements that are necessary for the selective PB1-OPCA interactions we and others (8Wilson M.I.

The known, full-length protein has been named hDMP1α and the new isoforms, hDMP1β and hDMP1γ. The hDMP1α, -β, and -γ splice variants have unique expression patterns in normal hematopoietic cells; hDMP1β mRNA transcripts are strongly expressed in quiescent CD34+ cells and freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocytes, as compared with hDMP1α. In contrast, activated T-cells and developing myeloid cells, macrophages, and granulocytes express low levels of hDMP1β transcripts, and hDMP1γ is ubiquitously and weakly expressed. Mouse Dmp1 has been shown to activate CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) and p19ARF gene expression via binding to canonical DNA recognition sites in the respective promoters. Assessment of CD13/APN promoter responsiveness demonstrated that hDMP1α but not hDMP1β and -γ, is a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, hDMP1β was found to inhibit the CD13/APN promoter transactivation ability of hDMP1α. Stable, ectopic expression of hDMP1β and, to a lesser extent hDMP1γ, reduced endogenous cell surface levels of CD13/APN in U937 cells. Moreover, stable, ectopic expression of hDMP1β altered phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced terminal differentiation of U937 cells to macrophages and resulted in maintenance of proliferation. These results demonstrate that hDMP1β antagonizes hDMP1α activity and suggest that cellular functions of hDMP1 may be regulated by cellular hDMP1 isoform levels.

The 761-amino acid mouse cyclin D-binding Myb-like protein (mDmp1) transcription factor was first identified using cyclin D2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and human DMP1 was cloned shortly thereafter (1Hirai H.

Both mouse and human DMP1 are composed of a central domain containing three Myb-like repeats flanked by an acidic transactivation, a cyclin binding domain on the N terminus, and an acidic transactivation domain at the C terminus (3Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In humans, hDMP1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in normal human tissues, with highest expression levels in testis, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes (2Bodner S.M.

Interestingly the hDMP1 locus is localized on chromosome 7q21, a region frequently deleted as part of the 7q-minus and monosomy 7 abnormalities of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. DMP1 binds to nonameric Ets consensus DNA sequences containing G(G/T)A cores, competes with Ets family proteins, and has been shown to be a transcriptional activator (1Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol.

DMP1 binding sites are found in the promoters of two well known genes, CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) 1The abbreviations used are: APN, aminopeptidase N; aa, amino acid; FITC, fluorescein; PE, phycoerythrin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; h, human; hr, human recombinant; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; tNGFR, truncated nerve growth factor receptor; PBMNC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. and the mouse tumor suppressor p19Arf (also referred to as ARF or p14ARF in humans), which is encoded from the Ink4a-Arf locus (4Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). DMP1 has been shown to be present in non-dividing cells and has a role in cell differentiation in certain hematopoietic lineages (1Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and is critical for cell cycle control via regulation of ARF (5Inoue K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One such gene regulated by DMP1, the ectoenzyme CD13/APN, has been implicated in myeloid development (6Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CD13/APN is a membrane-bound metalloproteinase that is expressed on normal human myeloid and lymphoid cells (7Drexler H.G. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1987; 1: 697-705PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pui C.H. Hancock M.L. Head D.R. Rivera G.K. Look A.T. Sandlund J.T. Behm F.G. Blood. 1993; 82: 889-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as non-hematopoietic cells (9Shipp M.A. Look A.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1052-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD13/APN expression is developmentally regulated (10Riemann D. Kehlen A. Langner J. Immunol Today. 1999; 20: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), functions in peptide degradation and cell-cell adhesion (11Menrad A. Speicher D. Wacker J. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1450-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bhagwat S.V. Petrovic N. Okamoto Y. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2002; 101: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and participates in growth and development of both hematopoietic and endothelial cells (reviewed in Riemann et al. (10Riemann D. Kehlen A. Langner J. Immunol Today. 1999; 20: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)). A direct role for CD13/APN has been proposed for human dendritic cell development in culture (13Rosenzwajg M. Tailleux L. Gluckman J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 453-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In myeloid cells it has been shown that c-Myb, Ets family members, and mDmp1 regulate CD13/APN transcription (6Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activation of CD13/APN gene expression is enhanced by a cooperative interaction between c-Myb bound to its cognate site and mDmp1, bound to one of the three downstream GGA core sites (6Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, CD13/APN promoter activity requires the intact DNA binding and transactivation domains of mDmp1, since mutants disrupted in either domain are biologically inert. Intriguingly, that c-Myb and mDmp1 show synergistic effects in activating the CD13/APN promoter implies that two different Myb family proteins collaborate in regulating CD13/APN gene expression and points to an important role for DMP1 in normal myeloid cell development (6Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Herein we describe two new splice variants of human DMP1 message generated by alternative splicing through the use of two different splice acceptor sites. We propose that the previously cloned hDMP1 message (2Bodner S.M. Naeve C.W. Rakestraw K.M. Jones B.G. Valentine V.A. Valentine M.B. Luthardt F.W. Willman C.L. Raimondi S.C. Downing J.R. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Look A.T. Gene. 1999; 229: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) be termed hDMP1α and the new splice variants hDMP1β and -γ. Distinct patterns of hDMP1α, -β, and -γ mRNA transcript expression in primary myeloid and lymphoid cells during in vitro development led us to consider the possibility that alternative hDMP1β and -γ isoforms might have distinct cellular functions as compared with hDMP1α. We confirm a role for the original DMP1 isoform, hDMP1α, in activation of CD13/APN gene expression (6Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and document antagonistic functional properties for the hDMP1β isoform in CD13/APN regulation using CD13/APN promoter-reporters and through stable, ectopic hDMP1β and -γ isoform expression in the U937 myeloid cell line. Moreover, stable, ectopic expression of hDMP1β in U937 cells altered PMA-induced terminal differentiation to macrophages. Cell Isolations—Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) samples were obtained from healthy donors recruited by the General Clinical Research Center at Green Hospital, La Jolla, CA, and cord blood samples were from placentas acquired from mothers with normal, full term deliveries at Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla, CA. Protocols and the use of all human samples were approved by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board of The Scripps Research Institute. CD34+ cells from cord and peripheral blood, as well as PBMNCs and neutrophils from peripheral blood, were isolated as previously reported (14Miyoshi H. Smith K.A. Mosier D.E. Verma I.M. Torbett B.E.

The relative expression of the hDMP1 splice variants β and γ as well as the previously cloned hDMP1α was determined by RT-PCR using primers encompassing the found insertions (Fig. 2A, forward primer, 5′-TACAGGACTATAGCATGGGGTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACTTCCCTGTGTTGCAAGTATC-3′). Conditions for PCR amplification were: one cycle for 5 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles with 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, and a last cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. HDMP1β and -γ were specifically amplified using the same forward primer as above but with a β- and γ-specific reverse primer (5′-CCATTTGACTGGTTTGGAAGTTG-3′) in the unique DNA insertion of these splice variants. PCR conditions were the same as above but using 32 cycles. GAPDH PCR was performed as described (16Zwahlen D. Tschan M.P. Grob T.J. Peters U.R. Fink D. Haenggi W. Altermatt H.J. Cajot J.F. Tobler A. Fey M.F. Aebi S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Cord blood CD34+ cells were differentiated in culture to either neutrophils or monocytes during a 15-day period with combinations of human recombinant cytokines. Initially, CD34+ cells were cultured in 10% BIT 9500 (StemCell Technology, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing hr stem cell factor (300 ng/ml), hr granulocyte CSF (10 ng/ml), hr interleukin-6 (10 units/ml), hr granulocyte-macrophage CSF (50 ng/ml), and hr Flt-3 ligand (300 ng/ml) to expand primitive progenitors. Growth factors were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). All cultures were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. After 4 days of culture the cells were removed and washed, and the medium was changed to Myelocult™ H5100 (StemCell Technology) containing hr CSF (300 ng/ml), hr granulocyte-macrophage CSF (10 ng/ml), hr interleukin-6 (10 units/ml), and hr interleukin-3 (10 ng/ml) to promote expansion of primitive myeloid progenitors. On day 10 of the cultures, cells were removed, washed, and resuspended in either Myelocult™ hr granulocyte CSF (10 ng/ml) for neutrophil development or Myelocult™ and hr macrophage CSF (5000 units/ml) for monocyte/macrophage development. Stage of development was assessed on cellular morphology and stage-specific cell surface markers using flow cytometry and appropriate antibody reagents (14Miyoshi H. Smith K.A. Mosier D.E. Verma I.M.

To obtain peripheral blood-derived macrophages, 2 × 106 PBMNCs in 1 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Ogden, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (C-RPMI) were added to each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and maintained overnight in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The next day non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing, and cells were then cultured in 1 ml of C-RPMI and 5000 units/ml of hr macrophage CSF. The human U937 monocytic cell line was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (C-DMEM). U937 cells were differentiated using PMA (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, PMA first was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 1.0 × 10–4m. For macrophage differentiation, PMA was diluted to concentrations as indicated in C-DMEM, and cells were cultured at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/ml for 1–4 days. All cultures were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 10% CO2. Non-adherent PBMNC were cultured in C-RPMI on 12-well plates pre-coated with anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) antibody for T-cell activation. Activation of T-cells was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the CD69 surface marker (peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated CD69 antibody, BD Biosciences) after 6 days of incubation in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Expression Plasmid and HIV Vector Construction and Preparation of Vector Stocks—hDMP1α and its two variants were cloned by RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA from KG-1 cells was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The open reading frame of hDMP1α was amplified with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) and the following primers: forward, 5′-ATGAGCACAGTGGAAGAGGATTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATGACAGTTTACCAAATCTTC-3′. Blunt-ended fragments were 3′ A-tailed with Taq DNA polymerase, purified, and ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid pCR-XL-CSPre was constructed by cloning the MluI-ApaI fragment from the self-inactivating (SIN) HIV vector pHIV-SINPre (19Miyoshi H. Blomer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the pCR-XL Topo backbone (Invitrogen). The cytomegalovirus promoter from pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (BglII-BamHI fragment) was cloned into the BamHI site of pCR-XL-CSPre. The HIV vector VIPER was constructed by cloning a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (20Follenzi A. Ailles L.E. Bakovic S. Geuna M. Naldini L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), the human elongation factor five internal ribosomal entry site (21Gan W. Celle M.L. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5006-5012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the truncated nerve growth factor receptor (tNGFR), and scaffold attachment region sequence (22Agarwal M. Austin T.W. Morel F. Chen J. Bohnlein E. Plavec I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the BamHI and SacII of pCR-XL-CSPre. HDMP1β and -γ were cloned into the unique BamHI site of VIPER. The VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV vectors were generated by transient transfection using the selected transgene plasmid and the following third-generation packaging plasmids: pMD.G (VSV-G), pMDLg/p.RRE (gag and pol), and pRSV-Rev (rev) (23Galimi F. Noll M. Kanazawa Y. Lax T. Chen C. Grompe M. Verma I.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The VIPER vector-containing supernatant was harvested after 24 h, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and resuspended in serum-free medium. HIV vector titers, defined as transducing units/ml were determined by transduction of 293T-cells and flow cytometry analysis to determine the percentage of cells expressing tNGFR (14Miyoshi H. Smith K.A. Mosier D.E. Verma I.M. Torbett B.E. Science. 1999; 283: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and Translation of hDMP1 Isoforms—Cell-free transcription and translation of hDMP1α, -β, and -γ plasmid DNA was performed using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (TnT® system) and the Transcend™ non-radioactive translation detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). A luciferase plasmid encoding a 61-kDa protein was used as positive control. The empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector served as a negative control. To detect reaction products 15 μl were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected by chemiluminescence. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays—Firefly luciferase reporter plasmids containing a contiguous stretch of eight concatamerized DMP1 binding sites, pGL2-BS2, kindly provided by Charles J. Sherr, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN, or the myeloid CD13/APN promoter (pMyo), kindly provided by Jørgen Olson, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, were used for functional analysis of the different hDMP1 isoforms. For transfection experiments, 293T-cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar); 6 μg of the reporter plasmids were co-transfected with 4 μg of the different hDMP1 expression vectors or the empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. Twenty ng of the pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector were co-transfected in each experiment as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For mixing experiments, 4 μg of the reporter plasmids and 1.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-hDMP1α were co-transfected with varying amounts of pcDNA3.1-hDMP1β and -γ. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 11.5 μg with empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. Cell lysates from transfected cells were prepared 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay protocol (Promega). The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase was calculated to obtain the relative luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and data are presented as the mean ± S.E. HIV VIPER Transduction and Cell Sorting—For VIPER vector transduction 2 × 105 U937 cells were added to round bottom 96-well plates in 0.1 ml of C-DMEM. Cells were transduced with VIPER control (tNGFR gene, no hDMP1 gene), VIPERβ (hDMP1β) and -γ (hDMP1γ) vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 20 in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The plates were spun for 45 min at 1250 rpm at room temperature using a Sorvall RT 6000D centrifuge and then incubated for 4 h in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were washed once and resuspended in fresh medium. The transduction was repeated the next day, and cells were cultured for 10 days. After 10 days the upper 20% tNGFR-expressing U937 cells were isolated on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Vantage SE II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using FITC-conjugated tNGFR antibodies. Analysis of Cell Surface Proteins—Flow cytometry was used to analyze expression of CD13/APN, CD11c, and tNGFR on transduced U937 cells. In brief, 2 × 105 U937 cells in 100 μl of ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer were incubated with 1 μl of the FITC-conjugated CD13/APN (10M13, AMAC, Westbrook, ME), the FITC-conjugated CD11c (Leu-M5, BD Biosciences), or the PE-conjugated NGFR antibody (C40–1457, BD Biosciences), washed, and analyzed for flow cytometry or sorted. For antibody specificity, irrelevant FITC- and PE-conjugated mouse isotype controls (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) were used. For flow cytometry analysis, 104 cell events per sample were acquired on a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences) running the Cell Quest acquisition software, and analysis was accomplished using Cell Quest analysis software, Version 3.4. Proliferation Assays—Proliferation was assessed by labeling cells with [3H]thymidine. Differentiating U937 VIPER and VIPERβ transfectants were resuspended in C-DMEM containing PMA at concentrations as indicated and seeded in 96-well plates. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 5 h of cell treatment (1 μCi/well). Cells were harvested at time points indicated using a Mach III cell harvester (Tomtec, Orange, CT), and β-radiation was detected on a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta Liquid Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Morphological Evaluation—Morphological features of differentiated U937 VIPER and VIPERβ cells were reviewed on cytospin slide preparations stained with May-Gruenwald-Giemsa stain. Classically defined morphological features were used as indicators of macrophage differentiation including cell shape, adherence, and ratio of cytoplasmic region to nuclei and cytoplasmic granulation. Genomic Organization and Translation of the Human DMP1 Gene and Its Splice Variants—During routine RT-PCR cloning for full-length hDMP1 message from the myeloid leukemic cell line KG-1, we obtained three distinct hDMP1 cDNA clones (“Experimental Procedures”). Sequence comparison of each unique clone to the hDMP1 genomic clone (accession number RG227L24) allowed identification of the genomic organization of hDMP1. The analysis revealed a perfect match for each of the 18 exons with corresponding splice donor and acceptor sites found in the genomic BAC clone (Table I). hDMP1 contains a large 11-kilobase first intron with the translational start site located in exon 3 (Fig. 1A). Further comparison of the two unique hDMP1 message sequences with the hDMP1 genomic sequence revealed inserts of 172 and 211 nucleotides, respectively, at nucleotide 985 (accession number AF084530). These sequences are identical to the genomic sequence of intron 9 and were generated by alternative splicing using two putative splicing acceptor sites as seen in Table I. Based on our findings we now propose to refer to hDMP1 as hDMP1α and the new splice variants as hDMP1β and -γ, respectively (accession numbers AF202144 and AF202145). The open reading frames of hDMP1β and -γ encode identical initial amino acid (aa) sequences to hDMP1α up to the splice site at aa 237. However, after aa 237, hDMP1β and -γ show novel stretches of 35 and 48 aa, respectively, followed by a premature TAA stop signal occurring in the alternatively spliced intronic sequence (Fig. 1B). The newly defined hDMP1 isoforms still contain the complete acidic N-terminal transactivation domain, the cyclin D binding domain (CBS), and an Myb-homology remnant but no C-terminal transactivation domain. The hDMP1β and -γ Myb-homology remnant is composed of first the 14/169 aa of the N-terminal sequence of the Myb-homology domain followed by sequences derived from intron 9 and concluding with 35 aa showing homology to the C terminus of the Myb-homology domain (Fig. 1B). HDMP1γ contains additional 13 aa as compared with -β, bridging the 14- and 35-aa remnants of the N- and C-terminal Myb-homology region. The predicted length of proteins encoded by hDMP1α,-β, and -γ would be 760, 272, and 285 aa, respectively.Table IExon-intron boundaries of hDMP1αExon no.ExonExon sizeSequence of exon-intron junction3′ splice acceptor5′ splice donorIntron sizebpkilobases11-144145ggggc GCGGCAGGAA gtaag10.942145-267123ttcag AGTGTTCTAG gtaag1.323268-384109tacag ATTTGGAATG gtagg1.434385-507123attag AAGCGTCCAC gtaag4.395508-60295tgaag TTTCATACAG gtata2.446603-717115tcaag ATTTTTAAAG gtaag0.947718-79477taaag GACATTTAAG gtatc4.878795-952158tttag GCACGGGAAA gtatg1.619953-98533tctag ATATAAAGGA gtaag0.8910986-1095110tttag GCTCCCACAG gtact2.0610β+172282cacag ACAACCACAG gtact1.8910γ+211321cccag GAAAACACAG gtact1.85111096-1324229ttcag GGAAGCTCAG gtttg1.20121325-1476152tgtag GATAGCCCTG gtaat2.11131477-1686210ttcag TCTTATGTTT gtaag2.64141687-176983cacag CTTCATTCCC gtgag2.17151770-1925156tttag TCTTTTATCC gtatg0.37161926-2303378tatag CCAGACTGAG gtaag0.58172304-2448145tttag GGTTTAACAG gtact0.20182449-37671319tacag ATCCC Open table in a new tab We next performed cell-free transcription and translation assays to verify the existence of protein translation from the hDMP1β and -γ message cDNA and to determine the approximate molecular weight of the translated proteins. HDMP1 expression plasmids produced all protein isoforms and displayed the molecular masses of 125, 31, and 32 kDa for hDMP1α, -β, and -γ, respectively (Fig. 1C). These data provide evidence that two new human DMP1 splice variants can be expressed from cloned hDMP1β and hDMP1γ message, and both encode shorter proteins than found for full-length hDMP1α. Expression Patterns of hDMP1 mRNA Splice Variants in Primary Hematopoietic Cells—hDMP1 is expressed in cells obtained from spleen, peripheral blood, and thymus (2Bodner S.M. Naeve C.W. Rakestraw K.M. Jones B.G. Valentine V.A. Valentine M.B. Luthardt F.W. Willman C.L. Raimondi S.C. Downing J.R. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Look A.T. Gene. 1999; 229: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the expression patterns of the two novel hDMP1β and -γ mRNA splice variants and hDMP1α in hematopoietic cells, we designed primers flanking the intronic insertions of hDMP1β and -γ, allowing us to amplify all three variants in the same PCR reaction and thereby allowing intra-transcript comparisons (Fig. 2A). A number of distinct hematopoietic cell lineages were used as poly-A mRNA sources for evaluation of hDMP1 transcript expression. As can be seen in a representative panel of RT-PCR results presented in Fig. 2B, expression of hDMP1α, -β, and -γ was seen in RNA samples obtained from freshly isolated CD34+ hematopoietic cells (7/7 samples) derived from mobilized peripheral blood, PBMNCs (6/6 samples), and cultured macrophages derived from peripheral blood (3/3 samples). In CD34+ cells the ratio of hDMP1α to hDMP1β transcripts was decreased (0.6 ± 0.1; n = 5), indicating increased relative amounts of hDMP1β transcripts as compared with hDMP1α. PBMNCs, a heterogeneous population of T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes expressed equivalent amounts of hDMP1α and -β mRNA transcripts (hDMP1α:hDMP1β ratio 0.9 ± 0.1; n = 6). In contrast to CD34+ cells, macrophages derived in tissue culture from peripheral blood monocytes predominantly and consistently demonstrated an increased hDMP1α: hDMP1β ratio (3.3 ± 1.0; n = 3), implying increased relative hDMP1α transcript amounts as compared with hDMP1β.Inall cell populations examined from peripheral blood, hDMP1γ transcripts were weakly expressed. To provide further insight into hDMP1 transcript expression in developing myeloid cells, cord blood CD34+ cells were differentiated in tissue culture using conditions that favored myeloid development. The presence of hDMP1 splice variants was assessed at various times early in differentiation and in culture-derived neutrophils (Fig. 2C , top right panel) and monocytes (Fig. 2C , bottom right panel). Myeloid stages of cells grown in culture were confirmed by phenotypic and morphologic criteria. After 1 day of differentiation a marked down-regulation of hDMP1β was observed (Fig. 2C). During the entire differentiation period relative levels of hDMP1β stayed low, whereas hDMP1α was the predominant splice variant identified. There were no substantial changes in hDMP1γ transcript expression. In contrast, terminally differentiated neutrophils expressed relatively lower amounts of all hDMP1 splice variants but increased amounts of hDMP1α versus hDMP1β, whereas monocytes expressed relatively higher amounts of hDMP1α transcripts. Assessment of hDMP1 transcripts from freshly isolated neutrophils obtained from blood confirmed (data n"

By using methods that enable the analysis of protamine binding to individual DNA molecules, we have monitored the kinetics of DNA condensation and decondensation by protamine 1 (P1) and synthetic peptides corresponding to specific segments of the bull P1 DNA binding domain. Our results show that the number of clustered arginine residues present in the DNA binding domain is the most important factor affecting the condensation and stability of the DNA-protamine complex prior to the formation of inter-protamine disulfide cross-links. The high affinity of P1 for DNA is achieved by the coordinated binding of three anchoring domains, which together in bull P1 contain 19 Arg residues. The single DNA molecule experiments show that sequences containing two or more anchoring domains have an off-rate that is at least 3 orders of magnitude slower than those containing a single domain. The use of Arg, rather than Lys residues, and the inclusion of Tyr or Phe residues in the hinge regions between anchoring domains provide additional stability to the complex.

Several different mechanisms have been identified for packaging DNA in eucaryotic cells. The best understood is the packaging scheme used to organize DNA inside the nucleus of all somatic cells, in which the histones coil the DNA into 11-nm nucleosomal subunits that are further organized into 30-nm chromatin fibers. This type of packaging allows individual genes to be activated or repressed depending on the needs of the cell. In contrast, small basic nuclear proteins called protamines bind to the entire length of the haploid genome in sperm cells and coil 50-kb segments of DNA into ∼60-nm toroidal subunits (1Balhorn R.

Sequence analyses of numerous P1 molecules and their genes have revealed that all mammalian P1 molecules appear to have several sequence-related features in common. The Arg residues that comprise the DNA binding domain of P1 are usually clustered in the center of the molecule (1Balhorn R. Cosman M. Thornton K. Krishnan V.V. Corzett M. Bench G. Kramer C.

Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar) during the final stages of sperm chromatin maturation. Intramolecular disulfide cross-links begin forming in late-step spermatids, shortly after the protamines bind to DNA. As the spermatids leave the testis and begin moving through the epididymis, a final set of disulfide bonds is formed that covalently link each protamine to its neighbor. This creates a chromatin complex that is highly compact and transcriptionally inert. Previous studies using salmon protamine (salmine) (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R.

Although the exact structure of the complex has not yet been determined, Raman spectroscopy and other studies have suggested that P1 must bind to DNA in an extended conformation with a footprint that covers ∼11 bp of sequence (14Hud N.V.

In an effort to gain additional insight into how the protamines interact with DNA and inactivate the genes of the developing spermatid, we have examined the functions of specific subsets of the P1 DNA binding domain that enable protamine to bind to DNA and condense it into toroids. These experiments extend previous studies that have been conducted by others using various Arg- and Lys-containing oligopeptides (24Standke K.C. Brunnert H.

Biol. 1967; 24: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and focus on elucidating how three specific features of the P1 sequence affect the ability of P1 to bind to DNA and maintain it in a condensed state as follows: 1) the number of poly(Arg) clusters or anchoring domains, 2) the relative importance of Arg and Lys residues in these domains, and 3) the presence of aromatic amino acids interspersed between anchoring domains. Peptides corresponding to subdomains of the bull P1 sequence were synthesized, and kinetics of their binding to individual λ phage DNA molecules were examined under conditions that preclude intermolecular aggregation (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Bull P1 was isolated from pooled bull semen (American Breeders Service, DeForest, WI) and purified using high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (11Mazrimas J.A. Corzett M. Campos C. Balhorn R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences synthesized for this study used bull P1 as the primary reference sequence, ARYRCCLTHSGSRCRRRRRRRCRRRRRRFGRRRRRRVCCRRYTVIRCTRQ. The bull P1 sequence shares a strong consensus with the sequences for P1 molecules found in other mammals (10Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to various subsets of the bull P1 sequence were synthesized by SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA) and were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to confirm their sequence and purity. Peptides located in the DNA binding domain of P1 were synthesized with an acetylated amino terminus and an amide on the carboxyl terminus to minimize terminal charge effects and mimic the internal peptide sequences present in P1. The amino-terminal protamine peptide ARYRSSLTHSGSRS was synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal amide group, and the carboxyl-terminal protamine peptide VSSRRYTVIRSTRQ was synthesized with an amino-terminal acetyl group. Protein Concentration Verification—To obtain accurate concentrations of the nuclear proteins used in the condensation experiments, the purified peptides and bull P1 were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, known aliquots were distributed into glass tubes, and the samples were frozen and lyophilized. Replicate samples were dissolved in 6 n hydrochloric acid and hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 16 h, and the amino acid content of each tube was determined by AAA Service Laboratory (Boring, OR). The protein content of each sample was determined using the known sequence of bull P1 and the synthetic peptides. Tube to tube variations in the aliquoted samples used for the experimental studies were found to be less than 2%. Preparation of Stained DNA Bead Sample—λ phage DNA (Sigma) was dissolved in buffer (degassed 50% sucrose (w/v), 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8, 30 mm dithiothreitol), tagged with biotin, and attached to 1-μm streptavidin-coated polystyrene spheres as described previously (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). YOYO-1 dye was then added so that the dye molecule to DNA base pair ratio was 1:4. Experiments performed with salmine and various peptides have shown that this concentration of YOYO-1 does not alter the kinetics of binding to DNA (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The same buffer, minus the YOYO-1 dye, was used to dissolve the protein samples. In experiments involving the binding and dissociation of bull P1 to DNA, dithiothreitol was included to prevent the formation of disulfide bonds between P1 molecules following their binding to DNA. Condensation/Decondensation Experiments—The experimental apparatus is identical to that used previously to examine the condensation of individual DNA molecules by salmon protamine (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Separate solutions containing protein and DNA molecules attached to polystyrene beads were introduced into a dual port flow cell at a flow velocity of ∼50 μm/s where they flowed side by side, in a laminar fashion, with little mixing. Beads containing individual DNA molecules were trapped using an infrared laser optical trap (λ = 1.047 μm). An argon ion laser (λ = 488 nm) was used to excite the YOYO-1-stained DNA molecules, and their fluorescence was visualized using an image-intensified CCD camera. Working at a depth of about 20 μm below the coverslip (the flow cell depth was 40 μm), the DNA molecule was pulled across the interface separating the two flowing buffer solutions, and the shortening of individual DNA molecules was monitored as the protein or peptide bound to it and induced condensation. The condensed DNA was evident as a bright fluorescent spot at the end of the DNA molecule. The length of the stained λ phage DNA molecule (48.5 kb) extended by flow was measured to be 19.2 ± 0.82 μm at a flow rate of 72 μm/s in 50% sucrose. Under these conditions, the DNA was 95% extended. 1D. Stigter, personal communication. Analyses of Protein and Peptide Binding Kinetics—The condensation rates for 5-20 individual DNA molecules were measured at several different protein or peptide concentrations, and a linear least squares fit (in conjunction with the peptide footprint) was used to determine the binding, or “on-rate”, k on, of the peptide or protein to DNA. The binding of peptides and proteins to DNA was shown previously to be the rate-limiting step in condensation, and the length of the DNA molecule during condensation was shown to decrease linearly with time (21Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 30Brewer L. Corzett M. Balhorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38895-38900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The decondensation rate was determined by pulling partially condensed DNA molecules back to the DNA side of the flow cell (where there was an absence of peptide or protein) and observing the DNA re-extend as the bound peptide left the DNA. The mean of ∼10 molecules was used to determine the “off-rate,” k off, of each peptide or protein dissociating from the DNA molecule. The dissociation constant K d was determined by dividing the off-rate by the on-rate, K d = k off/k on. Computational Analysis of Peptide Solution Conformation Using Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with AMBER (31Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P.A. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2670) Google Scholar) using the Cornell force field (32Cornell W.D. Cieplak P.

Structures of the R6GGR6 and R6FGR6 peptides were constructed in extended conformations and solvated in boxes of TIP3P water (33Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30135) Google Scholar) sufficient in size to have at least 15 Å of water between the protein and the solvent interface (81 × 72 × 45 Å3 initially). Twelve chloride ions were added to each system to neutralize the charge. The systems typically consisted of 21,400 atoms (∼7,000 water molecules). Each system was energy-minimized using 250 steps of steepest descents and 750 steps of conjugate gradients. Constant temperature and pressure dynamics were performed on these energy-minimized systems. Periodic boundary conditions were used, and electrostatic interactions were treated by Particle Mesh Ewald methods (34Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15756) Google Scholar) with a 9-Å cut-off in direct space, cubic interpolation, and using a 1-Å grid. SHAKE (35Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C.

These systems were coupled to a heat bath at 300 K. Coupling constants of 5 and 2 ps were used for peptide and solvent, respectively. Each simulation was performed for a total of 2.5 ns, and the last 2.0 ns were used for analysis. Coordinates were saved every 200 time steps. The peptide conformers were clustered using the program NMRCORE (36Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using the program surfv (37Sridharan S. Nicholls A. Honig B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: A174Google Scholar). Rate of DNA Condensation by P1 and Peptides—The rates of DNA condensation induced by the binding of bull P1 and a series of peptides containing different sequences present in the bull P1 DNA binding domain (Arg15-Arg36; sequence ARYRCCLTHSGSRCRRRRRRRCRRRRRRFGRRRRRRVCCRRYTVIRCTRQ) were determined for a range of protein and peptide concentrations (Table I). The results show that the rate of DNA condensation is affected by the number of Arg residues in the peptide or the protein's DNA binding domain, the presence of an aromatic residue in the hinge region between anchoring domains, and the substitution of Lys for Arg residues. Arg6 was the least effective of the Arg-containing peptides in condensing DNA. While R6GGR6 condensed the DNA molecules 42 times faster than Arg6, increasing the number of Arg6 anchoring domains from two to three, as in bull P1 and R6GGR6GGR6, did not increase the rate of condensation. Bull P1 and R6GGR6 condensed DNA with equal rates, while the condensation rate for R6GGR6GGR6 was surprisingly smaller. Substituting an aromatic residue for one of the Gly residues in R6GGR6 resulted in condensation rates that were a factor of 10-25 smaller (R6YGR6 and R6FGR6). The substitution of Lys residues for Arg also altered the rate of condensation. Lys6 was observed to be 10-fold less effective in condensing DNA than Arg6, and K6GGK6 was nearly 10-fold less effective than R6GGR6. Substitutions of individual Arg residues with Lys also decreased the condensation rate (Table I).Table IRate of condensation of individual DNA molecules induced by bull P1 and synthesized proteinsProteinCondensation rateOn-rate (k on)Concentration rangeμm/s·μmmolecules/s·μmμ mBull P19.2 ± 1.82113 ± 4130-2.6Arg62.1 ± 0.4 × 10−1177 ± 340-200Lys62.7 ± 0.25 × 10−223 ± 20-1800R6YGR63.3 ± 0.7 × 10−1139 ± 300-73R6FGR68.3 ± 1.5 × 10−1350 ± 630-19R6GGR68.8 ± 0.963711 ± 4050-5K6GGK67.6 ± 1.0 × 10−1320 ± 420-44RKRKRKGGRKRKRK6.5 ± 0.7 × 10−1274 ± 300-82R6GGR6GGR63.3 ± 0.7926 ± 1970-11Acetyl-VSSRRYTVIRSTRQNo condensation2.1ARYRSSLTHSGSRS-CONH2No condensation2.4 Open table in a new tab Peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal (ARYRSSLTHSGSRS-CONH2) and carboxyl-terminal (CH3CO-VSSRRYTVIRSTRQ) sequences of P1 outside the DNA binding domain were tested for their ability to condense DNA at concentrations similar to those used for the peptides containing anchoring domain sequences. The Ser residues were substituted for Cys to eliminate the possibility that the peptides might form disulfide-linked folded forms (38Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or multimers in solution and complicate our interpretation of the results. No DNA condensation was observed for either peptide at a concentration of 2 μm. While these results suggest that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences flanking the protamine DNA binding domain do not bind to DNA, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cysteine residues normally present in these sequences may stabilize the formation of some disulfide-dependent conformation in the peptide that enables DNA binding. Protein and Peptide Off-rates Determined by Decondensation—The DNA decondensation rates and dissociation constants (K d) measured for bull P1, and the synthetic peptides are shown in Table II. Bull P1 remained attached to DNA for the longest period of time with a dissociation rate (k off = 0.23 molecules/s) that was similar to previous rates obtained for salmine and hamster P1 (8Balhorn R.

Sequences containing Tyr had substantially slower off rates than those containing only Gly. The inclusion of a single Tyr residue decreased the off-rate of the peptide by 6-fold. Peptides containing Phe exhibited a similar, but less pronounced effect. Replacing the first Gly in R6GGR6 with Phe decreased the off-rate by 2-fold. Computational Simulation of the Protamine Anchoring Domain by Using Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics runs were performed on the R6GGR6 and R6FGR6 peptides to examine how the presence of the aromatic Phe residue located between two anchoring domains might affect the conformation adopted by the adjacent peptide segments and ultimately impact the binding of these sequences to DNA. Structures of each peptide were constructed in extended conformation and solvated in boxes of water utilizing periodic boundaries. Molecular dynamics simulations were run for a total time of 2.5 ns using a fixed number of particles held at constant pressure and temperature. Clustering analysis performed on 200 structures selected at 10-ps intervals during the last 2.0 ns of the simulations are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Comparisons of these structures suggest that both peptides form a significant amount of structure along the backbone of the entire sequence. In the simulation performed with the R6GGR6 sequence, this backbone remains reasonably extended as a result of the extension and solvation of the Arg side chains. The mobility of the carboxyl-terminal region of this peptide is constrained by the formation of a salt bridge between the terminal carboxyl group and the side chain of residue Arg11. The most interesting structure, however, is that developed in the R6FGR6 peptide during the last 1.1 ns of the simulation. In this peptide, the phenyl ring stacks against the peptide backbone and appears to form a stable core that is surprisingly tight (Fig. 2B). In these structures, the aromatic ring of Phe interacts with the backbone amides of Gly8 and Arg9. One consequence of this stacking is that the backbone is bent between the two anchoring (Arg6) domains. The distances measured from the amide hydrogen to the center of mass of the Phe ring during the last nanosecond of the simulation are 3.88 ± 0.63 and 3.52 ± 0.42 Å for Gly8 and Arg9, respectively. One effect of the interaction between the aromatic ring and backbone is that the amount of motion sampled by the ring is reduced significantly. The positional fluctuation of the Phe side chain is 4.54 Å for the first nanosecond of dynamics but reduces to 2.72 Å when stacked against the peptide backbone. The average solvent-accessible surface area of R6FGR6 (2766.5 ± 87.4 Å2) is lower than for R6GGR6 (2850.4 ± 79.4 Å2) even though R6FGR6 has the greater intrinsic surface area. Importance of Multiple Arg6 DNA Anchoring Domains—DNA condensation and decondensation experiments were performed using a series of synthetic peptides containing one (Arg6), two (R6GGR6), and three (R6GG R6GGR6) Arg6 anchoring sequences as model subsets of the bull P1 DNA binding domain and two 14-residue peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences flanking the bull P1 DNA binding domain. Even though the sequences of the model peptides do not correspond to the exact sequences present in bull P1 (the Cys residues were changed to Ser or Gly to prevent disulfide bond formation and model anchoring domains containing six Arg residues separated by two Gly residues were used to build up a peptide sequence corres"
https://openalex.org/W2038520499,"We examined cell death in developing retinal tissue, following inhibition of protein synthesis, which kills undifferentiated post-mitotic cells. Ultrastructural features were found of both apoptosis and autophagy. Only approximately half of the degenerating cells were either terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive or reacted with antibodies specific for activated caspases-3 or -9. Bongkrekic acid completely inhibited any appearance of cell death, whereas inhibitors of autophagy, caspases-9 or -3, prevented only TUNEL-positive cell death. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase-6 blocked TUNEL-negative cell death. Simultaneous inhibition of caspases-9 and -6 prevented cell death almost completely, but degeneration dependent on autophagy/caspase-9 still occurred under inhibition of both caspases-3 and -6. Thus, inhibition of protein synthesis induces in the developing retina various post-translational, mitochondria-dependent pathways of cell death. Autophagy precedes sequential activation of caspases-9 and -3, and DNA fragmentation, whereas, in parallel, caspase-6 leads to a TUNEL-negative form of cell death. Additional mechanisms of cell death may be engaged upon selective caspase inhibition."

Small regulatory proteins can, in principle, enter and leave the nucleus by simple diffusion through the nuclear pore complexes. However, molecules larger than ∼ 60 kDa are actively translocated from one side of the nuclear envelope to the other by a family of soluble transport receptors, classified as importins or exportins, which belong to the importin-β family of RanGTP-binding proteins. Importins bind their cargo in the cytoplasm and release it upon binding to RanGTP in the nucleus; on the opposite, exportins form a trimeric complex with cargo and RanGTP in the nucleus and release their transport substrate into the cytoplasm upon GTP hydrolysis (for review, see Refs. 2Mattaj I.W.

MAP kinases are a family of evolutionary conserved protein kinases that play a critical role in transducing extracellular chemical and physical signals into intracellular responses (for review, see Refs. 5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar, 6Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Upon activation, these enzymes phosphorylate a variety of substrates that are present in all compartments of the cell. Consequently, the spatial distribution of MAP kinases, as well as the temporal regulation of their activity, is an important determinant of the ultimate biological response. Studies on the regulation of MAP kinase localization have been focused mainly on the mammalian enzymes ERK1 and ERK2 (8Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Volmat V. Pouyssegur J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In resting cells, unphosphorylated ERK1/2 are anchored in the cytoplasm by their association with the MAP kinase kinases MEK1/2 (10Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) as well as with other cellular proteins such as protein phosphatase PTP-SL (11Zuniga A. Torres J. Ubeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the death effector domain-containing protein PEA-15 (12Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). After mitogenic stimulation, the MEK·ERK complex is disrupted, and a pool of ERK1/2 is translocated to the nucleus (13Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that ERK2 mainly enters the nucleus by a saturable, carrier-independent facilitated mechanism (16Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that sustained retention of ERK1/2 in the nucleus requires the neosynthesis of nuclear anchoring proteins (17Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 by nuclear phosphatases promotes their binding to NES-containing MEK1/2, which then mediate the export of MAP kinases to the cytoplasm by an active CRM1-dependent mechanism (18Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that localization of MAP kinases is regulated mainly by changes in the abundance and affinity of anchoring proteins. Several studies have emphasized the importance of the subcellular localization of MAP kinases in modulating cellular responses. Disruption of the NES was found to potentiate dramatically the ability of activated mutants of MAP kinase kinase to induce morphological changes and malignant transformation of rodent fibroblasts (19Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These effects were correlated with a strong increase in the fraction of nuclear activated ERK1/2 and were reversed by coexpression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1. Ectopic expression of an activated variant of ERK2 in the nucleus was also shown to transform NIH 3T3 cells and to induce neurite extension in PC12 cells (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reciprocally, sequestration of ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm by forced expression of a catalytically inactive MAP kinase phosphatase-3 mutant inhibits Elk1-dependent gene transcription and prevents S phase entry in fibroblasts (21Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the increased cell proliferation observed upon inactivation of the PEA-15 gene is associated with constitutive nuclear localization of ERK1/2 and augmented c-fos mRNA expression (12Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). ERK3 defines a distinct subfamily of MAP kinases which also includes the related kinase p63MAPK (22Turgeon B. Lang B.F. Meloche S. Genomics. 2002; 80: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ERK3 is a 100-kDa protein that shares about 50% identity with ERK1/2 in the kinase domain but presents structural features that distinguish it from conventional MAP kinases (23Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Meloche S. Beatty B.G. Pellerin J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1575-1579PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, ERK3 contains the sequence SEG instead of the conserved TXY motif in the activation loop and possesses a long C-terminal extension. Little is known about the regulation and functions of ERK3. Interestingly, we have observed recently that overexpression of ERK3 in NIH 3T3 cells markedly inhibits DNA synthesis (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Pelletier S. Pellerin J. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4542-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of MAP kinase localization in the control of their activity, we have examined the subcellular distribution and nucleocytoplasmic transport of ERK3. We show that ERK3 is present in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in resting cells and that localization is not affected by common mitogenic or stress stimuli. The cytoplasmic localization of ERK3 requires active nuclear export by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. Contrary to other MAP kinase family members, ERK3 binds directly to the CRM1 receptor in vitro. Importantly, we provide evidence that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ERK3 regulates its inhibitory action on cell cycle progression. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. HEK293 and HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. Wi38 VA13 human fibroblasts were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) at a density of 40,000 cells/well of 6-well plates. After overnight growth, the cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was 2 μg/well. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and processed for immunofluorescence as described below. Reagents and Antibodies—LMB was a gift from M. Yoshida (University of Tokyo). 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was from Roche Diagnostics. Commercial antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) and polyclonal anti-HA (Y-11) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-CRM1 from Transduction Laboratories; monoclonal anti-BrdUrd from Oncogene Research Products; polyclonal anti-GST from ABR Affinity Bioreagents; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG and TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch. The polyclonal ERK2 antiserum αIIcp42 has been described (27Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of ERK3 (E3-CTE4) was obtained by immunization of rabbits with purified His6-E3365-721-GST fusion protein (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Pelletier S. Pellerin J. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4542-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ERK3 phosphoserine 189-specific antibody was generated in collaboration with Cell Signaling Technology by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic phosphoserine 189 peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Pelletier S. Pellerin J. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4542-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—All recombinant ERK3 DNA constructs were derived from the human cDNA sequence (25Meloche S. Beatty B.G. Pellerin J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1575-1579PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into ERK3 cDNA using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). pcDNA3-Myc6 was constructed by inserting the Myc6 epitope sequence derived from pCS3MT (provided by A. J. Waskiewicz, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) into the HindIII/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-Myc6-ERK3 was constructed by first inserting an EcoRI site at the initiator ATG codon of ERK3 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, followed by subcloning of the ERK3 coding sequence into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3-Myc6. The K49A/K50A (kinase-dead) and Ser-189 mutants of ERK3 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into pcDNA3-Myc6 vector. The ERK31-365Δ, ERK31-398Δ, and ERK31-542Δ deletion mutants were generated by PCR using pcDNA3-HA-ERK3 as template and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3-Myc6. To construct the Rev-ERK3-GFP fusion plasmids, the ERK3 regions of interest were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the AgeI site of pRev(1.4)-GFP (28Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To generate NLS-ERK3, two annealed oligonucleotides coding for the SV40 NLS were subcloned into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of pCS3MT. The sequence PPKKKRKL replaced the sixth Myc epitope of the Myc6 tag. The NES-ERK3 was engineered similarly by subcloning two annealed oligonucleotides coding for MEK1 NES (LQKKLEELELE) into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of pCS3MT. Then, the coding sequence of ERK3 was ligated in-frame into the EcoRI site of the modified pCS3MT vectors. The ERK3-NLS was obtained by subcloning oligonucleotides coding for SV40 NLS into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pCS3MT followed by ligation of the ERK3 sequence into the EcoRI site of the vector. To generate the NES-ERK3-NLS construct, oligonucleotides coding for SV40 NLS were first subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pCS3MT-NES followed by insertion of ERK3 coding sequence into the EcoRI site of the vector to yield pCS3MT-NES-ERK3-NLS. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pcDNA3 vector encoding Myc-tagged CRM1 was kindly provided by C. Dargemont (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris). To construct the pcDNA3-HA-snurportin 1 expression vector, the snurportin 1 coding sequence from pQE60-snurportin 1 (29Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with EcoRI flanking sites and subcloned into EcoRI-digested pcDNA3-HA. pET15b-CRM1 was constructed by subcloning the human CRM1 cDNA from pET3a-CRM1 (30Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartmann E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen). Sequence of the primers used for PCR and details about the cloning strategies are available upon request. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant His6-CRM1, His6-GST, and His6-ERK3-GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as described (31Coulombe P. Meloche S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). His-tagged canine RanQ69L was kindly provided by D. Görlich (Universität Heidelberg) and purified as described (32Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. After quenching in 0.1 m glycine and PBS for 5 min, the cells were permeabilized by incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS for 5 min at room temperature and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. For detection of ectopically expressed ERK3, the cells were stained for 1 h at 37 °C with anti-Myc primary antibody followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Transfected HA-tagged snurportin 1 was visualized using a polyclonal anti-HA primary antibody. For localization of endogenous ERK3, the cells were stained with polyclonal anti-ERK3 antibody E3-CTE4 (1:50 dilution) followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. CRM1 was detected by staining with a monoclonal anti-CRM1 antibody. Cells were mounted on glass slides using mounting medium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mg/ml N-propylgallate, 50% glycerol) and viewed with fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM RB). A minimum of 150 cells was scored for each coverslip. CRM1 Binding Assay—In vitro CRM1 binding assays were performed as described (33McBride K.M. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6196-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The recombinant proteins His6-GST or His6-ERK3-GST (3-10 μg) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) preblocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin. The beads were then washed with CRM1 binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Tween 20, 0.4% nonfat dry milk, 1 mm GTP) and used as affinity matrices. His6-CRM1 was either expressed in E. coli or translated in vitro from pET15b-CRM1 in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT T7 Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega) and incubated with the beads for 3 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 388 μl of binding buffer. Where indicated, bacterially expressed His-tagged RanQ69L was added at a final concentration of 0.4 μm. The beads were recovered by mild centrifugation and washed four times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or immunoblotting with anti-CRM1 antibody. The total amount of His6-GST or His6-ERK3-GST proteins was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. BrdUrd Incorporation Studies—For analysis of BrdUrd incorporation, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded at 40,000 cells/well onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates and transfected with expression plasmids (2 μg of DNA) as described above. Exponentially growing cells were then incubated for 16 h with 10 μm BrdUrd. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. After quenching in 0.1 m glycine for 5 min, the cells were permeabilized by incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Nonspecific sites were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. The transfected proteins were detected by staining with anti-Myc as primary antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary reagent. Then, DNA was denatured with 2 n HCl for 10 min at room temperature. Staining for BrdUrd incorporation was performed by incubating cells for 1 h at 37 °C with anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary reagent. The nuclei were visualized by DAPI (1 μm final concentration) staining. Cell samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The results are expressed as the percentage of transfected cells showing nuclear labeling for BrdUrd. Localization of ERK3 in the Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Compartments—To determine the subcellular distribution of ERK3, we transiently expressed a Myc-tagged construct of ERK3 in various cell lines and analyzed its localization by immunofluorescence microscopy with 9E10 antibody. In the cell lines tested, Myc-ERK3 was distributed evenly in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, with the exception of HeLa cells where the kinase was enriched in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). To verify that localization of ectopically expressed ERK3 reflects that of the endogenous protein, we examined the distribution of endogenous ERK3 in cells using a polyclonal anti-ERK3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, ERK3 staining was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of exponentially proliferating cells. Preincubation of the antiserum with His6-ERK3-GST fusion protein immobilized to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, but not with empty beads, almost completely abolished the fluorescence signal, confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 1C). No reactivity was detected in the absence of primary antibody. Stimulation of cells with mitogenic factors causes the translocation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (13Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cellular localization of ERK3 was regulated by extracellular stimuli, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with Myc-ERK3 and exposed to different growth factors or chemical stresses (Fig. 2). In quiescent cells, ERK3 was localized in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, whereas ERK2 was present exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stimulation with serum growth factors, epidermal growth factor, or the G protein-coupled receptor agonist lysophosphatidic acid for 5 min to 3 h did not modify the subcellular distribution of ERK3. Under the same conditions, ERK2 was quantitatively relocalized to the nucleus (data not shown). Similarly, exposure to the oxidant H2O2 or to arsenite had no detectable effect on ERK3 localization. These experiments indicate that the cellular localization of ERK3 is not influenced by common MAP kinase stimuli. ERK3 Is Actively Exported to the Cytoplasm by a CRM1-dependent Mechanism—Treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide does not modify the cellular distribution of ERK3, suggesting that the cytoplasmic localization of the kinase is ensured by a nuclear export mechanism (data not shown). To test the possibility that ERK3 is actively exported from the nucleus by the receptor CRM1 (also known as exportin 1) (34Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 35Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 36Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), we treated cells with the antibiotic LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent transport (37Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Addition of LMB to exponentially proliferating NIH 3T3 cells caused the progressive accumulation of ERK3 in the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantification of the results revealed that ERK3 staining was primarily nuclear in less than 5% of control cells, whereas ∼60% of cells displayed predominant nuclear staining after 12 h of treatment with LMB (Fig. 3B). To establish further the role of CRM1 in ERK3 transport, we tested the effect of CRM1 overexpression on the cellular localization of the kinase. As shown in Fig. 4A, ectopic expression of CRM1 promoted the cytoplasmic relocalization of ERK3 in 40% of cotransfected cells, again suggesting that CRM1 directs ERK3 nuclear export.Fig. 4CRM1 promotes the nuclear export of ERK3. A, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of Myc-tagged ERK3 in combination with 1 μg of Myc-CRM1 or empty vector as indicated. After 48 h, the cellular localization of ERK3 and CRM1 was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with anti-ERK3 and anti-CRM1 antibodies, respectively (top panel). The localization of ERK3 was analyzed quantitatively as described in Fig. 3 (bottom panel). The bar graph represents the mean ± S.E. of two independent experiments. B, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of Myc-tagged ERK3 along with 1 μg of HA-snurportin 1 or empty vector as indicated. The localization of ectopically expressed ERK3 and snurportin 1 was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Snurportin 1 is an adaptor protein that mediates nuclear import of m3G-capped uridine-rich snRNPs by the importin-β receptor pathway (29Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After each round of import, snurportin 1 must return to the cytoplasm, and this recycling is mediated by the export receptor CRM1 (30Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartmann E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Notably, snurportin 1 binds CRM1 with a much higher affinity than the leucine-rich NES-containing protein Rev and competes with CRM1-dependent RNA export pathways in vivo. From this, it has been suggested that sensitivity toward competition by snurportin 1 would represent a stringent test for CRM1 requirement (30Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartmann E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We thus exploited this idea to test further the involvement of CRM1 in mediating ERK3 export. When snurportin 1 was coexpressed with ERK3 in NIH 3T3 cells, the localization of ERK3 became predominantly nuclear (Fig. 4B). Quantification of the results indicated that around 60% of cells cotransfected with snurportin 1 display enriched nuclear staining for ERK3, in contrast to less than 5% of control cells. We used an in vitro binding assay to determine whether CRM1 interacts directly with ERK3. CRM1 was translated in vitro with a wheat germ extract (to eliminate the contribution of endogenous lysate proteins) and incubated with E. coli- purified His6-ERK3-GST recombinant protein immobilized to glutathione-agarose beads, in the absence or presence of active RanQ69L. Labeled CRM1 bound to immobilized ERK3, and the binding was enhanced by the presence of RanQ69L (Fig. 5A). In contrast, very weak binding of His6-GST was observed under these conditions. Recombinant CRM1 purified from E. coli a"
https://openalex.org/W1983310583,"We demonstrated previously that leukotriene D4 (LTD4) regulates proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells through a CysLT receptor by protein kinase C (PKC)ϵ-dependent stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2. Our current study provides the first evidence that LTD4 can activate 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) via pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi protein pathways. Transfection and inhibitor experiments revealed that activation of p90RSK, but not CREB, is a PKCϵ/Raf-1/ERK1/2-dependent process. LTD4-mediated CREB activation was not affected by expression of kinase-dead p90RSK but was abolished by transfection with the regulatory domain of PKCα (a specific dominant-inhibitor of PKCα). Kinase-negative mutants of p90RSK and CREB (K-p90RSK and K-CREB) blocked the LTD4-induced increase in cell number and DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation). Compatible with these results, flow cytometry showed that LTD4 caused transition from the G0/G1 to the S+G2/M cell cycle phase, indicating increased proliferation. Similar treatment of cells transfected with K-p90RSK resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, consistent with a role of p90RSK in LTD4-induced proliferation. On the other hand, expression of K-CREB caused a substantial buildup in the sub-G0/G1 phase, suggesting a role for CREB in mediating LTD4-mediated survival in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results show that LTD4 regulates proliferation and survival via distinct intracellular signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrated previously that leukotriene D4 (LTD4) regulates proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells through a CysLT receptor by protein kinase C (PKC)ϵ-dependent stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2. Our current study provides the first evidence that LTD4 can activate 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) via pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi protein pathways. Transfection and inhibitor experiments revealed that activation of p90RSK, but not CREB, is a PKCϵ/Raf-1/ERK1/2-dependent process. LTD4-mediated CREB activation was not affected by expression of kinase-dead p90RSK but was abolished by transfection with the regulatory domain of PKCα (a specific dominant-inhibitor of PKCα). Kinase-negative mutants of p90RSK and CREB (K-p90RSK and K-CREB) blocked the LTD4-induced increase in cell number and DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation). Compatible with these results, flow cytometry showed that LTD4 caused transition from the G0/G1 to the S+G2/M cell cycle phase, indicating increased proliferation. Similar treatment of cells transfected with K-p90RSK resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, consistent with a role of p90RSK in LTD4-induced proliferation. On the other hand, expression of K-CREB caused a substantial buildup in the sub-G0/G1 phase, suggesting a role for CREB in mediating LTD4-mediated survival in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results show that LTD4 regulates proliferation and survival via distinct intracellular signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells.

(LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) belong to an important group of pro-inflammatory mediators that are derived from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway that have a number of pathophysiological functions in the inflammatory process, such as induction of proliferation and contraction of smooth muscle cells, promotion of eosinophil migration, and amplification of vascular permeability (1Funk C.D.

LTD4 is the most potent of the cysteinyl leukotrienes, and its effects are mediated through a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor type. Two such receptors have been cloned and characterized as CysLT1 and CysLT2 (4Brink C. Dahlen S.-E. Drazen J. Evans J.F. Hay D.W.P. Nicosia S. Serhan C.N. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T. Pharmacol.

Nature. 1999; 399: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In binding studies, the CysLT1 receptor has been shown to have the highest affinity for LTD4 and is generally believed to be the most important receptor in mediating the functional effects of this cysteinyl leukotriene (4Brink C.

The CysLT2 receptor, on the other hand, exhibits equal binding affinities for LTD4 and LTC4 (7Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N.

Some of the G proteins to which CysLT receptors are linked are sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), whereas others are not. This indicates that different signal transduction pathways can be initiated by CysLT receptors, thus enabling this receptor type to mediate a variety of functional activities in the same cell (8Sjölander A.

DuBois R.N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and the observation that colon cancer is underrepresented in populations treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12Ekbom A. Helmick C. Zack M. Adami H.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1228-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in previous experiments using nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells (13Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we found that prolonged exposure to LTD4 resulted in up-regulation of several proteins associated with colon carcinogenesis, among others cyclooxygenase-2, β-catenin, and the cell survival protein Bcl-2 (13Öhd J.F.

Commun. 2003; 302: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that the CysLT1 receptor is up-regulated in colon cancer tissues and that LTD4 signaling facilitates survival of colon cancer cells (15Öhd J.F. Nielsen C.K. Campbell J. Landberg G. Löfberg H. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and nontransformed epithelial cells (13Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings are interesting because both cyclooxygenase-2 and CysLT1 are accessible targets for drug therapy. In addition to its effect on survival, LTD4 can induce a proliferative response in intestinal epithelial cells via a signaling pathway that includes activation of a PTX-sensitive G protein, PKCϵ, Raf-1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 (16Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjölander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that the inflammatory mediator LTD4 can contribute to increased survival and growth of intestinal epithelial cells in pathological inflammatory conditions, although the effectors situated downstream of ERK1/2 have not been identified.Considering the ways in which ERK1/2 can mediate its effect on proliferation and survival in intestinal epithelial cells, two major downstream targets/substrates are of particular interest: the p90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Experiments performed in vitro and in vivo have revealed that ERK1/2 can interact and directly phosphorylate p90RSK on several different serine and threonine residues (17Chung J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The protein p90RSK is unique among serine/threonine kinases in that it contains two functional kinase domains (19Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that regulation of the N-terminal catalytic domain of p90RSK is mediated by activation of the C-terminal catalytic domain that occurs through MAPK-induced phosphorylation (17Chung J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The other potential target/substrate of ERK1/2 which might mediate the effect of this protein on intestinal cell proliferation is CREB. The C terminus of CREB contains a basic DNA binding domain and an adjacent leucine zipper domain, the latter of which is required for dimerization of CREB (20Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). CREB also has a transactivation domain that contains several independent regions, including one identified as the kinase-inducible domain, which comprises consensus phosphorylation sites for several kinases, among them protein kinase A (PKA) (21Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Kinase-induced phosphorylation of Ser133 on CREB facilitates attachment of this protein to the 256-kDa CREB-binding protein (CBP). The CREB·CBP complex can, in turn, interact with and activate the basal transcription machinery (21Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple signaling pathways can mediate the phosphorylation and activation of CREB in different cell lines. Transcriptional activation of CREB, through phosphorylation of the Ser133 residue, can obviously be induced by the catalytic subunit of the PKA (21Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). However, additional serine/threonine kinases, such as PKC (22Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p38 MAPK (23Swart J.M. Bergeron D.M. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2311-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMK; 24), a Ras-dependent p105 kinase (25Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and, interestingly enough, also p90RSK (22Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to phosphorylate and activate CREB. In some cases, several of these kinases can participate in the same agonist-induced signaling pathway; for example, engagement of the T cell receptor leads to a rapid phosphorylation and activation of CREB via a signaling cascade that involves stimulation of the tyrosine kinase p56lck, PKC, Ras, Raf-1, ERK1/2, and p90RSK2 (26Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The participation of PKC isoforms in activation of CREB is particularly interesting because we have shown previously that the LTD4-induced proliferative response in intestinal epithelial cells is mediated via activation of PKCϵ (16Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjölander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). PKCs are members of a family of serine/threonine kinases that have been shown to modulate diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and gene activation (27Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). There are at least 11 isoforms of PKC, which are classified as conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (δ, ϵ, θ, η), and atypical (ζ, ι/λ), and also PKCμ. Upon activation, the individual isoforms can exert unique effects in the cell. In NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of PKCϵ has been found to increase the growth rate, whereas PKCδ has the opposite effect (28Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pterce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCα has been implicated in an antiapoptotic response in COS-1 cells (29Whelan R.D. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).The present results show that LTD4 activates both CREB and p90RSK, but these effects occur via separate but parallel signaling pathways: for CREB a PKCα-dependent pathway, and for p90RSK a PKCϵ-Raf-1-ERK1/2 signaling cascade. Based on our observations in cells transfected with dominant-inhibitory mutant signaling proteins and in cells treated with pharmacological inhibitors, we conclude that, in intestinal epithelial cells, LTD4-induced activation of the PKCα-CREB signaling pathway favors survival, whereas simultaneous activation of the ERK1/2-p90RSK pathway mediates a proliferative response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Phosphospecific antibodies and total antibodies to p90RSK, CREB, p38 MAPK, and the inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.

ZM198,615 (ICI-198,615) was a gift from Dr. R. Metcalf (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.Cell Culture—Human intestinal epithelial cells (Int 407; 30) were used in all experiments. These cells, which exhibit typical epithelial morphology and growth, were cultured as a monolayer to ∼80% confluence for 5 days. Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, 55 IU/ml penicillin, and 55 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were tested regularly to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination.cDNAs and Transfections—Cells were transfected with different signaling protein constructs for 6 h and were then allowed to grow in medium supplemented with serum for another 24 or 48 h as indicated. The constructs we used were generously provided by the cited investigators: a full-length human HA-tagged dominant-negative Ras construct (N17 Ras; 31), EGFP- or Myc-tagged regulatory domains (RDs) of PKCϵ or α constructs (32Zeidman R. Pettersson L. Sailaja P.R. Truedsson E. Fagerstrom S. Påhlman S. Larsson C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or a W437 kinase-dead FLAG-tagged PKCϵ construct (K-PKCϵ), from Dr. Arthur Mercurio (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston); HA-tagged kinase inactive c-Raf construct (K-Raf-1), from Dr. Larry Karnitz (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN); a kinase-dead HA-tagged p90RSK (K-p90RSK), from Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston); a kinase-dead CREB construct (K-CREB), from Dr. Richard H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland). Transient transfections of the cells were achieved using 3.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 1.8 μg of plasmid DNA/ml of medium and were performed in serum-free medium, essentially according to the protocol provided by the supplier. In all transfection experiments, it was routinely confirmed that the empty vector had no effect, and the efficiency of transfection was determined by control cotransfections with an empty pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), except for the transfections with an EGFP-tagged RD of PKCϵ or α.Incubations and Lysis of the Cells—Cells in tissue culture flasks were preincubated with one of the following: the CysLT1 receptor antagonist ZM198,615 (50 μm, 15 min); the Gi/o protein inhibitor PTX (500 ng/ml, 2 h); the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm, 30 min); the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm, 30 min); the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm, 30 min); and then the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 (20 μm, 48 h); the CAMKII inhibitor KN-62 (10 μm, 30 min); the two PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Gö6976 (both 2 μm, 30 min). The cells in each of the flasks were subsequently stimulated with 80 nm LTD4 or 100 nm TPA in the absence or presence of the respective inhibitor for the indicated periods of time. The stimulation was terminated by adding ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Thereafter, the cells were kept on ice for 30 min in the lysis buffer, and the remaining cell debris was scraped loose from the bottom of the flasks into the buffer. The lysates were homogenized 10 times on ice with a glass tissue grinder (Dounce) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected, and the protein content was measured and compensated for and further processed for protein separation by gel electrophoresis.Gel Electrophoresis—Cell lysates were solubilized by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min in a sample buffer (final concentrations of the components: 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1.0% SDS, 10% glycerol, 15 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), and the solubilized proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10–12% homogeneous polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS.Immunoblotting—The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% non-fat dried milk at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody (diluted 1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were subsequently washed extensively and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit, anti-sheep, or anti-mouse antibody (1: 5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the membranes were washed extensively, incubated with ECL Western blot detection reagents, and finally exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL to visualize immunoreactive proteins. The phospho-p90RSK and phospho-CREB blots were routinely stripped and reprobed to determine the total amounts of p90RSK and CREB.Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown for 5 days. During the last 24 h of the incubation, the cells were cotransfected with dominant-negative K-p90RSK and EGFP vector or transfected with EGFP-tagged PKCα-RD as described above. Thereafter, the cells were serum starved for 2 h and stimulated with LTD4. The stimulation was terminated by fixing for 10 min at room temperature in a 3.7% paraformaldehyde and PBS solution, after which the cells were permeabilized in a 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS solution for 15 min. The coverslips were subsequently washed twice in PBS and incubated at room temperature in a 3% bovine serum albumin and PBS solution for 15 min, and the cells were stained for 1 h with a phosphospecific antibody against CREB. The coverslips were then washed six times in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer). The coverslips were thereafter washed six times in PBS and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO A/S). Samples were examined and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope, using a Plan-Apo 60× objective. Images were recorded with a scientific grade, charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and subsequently analyzed with HazeBuster deconvolution software (Vay Tek, Inc., Fairland, CT).Cell Counting and Thymidine Incorporation—The cells were cotransfected with dominant-negative K-p90RSK or dominant-negative K-CREB and EGFP vector or transfected with EGFP vector alone and allowed to grow for another 24 h in medium supplemented with serum as described above. Thereafter, the cells were serum starved and stimulated with LTD4 and or inhibitors as indicated in Fig. 6A. During the course of the experiment, fresh media, LTD4, and inhibitors were added every 24 h. To determine the number of viable cells, counting was done in the presence of 0.2% trypan blue after treatment for the periods of time indicated in Fig. 6A. For thymidine incorporation, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and cotransfected as described above or incubated with the indicated inhibitors. In the case of transfected samples, cells were either transfected with empty vector or with the vector indicated for 6 h and were then allowed to grow for an additional 24 h in medium supplemented with serum. Cells were then stimulated with LTD4 for 48 h, and cellular DNA synthesis was assayed by adding 0.5 μCi of 3H-labeled thymidine during the last 24 h of stimulation. Cells were washed twice with PBS, treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min, and then lysed in 1 m NaOH. The level of radioactivity, indicating the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, was measured using a β-liquid scintillation counter (LKB RackBeta, Wallace).Flow Cytometry—The cells were cotransfected with dominant-negative K-p90RSK or dominant-negative K-CREB and EGFP vector or transfected with EGFP vector alone and allowed to grow for another 24 h in medium supplemented with serum as described above. Thereafter, the cells were serum starved and stimulated with 80 nm LTD4 for 48 h in the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitors. During the course of the experiment, fresh media, LTD4, and inhibitors were added after 24 h. Cells that had spontaneously detached from the monolayer and were floating in the medium were collected by centrifugation and mixed with cells that had been detached from the same monolayer by the addition of trypsin-EDTA. These cells were slowly fixed by adding ice-cold ethanol while gently vortexing the sample. The DNA content of each sample (∼2 × 105 cells) was estimated by staining with propidium iodide using the Vindelöv reagent (33Gogal Jr., R.M. Smith B.J. Kalnitsky J. Holladay S.D. Cytometry. 2000; 39: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and then filtering (40 μm) the samples and quantifying the fluorescence by use of a Cell Quest FAC-Scan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Each measurement was based on analysis of 10,000 cells (events).RESULTSLTD 4 Induces Phosphorylations of p90RSK and CREB in a Time-dependent Manner—To examine the ability of LTD4 to activate p90RSK and/or CREB, we studied the effects of this leukotriene on the phosphorylation status of these two proteins. We found that LTD4 significantly increased the level of phosphorylation of both p90RSK and CREB. For p90RSK, the phosphorylation was rapid and transient (Fig. 1A), reaching a maximum (3.5-fold increase) after only 5 min and approaching the initial basal level after 90 min. By comparison, the LTD4-induced phosphorylation of CREB was also transient but had a slower onset, reaching a maximum level after 30 min and starting to decline after 90 min of exposure to the leukotriene (Fig. 1B). In our investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways involved in LTD4-induced activation of p90RSK and CREB, our first objective was to confirm the participation of a PTX-sensitive G protein in the initial signaling of LTD4. We incubated cells with 500 ng/ml PTX for 2 h and then stimulated them with LTD4 for 5 min (p90RSK) or 30 min (CREB). These periods of time were chosen because they represent the time required to reach maximum levels in p90RSK and CREB activities (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) and were subsequently used throughout this study when testing the effects of transfections and inhibitors on their activities. PTX inhibited the LTD4-provoked activation of both p90RSK and CREB (Fig. 1C), which agrees well with our previous observation that the LTD4-induced proliferative response in intestinal epithelial cells is mediated via a PTX-sensitive G protein (16Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjölander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of cell lysates show expression of both CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors in these cells (Fig. 1D). We therefore tested the sensitivity of the LTD4-induced p90RSK and CREB activity for the CysLT1 receptor antagonist ZM198,615. Our data show that the LTD4-induced activation of both p90RSK and CREB could be blocked by this antagonist, although at a relatively high concentration, 50 μm (Fig. 1E). Consequently, we cannot in the present study conclude whether the LTD4 effects are mediated via either or both the CysLT1 and the CysLT2 receptor. For comparison, we also examined the ability of LTB4 to activate p90RSK and CREB. It is cleat that LTB4 induces phosphorylation of both p90RSK and CREB to a degree similar to that of LTD4 (Fig. 1F). This finding is in good agreement with our previous observation that LTB4 also triggers a proliferative response in intestinal epithelial cells (34Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 507: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The total levels of p90RSK and CREB during the LTB4- and LTD4-induced stimulations were unchanged (Fig. 1, A–E).Fig. 1Time course of LTD4-induced activation of p90RSK and CREB. Int 407 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 80 nm LTD4 for the indicated periods of time and then lysed.

Classical NLSs are either monopartite sequences that contain a single cluster of basic amino acids (Lys/Arg) or bipartite sequences that contain two clusters of basic residues separated by an unconserved linker region. We have created mutations in conserved residues in each of the three NLS-binding sites/regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae karyopherin α (SRP1). For each mutant we have analyzed binding to both a monopartite and a bipartite NLS cargo in vitro. We have also expressed each karyopherin α mutant in vivo as the only cellular copy of the NLS receptor and examined the impact on cell growth and import of both monopartite and bipartite NLS-containing cargoes. Our results reveal the functional significance of specific residues within karyopherin α for NLS cargo binding. A karyopherin α variant with a mutation in the major NLS-binding site exhibits decreased binding to both monopartite and bipartite NLS cargoes, and this protein is not functional in vivo. However, we also find that a karyopherin α variant with a mutation in the minor NLS-binding site, which shows decreased binding only to bipartite NLS-containing cargoes, is also not functional in vivo. This suggests that the cell is dependent on the function of at least one bipartite NLS cargo that is imported into the nucleus by karyopherin α. Our experiments also reveal functional importance for the linker-binding region. This study provides insight into how changes in binding to cellular NLS sequences could impact cellular function.

In eukaryotic cells, cellular responses to extracellular signals often involve the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This transport occurs through nuclear pore complexes embedded within the nuclear envelope (1Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J.

The exchange of information entails both the import of signaling factors into the nucleus and the export of response molecules to the cytoplasm, both of which are highly regulated and selective processes (4Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The transport process is mediated by soluble receptors termed karyopherins, also known as importins and exportins, which carry cargoes into and out of the nucleus (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev.

General transport via karyopherin receptors requires direct binding of cargo to the karyopherin receptor. In the case of classical nuclear protein import, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; IBB, importin β binding; ARM, armadillo; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. within the cargo protein is recognized by an adaptor protein, karyopherin/importin α, which mediates binding to the transport receptor, karyopherin/importin β (8Enenkel C.

Classical NLSs are categorized as either monopartite, containing a single cluster of basic amino acid residues (K/R), or bipartite, containing two clusters of basic amino acid residues separated by a linker of 10–12 unconserved amino acids. The prototypical monopartite NLS is the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PKKKRKV), and the prototypical bipartite NLS is that of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKL) (10Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D.

For example, the most critical lysine (K ) defined in the monopartite NLS consensus (K (K/R)X(K/R) where X is any amino acid) is stabilized by three amino acid residues (Gly161, Thr166, and Asp203) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae karyopherin α (see Fig. 1A) (17Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Karyopherin α is composed of three domains, an N-terminal domain that mediates binding to karyopherin/importin β known as the importin β binding (IBB) domain, a large central NLS-binding domain that is composed of 10 armadillo (ARM) repeats, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with the nuclear export factor CAS/Cse1p (18Gorlich D.

Recent studies have provided a great deal of information about the molecular interactions between karyopherin α and NLS cargoes (13Conti E. Kuriyan J.

The resolution of the crystal structure of truncated S. cerevisiae karyopherin α with an NLS peptide revealed how the flexible ARM repeats create a binding groove for binding of both monopartite and bipartite NLSs (17Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies with the full-length mouse karyopherin α revealed that the structure and NLS binding mode are similar for vertebrate karyopherin α (14Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

The NLS-binding groove is lined by a regular array of conserved asparagine and tryptophan residues that is proposed to spatially orient and accommodate the lysine and arginine residues in an NLS (see Fig. 1A) (17Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In addition, the positively charged lysine and arginine residues of NLSs are stabilized by amino acids that line the binding pockets for each NLS residue (14Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The regular array of asparagine and tryptophan residues is interrupted by a conserved tyrosine and a conserved arginine (13Conti E. Kuriyan J.

Although the NLS interaction made by these two residues is not well defined, both of these residues are conserved across species (17Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The structural studies predict that three regions of the karyopherin α central ARM domain are critical for the direct interaction with classical NLS cargoes (see Fig. 1A) (14Fontes M.R. Teh T.

Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The major NLS-binding site, composed of ARM repeats 2–4, interacts with both monopartite NLSs and with the larger cluster of basic residues within bipartite NLSs. The minor binding site, composed of ARM repeats 7 and 8, interacts with the second smaller cluster of basic residues in bipartite NLSs. Finally, the two NLS-binding sites are linked by a less defined region, the linker-binding region, that is predicted to interact with the peptide backbone of the linker within a bipartite NLS (14Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 16Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D.A. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). More recent structural studies of mouse karyopherin α in complex with bipartite NLSs (of human retinoblastoma and Xenopus NIN2) suggest that the linker-binding region interacts with not only the backbone chain of the bipartite NLS linker but also with side chains of amino acid residues; however, the latter interactions appear to be specific to the individual NLS (16Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D.A. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the present study, we dissect the contributions of the different regions of the NLS-binding groove of karyopherin α to NLS binding using a combination of in vitro quantitative binding assays and in vivo functional tests in S. cerevisiae. For this study we have designed a series of NLS cargoes that can be used to compare quantitative binding to karyopherin α in vitro and NLS cargo targeting to the nucleus in vivo. Both the in vitro and in vivo NLS cargoes consist of the NLS sequence fused N-terminal to GFP such that the NLS is in the same context in both cargoes. This experimental design facilitates the direct comparison of the in vitro and in vivo data. We have created mutations in each of the three NLS-binding sites/regions in S. cerevisiae karyopherin α (SRP1). For each mutant we have analyzed binding to both a monopartite and a bipartite NLS cargo in vitro. We have also expressed each karyopherin α mutant in vivo as the only copy of the NLS receptor in the cell and examined the impact on cell growth and import of both monopartite and bipartite NLS containing cargoes. Our results reveal the importance of various residues within karyopherin α for binding to different NLS cargoes. A variant of karyopherin α with a mutation in the major NLS-binding site exhibits decreased binding to both monopartite and bipartite NLS cargoes, and this protein is not functional in vivo. However, we also find that a karyopherin α variant with a mutation in the minor NLS-binding site, which shows decreased binding only to bipartite NLS-containing cargoes, is also not functional in vivo. This suggests that the cell is dependent on the function of at least one bipartite NLS cargo that must be imported into the nucleus by karyopherin α. Our experiments also reveal functional importance for the linker-binding region. Finally, these studies have led to the creation of conditional alleles of karyopherin α with well characterized defects in NLS binding that will be useful for identifying and characterizing NLS cargoes. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast transformations and genetic manipulations were carried out by standard methods (25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Yeast strains and DNA plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Plasmids used for in vitro bacterial expression of truncated yeast karyopherin α, ΔIBB-Srp1p, were generated by subcloning ΔIBB-SRP1 variants (lacking residues 1–88) into the pProEX bacterial expression vector (17Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Plasmids used for in vitro expression of NLS-GFP (in pET28a) were previously described (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol.

Plasmids used for in vivo expression of Srp1p in yeast cells were created by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments, which contain the SRP1 coding region and its respective 5′ and 3′ genomic flanking regions, into the yeast vector pRS315 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids used for in vivo expression of NLS-GFP-GFP in yeast were made by subcloning PCR-amplified NLS-GFP fragments (from in vitro plasmids) in-frame using XbaI and ClaI restriction enzyme sites, into pAC825, which contains an additional copy of the C-terminal GFP (28Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In creating the in vivo NLS-GFP-GFP fusion protein, the His6 tag and 10 amino acids upstream of each NLS were removed; however, each NLS remains in the same context as the corresponding in vitro NLS-GFP fusion protein used for quantitative binding experiments.Table IYeast strains and plasmidsStrainsACY192MATα leu2Δ1 trp1 ura3-52 (33Winston F.

For all in vitro NLS binding experiments, we utilized yeast karyopherin α (Srp1p) that does not contain the karyopherin β-binding domain (ΔIBB-Srp1p), which binds NLSs with a similar affinity to full-length Srp1p in the presence of karyopherin β (26Fanara P.

The dissociation constants (Kd values) for the binding of monopartite and bipartite NLS-GFPs to ΔIBB-Srp1p were measured and calculated as previously described (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E.

Briefly, for each binding assay, a constant amount of the NLS-GFP cargo (∼20 nm) is titrated with increasing amounts of wild type or mutant ΔIBB-Srp1p protein. The change in anisotropy is then used to calculate the binding isotherm for each binding reaction and subsequently fitted by nonlinear regression to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) (15Hodel M.R.

For some weak binding variants (D203K and E402R), binding constants could only be estimated because the binding curves did not show an obvious inflection point. These binding constants were estimated based on the assumption that the binding isotherm would saturate at approximately the same anisotropy value as measured for other tighter binding variants. Binding reactions were maintained at 25 °C for most experiments, but some were also carried out at 37 °C as indicated. All of the binding constants were measured at least two times for each karyopherin α protein variant. For this study, we used three NLS-GFPs (SV40, BPSV40T3, and BPSV40A4), all of which bind with similar affinity to ΔIBB-Srp1p (see Fig. 1B) (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We employed SV40 to examine monopartite NLS binding in all experiments. To assay bipartite NLS binding to the mutant Glu402 and Tyr283/Arg321 ΔIBB-Srp1 proteins, we used the engineered BPSV40T3 NLS, which contains the classical threonine mutation at the critical lysine within the monopartite SV40 sequence (10Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Because residue Asp203 is predicted to stabilize this critical lysine, to assess the binding of the mutant Asp203 protein we used BPSV40A4 (alanine mutation at the second lysine residue within the NLS) instead of BPSV40T3 (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In Vivo Functional Assay—A plasmid shuffle assay was used to test the function of the various mutant Srp1 proteins. We used S. cerevisiae cells deleted for the endogenous wild type copy of SRP1 and maintained by a URA3 plasmid that contains an exogenous copy of SRP1 expressed from its own promoter (ACY324) (29Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To create and test the viability of cells containing only the full-length mutant Srp1 protein, ΔSRP1 cells were transformed with a LEU2 plasmid containing the mutant srp1. Immunoblot analysis of lysates of cells expressing each of the Srp1p variants demonstrated that all are expressed at approximately the same level as wild type Srp1p (data not shown). For growth analysis, cells were grown to saturation (∼2 × 108 cells/ml), serially diluted, and spotted onto selective medium or 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates, which select against the wild type SRP1-URA3 maintenance plasmid (30Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the cells on 5-FOA plates contain only the LEU2 test plasmid encoding the Srp1p variant. In Vivo Localization Assay—The localization of NLS-GFP-GFP in yeast cells was examined by direct fluorescence microscopy. SRP1-, srp1-D203N-, srp1-E402Q-, and srp1-Y283A/R321A-expressing cells were transformed with plasmids encoding NLS-GFP-GFP fusion proteins expressed from the inducible methionine promoter, pMET25 (Table I) (28Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in methionine-deficient medium (4–6 h) to induce the expression of the NLS-GFP-GFP fusion protein prior to visualization. Immunoblotting demonstrated that NLS-GFP-GFP cargoes were expressed at approximately the same level in all of the cells examined (data not shown). For temperature-sensitive srp1-E402Q yeast transformants, the cells were grown to log phase at the permissive temperature (25 °C) and then shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) for 2–4 h before viewing the cells. DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) to confirm the position of the nucleus (data not shown). Direct fluorescence images were captured using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a GFP-optimized filter and a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. To assess the functional consequences of mutations within the NLS-binding groove, we generated several variants of S. cerevisiae karyopherin α (Srp1p) and characterized them through a combination of in vitro binding assays and in vivo functional assays. For our mutational analysis, we have focused on four conserved residues within karyopherin α that represent different binding sites/regions within the NLS-binding groove: Asp203 of the major NLS-binding site, Glu402 of the minor NLS-binding site, and Tyr283 and Arg321 of the bipartite NLS linker-binding region (Fig. 1A). To define the function of each binding site/region, we analyzed these Srp1p variants by measuring binding to a monopartite NLS (SV40) and a bipartite NLS (BPSV40T3 or BPSV40A4), all of which bind to wild type Srp1p with comparable Kd values (Fig. 1B and Table II) (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, as a functional in vivo test, we assessed the ability of the various srp1 mutants to replace the essential SRP1 gene (31Yano R. Oakes M. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae. For srp1 mutants that could support cell growth, we then examined the steady state localization of both monopartite and bipartite NLS cargoes in cells expressing the mutant Srp1 protein as the only cellular NLS receptor.Table IINLS binding affinities of mutant Srp1 proteinsΔIBB-Srp1pNLSMP/BPTemperatureKd°CnmWild typeSV40MP2510 ± 4SV40MP3721 ± 7BPSV40T3BP2519 ± 8BPSV40T3BP3732 ± 7BPSV40A4BP255 ± 4D203KSV40MP25≥3000BPSV40A4BP25≥1900D203NSV40MP2566 ± 8BPSV40A4BP2513 ± 4E402RSV40MP2550 ± 8BPSV40T3BP25335 ± 35E402QSV40MP2522 ± 6SV40MP3731 ± 11BPSV40T3BP2533 ± 16BPSV40T3BP37165 ± 75Y283A/R321ASV40MP2525 ± 7BPSV40T3BP25"
https://openalex.org/W2043705194,"This study generated pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL)-null mice to test the hypothesis that PTL-mediated hydrolysis of dietary triglyceride is necessary for efficient dietary cholesterol absorption. The PTL – / – mice grew normally and displayed similar body weight as their PTL + / + littermates. Plasma lipid levels between animals of various PTL genotypes were similar when they were maintained on either a basal low fat diet or a western-type high fat/high cholesterol diet. Although the lack of a functional PTL delayed fat absorption during the initial hour of feeding a bolus load of olive oil containing [3H]triolein and [14C]cholesterol, the rate of [3H]triolein absorption was similar between PTL + / + and PTL – / – mice after the initial 1-h period. Importantly, comparison of fecal fat content revealed similar overall fat absorption efficiency between PTL + / + and PTL – / – mice. In contrast, the PTL – / – mice displayed significant decrease in both the rate and the amount of cholesterol absorbed after a single meal. The plasma appearance of [14C]cholesterol was found to be 75% lower (p < 0.0005) in PTL – / – mice compared with PTL + / + mice after 4 h. The total amount of [14C]cholesterol excreted in the feces was 45% higher (p < 0.0004) in PTL – / – mice compared with PTL + / + mice over a 24-h period. These results indicate that the delayed fat digestion due to PTL deficiency results in a significant reduction in cholesterol absorption, although other enzymes in the digestive tract may compensate for the lack of PTL in PTL – / – mice in fat digestion and absorption.

The digestion and absorption of dietary lipids is a process involving a multitude of steps in several different tissues. Fat digestion begins in the stomach, with a small amount of dietary triglyceride being hydrolyzed by preduodenal lipases and peristalsis (1Carey M.C. Small D.M. Bliss C.M. Am. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 651-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Miled N. Canaan S. Dupuis L. Roussel A. Riviere M. Carriere F. de Caro A. Cambillau C. Verger R. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The undigested lipids are delivered to the intestinal lumen as crude lipid emulsion particles (3Hernell O. Acta Pediatr. Scand. 1990; 365: 20-27Crossref Google Scholar, 4Hernell O. Staggers J.E. Carey M.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2041-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5Carey M.C. Hernell O. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1992; 3: 189-208Google Scholar). These emulsion particles consist of a core of dietary triglyceride with a monolayer of phospholipids, cholesterol, and free fatty acids (1Carey M.C. Small D.M. Bliss C.M. Am. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 651-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Within the lumen of the intestine, hydrolysis of the lipid emulsion particles proceeds via the action of pancreatic enzymes. The digested products are mixed with biliary phospholipids and bile salts to form micellar structures or complexed with phospholipids in vesicles. Solubilization of the lipolytic products of fat digestion, cholesterol, and other dietary components is essential because all are minimally soluble in aqueous systems and are dependent upon the detergent properties of bile acids for dispersion in the intraluminal environment. Once solubilized, the digestion products are taken up by the enterocyte and packaged into lipoprotein particles for delivery throughout the body.Numerous biochemical and genetic studies suggested that cholesterol absorption is a protein-mediated process. Most of these studies have focused on the process of cholesterol transport across the brush-border membrane of the enterocyte (6Dawson P.A. Rudel L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The role of proteins that mediate intraluminal lipid digestion in influencing cholesterol absorption is less understood. Earlier studies have documented that the removal of the pancreas resulted in dramatic reduction of cholesterol absorption by the intestine (7Gallo L.L. Newbill T. Hyun J. Valhouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1977; 156: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies suggested the importance of pancreatic lipolytic enzymes in dietary cholesterol absorption. Of these enzymes, cholesterol ester lipase (CEL) 1The abbreviations used are: CEL, carboxyl ester lipase (cholesterol esterase); PLA2, phospholipase A2; PTL, pancreatic triglyceride lipase; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride.1The abbreviations used are: CEL, carboxyl ester lipase (cholesterol esterase); PLA2, phospholipase A2; PTL, pancreatic triglyceride lipase; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. and Group 1B phospholipase A2 (PLA2) have been proposed to have a direct role in controlling cholesterol absorption via their enzymatic activities (8Bhat S.G. Brockman H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Lopez-Candales A. Bosner M.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1197-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, data from CEL and PLA2 knockout mice showed that intestinal cholesterol absorption was similar to wild-type mice indicating that these enzymes do not have a major physiological role in mediating cholesterol absorption in vivo (12Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Richmond B.L. Boileau A.C. Zheng S. Huggins K.W. Granholm N.A. Tso P. Hui D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1193-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In addition to CEL and PLA2, the pancreas also secretes pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) in response to a lipid meal (14Brannon P.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 85-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This protein is a member of the lipase gene family and has been shown in association with colipase to be the primary enzyme in the digestive tract capable of hydrolyzing triglycerides in emulsified lipid particles (15Lowe M.E. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1524-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether PTL also participates in cholesterol absorption has not been explored. Previous in vitro experiments using an intestinally derived cell line have suggested that PTL-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis was necessary for cholesterol transport from emulsions to intestinal cells (16Young S.C. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting an in vivo role for PTL in cholesterol absorption is provided by reports of decreased cholesterol absorption in animals fed the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin (16Young S.C. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Hogan S. Fleury A. Hadvary P. Lengsfeld H. Meier M.K. Triscari J. Sullivan A.C. Int. J. Obes. 1987; 11: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hauptman J.B. Jeunet F.S. Hartmann D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1992; 55: S309-S313Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this reagent is nonspecific and is capable of inhibiting several lipases, including PTL, CEL, and other related enzymes (19Hadvary P. Lengsfeld H. Wolfer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez E. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these results support the hypothesis that remodeling of core neutral lipids of lipid carriers may be necessary prior to absorption of dietary cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract.The goal of the present study is to determine the role of PTL in dietary lipid absorption in vivo. Specifically, we generated mice containing a null mutation of PTL to test the hypothesis that fat and cholesterol absorption efficiency is correlated to the efficiency of luminal lipid digestion, which is in turn dependent on the activity of PTL in the intestinal lumen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTargeting Construct and Generation of Pancreatic Triglyceride Lipase-null Mice—A rat PTL cDNA clone was obtained from Dr. Patsy Brannon (Cornell University) and used to screen a 129 mouse genomic library made in λ-DASH phage vector that was obtained from Dr. Thomas Doetschman (University of Cincinnati). A positive clone that also hybridized with probes corresponding to 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the rat PTL gene showed that the mouse PTL gene spans over 20 kb in length. Genomic clones that hydridized with oligonucleotide primers with specific sequences for the authentic PTL gene, but not the sequences for pancreatic lipase-related protein-1 and -2 (21Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G914-G921PubMed Google Scholar), were selected for propagation and further characterization.A 4-kb BamHI-digested DNA fragment, encoding sequences from intron 1 to intron 6 of the mouse PTL gene, was obtained from the original λ clone and inserted into a similarly digested PTZ18U plasmid to generate PTZ-mPTL. Restriction digest of the recombinant plasmid vector revealed the absence of an XhoI restriction site. A specific XhoI recognition sequence was introduced into exon 4 of the mouse PTL gene by the site-specific oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis technique of Zoller and Smith (22Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA (New York). 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), as described previously (23DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb XhoI-SalI-digested DNA fragment, containing a thymidine kinase promoter-driven neomycin-resistant gene, was then isolated from pMC1Neo-PolyA (Stratagene; Cedar Creek, TX) and inserted into the mutagenized PTZ-mPL plasmid at the unique XhoI site in exon 4 of the mouse PTL gene. This procedure resulted in a disrupted mouse PTL gene with 2.4-kb PTL sequence upstream of the insertion site and 1.6-kb PTL sequence downstream from the neomycin gene cassette insert (Fig. 1A). The insertion of the TK-neomycin-resistant gene into exon 4 resulted in the disruption of the PTL gene preceding domains required for PTL enzymatic activity (24Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Lowe M.E. Rosenblum J.L. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20042-20048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Targeted inactivation of the PTL gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were performed using R1 ES cells as described previously (12Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Approximately 5.5 × 107 ES cells in 0.5 ml of culture medium were electroporated in the presence of 3 pmol of the PTL-targeting DNA construct using an IBI GeneZapper 450. Surviving cells were placed in selection medium containing 400 μg/ml of the neomycin analog G418. Resistant colonies were picked after 10 days and expanded individually in 96-well dishes. Genomic DNA from the targeted ES cells was digested with PstI, radiolabeled with 32P, and hybridized with a 5′ probe from the targeting DNA. This hybridized with a 5.4-kb fragment in wild-type DNA. Homologous recombination at the endogenous PTL gene locus yielded a positive signal at 4.7 kb due to the insertion at the PstI site present in the thymidine kinase promoter of the neomycin-resistant gene cassette (data not shown). The PTL gene-targeted ES cells were microinjected into 4.5-day blastocysts collected from C57BL/6 mice. The embryos were transferred into the uterine horn of (C57BL/6 × C3H/HeN) F1 pseudopregnant females to generate chimeric mice. Chimeras were identified by PCR. The positive chimeric mice were mated with Black Swiss mice to test for germ line transmission of the ES cell genome. Agouti pups were screened by PCR analysis. Ear punch tissue DNA was obtained by proteinase K digestion. Two μl of the DNA sample was used for PCR analysis. Primers used for the PCR (Fig. 1A) are as follows: primer 1, 5′-GCTACTGGAAGAAACGCGAC-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCCTTTGTCCTCCTCAGTTG-3′; primer 3, 5′-CTCGTCCTGCAGTTCATTCA-3′. Each reaction contained 2.5 μm of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP (Invitrogen), and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. All reactions were prepared on ice, preheated to 94 °C for 5 min, and subjected to 30 cycles of amplification consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. Samples were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1B). The predicted size from the PCR primers is 250 bp for the wild-type exon 4 and 500 bp for the exon 4 containing the neo insert. Heterozygotes from different parents were mated to obtain mice with homozygous disruption of the PTL gene.Animals and Diets—All animals used in these studies were backcrossed five times into the C57BL/6 background. The mouse colony was maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and fed a rodent chow (LM485; Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI) with free access to water. In some experiments, mice were fed a western-type high fat/high cholesterol diet containing 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol by weight (TD88137, Harlan Teklad) for 4 weeks. Body weights were recorded at weaning (3 weeks of age) and again at 6 weeks of age. Food intake measurements were performed as described previously (26Huggins K.W. Boileau A.C. Hui D.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E994-E1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati.Pancreatic Triglyceride Lipase Determination—Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the abdominal cavities opened. The pancreas was removed and homogenized on ice in a solution containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 1.5% glycerol, and 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided into aliquots and stored at –80 °C. Total pancreatic protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Pancreatic triglyceride lipase protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. Forty μg of pancreatic protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) using the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (0.45 μm, Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (0.025 m Tris, 0.19 m glycine, 20% methanol). The PVDF membranes were then blocked with Blotto (5% non-fat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary PTL antibody, produced against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 38–59 of mouse PTL, was diluted 1:1000 in Blotto and incubated with the PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times for 10 min each with Blotto. The secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; Amersham Biosciences) was diluted 1:5000 in Blotto and incubated with the PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).Triglyceride hydrolysis activity in the pancreatic extracts was determined as described previously (29Lowe M.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μCi of [3H]triolein (Amersham Biosciences) was dried under a stream of nitrogen in a glass tube and resuspended in 5 ml of assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 mm taurodeoxycholate) containing 1.56 μmol of triolein (final concentration = 0.312 mm). The mixture was vortexed and sonicated for 3 min to generate an emulsion. Forty five μl of the radiolabeled substrate emulsion was added to separate glass tubes on ice. Five μl of pancreatic extract from PTL +/+, PTL + / –, and PTL –/– mice were then added to each tube. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 volumes of chloroform/methanol/heptane (125:140:100; v/v/v), followed by 5 volumes of 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10.5. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged for phase separation. The amount of radiolabeled fatty acid liberated from [3H]triolein hydrolysis was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the aqueous phase. In selected experiments, taurodeoxycholate was replaced with taurocholate in the assay buffer.Plasma Chemistries—Plasma was obtained by low speed centrifugation of the blood samples after a 5-h fast (beginning at 9:00 a.m.). Plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were determined using a colorimetric assay kit from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA).Rate of Postprandial Fat and Cholesterol Absorption—Male mice (6–8 weeks old) consuming a low fat chow diet were fasted overnight. The following morning, the mice were injected with 12.5 mg of Triton WR-1339 (Sigma) to block lipolysis (30Aalto-Setala K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten minutes later, the mice received an intragastric load of 100 μl of olive oil containing 1 μCi of [3H]triolein, 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol, and 2 mg/ml cholesterol (Sigma). The mice were allowed access to water but not food during the course of the experiment. Blood samples were taken 1, 2, and 4 h post-gavage by tail bleeding to detect the appearance of radioactivity in the plasma. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of the 4-h period. The small intestines were removed, divided into 4 equal pieces, and flushed with excess saline. The intestinal segments were homogenized in saline, and an aliquot was taken for radioactivity determination.Total Cholesterol Absorption from Bolus Meal—Cholesterol absorption studies were performed on 6–8-week-old male mice consuming a basal low fat diet by using the procedure described previously (12Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Zilversmit D.B. Hughes L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 465-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the mice were transferred to metabolic cages 24 h prior to the beginning of experiments. Each mouse received, by stomach gavage, a bolus test meal (100 μl) of 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol, 2 mg/ml cholesterol, and 0.5 μCi of [3H]sitostanol (Amersham Biosciences) in olive oil or 100 μl of phospholipid vesicles prepared as described previously (13Richmond B.L.

The mice were returned to their metabolic cages, where they had free access to food and water. Feces were collected over a 24-h period. After collection, the feces were homogenized in water and then extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). An aliquot of the organic phase from each sample was used for scintillation counting to determine the amount of radioactive sterols excreted in the feces. Cholesterol absorption efficiency was determined as a percentage of the administered dose absorbed after determining the amount of nonabsorbed cholesterol present in the feces, corrected for recovery based on the amount of [3H]sitostanol present in each sample, using the formula described by Grundy et al. (32Grundy S.M. Ahrens Jr., E.H. Salen G. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 374-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as follows: {1 –((3H dpm)/(14C dpm) in feces)/((3H dpm)/(14C dpm) in administered dose)} × 100. In a separate set of experiments, cholesterol absorption experiments were performed as stated above, except that the fecal samples were collected for 24 or 96 h and saponified as described previously (33Wang D.Q.-H. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1042-1059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Fecal Cholesterol Excretion—Feces were collected over a 72-h period from individually housed mice fed a chow diet. The feces were combined, dried, weighed, and ground into a powder. A 1-g aliquot was saponified with 5 ml of alcoholic KOH at 65 °C for 2 h. Five ml of water were added, and lipids were extracted with 15 ml of petroleum ether containing 1.0 mg of stigmastanol (Sigma) as an internal standard. The amount of cholesterol was quantitated by gas chromatography (GC) analysis as described previously (34Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fecal Lipid Analysis—Feces were collected from mice fed the low fat chow and western diet (4 weeks) over a 24-h period. The stool samples were dried to a constant weight in a vacuum oven, and the lipids were extracted from 100 mg of dried feces (35Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E.

Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight; Fort Dodge Laboratories, Inc., Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (16 mg/kg; The Butler Co., Columbus, OH) diluted in 0.9% NaCl. An upper midline incision was made, and the gallbladder was exposed. The common bile duct was ligated, and the gallbladder was cannulated with a polyethylene catheter. Hepatic bile was collected for 1 h by gravity. Bile was stored at –20 °C until analysis. At the end of the 1-h collection period, the livers were removed, and ∼250-mg samples were saponified as described above to determine hepatic cholesterol concentrations. Biliary cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol were determined by gas chromatography as described previously (34Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total and individual bile salt concentrations were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (39Rossi S.S. Converse J.L. Hofmann A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 589-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All results are presented as means ± S.D. Differences between genotypes were determined by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was accepted as a statistically significant difference between two groups. All statistical analysis was completed using the SigmaStat software from Jandel (San Rafael, CA).RESULTSAppropriate gene targeting for ablation of PTL protein expression was confirmed by analysis of pancreatic homogenates from PTL + / +, PTL + / –, and PTL – / – mice for the presence of PTL. Western blot analysis indicated no PTL expression in the homogenates of the PTL – / – mice. The levels of PTL protein in pancreatic extracts of the PTL + / – mice were approximately half those of the PTL + / + mice (Fig. 2A). When the pancreatic extracts were assayed for triglyceride hydrolytic activity, significant decreased [3H]triolein hydrolytic activity was observed in extracts of PTL + / – and PTL – / – mice compared with those of PTL + / + mice (Fig. 2B). However, significant triglyceride hydrolytic activity was still observed in the extract of PTL-null mice when the assay was performed in the presence of taurocholate (Fig. 2B, open bars). Because CEL in the pancreas is also capable of triglyceride hydrolysis, in a manner that is dependent on the presence of trihydroxylated bile salt, [3H]triolein hydrolysis was also assayed in the presence of taurodeoxycholate instead of taurocholate to determine specifically the contribution of PTL to triglyceride hydrolytic activity in the pancreas of the genetically modified mice. The results showed that hydrolysis of radiolabeled triglyceride was decreased ∼90% in the PTL – / – mice (Fig. 2B, filled bars). The PTL + / – mice had ∼50% PTL activity compared with the PTL + / + mice. These results confirmed the successful generation of PTL-deficient mice.Fig. 2PTL immunoblot and activity analysis. A, 40 μg of total pancreatic protein from each PTL genotype was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with anti-mouse PTL. B, total pancreatic protein was analyzed for PTL activity. The enzyme reaction was carried out by incubating 5 μl of pancreatic protein from each PTL genotype with 45 μl of lipid emulsion containing 1.56 μmol of triglyceride and [3H]triolein in the presence (open bars) or absence (closed bars) of taurocholate. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at room temperature. The liberated free fatty acid was counted for radioactivity, and data were normalized for total protein. Data are means ± S.D. for 3 mice per genotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Crosses between heterozygous PTL + / – mice yielded offsprings at the expected 1:2:1 ratio of wild-type to heterozygous to homozygous knockout genotypes. There were no differences in body weight at 3 or 6 weeks of age (Fig. 3), indicating normal growth and development in these animals. Food intake studies showed no difference between PTL + / + and PTL – / – mice (3.1 ± 0.5 versus 3.3 ± 0.2 g/day). There were also no differences in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations between PTL + / + and PTL – / – mice when they were fed either the low fat chow or after 4 weeks of feeding the western-type high fat/high cholesterol diet (Table I). Hepatic cholesterol concentrations were similar between the two groups of mice (Table II).Fig. 3Body weights of male PTL+/+, PTL+/–, and PTL–/– mice. Data points represent mean ± S.D. of body weight at 3 (filled bars) and 6 (open bars) weeks of age. Mice were bred from heterozygous matings. The numbers of mice from each genotype were as follows: PTL + / +, 13; PTL + / –, 19; PTL – / –, 10.

https://openalex.org/W2083188121,"We have demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) binds specifically to human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in a functionally relevant manner, both increasing plasminogen activation and decreasing tPA inhibition (Ellis, V., and Whawell, S. A. (1997) Blood 90, 2312-2322; Werner, F., Razzaq, T. M., and Ellis, V. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21555-21561). To further understand this system we have now identified and characterized the protein responsible for this binding. Rat VSMC were surface-labeled with 125I, and cell lysates were subjected to an affinity chromatography scheme based on the previously identified tPA binding characteristics. A single radiolabeled protein of 63 kDa bound specifically and was eluted at low pH. This protein was isolated from large scale preparations of VSMC and unambiguously identified as the rat homologue of the human type-II transmembrane protein p63 (CKAP4) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments. In confirmation of this, a monoclonal antibody raised against authentic human p63 recognized the isolated protein in Western blotting. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that p63 was located principally in the endoplasmic reticulum but was also detected in significant quantities on the surface of human VSMC. In support of the hypothesis that p63 is the functional tPA binding site on VSMC, an anti-p63 monoclonal antibody was found to block tPA binding. Furthermore, heterologous expression of an N-terminally truncated mutant of p63, which targets exclusively to the plasma membrane, led to an increase in tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation. Therefore, p63 on the surface of VSMC may contribute to the functional regulation of the plasminogen activation system in the vessel wall.

Plasmin mediates multiple effects in experimental models of vascular injury, including direct degradation of matrix components (7Drew A.F. Tucker H.L. Kombrinck K.W. Simon D.I. Bugge T.H. Degen J.L.

Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in the vessel wall, tPA also plays a prominent role. tPA has a very limited expression pattern in vivo but is expressed by VSMC and up-regulated in response to arterial injury, both in animal models (13Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 14Schafer K. Konstantinides S. Riedel C. Thinnes T. Muller K. Dellas C. Hasenfuss G.

The two plasminogen activators are differentially regulated in VSMC in response to vascular injury (13Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and observations in gene-ablated mice suggest that they have different roles in this response (14Schafer K. Konstantinides S. Riedel C. Thinnes T. Muller K. Dellas C. Hasenfuss G. Loskutoff D.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pericellular proteases involved in matrix degradation are often associated with cellular binding sites or receptors (6Ellis V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which localize them and potentially regulate their activity (17Bass R. Ellis V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best described example is the regulation of plasmin generation by the interaction of uPA with its specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cellular receptor uPAR (12Ellis V. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Bass R. Ellis V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Ellis V.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although uPAR is expressed by VSMC (20Reuning U. Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Bang N.U. Blood. 1994; 84: 3700-3708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have found that these cells also specifically bind tPA and that this binding regulates the functional activity of the bound protease by multiple mechanisms, potentially leading to greater levels of plasmin generation than those achieved by the uPA/uPAR system (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The interaction of tPA with VSMC displays unique characteristics. In addition to increasing the activation of cell-associated plasminogen by >100-fold (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bound tPA also becomes refractory to inhibition by its cognate inhibitor PAI-1 (22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This effect is not observed with other proteins known to stimulate tPA activity, including fibrin, and is due to the involvement of the catalytic domain in the binding. As a consequence, conformational changes in this domain caused by the binding of certain inhibitors render tPA unable to bind to VSMC (22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lysine binding kringle-2 domain of tPA, analogous to those of plasminogen and allowing tPA to interact promiscuously with proteins exposing C-terminal lysine residues, is not involved in the binding (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently tPA binding to VSMC is not competed by plasminogen, a phenomenon that limits the functionality of other proposed cellular binding sites for tPA. We have now isolated the protein that binds tPA on VSMC by using an affinity purification scheme based on these unique binding characteristics. This protein was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) as the type-II transmembrane protein p63 (Human Genome Organization (HUGO) gene name CKAP4, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4). Evidence that this protein is responsible for the specific binding of tPA includes the detection of p63 on the surface of VSMC by immunofluorescence microscopy, inhibition of tPA binding by a monoclonal antibody to p63, and a specific increase in tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation when overexpressed in COS cells. This represents the first demonstration of the direct involvement of a transmembrane protein in plasminogen activation and suggests that p63 may have an important role in the functional regulation of pericellular proteolytic activity in the vessel wall. Cell Culture—Human VSMC were prepared from aortic explants as described previously (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used between passage 2-6. Rat primary VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of Wistar rats by enzymatic digestion (23Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani F. Ropraz P. Gabbiani G. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and used between passage 4-7. The immortalized rat VSMC line, SV40LT-SMC (CRL 2018), was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to their recommendations. All cell culture media and sera were obtained from Invitrogen. Determination of Plasminogen Activation by VSMC-associated tPA—Plasmin generation by tPA bound to VSMC was determined as described previously (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 10 nm tPA (Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany) for 20 min, washed extensively, and incubated with 0.2 μm Lys-plasminogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Swansea, UK) and 0.2 mm H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). Plasmin generation was determined by continuous monitoring of fluorescence in a SPECTRAmax Gemini fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and expressed as ΔF/min. The binding of tPA was determined by varying the initial concentration of tPA (0-250 nm) as described previously (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated as the difference in plasmin generation in the presence and absence of 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid (ϵ-ACA). Data were analyzed by non-linear regression to obtain an apparent K d for tPA binding. Preparation of Affinity Matrices—tPA was first inactivated with either DFP (Sigma) or PPACK (Bachem) as described previously (22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Inactivated tPA was coupled to CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception that tPA was dissolved in 0.5 m sodium thiocyanate prior to coupling to aid solubility. Surface Iodination of VSMC—Ten T-175 flasks of VSMC approaching confluence (∼2 × 107 cells) were washed in serum-free medium and gently scraped from the culture flasks. The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of PBS at room temperature, labeled with 1 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h using Iodo-Beads (Pierce), pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 200 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were passed five times through a 25-gauge needle and solubilized for 30 min on ice before centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g. Affinity Isolation of 125I-labeled VSMC tPA Receptor—Cleared cell lysates were incubated with PPACK-inactivated tPA-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The non-binding supernatant was decanted and applied to a column of DFP-inactivated tPA-Sepharose. The column was washed sequentially with the buffers PBS, PBS containing 1 m NaCl, and PBS containing 100 mm l-lysine, all of which contained 0.1% Triton X-100, and was finally eluted with 0.05 m glycine, pH 3.0, and 1 m NaCl. Column fractions were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed, and resolubilized in SDS/PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 4-12% SDS/PAGE gels, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using BioMax MS film (Kodak). Purification of 63-kDa VSMC tPA Receptor—Large scale purification of tPA-binding proteins from rat VSMC was performed using 5 × 108 SV40LT-SMC cells. These were prepared in the same way as described above, with the exception that they were not radiolabeled and that cleared cell lysates were stored at -80 °C prior to further processing to allow accumulation of sufficient starting material. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein bands were excised. These gel plugs were washed, reduced, alkylated, and digested in situ with trypsin. The generated peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry on a Bruker REFLEX reflector time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Partial sequencing of individual peptides was performed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using a QSTAR quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (PE Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Mass spectroscopic analyses were performed by Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark. Peptide maps and sequence data were searched against non-redundant protein and expressed sequence tag data bases and also against rat genomic sequence data (BAC 2002-11-22 assembly, Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine). Immunoblotting—Fractions eluted from the DFP-tPA affinity purification step were subjected to SDS/PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to human p63 (a gift of Drs. Jack Rohrer and Anja Schweizer), peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, Ely, UK) and detected with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma). When eluted fractions were derived from surface-iodinated cell preparations, the blots were subsequently subjected to autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Subconfluent layers of human VSMC grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, blocked, and incubated at 4 °C with 1:100 G1/293, a monoclonal antibody to p63 (24Schweizer A. Peter F. Van P.N. Soling H.D. Hauri H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 366-370PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Controls included incubation with isotype-matched mouse IgG (DAKO) or secondary antibody alone. Mounted slides were visualized by epifluorescence, and images were captured digitally. Expression of Recombinant p63—COS-1 cells (CRL-1650, ATCC) at ∼80% confluency in 24-well plates were transfected using 3 μl of FuGENE-6 (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 μg of DNA per well with the expression plasmids pECE-p63 or pECE-Δ2-101AA (25Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Hauri H.P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) coding for wild-type human p63 and an N-terminal deletion mutant of p63, respectively. Cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection for tPA binding, cell surface plasminogen activation, and p63 immunofluorescence in the same way as described for VSMC. tPA Binding to VSMC—We have demonstrated previously that human VSMC bind tPA specifically and that this binding greatly stimulates the activation of cell-associated plasminogen (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The limited potential of these cells as a source for the isolation of the binding protein led us to investigate more suitable sources of starting material. Primary rat VSMC and the immortalized cell line SV40LT-SMC were found to have characteristics similar to those demonstrated previously for human VSMC. Bound tPA activated cell-associated plasminogen >90-fold more efficiently than plasminogen in solution (Fig. 1), primarily due to a reduction in the K m for plasminogen from >10 μm to 80 nm (data not shown), and the specific binding associated with this high-efficiency plasminogen activation had an apparent K d of 15 nm (Fig. 1, inset). Isolation of VSMC tPA-binding Protein—To identify the functional tPA binding protein, rat VSMC were surface-labeled with 125I prior to affinity chromatography of cell lysates on tPA-Sepharose. Preliminary experiments suggested that multiple proteins interact with immobilized tPA under these conditions, suggesting a relatively high level of nonspecific interaction. To overcome this, we sought to exploit two unique characteristics of the specific binding of tPA to VSMC that we had previously identified in functional studies. The first is its independence from the kringle-2 lysine-binding site (21Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second is the differential binding of two catalytically inactivated forms of tPA, i.e. DFP-inactivated tPA, which binds to VSMC, and tPA inactivated by the tripeptide chloromethane inhibitor PPACK, which does not (22Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To remove nonspecifically bound proteins, surface-labeled cell lysates were pre-adsorbed with immobilized PPACK-tPA, and the non-binding fraction was applied to immobilized DFP-inactivated tPA and washed extensively in lysine-containing buffer. The proteins remaining specifically bound were subsequently eluted at low pH (Fig. 2). The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, which revealed a single major radiolabeled band with a molecular mass of 63 kDa (Fig. 2, inset). To establish that this protein was distinct from the abundant proteins migrating with similar mobilities in the starting material and non-bound fractions, the latter were pooled and re-chromatographed. A greatly reduced level of radioactivity was eluted under these conditions (Fig. 2, open circles), which was not observable by autoradiography (data not shown), demonstrating that the specifically bound radiolabeled protein had been quantitatively bound by the affinity matrix. Therefore, in these experiments a radiolabeled 63-kDa protein, which did not bind to PPACK-inactivated tPA, bound specifically and quantitatively to DFP-inactivated tPA in a lysine-independent manner. Identity of the 63-kDa tPA-binding Protein—To identify the 63-kDa tPA-binding protein, large scale non-radiolabeled lysates of rat VSMC were prepared and subjected to the same chromatographic procedure. Specifically eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3, lane 1). Two bands were observed at 44 and 63 kDa, the latter major band corresponding to the single radiolabeled band observed by autoradiography. Both bands were excised from the gel, digested in situ with trypsin, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS. The peptide mass map obtained from the 63-kDa protein band contained 97 individual peptides masses, which, when searched against protein and expressed sequence tag data bases, identified the presence of two proteins. Seven of the peptide masses matched the sequence of a 66-kDa human type-II transmembrane protein known as p63 or CKAP4. Sequencing of six of the peptides by nano-electrospray tandem MS either confirmed their assignment or gave positive hits to mouse or rat ESTs homologous to p63. Subsequent searching of rat genome data revealed a p63 coding sequence which, when compared with the original peptide mass map, gave a greatly improved match with 32 of 97 peptides covering 52.2% of the sequence of a 63.6-kDa protein (Table I), unequivocally identifying this protein as the rat ortholog of p63 (sequence comparison is shown in the supplemental data available in the on-line version of the article). Fifteen of the remaining peptide masses matched the peptide map of a 69.8-kDa mouse RNA-binding protein, GRY-RBP (covering 29.7% of the sequence). This protein appeared to be a contaminant, as we failed to detect a GRY-RBP peptide mass signature in a second protein isolation, which included a more extensive lysine wash (Fig. 3, lane 2).Table ISequence assignments of tryptic peptides derived from the 63-kDa protein by mass spectrometryMeasuredCalculatedDifferenceStartresidueEndresidueSequenceDaDaDa800.415800.439−0.024552aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).558(K) GLLDDLR (N)845.371845.378−0.007120126(R) GHQDFSR (Q)849.383849.423−0.040379385(K) AFDELQK (Q)897.486897.503−0.017347353(R) LPEDIRR (L)932.431932.4200.011172179(K) EGESEINR (I)938.426938.4090.017422428(K) SQEYEQR (L)972.504972.524−0.020285292(R) ERDIEALK (S)985.560985.581−0.021327aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).335(R) LALQALTEK (L)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.1001.4621001.479−0.017119126(R) RGHQDFSR (Q)1081.5491081.577−0.028193aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).202(K) DLSDGIHVVK (D)1134.6021134.5520.050337346(K) LLQSEESSSR (L)1189.5851189.594−0.009253263(K) VASLEESKGDR (S)1251.7201251.6700.050528aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).539(R) TAVDSLVAYSVK (I)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.1284.6701284.704−0.034353362(R) RLEEELQQLK (V)1356.6311356.679−0.048363375(K) VGAHGSEEAVVFR (D)1438.6711438.6570.014208aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).219(R) DFTSLENTVEER (L)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.1532.7211532.793−0.072451464(R) SLEETQLALSSDLK (G)1546.7511546.835−0.084307aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).319(R) ELVSLKQEQQAFK (E)1707.7891707.825cMass calculated with oxidized methionine.−0.036379393(K) AFDELQKQMEGLGAR (L)1717.8941717.936−0.042142157(K) VQSLQAAVGTFESILR (S)1723.7711723.801−0.030206aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).219(R) ERDFTSLENTVEER (L)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.1732.8691732.911−0.042227241(K) SINDNIAIFTDVQKR (S)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.1743.7841743.799−0.015293307(K) SSLQTMESDVYTEVR (E)1759.7701759.794cMass calculated with oxidized methionine.−0.024293307(K) SSLQTMESDVYTEVR (E)1857.9121857.943−0.031337352(K) LLQSEESSSRLPEDIR (R)1919.9611920.068−0.083187203(K) LQNEILKDLSDGIHVVK (D)1920.9691921.076−0.107186aOriginal hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).202(K) LQNEILKDLSDGIHVVK (D)2014.0112014.044−0.033337353(K) LLQSEESSSRLPEDIRR (L)bPeptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.2145.0232144.9840.0391134(K) GGHGAASPSDKGAHPSGGADDVAK (K)2365.2192365.231−0.012429450(R) LAMLQEHVESLGPISDLASTVR (S)2381.2512381.226cMass calculated with oxidized methionine.0.025429450(R) LAMLQEHVESLGPISDLASTVR (S)2876.4042876.470−0.0663661(K) KPPPAPQQPQPPAPHPPQHPQNQAHR (G)a Original hits against human p63 (CKAP4) sequence (rat sequence numbering used here).b Peptide sequences confirmed by MS/MS.c Mass calculated with oxidized methionine. Open table in a new tab Identity of the 440-kDa tPA-binding Protein—The peptide mass map obtained for the 44-kDa protein, which was not labeled in the surface iodination experiments and was therefore most likely intracellular, was unequivocally identified as cytoplasmic β-actin (21 of 90 peptides matched covering 55% of the sequence, data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports of tPA binding to actin, a lysine-dependent interaction (26Lind S.E. Smith C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17673-17678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dudani A.K. Ganz P.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 95: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Presumably, the abundance of actin has allowed a small proportion of it to evade our attempts to exclude lysine-dependent binding proteins. Confirmation of the Specific tPA-binding Protein as p63—To confirm the identity of the specific tPA-binding protein as the rat ortholog of p63, 125I-labeled cell lysates were again subjected to DFP-tPA affinity chromatography, and elution fractions were probed by both autoradiography and Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against authentic human p63. The eluted protein was specifically recognized by the antibody (Fig. 4, top panel) and had an exact correspondence with the radiolabeled 63-kDa protein (top panel). Comparison of the loading and intensities of the various lanes suggest that p63 was quantitatively removed from the cell lysate by DFP-tPA affinity chromatography, reinforcing the conclusion that the 63-kDa radiolabeled protein does not represent a small proportion of a nonspecifically bound, highly abundant protein. p63 Is Present at the Surface of VSMC—Although a transmembrane protein, p63 has previously been reported to be retained in the ER (28Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2477-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that p63 was present on the surface of VSMC as suggested by the surface iodination experiments, human VSMC were probed with a p63-specific monoclonal antibody (G1/293) by immunofluorescence microscopy. Intact, non-permeabilized cells demonstrated a punctate cell-surface staining for p63, which was also apparent on permeabilized cells (Fig. 5). The latter also demonstrated extensive perinuclear staining consistent with ER localization. The specificity of the cell-surface staining was tested in control experiments using COS cells overexpressing wild-type human p63, which demonstrated only perinuclear staining (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (25Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Hauri H.P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). p63 Binds tPA on the Surface of VSMC—To determine whether p63 on the surface of VSMC was responsible for the binding that we identified originally, anti-p63 antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit tPA binding and subsequent cell-surface plasminogen activation. Fig. 6 shows that increasing concentrations of G1/293 led to a decrease in cell surfac"
https://openalex.org/W1975600674,"The eukaryotic cell monitors the fidelity of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and only permits properly folded and/or assembled proteins to transit to the Golgi compartment in a process termed “quality control.” An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal sensor for quality control is the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase that targets unfolded glycoproteins for transient, calcium-dependent glucosylation. This modification mediates glycoprotein interaction with the folding machinery comprised of calnexin or calreticulin in conjunction with ERp57. Two human UGT homologues, HUGT1 and HUGT2, exist that share 55% identity. The highest degree of identity resides in the COOH-terminal 20% of these proteins, the putative catalytic domain of HUGT1. However, only HUGT1 displays the expected functional activity. The contribution of the NH2-terminal remainder of HUGT1 to glucosyltransferase function is presently unknown. In this report we demonstrate that HUGT2 is localized to the ER in a manner that overlaps the distribution of HUGT1. Analysis of a series of HUGT1 and HUGT2 chimeric proteins demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of HUGT2 contains a catalytic domain that is functional in place of the analogous portion of HUGT1. Whereas neither catalytic domain displayed detectable activity when expressed alone, co-expression of either catalytic domain with the noncatalytic amino-terminal portion of HUGT1 conferred UDP-Glc binding and transfer of glucose that was specific for unfolded glycoprotein substrates. The results indicate that the amino-terminal 80% of HUGT1 is required for activation of the catalytic domain, whereas the homologous portion of HUGT2 cannot provide this function.

Proteins targeted to the extracellular environment, the plasma membrane, intracellular organelles, and the Golgi compartment are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CNX, calnexin; CRT, calreticulin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; HUGT, human UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; Man, mannose; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, Protein C; UDP-Glc, uridine diphosphate-glucose; UGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; 1Cat, first catalytic; 2Cat, second catalytic; 5-N3UDP-Glc, 5-azidouridine 5′-diphosphoglucose. in an unfolded state. Protein folding occurs as the polypeptide enters the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen with the assistance of molecular chaperones, including BiP, calnexin (CNX), and calreticulin (CRT) (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar). CNX and CRT are membrane-bound and soluble isoforms, respectively, of a lectin that promotes proper protein folding and disulfide bond formation through association with the protein-disulfide isomerase homologue ERp57 (2Wada I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate binding specificities of CNX and CRT are similar, if not identical, recognizing the glucose-α(1,3)-mannose glycosidic bond present on high mannose-containing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (5Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 6Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Upon translocation of proteins into the ER lumen, a 14-oligosaccharide core containing glucose3-mannose9-N-acetylglucosamine2 (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is added en masse to consensus asparagine residues (Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except Pro). Subsequently, the terminal glucose is cleaved by glucosidase I, and the remaining glucose residues are cleaved by glucosidase II (8Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). A monoglucosylated oligosaccharide is an intermediate in the trimming process and is the ligand for CNX and CRT interaction. CNX/CRT association prevents trafficking of unfolded glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi compartment as part of the cellular quality control mechanism. Glycoprotein release from CNX/CRT is associated with cleavage of the remaining glucose residue by glucosidase II. However, the folding status of the glycoprotein is not recognized by glucosidase II. It is the specific recognition of unfolded substrates by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGT), an enzyme that catalyzes the re-addition of a single glucose residue to Man7–9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide core structures, that mediates retention of glycoproteins in the ER for prolonged participation in the CNX/CRT cycle and completion of the folding process. UGT is a large glycoprotein (175 kDa) for which only a small region, the COOH-terminal catalytic domain, has a known function. The catalytic domain contains the DXD motif that coordinates donor sugar binding (9Tessier D.C. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although the catalytic residues involved in sugar transfer are unknown. Although additional domains have yet to be defined, recent work has provided insight into the function of the remainder of the protein. Significantly, data support that UGT specifically recognizes proteins in an advanced, although incomplete, state of folding (10Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ability to assess not only hydrophobicity of a substrate, but also globular structure, indicates that a complex recognition mechanism exists, perhaps spanning a large region of UGT that is difficult to define. In addition to glycoprotein folding status, UGT also recognizes the oligosaccharide to which glucose is transferred. Specifically, UGT recognizes the innermost N-acetylglucosamine of the substrate (11Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and prefers high-mannose structures containing 7–9 mannose residues (12Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest the participation of a binding pocket or cleft in the recognition of oligosaccharide structure for glucose transfer. Homologous bacterial glycosyltransferases comprised solely of the analogous catalytic domain share characteristics of substrate oligosaccharide recognition, but lack the requirement for detection of substrate folding status. These findings support the hypothesis that the primary function of the noncatalytic portion of UGT is to monitor protein folding status. Previously, two human sequences with homology to known UGTs from Drosophila and Schizosaccharomyces pombe were isolated, HUGT1 and HUGT2 (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although indistinguishable in size and highly identical (83%) to one another in their proposed catalytic regions, the human homologues are significantly dissimilar (49% identical) in their noncatalytic portions. In addition, HUGT2 does not display the defined glucosyltransferase activity characteristic of UGT homologues, whereas HUGT1 is a functional UGT. As a consequence, we hypothesized that the noncatalytic portion of UGT might define the nature of the catalysis mediated by the COOH-terminal domain. To test this hypothesis, we studied genetically engineered chimeras of HUGT1 and HUGT2 to elucidate the requirements for the noncatalytic portion to regulate UGT activity. Surprisingly, the results demonstrate that the noncatalytic portion of HUGT1 does indeed activate a glucosyltransferase activity for both the HUGT1 and HUGT2 catalytic domains. Design of Constructs—Previously described HUGT1 and HUGT2 constructs in pEDΔC (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were modified by sequence replacement with fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction or by restriction endonuclease digestion. PCR fragments were designed to contain, at their ends, sequence-specific restriction endonuclease digestion sites for ligation. All DNA constructs incorporating sequences generated by PCR were verified by DNA sequence analysis. All constructs, except where noted, were tagged with the Protein C epitope to facilitate protein purification. The Protein C epitope mediates a calcium-dependent binding to an anti-Protein C antibody affinity matrix (Roche) that can be used for purification. The Protein C (PC) epitope, EDQVDPRLIDGK, was placed at the COOH terminus of each construct, just upstream of the 5 terminal amino acids (KREEL for HUGT1 COOH termini or THDEL for HUGT2 COOH termini) to maintain the ER-retrieval signal function. This was also true of the 1N80-PC and 2N80-PC truncations, in that the PC epitope, linked to the appropriate retrieval signal, immediately followed these noncatalytic sequences. The non-PC-tagged versions of these two constructs were equipped with retrieval signals as well. The 1(C80)-PC, 1Cat-PC, and 2Cat-PC constructs were each designed to contain a signal sequence for translocation into the ER lumen. The signal peptides of HUGT1 and HUGT2 (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were tethered directly to the sequences comprising the COOH-terminal 80% of HUGT1 or the catalytic domains of HUGT1 or HUGT2, and were predicted to be cleavable (SignalP server (14Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar)). Production and Testing of HUGT2 Antibody—The 16 COOH-terminal amino acids of HUGT2, HLENKKQDTILTHDEL, were chosen for synthesis of a multiantigenic peptide (Biomedical Research Core Facilities, University of Michigan). This peptide, in conjunction with Freund's adjuvant, was used to produce a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). The acidic multiantigenic peptide (9 mg) was conjugated to a 500-μl bed volume of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (3 ml total volume), and unbound peptide was removed with acid elution (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.02% NaN3). The antibody was precipitated from serum overnight with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and affinity purified with acid elution (buffer same as above). Elution fractions were neutralized in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, and fractions with highest titer were dialyzed against 1× PBS. COS-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with 6 μg of pEDΔC (backbone vector), HUGT1, or HUGT2 per 10-cm dish. Each plate additionally contained 2 μg of the pEDpur vector to permit selection of transfected cells with puromycin. Puromycin was added 36–41 h post-transfection for a period of 24 h. Lysates were then collected in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of total lysate was analyzed per sample (polyclonal rat antibody αGT333 for recognition of HUGT1 kindly provided by Armando Parodi) and the HUGT1 and HUGT2 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100. Secondary goat α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used at a dilution of 1:5000, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). For immunofluorescence, transfected cells were split onto coverslips in 6-well plates at 36 h post-transfection. HUGT2 was transfected alone or co-transfected with HUGT1-PC. Immunostaining and fluorescence analysis was performed as before (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with few exceptions. The HUGT2 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100, as was the mouse monoclonal antibody to Protein C (catalog number 1814508; Roche). A third, monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing the KDEL retrieval signal (catalog item SPA827; Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) was used at a dilution of 1:200 to display ER localization. Primary antibodies were left on cells overnight. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-mouse and Texas Red-conjugated α-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were employed at 1:500 dilutions, and a 1:10,000 dilution of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to demonstrate nuclear staining. Cells were viewed with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope at ×60 magnification. Purification of PC-tagged Constructs—COS-1 cells co-transfected with the pEDpur plasmid and pED or PC-tagged constructs (method same as described above) were washed twice with cold 1× PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease inhibitors (same buffer as above). Each lysate was cleared of cellular debris and added to a 50-μl bed volume of α-Protein C affinity matrix (catalog number 1815024, Roche). For highest affinity interaction with the resin, the lysates were exposed with agitation at 4 °C overnight. They were then washed with four 1-ml aliquots of cold lysis buffer and eluted at 4 °C in 50–100 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. EDTA dissociates the Protein C epitope from the affinity matrix. UGT Assay—For each activity assay, a solution of 20 mg/ml thyroglobulin in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was injected into a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) and denatured overnight at room temperature in 8 m urea, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The cassette was dialyzed against a solution of 25 mm Tris-HCl maintained on ice at 4 °C for 5 h, with a change of solution after 1 h. Constructs were either purified on α-PC-Sepharose (Roche), or were tested directly from cell lysate (1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, as above). Each reaction contained 5 μm UDP-[14C]Glc (303 mC/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μl of dialyzed thyroglobulin, and up to 10 μl of eluted construct or up to 5 μl of cell lysate to maintain a final Tris-HCl concentration of 10 mm in a total volume of 50 μl. Assays of cell lysate contained, in addition, 300 μm deoxynojirimycin. Samples were precipitated with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 0.5 h and labeled thyroglobulin was collected on 25-mm GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman) on a Millipore 1225 sampling manifold (Millipore). Filters were washed with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, cold 100% ethanol, and acetone. Filters were dried and subjected to liquid scintillation for determination of 14C incorporation. Four samples were processed per construct per experiment: duplicate samples for each of 2 volumes of eluate or lysate. Background radioactivity (measured in samples containing all components except enzyme) was subtracted from each reading, counts per microliter of eluate or per micrograms of lysate were determined, and the four samples were averaged. For eluted samples, Western blots of the proteins used for activity assay were analyzed by NIH Image software. This information was then used to determine the relative percentage of HUGT1 activity for each construct. Activities were determined after a 16-h incubation of substrate with enzyme to detect very low levels of activity. Therefore, the activity values do not represent a stringent kinetic analysis, but rather a value relative to wild-type HUGT1. Photoaffinity Cross-linking Analysis—Constructs purified on the basis of the PC epitope were combined with an equal volume of CaCl2, such that the final mixture consisted of the following: 25 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Each standard reaction was initiated by adding the components of the mixture to a tube containing the cross-linker, [β-32P]5-azidouridine 5′-diphosphoglucose ([β-32P]5-N3UDP-Glc, 1.8–2.6 Ci/mmol; Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc., Lexington, KY) in minimal volume, resulting in a final cross-linker concentration of 40 μm. After 1 min, samples were either maintained or exposed to UV with a hand-held 254-nm lamp (UVG-11; UVP, Inc., Upland, CA) at a distance of 4 cm for a period of 90 s. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid. For competition, cold UDP-Glc was added to the mixtures (final concentration, 0.2–1 mm) for 15 min prior to incubation with the cross-linker. The reactions then proceeded as above. Samples were processed for autoradiography by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (responsible for smeary background of samples in Figs. 3C and 5D) or with a gel-loading buffer modified by the addition of 4 m urea as described previously (15Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). The results shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5 are representative of two to three cross-linking analyses per construct in which consistent results were obtained.Fig. 5The noncatalytic portion of HUGT1 can activate UGT function of the HUGT1 and HUGT2 catalytic domains.

[35S]Methionine/cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then added for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator in a volume of 1 ml. Cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS, lysates were collected in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (same as above), and PC purification was performed as described above. Expression of HUGT2—To analyze HUGT2 expression and function, an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was produced that reacts with the unique carboxyl-terminal 16 residues of HUGT2. The specificity of the antibody for HUGT2 was analyzed by Western blot reactivity using extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with vector alone or with vectors directing expression of HUGT1 and HUGT2 (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for rat UGT1 detected increased levels of UGT1 specifically in HUGT1-transfected cells (lane 2, compare with lanes 1 and 3). In parallel Western blot analysis, HUGT2 antibody reacted uniquely with HUGT2 and not with HUGT1 (lane 6, compare with lane 5). In addition, the HUGT2 antibody detected the endogenous COS-1 cell UGT2 (lanes 4 and 5). The UGT2 signals in extracts from vector-transfected cells were likely specific, as stripping and reprobing with secondary antibody alone did not produce bands in this region (data not shown). In addition, unidentified bands in Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6, were attributable to the secondary antibody. These results demonstrate that the two polyclonal antibodies can distinguish between HUGT1 and HUGT2. The intracellular localization of HUGT1 and HUGT2 was analyzed in transfected COS-1 cells. Although the HUGT2-specific antibody did not detect endogenous UGT2 by this method, it did recognize overexpressed HUGT2 (Fig. 1, panels B and E). The cellular distribution of HUGT2 reactivity was compared with reactivity with an α-KDEL antibody (Fig. 1, panel C) that recognizes the ER markers BiP and GRP94 as well as an unidentified 55-kDa protein. Upon merging these images, it became apparent that the majority of HUGT2 co-localized with the ER marker proteins, although there were some differences in their ER distributions (Fig. 1, panel D). Because a similar distributional disparity was previously described for HUGT1 (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the expression pattern of HUGT2 was directly compared with that of a PC epitope-tagged HUGT1. Use of a PC-tagged form of HUGT1 was necessary because the rat UGT1 antibody, like α-HUGT2-peptide, was generated in rabbit and would not be distinguishable on the basis of reactivity to secondary fluorescence-labeled antibody. At the level of resolution achievable by light microscopy, the localization of PC-tagged HUGT1 (Fig. 1, panel F) was highly comparable with that of HUGT2 (Fig. 1, panel E) as evidenced by analysis of the merged images (Fig. 1, panel G). The Catalytic Domain of HUGT2 Can Replace That of HUGT1—Previous studies demonstrated that recombinant HUGT2 expressed in transfected COS-1 cells was not active under conditions where recombinant HUGT1 was active (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of distinct domains of the protein to catalysis, chimeras between HUGT1 and HUGT2 were constructed. Using sequence homology as a basis for comparison, both HUGT1 and HUGT2 were subdivided into 5 “domains” of approximately equal size (Figs. 2 and 3A). The initial set of chimeras was designed to determine whether or not the region of HUGT2 sharing homology with the highly conserved COOH terminus of active glucosyltransferases was competent for catalysis in the context of HUGT1. The first chimera, 1(80)/2(20)-PC, constituted an exchange of domain 5 of HUGT1, the catalytic domain, for domain 5 of HUGT2 on the full-length HUGT1 sequence (Fig. 3A, line III). PC refers to the Protein C epitope that was chosen for its ability to be dissociated from antibody following immunoadsorption. The numbers in parentheses refer to the approximate percentage of each molecule represented in consecutive amino acid sequence. The catalytic domain 5 is defined as previously described (13Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) on the basis of homology to sequences and structural information for members of the most closely related glycosyltransferase family (Family 8 (16Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar)). A second chimera, 1(60)/2(40)-PC (Fig. 3A, line IV), extended the analysis to include domain 4 of HUGT2 in the swap in the event that the proposed catalytic domain was not inclusive of all residues required for UGT function. To control for the possibility that the absence of the HUGT2 function was attributable to a catalytic mutation, the chimeras 2(80)/1(20)-PC and 2(60)/1(40)-PC were constructed to replace the COOH-terminal region of HUGT2 with the analogous portions of HUGT1 (Fig. 3A, lines V and VI, respectively). Recombinant proteins were purified from transfected COS-1 cell extracts by PC affinity chromatography and yields were measured by Western blot analysis using antibody that reacts with the PC tag (Fig. 3B). The UGT activities relative to that of wild-type HUGT1 were determined and normalized to PC epitope reactivity. Of the four chimeras, only the chimera containing the NH2-terminal 80% of HUGT1 adjoined to the catalytic domain-like portion of HUGT2, 1(80)/2(20)-PC, displayed activity in the standard assay (Fig. 3A, line III). An HUGT1 construct truncated after domain 4 (1N80-PC), and therefore missing the proposed catalytic domain, was not active (Fig. 3A, line VII), suggesting that the activity obtained from 1(80)/2(20)-PC required the catalytic domain-like region of HUGT2. Finally, the construct 1(60)/2(20)/1(20)-PC was also inactive (Fig. 3A, line VIII), suggesting that the subcatalytic region, domain 4, of HUGT2 may be defective for UGT activity. Analysis of the activity of chimeric constructs in cell lysates not subjected to the immunoprecipitation process generated similar relative amounts of activity, demonstrating that there was no loss of activity during the purification procedure (not shown). To determine whether HUGT2 was inactive because of a defect in UDP-Glc binding, binding to a photoaffinity cross-linker, [β-32P]5-N3UDP-Glc, was measured. With the notable exception of 1N80-PC (Fig. 3C, lane 23), only those constructs displaying glucosyltransferase activity bound the cross-linker at levels above background (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5 and 11 to lanes 8, 14, 17, 20, and 26). Cross-linker binding required exposure to ultraviolet light (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5, 11, and 23 to lanes 4, 10, and 22, respectively) and was partially competed by the presence of a 5-fold excess of unlabeled UDP-Glc (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5, 11, and 23 to lanes 6, 12, and 24, respectively), demonstrating specificity. Comparison of the relative protein levels evidenced by Western blot analysis in Fig. 3B to the labeling intensities in Fig. 3C demonstrated that the absence of cross-linking was not because"

Recent results revealed that a portion of cellular Arl2 and its binding partner, BART, localize to mitochondria. Because ∼90% of cellular Arl2 is cytosolic, we investigated properties of the soluble protein and found that it is stably bound in a complex that migrates in gel filtration medium with a predicted molecular mass of ∼300 kDa. This complex was purified ∼500-fold from the soluble fraction of bovine brain.

The presence of more than one PP2A B-type subunit and the low stoichiometry of Arl2 indicate that the purified preparation still contains a mixture of complexes that cannot currently be completely resolved. Thus, although all the soluble Arl2 in bovine brain is in high molecular mass complexes, only a portion of the total cellular cofactor D and PP2A are associated with the Arl2. We further show that the Arl2 in the complex cannot bind GTP and that complexed cofactor D does not efficiently participate in tubulin refolding reactions in a manner comparable with free cofactor D.

Although the Arfs share a number of conserved activities and >60% sequence identity, the Arls are more divergent in both sequence (40–60% identity to each other or to any Arf) and function. For example, Arl2 shares 45% identity to Arf1 yet lacks each of the biochemical activities previously ascribed to Arfs. Arl2 is notable for a number of unusual features within the Arf family, including the apparent lack of N-terminal myristoylation, rapid and phospholipid-independent binding of GTP, and association with mitochondria (1Sharer J.D. Shern J.F. Van Valkenburgh H. Wallace D.C. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 2002: 71-83Google Scholar, 2Van Valkenburgh H.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first Arl2 effector described, BART (binder of Arl2; 20 kDa) (3Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), binds to Arl2·GTP with high affinity (KD = ∼20 nm) and also partially localizes to mitochondria. The BART·Arl2·GTP complex can bind the inner mitochondrial membrane protein, adenine nucleotide transporter 1, in in vitro assays (1Sharer J.D. Shern J.F. Van Valkenburgh H. Wallace D.C. Kahn R.A.

In contrast to these data implicating a role for Arl2 (and BART) in mitochondrial function(s), a number of genetic studies point to roles for Arl2 in microtubule dynamics. The Arl2 ortholog in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cin4p, is encoded by one of three nonessential genes isolated from screens aimed at identifying mutations with altered responsiveness to microtubule-directed stress (cold or benomyl) (8Hoyt M.A. Stearns T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Later, all three genes were shown to be involved in microtubule stability (9Hoyt M.A. Macke J.P. Roberts B.T. Geiser J.R. Genetics. 1997; 146: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A very similar story emerged from studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Arl2 ortholog, Alp41, was identified as an essential gene required for microtubule dynamics and the establishment of growth polarity (10Radcliffe P.A. Vardy L. Toda T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This screen also identified orthologs of the tubulin folding chaperones cofactor D (Alp1) and E (Alp21). Tubulin folding and the formation of polymerization-competent αβ tubulin heterodimers is a complex process that requires the sequential actions of the 800-kDa cytosolic chaperonin CCT (11Gao Y. Vainberg I.E. Chow R.L. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2478-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by interactions with five tubulin-specific chaperones or cofactors, termed cofactors A–E (reviewed in Ref. 12Lewis S.A. Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified cofactors C–E participate in tubulin heterodimer formation through a step that involves the hydrolysis of GTP by β-tubulin (13Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of GTP serves as a switch for the release of the native tubulin heterodimer from a supercomplex containing cofactors C–E and α- and β-tubulin. In addition, cofactors C–E can act on native tubulin heterodimers, such that the supercomplex is reformed. This cycle (termed the back-reaction) is thought to constitute a quality control mechanism that serves to continuously monitor the guanine nucleotide hydrolytic activity of β-tubulin in the heterodimer. The biological significance of this process lies in the fact that the ability of β-tubulin to hydrolyze GTP is an essential property for the proper functioning of microtubule dynamics. The same reaction also serves to regulate microtubule dynamics by modulating the availability of GTP-bound heterodimers (14Tian G. Bhamidipati A. Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 73-104Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Direct, biochemical evidence for a role of Arl2 in the complex process of the regulation of the action of one of these cofactors, cofactor D, was provided by Bhamidipati et al. (16Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This study indicated direct binding between Arl2 and cofactor D in mammalian cells and demonstrated the existence of a tubulin destruction pathway under regulation by Arl2. These observations raise the important possibility that the tubulin folding chaperones not only act in the biosynthesis of functional tubulin heterodimers but are also capable of reversing that final step to unfold and degrade tubulin, potentially as a means of modulating microtubule dynamics. In this report, we describe the copurification from cytosol of a ∼300-kDa complex that is coenriched for cofactor D, heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the entire cytosolic pool of Arl2. Heterotrimeric PP2A consists of a ∼63–65-kDa scaffolding A subunit, a regulatory B-type subunit, and a ∼36-kDa catalytic C subunit, all of which are highly conserved in eukaryotes. Only two isoforms exist each for the A and C subunits, which comprise the core PP2A enzyme. The B-type subunits exist as multiple families (e.g. B, B′, B″, and B′′′), each containing multiple members, which can be expressed in a tissue-specific manner and at distinct times during development (17Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The importance of PP2A activity to cellular activities is highlighted by the fact that papovavirus tumor antigens (small and middle T antigens) can serve as B-type subunits (18Pallas D.C.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the PP2A trimer is largely determined by the B subunit. This can result either from the influence of the B subunit on the substrate specificity or through its impact on the localization of the PP2A trimer. A large number of binding partners and cellular targets for PP2A phosphatase are known. Given the previously published genetic data implicating Arl2 in microtubule dynamics, it is worth noting that tubulin and the microtubule associated protein tau have each been shown to be targets of PP2A (24Hiraga A.

Immunoblotting was performed after resolution of proteins in denaturing 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 mA overnight. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence and captured on film. Purification of Arl2 Complex—Soluble proteins were isolated from various bovine and rat tissues (obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals) by first suspending the tissue in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). Similar results were obtained from the different tissues tested. Homogenization with a polytron was then performed for 5 min at high speed at 4 °C. The tissue lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble fraction (S100) was then obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The S100 was used immediately or quickly frozen and stored at –80 °C. Bovine brain S100 was sequentially precipitated in increasing (NH4)2SO4. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to S100 (500 ml) to bring the concentration to 20% and then stirred at 4 °C for at least 1 h or overnight. After clarifying by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was collected, and the process was repeated in 40% (NH4)2SO4. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A to a volume of 250 ml and applied to a 500-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, washed with buffer A, before a linear salt gradient (100–500 mm NaCl) was applied in a total volume of 800 ml. The fractions were assayed for the presence of Arl2 by immunoblotting, as described below. No Arl2 was found in the flow-through or buffer A wash fractions. A single peak of Arl2 was found to elute at a salt concentration of ∼220 mm. Fractions containing ≥50% peak level of Arl2 were pooled and applied to a column containing 10 g of Macro-prep ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 10–400 mm K2H(PO4) in buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing the Arl2 were detected by immunoblot, and the peak fractions were pooled. The sole Arl2 peak eluted at phosphate concentrations of 70–100 mm. The pool from the hydroxyapatite column was applied to a 20-ml cation exchange column (Fractogel EMD SO3 S (Fractogel S); Merck) previously equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl. The column was washed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min before beginning a linear gradient of 25–500 mm NaCl. The Arl2 eluted as a single peak in the range of 50–100 mm NaCl. The peak fractions from the Fractogel S column were pooled and concentrated to 250 μl and then applied to a 24-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated and developed in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and Arl2 was assayed by immunoblot. The peak fractions were pooled and quickly frozen for storage at –80 °C. During purification we routinely pooled fractions containing ≥50% of the maximal activity (Arl2 immunostaining). The protein profile from the final step in such a preparation is shown in Fig. 2, and the purification is summarized in Table I.Table IPurification scheme for the Arl2 complex from bovine brainChromatographic stepPooled proteinArl2 recoveredFold purificationArl2 recoverymgμg%S100210021100(NH4)2SO4 (20-40%) pellet8641.4270DEAE-Sephacel1740.7435Hydroxyapatite (80 μm)340.41220Fractogel S28.80.351217Superdex 2000.40.250010 Open table in a new tab Mass Spectroscopic Identification of Proteins—The slowest migrating species in the complex was reasoned to be cofactor D from published data, and this was confirmed by immunoblotting. All other major species found to copurify with Arl2 were identified by mass spectroscopy. Approximately 5 μg of total protein from the pooled peak from the Superdex 200 column was applied to a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were stained, and each band was excised. The proteins were digested in the gel pieces with sequencing grade trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted and desalted using a C18 zip tip (Millipore) and analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectroscopy at the Emory Microchemical Core Facility using a Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonics) as described by Hubalek et al. (33Hubalek F. Edmondson D.E. Pohl J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The time-of-flight MS ions were used to search the publicly available (All Taxa) proteome for significant matches using the ProFound search engine (prowl.rockefeller.edu). Further analysis was performed using post source decay (34Spengler B.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 1019-1036Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) on selected peaks (1–3 peaks/sample). The resulting spectra were analyzed using the MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com) and the NCBI nonredundant protein data base. Further analysis was performed on selected samples using a Q-Star Pulsar i (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) hybrid quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer interfaced with an Ultimate nano-HPLC system (LC Packings). The mass spectrometer was operated in information-dependant acquisition mode on the LC eluent, collecting both MS and MS/MS data. These MS and MS/MS data were analyzed using the ProID (Applied Biosystems) and MASCOT (www.matrixscience.com) search algorithms. Coimmunoprecipitation of Cofactor D—Purified bovine brain Arl2 complex (100 μg) in buffer A was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody 1D6. The immune complexes were precipitated by addition to 50 μl of pre-equilibrated protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed three times with buffer A before being resuspended in sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblot. Nucleotide Binding of Complexed Arl2—Binding of radionucleotides ([3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS) to Arl2 was determined as previously described (3Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using the filter trapping method to separate bound and free nucleotides. Binding of nucleotides to Arl2 in the complex was compared with that of purified recombinant Arl2. Bacterially expressed human Arl2 was purified as previously described (3Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tubulin Refolding Assays—Tubulin refolding assays were performed and analyzed as described by Bartolini et al. (36Bartolini F. Bhamidipati A. Thomas S. Schwahn U. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14629-14634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein Phosphatase Assay—A serine/threonine phosphatase assay system (Promega) was used to determine the specific activities for PP2A-containing complexes, according to the manufacturer's specifications. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. The optical density of products was determined using a plate reader to read the absorbance at 600 nm. The samples were compared with a standard curve of 0–4000 pmol of free phosphate. Cytosolic Arl2 Is Present in a High Molecular Mass Complex—Arl2 and its binding partner, BART, were previously shown to localize to mitochondria (1Sharer J.D. Shern J.F. Van Valkenburgh H. Wallace D.C. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 2002: 71-83Google Scholar). In that study it was noted that only a small fraction (estimated at 5–10%) of total cellular Arl2 was found to be associated with mitochondria, with the remainder appearing in the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g (100S) and thus assumed to be cytosolic. As an initial test of the properties of this soluble pool of Arl2, the 100S fraction from bovine brain was fractionated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Immunoblot assays revealed that Arl2 eluted as a single peak. Surprisingly, comparison of the migration of Arl2 to protein standards indicated that the Arl2 emerged from the column with an apparent molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 1). In contrast, the cytosolic BART migrated in a manner consistent with a monomeric 20-kDa protein. Purified, recombinant Arl2 has previously been found to migrate as a monomer in a number of different gel filtration media, suggesting that the high molecular mass species in which Arl2 is present in cytosol is not simply a homo-oligomeric form of Arl2. In addition, all other Arf family members, including the most closely related protein, Arl3 (data not shown), each migrate as monomeric species in gel filtration chromatography. The nature of this high molecular mass complex was therefore investigated further. The presence of Arl2 in a high molecular mass complex was also evaluated in S100 from a number of different tissue sources, including bovine liver and retina, rat brain and liver, and a panel of tissue culture lines, including COS-7, Sf295, HeLa, and normal rat kidney cells. In each case, the Arl2 was found exclusively in a complex that eluted in the same fractions as that of bovine brain S100 Arl2, shown in Fig. 1. Because it is the most abundant source of Arl2, brain was the source for most of the purifications performed. Purifications of the Arl2 complex were performed from bovine liver and retina and yielded results similar to those described below for bovine brain, although each was less pure than the final brain preparation. Purification of the Cytosolic Arl2 Complex—The fact that essentially all soluble Arl2 from bovine brain was present in the complex and that the brain extract could be stored on ice for at least a week with no change in the chromatographic behavior of the Arl2 suggested that the complex in cytosol was quite stable. No appreciable dissociation of Arl2 into monomer was found at any step during the purification. Despite the fact that Arl2 is most abundant in brain, at ∼0.0001% of soluble protein (estimated by immunoblot assay), Arl2 is much less abundant than Arfs (∼0.01–0.3% of total cell protein) and has never before been purified from any tissue. The cytosol from one calf brain contains only about 2 μg of Arl2 (Table I) and is most readily detected by immunoblot assays. Soluble Arl2 was purified from bovine brain by sequential chromatography after ammonium sulfate fractionation, using anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, cation exchange, and gel filtration media (see “Materials and Methods”). The purification scheme is summarized in Table I; the scheme allowed the purification of less than 1 mg of complex with about 10% recovery of Arl2 and resulted in a ∼500-fold increase in specific activity of Arl2. Note that immunoblotting was the sole assay used to locate the Arl2 throughout the purification process. Specific activity is defined as the amount of Arl2, determined by comparative immunoblotting using purified recombinant Arl2 as standard, divided by total protein. The recovery of Arl2 is consistent with losses resulting from pooling of peak fractions over multiple steps, although we cannot exclude the possibility of undetectable amounts of Arl2 being lost by dissociation from the complex. The protein profile from the peak fractions of the final (gel filtration) step in a preparation is shown in Fig. 2. Four proteins were found always to be present in the most highly enriched fractions and to have elution profiles essentially identical to that of Arl2. These four proteins also represent the most intensely staining components in the preparation and have apparent molecular masses of 130, 63, 56 (doublet), and 36 (doublet) kDa. The differences in migration of the two ∼56- and ∼36-kDa bands, referred to as doublets, varied between gels and preparations. The presence of an additional band, also often a doublet, at ∼43 kDa in SDS gels (seen faintly in Fig. 2) was often but not always observed. Its absence from some preparations and lower staining intensity in all indicate that it is not an obligate component in the complex (see below). Analysis of each obligate component in the Arl2 complex is presented below. Cofactor D—The protein migrating in SDS gels with an estimated molecular mass of ∼130 kDa was predicted to be the tubulin-specific chaperone, cofactor D, based upon its previously described binding to Arl2 (16Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding bovine cofactor D has been cloned and sequenced (accession number T18522) and predicts a protein product of 1199 amino acids with a molecular mass of 133 kDa. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to bovine cofactor D were used in immunoblots and confirmed the presence of cofactor D in our purified preparation of the Arl2 complex. Furthermore, Arl2 and cofactor D immunoreactivities had identical elution profiles in the final step of the purification of the complex (Fig. 3), and the intensity of signal in immunoblots always matched the intensity of dye binding of the ∼130-kDa band in SDS gels. PP2A—The most intensely staining (with Coomassie Blue or colloidal Coomassie stain) band in each preparation of the Arl2 complex was that migrating with a predicted molecular mass of ∼63 kDa in stained SDS gels. MALDI-MS/MS analysis identified 14 peptides with masses identical to those predicted from a tryptic digestion of murine PP2A-A subunit and covered >22% of the protein sequence. The only other match with a significant score from Prowl searching or to a mammalian protein was to a human keratin, a contaminant found in all of the bands analyzed. PP2A-A subunits are always found bound to the catalytic C subunits of PP2A or in a heterotrimer that also contains a regulatory B-type subunit. Mammals express two isoforms of PP2A A proteins, α and β, that are 87% identical. Ten of the 14 peptides found by MS are present in PP2A Aα but not β, and the other 4 peptides had sequences common to α and β isoforms. No PP2A Aβ-specific sequences were identified. Thus, PP2A Aα was present in the complex, but we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the β isoform was also present. The nomenclature for this family of proteins is confusing, but the A subunits (also termed PR65 or R1) are thought to serve as scaffolds that coordinate the binding of the catalytic C subunit with the much more diverse, regulatory B-type subunits. The human PP2A Aα protein (accession number P30153) is 589 residues in length and has been reported to migrate in SDS gels with an apparent molecular mass of between 61 and 65 kDa. Monoclonal antibody 4G7, specific to PP2A A subunit and reactive against the bovine protein, was used in immunoblots and confirmed the presence of this protein in the 63-kDa band excised from gels and its coelution with Arl2 in the gel filtration column at the end of the Arl2 complex preparation (Fig. 3). Protein(s) with apparent molecular mass of ∼56 kDa were also evident in the complex. This band actually appeared as a doublet, often more closely spaced than shown in Fig. 2. The preparation used for protein identification contained a very closely spaced doublet that was analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight MS, resulting in the identification of 15 peptides (accounting for 29% of the protein) with masses identical"
https://openalex.org/W2074866716,"Nonhomologous end joining is the most common mechanism of DNA double-strand break repair in human cells. Here we show that nonhomologous end joining can occur by two biochemically distinct pathways. One requires a fraction containing the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex. The other requires a fraction containing a novel, ∼200-kDa factor that does not correspond to any of the previously described double-strand break repair proteins. The two pathways converge, sharing a common requirement for the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex to catalyze the final step of phosphodiester bond formation. Whereas the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1-dependent pathway does not require, and may be inhibited by, DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation, the new pathway depends on this phosphorylation for release from a DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated reaction checkpoint. The existence of two distinct pathways, which are differentially regulated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase, provides a possible explanation for the selective repair defects seen in DNA-dependent protein kinase-deficient mutants.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; WRN, Werner syndrome gene product. mediate the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. Two different repair mechanisms protect against these effects (reviewed in Refs. 1Sonoda E. Takata M. Yamashita Y.M. Morrison C. Takeda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Homologous recombination, predominant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the G2 phase of the vertebrate cell cycle, uses a second, intact copy of a DNA as a template for repair of sequences spanning the break. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), predominant under most conditions in vertebrates, relies on direct ligation of DNA ends by a DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 (L4·X4) complex. The L4·X4 complex requires accessory factors for its activity, including the two subunits of Ku protein (Ku70 and Ku80), which bind tightly to DNA ends to form an initial complex. In S. cerevisiae, NHEJ also requires the M·R·X complex, composed of MRE11p, RAD50p, and XRS2p (reviewed in Ref. 3Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This multifunctional complex remodels and aligns broken DNA ends. The role of the M·R·X complex in other organisms is uncertain. The equivalent complex is not essential for NHEJ in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (4Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the equivalent complex is essential for cell viability in the absence of DNA damage, so its specific role in NHEJ is difficult to assess (5Xiao Y. Weaver D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita Y.M. Yagi T. Takata M.

Naturally occurring mutant alleles of two proteins in the complex, Mre11 and NBS1 (functional equivalents of yeast MRE11p and XRS2p, respectively), do not cause specific NHEJ defects, although they are associated with human genetic instability syndromes (8Varon R.

In vertebrates, NHEJ requires several proteins with no apparent orthologs in lower eukaryotes. These include the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which interacts with Ku and DNA to form an active protein kinase complex, and Artemis, which processes DNA hairpin ends. Human NHEJ also requires a new, as yet unidentified gene, which apparently does not correspond to any of the genes identified in yeast (10Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The requirement for additional proteins in vertebrates may reflect the larger genome size, where the increased likelihood of multiple, simultaneous breaks demands a more efficient NHEJ system. In yeast, NHEJ is a secondary mechanism of repair that comes into play only when homologous recombination is disabled. Understanding the relationship between vertebrate-specific NHEJ proteins, especially DNA-PKcs, and the more primitive NHEJ system in lower eukaryotes is a central challenge in the field. Do all of the proteins cooperate in a single pathway, or are there multiple pathways involving distinct sets of proteins, perhaps targeted at repair of different types of DSBs? It is notable that phenotypes of mutants in vertebrate NHEJ components vary in severity. Targeted disruption of genes encoding murine L4 and X4 causes death in utero (11Barnes D.E. Stamp G.

The graded severity of mutant phenotypes is consistent with the idea of branched NHEJ pathways with some requirements that are distinct and others that are common. Here we apply biochemical tools to investigate the relationship between proteins required for vertebrate NHEJ. We show that in vitro end joining catalyzed by the L4·X4 complex occurs by two biochemically distinct pathways. One is the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1-dependent pathway originally defined in yeast, the other involves a novel factor. The two pathways differ with respect to their requirement for DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation, but converge on a common requirement for the L4·X4 complex. Protein Purification—Recombinant L4·X4 complex and Ku heterodimer were prepared as described (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Extract from 50–100 liters of HeLa cell culture was applied to a 40-ml heparin-agarose column (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 0.1 m KOAc in DB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol and protease inhibitors) (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The column was eluted stepwise with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m KOAc in DB buffer. DNA-PKcs were purified from the 0.6 m fraction, dialyzed, and purified using a 20-ml Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted stepwise with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.85, and 1.0 m KOAc in DB buffer. The 0.5 m fraction was concentrated and subjected to Superdex 200 gel chromatography (HR 16/60 column, Amersham Biosciences). DNA-PKcs-containing fractions, which elute near the void volume, were pooled and stored at –80 °C. End joining factors were purified from the 0.4 m KOAc heparin-agarose fraction by Q-Sepharose chromatography as above, and the 0.3 m fraction was concentrated and subjected to chromatography as above. Immunoblotting was carried out as described (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) except that membranes were developed using an ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Artemis was raised in rabbits against an internal peptide. Antibodies to 53 BP1 and HDAC4 were a gift of G. Kao (University of Pennsylvania). Anti-DNA-PKcs (monoclonal antibody 18-2) and anti-Ku (monoclonal antibody 111 and N3H10) were from Neomarkers. Other antibodies were from commercial sources (M·R·N complex, SMC1, Rad51, WRN, Novus Biologicals; Rad21, Neomarkers; MDC1, a gift from S. J. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine). DNA End Joining—Assays were performed using 0.5 ng/μl radiolabeled linearized plasmid DNA with product analysis by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Gels were 0.6% agarose unless otherwise indicated. A Novel L4·X4 Stimulatory Activity Obtained from HeLa Cell Extracts—Extraction of proteins from HeLa cell nuclei and initial column fractionation were as described (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fractions were assayed for the ability to stimulate purified L4·X4, which is otherwise inactive with linear duplex substrates. Consistent with previous results, a fraction that eluted from heparin-agarose at 0.4 m KOAc strongly stimulated end joining activity (Fig. 1). Further chromatography on a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column resolved two activities, one eluting at 0.2–0.3 m and the other at 0.85 m KOAc. Although the 0.2 and 0.3 m fractions displayed some endogenous DNA ligase activity, much higher levels of activity were seen when the reactions were supplemented with exogenous L4·X4 complex (compare lanes 5 and 7 with 6 and 8, respectively). The 0.85 m fraction showed almost complete dependence on exogenous L4·X4 for activity (compare lanes 11 and 12). The requirement for L4·X4 demonstrates that end joining in this assay reflects bona fide NHEJ, as L4·X4 is the enzyme that catalyzes NHEJ in vivo. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of the fractions with exogenous L4·X4 indicates that the fractions contain primarily a stimulatory activity, rather than a DNA ligase per se. Previous work has shown that the ligase stimulatory activity of the 0.85 m fraction is attributable, in part, to the presence of the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 (M·R·N) complex (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of the M·R·N complex in the 0.5 and 0.85 m KOAc fractions. However, this complex, as well as its individual components, were absent from the 0.2 and 0.3 m fractions (Fig. 1D). Stimulatory activity of the 0.2 and 0.3 m fractions must therefore be attributable to a different factor or factors. Immunoblotting was performed to detect other known DSB repair proteins in the Q-Sepharose fractions. We probed with antibodies to the Werner syndrome gene product (WRN), which interacts with Ku in vitro (18Li B. Comai L. J. Biol.

We also probed with antibodies to the SMC1 and Rad21 subunits of cohesin, a protein implicated in DSB repair (27Kim J.S. Krasieva T.B. LaMorte V. Taylor A.M. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45149-45153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and to Rad51, a protein required for homologous recombination (28Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Except for traces of Rad51 in the 0.3 m fraction, none of these proteins was detectable in the 0.2 m-0.3 m region of the Q-Sepharose column profile. All of these proteins were detectable in unfractionated nuclear extract (Fig. 1D). Results suggest that activity of the 0.2–0.3 m fractions is not attributable to known NHEJ proteins. Differential Regulation by DNA-PKcs Phosphorylation—One of the goals of our study was to investigate the regulation of end joining by DNA-PKcs. DNA-PKcs phosphorylation dependence is a distinguishing feature that differentiates vertebrate NHEJ from the simpler process in S. cerevisiae and other model organisms. End joining was performed with various fractions in the presence and absence of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor, LY294002. End joining with the heparin-agarose 0.4 m KOAc fraction was partially inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 2, lanes 12 and 13). The activities that eluted in different regions of the Q-Sepharose profile, however, are oppositely regulated by LY294002. With only minimal levels of endogenous DNA-PKcs present, LY294002 partially inhibited activity of the 0.3 m fraction (lanes 4 and 5), and actually stimulated activity of the 0.85 m fraction (lanes 8 and 9). With addition of exogenous DNA-PKcs, inhibition of the 0.3 m fraction was more pronounced (lanes 6 and 7), whereas the effect on the 0.85 m fraction was unchanged (lanes 10 and 11). Results indicate that the new pathway, defined by the 0.2–0.3 m fractions, is significantly dependent on phosphorylation. In contrast, the M·R·N-dependent activity is not phosphorylation-dependent, consistent with previous results (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ability of LY294002 to stimulate activity in the presence of the 0.85 m fraction, which was somewhat variable between experiments, could reflect suppression of a competing, phosphorylation-dependent pathway. Further Purification of the Novel Activity—Because the 0.3 m fraction was contaminated with traces of DNA-PKcs and may have contained other interfering proteins, it was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. A peak of stimulatory activity eluted at a position corresponding to ∼200 kDa (Fig. 3), well separated from the void volume. The products in this experiment were primarily dimer and trimer products, although in other preparations, where the factor was more concentrated, higher order multimers were also present (see Fig. 5).Fig. 5Novel end joining factor alters the distribution of intramolecular versus intermolecular reaction products. End joining fractions were performed in the presence of Superdex 200 fraction containing novel repair factor, recombinant Ku (25 ng), L4·X4 complex (100 ng), and indicated dilutions of T4 DNA ligase (400 units/μl; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as indicated. Products were analyzed on a 1.0% SDS-agarose gel containing 1.0 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Inclusion of ethidium bromide permits resolution of covalently closed circular DNA from other forms. CC, covalently closed circular DNA; OC, open circular DNA. Figures at the bottom indicate -fold difference in activity in the bracketed lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The position of elution of activity on the gel filtration column effectively eliminates the possibility of cross-contamination with M·R·N or DNA-PKcs at levels below the threshold detectable by immunoblotting, as both proteins elute at or near the void volume under the conditions used (17Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Results also rule out the involvement of other large complexes, such as BASC, a supercomplex of BRCA1-associated proteins involved in DNA repair (30Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We were thus able to evaluate the requirement for the physical presence of DNA-PKcs separately from the requirement for DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation. DNA-PKcs Establishes a Reaction Checkpoint—The novel end joining factor was seen in the absence of DNA-PKcs and this activity was unaffected by LY294002 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). DNA-PKcs was separately purified from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 1A) and added to the reconstituted reactions. There was a small decline in basal activity, and reactions became strongly sensitive to LY294002 inhibition (lanes 9–12). Thus, physical presence of DNA-PKcs is not required for end joining, but when present, DNA-PKcs restricts the reaction, such that phosphorylation is required for further progression. We term this restriction a “reaction checkpoint” because it represents a point in the reaction pathway where traffic can potentially be halted or diverted (see “Discussion”). This experiment also shows that end joining activity with the more purified fraction is completely dependent on Ku and L4·X4 (lanes 3 and 4), thus eliminating any potential concerns about co-purification of endogenous ligases with the stimulatory fraction. A similar end joining experiment performed in the absence and presence of wortmannin, a different DNA-PKcs inhibitor, confirmed that phosphorylation activity is partially required whenever DNA-PKcs is physically present in the reaction (Fig. 4B). Mechanism of Action of the Novel Stimulatory Factor—Previous work has shown that human Rad50-Mre11 directly tethers DNA ends to each other in vitro (31de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This tethering provides a potential mechanism for the stimulatory effect of the M·R·N complex on L4·X4-catalyzed DNA ligation. It was of interest to determine whether the novel 200-kDa repair factor shared a similar mechanism of action. If the factor interacted directly with DNA, one prediction is that it might stimulate the activity of other ligases, in addition to L4·X4. Fig. 5 compares the effect of the 200-kDa repair factor on end joining catalyzed by L4·X4 versus a homologous ATP-dependent DNA ligase encoded by bacteriophage T4. Consistent with previous experiments, the factor stimulated L4·X4 activity more than 10-fold (compare lanes 1 and 2). The effect of the factor on T4 ligase activity was more modest (a 2–4-fold stimulation). However, there was a striking redistribution of the products in the T4 ligase reaction. In the absence of the factor, T4 ligase produced a preponderance of circular intramolecular ligation products, as expected at the low concentration of substrate DNA used in the reaction. In the presence of the factor, T4 ligase produced a ladder of concatenated product more typical of the eukaryotic end joining reaction. Thus, the mechanism of action of the factor appears to involve, in part, direct interaction with DNA, in addition to or instead of specific interaction with L4·X4. The effect of this interaction with DNA is to favor intermolecular over intramolecular ligation. We show that human NHEJ can occur by two biochemically distinct pathways that differ in their factor requirements and in their regulation by DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation, but converge on a common requirement for L4·X4 to catalyze the final step of phosphodiester bond formation. Results indicate the existence of a novel factor that does not correspond to previously defined NHEJ proteins. The current study also provides what is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation-dependent end joining in a system reconstituted from individual protein components. Surprisingly, we found that phosphorylation was required if and only if DNA-PKcs was physically present in the reaction. DNA-PKcs appears to arrest the reaction until phosphorylation occurs, establishing what may be termed a reaction checkpoint. The checkpoint is released upon receipt of some internally generated signal. Perhaps this signal is generated by the synapsis of opposing DNA ends, which triggers activation of DNA-PKcs in vitro (32DeFazio L.G. Stansel R.M. Griffith J.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Activation of DNA-PKcs could release the complex from its arrested state through phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs itself, XRCC4, or other targets within the repair complex (33Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 34Matsumoto Y. Suzuki N. Namba N. Umeda N. Ma X.J. Morita A. Tomita M. Enomoto A. Serizawa S. Hirano K. Sakaia K. Yasuda H. Hosoi Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A more subtle issue is why a phosphorylation-dependent checkpoint should occur at all in the NHEJ pathway. The existence of a checkpoint implies the possibility of alternate fates. It may be that a delay in phosphorylation, or phosphorylation of different targets within the repair complex, can divert the complex to a different DSB repair pathway. In this respect, it has been shown that the structure of DNA ends can influence the protein substrate specificity of DNA-PKcs (35Soubeyrand S. Torrance H. Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9605-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to learn if ends that require processing before joining influence DNA-PKcs substrate specificity in such a way as to activate accessory factors required for that processing (such as Artemis, required for hairpin ends) or to divert repair to the M·R·N-dependent or homologous recombination pathways. The novel 200-kDa repair factor produces a striking change in its ability to alter the distribution of intermolecular versus intramolecular products as seen with T4 ligase. In general, the rate of formation of intermolecular ligation products is directly proportional to molar DNA end concentration. In contrast, the rate of formation of intramolecular products is determined by polymer chain statistics, and in the range of interest declines with increasing DNA length (36Bloomfield V.A. Crothers D.M. Tinoco I. Nucleic Acids Structures, Properties and Function. University Science Books, Herndon, VA2000Google Scholar). It may be that the factor accelerates intermolecular DNA end joining by increasing the effective DNA end concentration. This could occur if the factor tethered DNA ends to each other, like the Mre11-Rad50 complex. An alternate possibility is that the factor alters the ratio of different products by inhibiting the intramolecular reaction. This could occur if binding of the factor stiffens the DNA chain, altering its conformation, and causing it to behave as if its length were greater. The active polypeptides in the novel 200-kDa fraction have yet to be identified. Because the factor is not yet pure, we cannot rule out the possibility that more than one component contributes to its activity. In particular, we cannot be certain that the component responsible for redistribution of T4 ligase products is the only factor required for stimulation of L4·X4 activity. Although the identification of these active component(s) will be required to demonstrate relevance of the factor to DSB repair in vivo, the ability of the factor to stimulate L4·X4, the dependence on Ku, and the regulation by DNA-PKcs all argue that the factor is likely to be physiologically relevant. One significant difference between the in vivo and in vitro results remains, however. In vivo, DNA-PKcs not only regulates end joining but also increases its efficiency. Physical absence of DNA-PKcs, as seen in null mutants, leads to a deficiency in DSB repair. Specifically, such mutants are impaired in the ability to rejoin radiation-induced DSBs and to form V(D)J coding joints, although they remain competent to form V(D)J signal joints and to repair etoposide-induced DSBs (13Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R759-R761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Jin S. Inoue S. Weaver D.T. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, physical absence of DNA-PKcs in the simplified in vitro system did not affect overall end joining efficiency. It may be that DNA-PKcs increases efficiency in vivo by recruiting processing enzymes required to join certain types of breaks, or by antagonizing negative regulators that are absent from the purified system. Because cohesive 5′-phosphoryl ends, used here, require no processing, and potential negative regulators have been removed by chromatographic fractionation, these functions might become dispensable in vitro. Data presented here may explain the phenotype of DNA-PKcs-deficient mice. Coding joint formation may require DNA-PK kinase activity to process the hairpin coding ends (probably with Artemis), whereas signal joint formation involves simple blunt-end ligation, for which DNA-PKcs may be dispensable.

V0V1-ATPases (V-ATPases) are the ATPase/ATP synthase superfamily that catalyzes the exchange of the energy between proton translocation across membranes and the energy of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis (1Forgac M.

In eukaryotic cells, V0V1-ATPases exist in both intracellular compartments and plasma membranes, and are responsible for the acidification of intracellular compartments, renal acidification, born resorption, and tumor metastasis (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most prokaryotic V0V1-ATPases produce ATP using the energy of a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient that is generated by a respiratory chain (4Grüber G. Wieczorek H.

The overall structure of V0V1-ATPases is similar to that of F0F1-ATPases (α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1a1b2c10-14), which are responsible for ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membranes of eubacteria (3Yoshida M.

Both are composed of two functional domains, the peripheral catalytic V1 or F1 and a membrane embedded ion translocating domain called V0 or F0. The structure and subunit arrangements of F0F1-ATPases are well characterized. The x-ray structure of F1 revealed a hexamer of alternating α and β surrounding a central cavity containing a highly α-helical γ subunit (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). The γ and ϵ subunit constituted a central shaft, which directly contacted with the c subunit ring in F0 (8Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The b subunit has a hydrophobic N-terminal domain anchored in the membrane, and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain forms an elongated peripheral stalk that interacts with the F1 moiety as a stator (9Suzuki T.

The a subunit in F0, which consists of a stator part together with b subunits, is situated peripherally to the c subunit ring and plays a crucial role in the proton translocation (3Yoshida M.

Like the F0F1-ATPases, the peripheral V1 part contains a catalytic core, which is composed of three copies each of A and B subunits. The A subunit contains a catalytic site, and the A and B subunits are arranged alternately, forming a hexameric cylinder. The D subunit, which fills the central cavity of the A3B3 cylinder, makes up a central shaft with the F subunit (12Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc.

The V0 moiety contains at least two kinds of hydrophobic proteins, proteolipid subunits and 100-kDa subunit. The V0V1-ATPases from yeast contains three members of the proteolipid family, which are predicted to contain at least four transmembrane helices, and they constitute a hetero-oligomer (14Hirata R.

Although no significant sequence homology was found between the 100-kDa subunit and F0-a subunit, several lines of evidence have suggested that the 100-kDa subunit might be a functional equivalent to F0-a subunit (18Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Based on the functional and structural similarity between V0V1-ATPases and F0F1-ATPases, it has been assumed that V0V1-ATPases would use a similar rotary mechanism as the F0F1-ATPases (3Yoshida M.

The central shaft composed of γ and ϵ subunits in F1 are directly associated with the c subunit ring in F0 (8Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Thus, the rotation of the central shaft in turn drives the rotation of the c subunit ring. This movement of the c subunit ring relative to F0-a subunit, which is kept fixed to the α3β3 hexamer by a peripheral stalk, is thought to be directly responsible for proton translocation (3Yoshida M.

Recently, we visualized the rotation of single molecules of V1-ATPase, establishing that V0V1-ATPases functions through a rotary mechanism (12Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S.

The T. thermophilus has a simple subunit structure, composed of nine different subunits, A, B, D, F, C, E, G, I, and L, with molecular sizes of 64, 54, 25, 12, 36, 21, 13, 72, and 8 kDa, respectively 1The recent versions of the nucleotide sequences, and protein sequences of each subunit have been submitted to GenBank™. The X subunit was termed as C subunit in that version and in this paper. (Table I). Although the molecular size of some subunits of T. thermophilus is smaller than that of eukaryotic counterparts, each subunit of T. thermophilus shows a sequence similarity to its eukaryotic counterpart (see Table I). For instance, the I subunit shows an overall sequence similarity to eukaryotic V0-a subunit (100-kDa subunit). Although the molecular size of the L subunit is ∼50% of the eukaryotic V0-c subunit (16-kDa proteolipid subunit), the L subunit shows an obvious sequence similarity to the V0-c subunit.Table IComparison between V 0 V 1-ATPase subunits in T. thermophilus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapienceYeast V-ATPaseIdentities between Tth V and yeast VT. thermophilus V-ATPaseIdentities between Tth V and human VHuman V-ATPase%%A (70 kDa)50A (64kDa)50A (68kDa)B (58 kDa)55B (54kDa)55B (57kDa)D (28 kDa)28D (25kDa)28D (28kDa)F (13 kDa)21F (12kDa)16F (13kDa)d (40 kDa)17C (36kDa)16d (40kDa)E (26 kDa)16E (21kDa)20E (26kDa)G (13 kDa)22G (13kDa)13G (14kDa)a (96 kDa)16I (72kDa)16a (96kDa)c (16 kDa)37L (8 kDa)37c (16kDa)c′ (17 kDa)c′ (17kDa)c″ (23 kDa)c″ (23kDa)H (54 kDa)H (55kDa)C (44 kDa)C (44kDa) Open table in a new tab The hydrophilic V1 part of T. thermophilus, which is ATPase-active and hence called V1-ATPase, is made up of four subunits with a stoichiometry of A3B3D1F1 (23Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G, E, and C subunits are also hydrophilic, but they are not contained in the V1 (23Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report isolation of several subcomplexes of V0V1-ATPases of T. thermophilus, and we propose subunit arrangement as well as rotor/stator identification in the complex. Construction of a His 8 -V 0 V 1 -ATPase, V 1 , Expressing T. thermophilus Strain—A mutant T. thermophilus strain, AH8, in which the atpA gene was replaced with a modified atpA gene encoding a His8-tagged A subunit, was constructed as follows. At first, an atpA-his 8 gene was constructed; the cloned atp operon was subjected to a PCR mutagenesis. The mutation primer was 5′ AAT GGA GGG ACG ATG ATC CAA CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAT GGG GTG ATC CAG AAG ATC GCG 3′. pUTpyrE, which carries the pyrE gene cassette, was constructed; the XbaI-EcoRI fragment containing the leuB gene of pT8leuB (25Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned in pUC119, and then the NdeI-EcoRI fragment was replaced with the NdeI-EcoRI fragment containing the pyrE gene of pINV (26Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence corresponding to a 1550-bp region, which is upstream of the atpA gene and includes the termination code of the atpF gene, was amplified with primers InteA5/5/Sph (5′-GGGCATGCGAGGTGGTGAGGAAACTGGCCCTG-3′), and InteA5/3/Sal (5′-GGTCGACTACAGCTTGATGTCAAAGCCGATGGTC-3′), followed by SphI and SalI digestion. The sequence corresponding to a 1750-bp region containing most parts of the atpA-his gene with its Shine-Dalgarno sequence was amplified with primers InteA/3/5/Eco5 (5′-GATATCTAGAATGGAGGGACGATGATCCAACAC-3′) and InteA/3/3/EcoR1 (5′-GAATTCCCCCTTTAGGCCAGCCTTGAAGGCCCC-3′), followed by EcoRV and EcoRI digestion. These two fragments were cloned in the SphI-SalI and the EcoRV-EcoRI sites of pUTpyrE, respectively. The resultant plasmid pyrE strain, T. thermophilus TTY1 (26Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was genetically transformed as described previously in order to insert the pyrE gene as a selective marker and to replace the original atpA gene on the chromosome with the modified atpA gene encoding the His-tagged A subunit (25Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on a minimum-medium plate without uracil. Chromosomal DNA was prepared from a transformed strain, AH8, and integration of the pyrE gene into the site between the atpF gene and the atpA gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Isolation of V 0 V 1 -ATPase, V 1 , and V 0—The recombinant T. thermophilus was grown as described previously (24Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (200 g) harvested at log phase growth were suspended in 400 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), containing 5 mm MgCl2, and disrupted by sonication. The membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and washed with the same buffer twice. The washed membranes were suspended in 20 mm sodium imidazole (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 10% Triton X-100 (w/v), and then the suspension was sonicated. The debris and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was applied onto a Ni-NTA superflow column (Qiagen, 3 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium imidazole (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (20-100 mm). The fractions containing the V0V1-ATPases were analyzed with PAGE in the presence of SDS-PAGE, and then were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 3 h. The dialyzed solution was applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m). The purity of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and/or PAGE in the presence of alkyl ether sulfate (Softy 12, LION corp., AES 2The abbreviations used are: AES, alkyl ether sulfate (Softy 12, LION); DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; FCCP, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol.-PAGE, Ref. 24Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each fraction containing V0V1-ATPases, V0, and V1 was combined and stored at 4 °C until use. Preparation of CL and IEG Subcomplexes from V 0—The V0 fraction was dialyzed overnight against acetate buffer, containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton, or urea buffer, containing 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100. The dialyzed solution was concentrated with ultrafiltration using Centricon (Millipore Corp.). The concentrated solution was subjected to FPLC with a Superdex HR-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer, and each fraction was analyzed by AES-PAGE. Each subcomplex was subjected to re-chromatography by FPLC with the Superdex HR-200. The fractions containing each subcomplex were combined and stored at 4 °C until use. Preparation of V 1 -CL Subcomplex—The V0V1-ATPase was dialyzed overnight against acetate buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100. The dialyzed solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and then subjected to FPLC with the Superdex HR-200 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The fractions were analyzed by AES- and SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the V1-CL complex were combined and stored at 4 °C until use. Reconstitution of V 0 into Liposomes and Measurement of Proton Permeability of the Liposomes—Proteoliposomes containing V0 were reconstituted according to the procedure by Richard et al. (27Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reconstitution was performed at 25 °C in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and 500 mm K2SO4. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation using phosphatidylcholine (type II, Sigma) and resuspended at a lipid concentration of 4 mg/ml. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 8 mg/ml. Then 10 μl of V0 solution (5 mg of protein/ml) was added to 850 μl of the liposome solution. N-Octyl-d-glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min. Then pyranine (excitation, 450 nm; emission, 510 nm) was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 0.2 μm. The detergent was removed by four successive additions of 80 mg/ml washed Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad). Two milliliters of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and 100 mm Na2SO4 were added to 200 μl of liposome solutions and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Valinomycin was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 20 μm, and then carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. Others—Chemicals used were reagent-grade and purchased from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), and bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. PAGE in the presence of SDS or AES was carried out as described previously (24Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purification of His-tagged V 0 V 1 -ATPase—To obtain a large amount of highly purified V0V1-ATPase from T. thermophilus, His8 tag was introduced at the N-terminal of atpA with a shuttle integration vector system (25Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The His-tagged V0V1-ATPase in the membranes was solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified with a Ni-NTA-agarose column. The AES-PAGE analysis revealed that V0V1-ATPase was the major component in the eluted fractions (Fig. 1a). Typically, ∼30 mg of V0V1-ATPase was obtained from 200 g of the recombinant cells. Isolation of V 0 Proton Channel Activity—As shown in Fig. 1b, the V0V1-ATPase partially dissociated into V1 and V0 during the anion exchange column chromatography. The peak fractions containing each complex were individually subjected to further purification with gel permeation chromatography (Superdex HR-200), and the purified complexes produced single bands on the AES gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a, left). Fig. 2b shows elution profiles of the V0V1-ATPase, V1, and V0. The molecular size of V0 was estimated to be 350 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the V0 was composed of I, L, E, G, and C (Fig. 2a, right, lane 3). The V0 was reconstituted into liposome in order to examine proton channel activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the lumens of V0 liposome were rapidly acidified in response to a membrane potential imposed by K+ diffusion mediated by valinomycin. Further incorporation of protons was induced by the addition of an uncoupler, FCCP. The prior treatment of the V0 liposomes with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) resulted in loss of proton translocation. No rapid acidification was observed for simple liposomes without V0. The results indicate that the isolated V0 is a functional DCCD-sensitive proton channel. IEG and CL Subcomplexes from V 0—The V0 fraction was exposed to acidic buffer (pH 4.0) and then applied to gel permeation chromatography. Two new peaks appeared with estimated molecular mass of ∼250 and ∼130 kDa (Fig. 4a). Each fraction showed a single band in the AES gel (Fig. 4b, upper panel). The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the 250-kDa complex was composed of subunits I, E, and G, and the 130-kDa complex was composed of subunits C and L (Fig. 4b, lower panel). These complexes were also obtained from V0 by treatment with 8 m urea, suggesting that hydrophilic E and G subunits are associated tightly with hydrophobic I subunit and hydrophilic C subunit with the L subunit ring. V 1 -CL Subcomplex—The V0V1-ATPase was exposed to the low pH acetate buffer and applied to gel permeation chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4a, following this separation, a new peak appeared after the peaks corresponding to V0V1-ATPase and the IEG subcomplex. AES-PAGE and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the complex in the new peak was composed of C, L, A, B, D, and F (Fig. 4b, lower panel). The E, G, and I were not present in the complex (Fig. 4, b and c). This result indicates that the LC subcomplex binds to the central shaft composed of D and F subunits. The precise arrangement of the subunits in the V0V1-ATPase remains an important, unclarified issue. In particular, the structure and subunit composition of both central and peripheral stalk have yet to be clarified. In an attempt to obtain insight into the subunit arrangement and function, we have studied the T. thermophilus V0V1-ATPase, which has a much simpler subunit composition compared with eukaryotic counterpart (Table I). The V0V1-ATPase of T. thermophilus partially dissociated into V0 and V1 during the ion exchange column chromatography, and they were easily isolated. The V1 part of T. thermophilus is made up of four different subunits with a stoichiometry of A3B3D1F1. The D subunit had been the most probable candidate of rotor subunit in V1 portion (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies have suggested that the D subunit was adjacent to B subunit at central cavity region of A3B3 hexamer, and the F subunit was associated with the D subunit (29Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies on the V-ATPase from Manduca sexta suggested that subunit E, rather than subunit D, was the rotor subunit (31Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Koch M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30082-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic study of Na+-pumping V0V1-ATPase from Caloramator fervidus also suggested that the E subunit was the rotor (32Chaban Y. Ubbink-Kok T. Keegstra W. Lolkema J.S. Boekema E.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated rotation of both D and F subunits relative to A3B3 in V1-ATPase from T. thermophilus, and we established that these two subunits constitute the central shaft (12Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The V0 moiety of T. thermophilus, which shows proton channel activity, is composed of five different subunits, two typical membrane proteins, subunits I and L, and three hydrophilic subunits, E, G, and C (Fig. 2c). In the rotary mechanism, each subunit should be classified as part of the rotor or the stator part. Subunit I (72 kDa) shows an apparent sequence similarity to yeast VHP1 product, which interacts with the proteolipid ring and also plays a critical role in proton translocation (18Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the I subunit is thought to be functional homologue of F0-a, and to constitute the stator part with other subunits. The L subunit is a member of a highly conserved family of hydrophobic subunits, often termed as proteolipid due to their solubility in organic solvents (15Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The proteolipid subunit, both in F0F1-ATPase and V0V1-ATPase, forms a ring structure and has an essential carboxyl residue involved in proton translocation (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 8Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently (33Yokoyama K. Nakano M. Imamura H. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24255-24258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) the rotation of L subunit ring relative to A3B3 hexamer, indicating that the L subunit is part of the rotor region along with the D and F subunits. To address the question of the localization of C, E, and G subunits in V0V1-ATPase, V0V1-ATPase or V0 was exposed to low pH buffer or with 8 m urea to dissociate them into subcomplexes. The V0 part can be divided into two complexes, one is composed of subunits E, G, and I, and the other is composed of subunits L and C. The E subunit was predicted to be a highly hydrophilic α-helical protein and one of candidates of F1-γ subunit homologue (31Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Koch M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30082-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Chaban Y. Ubbink-Kok T. Keegstra W. Lolkema J.S. Boekema E.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the cross-linking studies by Arata et al. (29Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that the subunit E is a stator subunit, rather than a rotor subunit. The G subunit of T. thermophilus shows significant similarity (∼20% identity, overall sequence) to the F1-b subunits in F0, which constitutes the peripheral stator in F0F1-ATPase. Indeed, the secondary structure prediction of the subunit G shows the presence of a long hydrophilic α-helix at the C-terminal region (data not shown). Tomashek et al. (34Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Tomashek J.J. Garrison B.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicated that the E (Vma4p) and G (Vma10p) subunits of yeast constitute the EG subcomplex in vivo. Taken together, it is most likely that hydrophilic E and G subunits were associated with hydrophobic I subunit and form the stator part, that is the peripheral stalk. Unlike T. thermophilus enzyme, both E and G subunits of eukaryote have been proposed to be components of V1 moiety (1Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The difference in localization of E and G subunits between T. thermophilus and eukaryotic enzymes after the dissociation procedure might be due to the affinity of E and G subunits to A3B3DF and/or 100-kDa subunit. It is known that the amount of functional V0V1-ATPase in a given vacuolar membrane is regulated by reversible dissociation/association of the V1 and V0 domain (1Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). For instance, the assembly state of the yeast V-ATPase is post-translationally regulated by glucose in vivo (36Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V0V1-ATPase of M. sexta also shows a similar type of regulation (4Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast, the V0V1-ATPase of T. thermophilus functions as an ATP synthase, and no reversible dissociation has been observed for this enzyme. The lower affinity of both E and G subunits to the membrane domain in eukaryotes may be important in the reversible dissociation of the V1 and V0 domain. Subunit C, a homologue of Vma6p (or the d subunit) assigned to be the V0 part in yeast V0V1-ATPase (21Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also a member of the V0 part of T. thermophilus. The CL subcomplex was stable against the treatment with 8 m urea, suggesting that the C subunit tightly binds to the L subunit ring. Interestingly, the IEG subcomplex is easily removed from V0V1-ATPase by low pH treatment, leaving an ATPase active V1-CL subcomplex (illustrated in Fig. 5). Based on the electron microscopy studies of subcomplexes with different subunit composition, Chaban et al. (32Chaban Y. Ubbink-Kok T. Keegstra W. Lolkema J.S. Boekema E.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested that the C subunit of C. fervidus V0V1-ATPase is a component of the central stalk. The V1 complex from Methanosarcina mazei was made up from five different subunits, A-D and F (39Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun U. Lemker T. Koch M.H. Schagger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and each subunit shows an apparent sequence homology to counterpart of T. thermophilus. Taken together, we propose that the C subunit is part of the central stalk of V0V1-ATPase with D and F subunits and transmits the torque generated in A3B3 to the ring of the L subunits. Grüber et al. (40Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) analyzed the low resolution structure of the F1 complex from Escherichia coli and V1-ATPase from M. mazei by SAXS, and identified the stalk structure of each complex. The structure of the stalk of the V1 particle from M. mazei is ∼84 Å long and 60 Å in diameter, whereas the F1 particle from E. coli has a significant shorter stalk, being ∼40-50 Å long and 50-53 Å wide. In the x-ray structure of F1c10 of yeast, the height of the stalk is 50 Å (8Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the molecular size of subunit D (24-28 kDa) in V0V1-ATPase, which is the functional homologue of the F1-γ subunit, is smaller than those of the γ subunits (31-35 kDa). It is likely that the D subunit might not be in direct contact with the ring of the L subunits. In this study, we demonstrated that V0V1-ATPase of T. thermophilus consists of three parts, the V1, which acts as an ATP-driven motor, the V0 rotor part composed of subunits C and L, and the stator part composed of subunits I, E, and G (Fig. 5). These subcomplexes would also be useful for future structural studies. We thank C. Ikeda for culture and enzyme preparation and assays, Y. Akabane for technical advice, and B. Bernadette for critical assessment of the manuscript."

After Chase I, cells were incubated for another hour (C2) with/without brefeldin A (BFA) and nocodazole (Noc) (to block ER to Golgi trafficking) and with/without oleic acid (OA). OA treatment alone during C2 increased VLDL secretion. This was prevented by the addition of BFA/Noc in C2. When C2 media were replaced by control media for another 1-h chase (C3), VLDL formed during OA treatment in C2 were secreted into C3 medium. Thus, OA-induced conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL to VLDL during C2 occurred in the ER. Next, newly synthesized apoB100 lipoproteins were trapped in the Golgi by treatment with Noc and monensin during Chase I (C1), and C2 was carried out in the presence of BFA/Noc with/without OA and without monensin. Under these conditions, OA treatment during C2 did not stimulate VLDL secretion. The same pulse/chase protocols were followed by iodixanol subcellular fractionation, extraction of lipoproteins from ER and Golgi, and sucrose gradient separation of extracted lipoproteins. Cells treated with BFA/Noc and OA in C2 had VLDL in the ER. In the absence of OA, only LDL/HDL were present in the ER. The density of Golgi lipoproteins in these cells was not affected by OA. Similar results were obtained when ER were immuno-isolated with anti-calnexin antibodies. In conclusion, apoB100 bulk lipidation, resulting in conversion of LDL/HDL to VLDL, can occur in the ER, but not in the Golgi, in McA RH7777 cells. The site where bulk lipid is added to apoB100 low density lipoproteins (LDL)/high density lipoproteins (HDL) particles to form triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has not been identified definitively. We employed several strategies to address this question.

In conclusion, apoB100 bulk lipidation, resulting in conversion of LDL/HDL to VLDL, can occur in the ER, but not in the Golgi, in McA RH7777 cells. Although the early, crucial steps in apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100)-lipoprotein assembly, including translation, translocation, and targeting of apoB100 for the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway have been well studied (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), much less is known about how the mature, triglyceride (TG) 1The abbreviations used are: TG, triglyceride; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; OA, oleic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; Noc, nocodazole; Mon, monensin; [35S]Met, [35S]methionine/cysteine; MEM, minimum essential medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin.-enriched lipoprotein is assembled. Thus, the exact process of bulk lipid addition and, in particular, the site where bulk lipid is added to apoB100 low density lipoproteins (LDL)/high density lipoproteins (HDL) to form mature, TG-enriched very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has not been identified definitively. Early work by Hamilton and co-workers using electron microscopy (2Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggests that a lipid-poor form of apoB present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) could fuse with lipid droplets present in the smooth ER. That work first raised the possibility that VLDL was assembled in a two-step process. This scheme has been supported by studies from several laboratories (3Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Stillemark P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two-step model includes the transformation of an “HDL-like” apoB-lipoprotein to a TG-enriched lipoprotein in the presence of adequate cell lipid stores (4Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Ginsberg H.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity is required before and during the early stages of apoB-lipoprotein assembly in order for bulk lipid addition to occur at the later stages (1Fisher E.A.

On the other hand, our recent studies indicate that the actual addition of bulk lipid during the final stage of assembly is independent of both MTP activity and ongoing TG synthesis (6Pan M. Liang J.-S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Further support for an MTP-independent fusion of lipid poor apoB-lipoproteins with apoB-free lipid droplets can be found in the very recent study by Kulinski et al. (12Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite a general consensus concerning the above-described model for a two-step assembly of VLDL, there remains significant uncertainty concerning the site at which the second step occurs. Recent studies suggest that transformation may require either lateral diffusion of apoB to a specialized compartment of the ER or vesicular transport of apoB from one secretory compartment to another (4Olofsson S.-O.

In the studies presented here, using pharmacological and subcellular fractionation approaches we demonstrate that the oleic acid (OA)-induced conversion of apoB100 LDL/HL particles to VLDL in McA RH7777 cells occurs in the ER and not in the Golgi. Materials—N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), dimethyl sulfoxide, leupeptin, pepstatin A, bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), brefeldin A (BFA) (used at 2 μg/ml), nocodazole (Noc) (used at 20 μg/ml), and monensin (Mon) (used at 500 nm) were purchased from Sigma. BFA was used to block ER to Golgi transport, Noc was used to prevent Golgi collapse into ER, and Mon was used to block vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (21Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sheep anti-human apoB100 polyclonal antibodies were from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit anti-calnexin was purchased from Stressgen. Mouse anti-TGN38 and protein G-agarose were purchased from Calbiochem. Optiprep (a sterile 60% (w/v) iodixanol solution) was obtained from Nycomed. [35S]Methionine/cysteine ([35S]Met) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Minimum essential medium (MEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Growth of Cells—McA RH7777 cells, obtained from ATCC, were grown in six-well plates coated with collagen. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% fetal bovine, and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). For all studies the medium was changed to serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA and other compounds as noted. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Subconfluent McA RH7777 cells were preincubated in serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA for 1 h followed by pretreatment with serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA with or without 40 μg/ml ALLN for 1 h and then labeled with Eagle's MEM containing BSA, with/without ALLN, and 150 μCi/ml [35S]Met for 20 min. Pulse-labeling was followed by two or three chase periods; each chase period was 60 min long. New medium was used for each chase period. Depending on the experiment, medium was collected at the end of each chase period as indicated and used for sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Cells were either lysed for immunoprecipitation or homogenized for cell fractionation. Immunoprecipitation—Media were transferred to tubes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (30 μl/ml). Protease inhibitors consisted of 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.86 mm, was added fresh to the tubes. Cells were harvested with homogenization buffer (62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation of apoB100 in medium or cellular lysate was carried out according to the method of Dixon et al. (22Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B was added to the reaction solution to precipitate apoB100, which was later released by boiling the sampling buffer for 5 min. Samples were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was treated with Autofluor (National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA) and, after drying, exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR) at -70 °C. Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of apoB-containing lipoproteins was conducted as described by Boren et al. (23Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sucrose gradient was formed by layering from the bottom of the tube: 2 ml of 47% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, 5 ml of sample in 12.5% sucrose, and 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. All solutions contained 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.86 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μm ALLN, 5 μm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The gradients were spun at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 65 h at 12 °C, and then 12 fractions were removed from the top to the bottom. Subcellular Fractionation in Self-generated Iodixanol Gradient—Microsomes were prepared according to methods described previously (24Liang J.-S. Wu X. Jiang H. Zhou M. Yang H. Angkeow P. Huang L.-S. Sturley S.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A working stock solution of 50% (w/v) iodixanol was made by diluting 5 volumes of Optiprep with 1 volume of 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The microsomes were adjusted to 12.5% (w/v) iodixanol by mixing 3 volumes of the microsomes with 1 volume of the working stock solution and placed in 5-ml Optiseal tubes. Centrifugations were carried out in a Beckman NVT65.2 rotor at 64,000 rpm and 27 °C for 2.5 h with slow acceleration and the brake off during deceleration from 2,000 rpm. Gradients were collected dense-end first in 0.25-ml fractions. ER fractions and Golgi fractions were detected by Western blotting of each fraction using anti-calnexin and anti-TGN38 antibodies, respectively. Extraction of proteins from microsomes was conducted as described by Rustaeus et al. (25Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions representing ER or Golgi were diluted with 3 ml of 1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, containing 250 mm sucrose and 2 ml of 0.0625% deoxycholate in 3 m KCl. The mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. To improve recovery of radiolabeled apoB100, albumin was added to get a final concentration of 0.75%, and the incubation was extended for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the extracted proteins was adjusted to 12.5% sucrose, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 mm NaCl for sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described. Immuno-isolation of ER-derived Microsomes—Isolated microsomes were also used for immuno-isolation by incubation with an anti-calnexin C-terminal polyclonal antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Because calnexin is an ER transmembrane protein whose C-terminal domain is exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER, this antibody should be capable of immuno-isolating microsomes derived from the ER. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that calnexin, but not TGN38, was present in the immuno-isolated microsomes (see Fig. 6). The microsome-antibody complexes were precipitated by overnight incubation with protein G-agarose. Proteins were extracted from the immunoaffinity-isolated microsomes by the method of Rustaeus et al. (25Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as detailed above. The extracted protein fraction was adjusted to 12.5% sucrose, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 mm NaCl and subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described above. ApoB100 LDL/HDL That Are Trapped in the ER Can be Converted to VLDL by OA—In our initial experiments addressing the site where bulk lipid is added to apoB100 LDL/HDL particles to form mature, TG-enriched VLDL, McA RH7777 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]Met, and the radioactivity was chased for 1 h (Chase I (C1)) in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, ALLN. Based on our prior studies, this approach allows accumulation of a pool of lipid-poor, newly synthesized apoB100 in the ER that can later be converted to VLDL by the addition of OA to the media (6Pan M. Liang J.-S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). During C1, apoB is also present in the post-ER secretory compartments as VLDL, LDL, and HDL. After C1, media were removed, and cells were incubated in fresh media for another hour (Chase II; C2) with/without BFA (2 μg/ml) and nocodazole (Noc) (20 μg/ml) and with/without 0.4 mm OA (Fig. 1A, top). The combination of BFA/Noc, which was added 5 min before the addition of OA, was used to simultaneously block ER to Golgi transport and prevent Golgi collapse into ER (21Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C2 media also contained ALLN. Media were collected at the end of C2 and used for sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. In the absence of any treatments during C2 (control cells), apoB100 was secreted on lipoproteins with a wide range of densities, including VLDL (1.005, 1.008), LDL (1.020-1.06), and HDL (1.07) (Fig. 1A, top line). OA treatment alone (without BFA/Noc) during C2 caused a significant increase in secretion of the full range of apoB100-lipoproteins, but particularly VLDL (d, 1.005, 1.008), as compared with control cells (Fig. 1A, compare second line to first line). By contrast, treatment of cells with only BFA/Noc during C2 resulted in secretion of only a small amount of apoB100 LDL/HDL particles (Fig. 1A, third line). Because BFA essentially blocks all apoB100 secretion when it is added to the media immediately after labeling (21Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (confirmation data in the present studies are not shown), any apoB100 LDL/HDL secreted in the presence of BFA/Noc during C2 must represent apoB100 lipoproteins that had already left the ER during C1 but had not yet been secreted by the time C2 was started. Importantly, treatment of cells with both OA and BFA/Noc in C2 resulted in the same pattern of secretion of apoB100 LDL/HDL particles as seen with BFA/Noc alone (compare Fig. 1A, fourth line with third line). These results indicated that when apoB100 lipoproteins were trapped in the ER during C2 by BFA/Noc, concomitant OA treatment could not stimulate the secretion of apoB100 VLDL particles. Therefore, OA did not stimulate the conversion of any apoB100 LDL/HDL that had already left the ER to VLDL. Despite our finding in a prior study (6Pan M. Liang J.-S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that we obtained identical results with or without ALLN in the media, we repeated these initial studies in the absence of ALLN. The results shown in Fig. 1B are essentially identical to those depicted in Fig. 1A. Thus, the addition of ALLN as a means of salvaging newly synthesized apoB100 from early proteasomal degradation did not alter the effects of either OA or BFA/Noc blockade of ER to Golgi trafficking on apoB100-lipoprotein assembly. To determine whether OA treatment during C2 had stimulated the addition of bulk lipids to apoB100 lipoproteins that were trapped in the ER during that time, the experiment described above was repeated, but at the end of C2, the BFA/Noc medium (with or without OA) that was present during C2 was changed to fresh BSA chase medium without either BFA/Noc or OA, and the cells were incubated for an additional 60 min (Chase III (C3)). This third chase should have allowed apoB100 lipoproteins that had previously been trapped in the ER during C2 to be secreted. In cells treated with BFA/Noc but without OA in C2, additional incubation with BSA-only medium during C3 resulted in secretion of a small amount of apoB100 LDL/HDL (Figs. 2, A and B, top lines). Importantly, OA treatment together with BFA/Noc during C2 resulted in the secretion during C3 of increased amounts of apoB100 lipoprotein that had shifted from LDL/HDL to VLDL and LDL (Figs. 2, A and B, second lines). Additionally, the same results were seen whether BFA/Noc preceded OA in C2 by only 5 min (Fig. 2A) or 30 min (Fig. 2B). The latter, longer preincubation with BFA/Noc was done to ensure that both of those pharmacological inhibitors had enough time to block forward (BFA) and retrograde (Noc) flow of ER and Golgi constituents, respectively, before OA was added. Finally, the experiment in Fig. 2B was repeated without ALLN present at any time. The results, presented in Fig. 2C, were essentially identical to those in Figs. 2, A and B. Overall, the results of the experiments presented in Fig. 2 indicate that apoB100 LDL/HDL that were exposed to OA while trapped in the ER by BFA/Noc during C2 could be secreted as VLDL particles after the BFA/Noc had been removed at the start of C3. Furthermore, in view of the lack of effect of ALLN on the outcomes of the studies presented in Figs. 1 and 2, ALLN was present in all other experiments to prevent proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized apoB100 and thereby increase the number of apoB-lipoproteins available for study. One more experiment was performed using the three-chase protocol. In this experiment, presented in Fig. 3, total apoB100 in the media was isolated rather than density gradient fractions. First, we show that the presence of OA in C2 was associated with secretion of more total apoB100 lipoproteins during C3 compared with secretion when OA was absent in C2 (compare lane 2 to lane 1). Second, we demonstrate that the continued presence of BFA/Noc during C3 (after the presence or absence of OA in C2) results in almost no secretion of apoB100 lipoproteins. These last results strongly support our conclusion that when BFA/Noc were removed from the media after C2 (in Figs. 2, A and B), what was secreted during C3 had to have come from the ER. ApoB100 LDL/HDL That Are Trapped in the Golgi Cannot Be Converted to VLDL by OA—In the experiments depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, use of BFA/Noc to block ER-Golgi trafficking allowed us to demonstrate that OA could convert apoB100 LDL/HDL that were trapped in the ER into apoB100 VLDL that could be secreted when BFA/Noc were removed. Those studies were not designed, however, to directly examine the effects of OA on apoB100 lipoproteins in the Golgi. Therefore, in the next experiment, we investigated whether apoB100 LDL/HDL that was already in the Golgi could be converted to VLDL by OA. The data presented in Fig. 1, A and B, suggested that was not the case, but to investigate this in more detail, we used Noc and Mon treatment to trap newly synthesized apoB100 lipoproteins in the Golgi during C1 (Fig. 4, top). Under these conditions, essentially no apoB100 lipoproteins were secreted into the media during C1 (data not shown). The medium was then changed to one containing BFA/Noc but no Mon for the next 60 min (C2). Under this condition, further movement of any apoB100 lipoproteins from the ER to the Golgi would be blocked, whereas secretion would be allowed. Additionally, C2 was carried out in either the presence or absence OA. Under these conditions, the presence of OA during C2 had no effect on the density of the secreted apoB100 lipoproteins; the same range of VLDL, LDL, and HDL was secreted (compare Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicated that when apoB100 lipoproteins were first trapped in the Golgi and then released and secreted, the addition of OA at the time of their release could not stimulate the conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL particles to VLDL. ApoB100 LDL/HDL Are Converted to VLDL in the ER by OA; Evidence from Iodixanol Subcellular Fractionation Studies—The above studies used pharmacological perturbations of intracellular protein transport and examined secreted apoB100 lipoproteins. The same pulse/chase protocol depicted in Fig. 1 was employed to allow examination of apoB100 lipoproteins isolated directly from ER and Golgi. After C2, cells were harvested by homogenization, and microsomes were isolated. The microsomes were then subjected to iodixanol subcellular fractionation, extraction of lipoproteins from purified ER and Golgi fractions, and sucrose gradient separation of extracted lipoproteins. Calnexin, used as a marker of the ER, was present mainly in fractions 1-3 of the iodixanol gradient, whereas TGN-38, used as a marker of Golgi, was present mainly in fraction 7-12 (Fig. 5). Therefore, fractions 1-3 were pooled for extraction of lipoproteins in the ER, and fractions 7-12 were pooled for extraction of lipoproteins in the Golgi. In the absence of OA, apoB100 lipoproteins isolated from purified ER that had been treated with only BFA/Noc were found mainly at the density of LDL/HDL (d, 1.02-1.07) (Fig. 6, left top panel). By contrast, treatment with OA and BFA/Noc caused a significant shift of apoB100 lipoproteins isolated from the ER to a density range between 1.005 to 1.048, consistent with a partial, but significant, conversion of LDL/HDL to VLDL particles (Fig. 6, left bottom panel). Importantly, the density distribution of apoB100 lipoproteins in the Golgi from these same cells was not affected by OA/BFA/Noc treatment ((Fig. 6, right bottom panel) compared with Golgi from control cells (Fig. 6, right top panel). As noted above, we conclude that any apoB lipoproteins isolated from the Golgi in this protocol had arrived there before the addition of BFA/Noc. Although some of those apoB lipoproteins were secreted during C2 (see Fig. 1A, second line), some were still in the Golgi, and their densities were not affected by the presence of OA. Furthermore, results from studies shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate that any apoB lipoproteins that would have been secreted from the Golgi during C2 in this experiment in the presence of BFA/Noc would also have been LDL/HDL in nature. Overall, these results are consistent with the data obtained from the previous whole cell experiments in which secreted lipoproteins were characterized and indicated that the conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL to apoB100 VLDL in response to OA occurs in the ER. ApoB100 LDL/HDL Are Converted to VLDL in the ER by OA; Evidence from Immuno-isolation Studies—To further confirm our findings, we used an alternative method, immuno-isolation, to characterize the effects of OA on apoB100 lipoproteins in the ER. In these experiments, cells were harvested after C2 and ER isolated from total microsomes by immuno-isolation using an anti-calnexin C-terminal antibody. In Fig. 7 we show that although the total microsome fraction isolated by centrifugation alone contained both calnexin and TGN38 by Western blotting (left lane of each panel), the immuno-isolated ER contained only calnexin (right lanes of each panel). The distribution of apoB-lipoproteins in the immuno-isolated ER were essentially identical to those obtained when cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation by iodixanol (above); in the presence of BFA/Noc, incubation with OA during C2 caused the conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL (Fig. 7, top row) to apoB100 VLDL (Fig. 7, bottom row) in the ER. Despite intense study by many investigative groups, the assembly of VLDL by the liver remains incompletely charaterized. One area that requires further study is the process whereby lipid-poor apoB100 LDL/HDL particles mature into lipid-rich VLDL. Biochemical and morphologic evidence has been presented in support of a model in which assembly of lipid-rich VLDL is accomplished via a two-step process (2Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J.

Falling within this category are the closely related proteins MPB70 and MPB83. The structure of MPB70 reveals a complex and novel bacterial fold, which has clear structural homology to the two C-terminal FAS1 domains of the cell adhesion protein fasciclin I, whose structures were reported very recently. Assessment of the surface features of MPB70, the sequence divergence between MPB70 and MPB83, the conservation of residues across a group of FAS1 domains, and the locations of disease-inducing mutations in βig-h3 strongly suggests that MPB70 and MPB83 contain two functional surfaces on opposite faces, which are probably involved in binding to host cell proteins. This analysis also suggests that these functional surfaces are retained in the FAS1 proteins associated with mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (fasciclin I, periostin, and βig-h3) and furthermore that some of the human corneal disease-inducing substitutions identified in βig-h3 will perturb interactions at these sites.

Tuberculosis remains one of the most significant infectious diseases of humans, with about one-third of the world's population currently infected resulting in about 3 million deaths annually (1Murray C.J.L.

The bacteria responsible for tuberculosis belong to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which is a group of highly related mycobacteria. The complex includes M. tuberculosis, which causes the majority of human tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium bovis, which leads to tuberculosis in a range of domesticated and wild animals. Analysis of the complete M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome has identified the genes for 4006 proteins (3Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S.

In addition, we still have relatively little information about which M. tuberculosis complex proteins are essential for pathogenesis, or associated with the stimulation of protective immunity, and even less knowledge of their structures, functions, and mechanisms of action. The finding that only live mycobacterial vaccines provide significant protection against tuberculosis infection (5Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3310-3312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) clearly indicates a key role for secreted M. tuberculosis complex proteins in stimulating protective immunity and highlights the importance of investigating major secreted antigenic proteins such as MPB70, MPB83, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 (6Hewinson R.G.

The mature M. bovis protein MPB70 and its identical M. tuberculosis homologue MPT70 (Rv2875) are stable, 163-residue polypeptides, that are efficiently secreted from mycobacterial cells following cleavage of a 30-residue signal peptide (3Cole S.T.

The proteins contain a single disulfide bond linking Cys-8 and Cys-142 but show no other form of post-translational modification. MPB70 is a major serodominant antigen of M. bovis, which also stimulates cellular immune responses during infection and is able to elicit a strong, delayed type hypersensitivity response in M. bovis infected cattle (11Billman-Jacobe H.

Virulent M. bovis strains secrete high levels of MPB70 when grown in culture, but the protein is produced at much lower levels by M. tuberculosis and by a number of M. bovis BCG strains including Pasteur, Copenhagen, and Glaxo (7Harboe M.

Despite significant differences in expression levels in culture both M. bovis and M. tuberculosis stimulate a strong immune response to MPB70 upon infection, suggesting that expression of the protein is up-regulated by M. tuberculosis in vivo (17Roche P.W.

In addition, the treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected mice with a DNA vaccine encoding MPB70 has a pronounced therapeutic affect, indicating an essential role for MPB70 during infection of the host (19Lowrie D.B. Tascon R.E. Bonato V.L.D. Lima V.M.F. Faccioli L.H. Stavropoulos E. Colston M.J. Hewinson R.G. Moelling K. Silva C.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Although MPB70 is clearly linked to the stimulation of protective immunity and implicated in tuberculosis pathogenesis, the function of the protein remains unknown. Interestingly, residues 26–162 from MPB70 show significant sequence homology (up to 30% identity) to the FAS1 domains of several extracellular matrix proteins (fasciclin I, βig-h3, and periostin), which are known to be involved in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (20Kim J.-E.

Mycobacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex produce another major secreted protein termed MPB83 in M. bovis and MPT83 (Rv2873) in M. tuberculosis (identical sequences), which is highly homologous to MPB70 or MPT70 (Rv2875) and as with MPB70 appears to stimulate a strong protective immune response upon infection (18Hewinson R.G. Michell S. Russell W.P. McAdam R.A. Jacobs W.R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Morris S. Kelley C. Howard A. Li Z. Collins F.

The genes encoding MPB/MPT70 and MPB/MPT83 appear to form part of a larger operon (Rv2871 to Rv2875 in M. tuberculosis) and are expressed under identical conditions (7Harboe M. Wiker H.G. Ulvund G. Lund-Pedersen B. Andersen A.B. Hewinson R.G. Nagai S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 289-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hewinson R.G. Michell S. Russell W.P. McAdam R.A. Jacobs W.R. Scand. J.

The mature secreted form of MPB83 contains 196 residues, with residues 33–195 over 80% homologous to full-length mature MPB70 (74% identity over 163 residues). On the basis of sequence conservation MPB83 is expected to contain a single disulfide bond analogous to that found in MPB70 linking Cys-40 and Cys-174, but the protein is also glycosylated on T24 and T25 and lipoylated at the N terminus (25Michell S.L. Whelan A.O. Wheeler P.R. Panico M. Easton R.L. Etienne A.T. Haslam S.M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Reason A.J. Herrmann J.L. Young D.B. Hewinson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16423-16432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As with MPB70, the function of MPB83 is not known, however, in contrast to MPB70 it is localized to the surface of M. tuberculosis complex cells and anchored to the cell wall via the N-terminal lipid group (7Harboe M. Wiker H.G. Ulvund G. Lund-Pedersen B. Andersen A.B. Hewinson R.G. Nagai S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 289-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that the two closely related proteins have evolved distinct functional roles. In this communication we report the determination of the high resolution solution structure of MPB70, which contains a complex fold not previously observed in bacterial proteins and shows close structural homology to the third and fourth FAS1 domains of Drosophila fasciclin I whose structures were reported during the preparation of the manuscript for this report (26Clout N.J. Tisi D. Hohenester E. Structure. 2003; 11: 197-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The structure obtained for MPB70 has allowed us to assess the functional implications of surface features on the protein and of the sequence divergence between MPB70 and MPB83. In addition, the MPB70 and fasciclin I structures have enabled us to examine the roles of residues conserved across a group of FAS1 domain-containing proteins and to consider the functional and structural consequences of mutations in the fourth FAS1 domain of human βig-h3, which lead to severe impairment of vision through progressive degeneration of the cornea (inherited corneal dystrophies (27Munier F.L.

Sample Preparation—The 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled MPB70 were prepared from a pBluescript KS+-based Escherichia coli expression vector (pVW500) as described previously (6Hewinson R.G. Russell W.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Bloemink M.J. Kemmink J. Dentten E. Muskett F.W. Whelan A. Sheikh A. Hewinson G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biomol.

The expression system produces the mature form of MPB70 (163 residues) as a secreted product, which is purified from the culture supernatant and periplasmic cell fraction. The majority of the MPB70 samples were either uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled, however, 13C/1H HMQC-NOESY 1The abbreviations used are: HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; CANDID, combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination protocol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CE, combinatorial extension; DQF, double quantum filtered. spectra were acquired from MPB70 in which only the non-aromatic residues were labeled. This was achieved by preparing the protein from cells grown on labeled minimal medium (2 g/liter [15N]ammonium sulfate and 5.5 g/liter [13C]glucose) supplemented with 50 mg/liter unlabeled l-histidine, l-tyrosine, and l-phenylalanine. The NMR experiments were carried out on 0.35-ml samples of 1.0 mm15N-, 0.7 mm uniformly 15N/13C-, and 1.2 mm non-aromatic residue 15N/13C-labeled MPB70 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mm sodium chloride and either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O as appropriate. NMR Spectroscopy—All the NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on either 600- or 800-MHz Varian Inova spectrometers. The two- and three-dimensional spectra recorded to extend essentially complete sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments for MPB70 to the side chains and to obtain conformational constraints for structural calculations were: 1H DQF-COSY (28Rance M.

The three-dimensional spectra were acquired over about 85 h with typical maximum evolution times in F1 or F2 of 12–14 ms for 15N, 6–10 ms for 13C, and 15–18 ms for 1H and acquisition times in F3 of 50–150 ms. The decoupling of 15N and 13C from 1H during the acquisition time was usually achieved using a GARP1 sequence, but at 800 MHz 1H adiabatic WURST sequences were used for 13C decoupling (35Kupce E. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1996; 118: 299-303Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded over about 40 h with acquisitions times of 35–40 ms in F1 and 250 ms in F2. In all experiments the WATER-GATE method was used to suppress the water signal when required (36Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar), with linear prediction used to extend the effective acquisition times by up to 1.5-fold in F1 and F2 and mild resolution enhancement applied in all dimensions using a shifted sine-squared function. Apart from the omission of linear prediction, the two-dimensional spectra were similarly processed using the Varian VNMR package. All the spectra were analyzed on-screen using the program XEASY (38Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Structural Calculations—The family of converged MPB70 structures was calculated in a two-stage process using the program CYANA (39Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Initially, the recently published combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination protocol (CANDID) was used to automatically assign the NOE cross-peaks identified in three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra of MPB70 and to produce preliminary structures of the protein (40Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). After which several cycles of simulated annealing combined with redundant dihedral angle constraints to increase convergence were used to produce the final converged MPB70 structures (41Güntert P. Wütrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The input for the CANDID stage primarily consisted of essentially complete 15N, 13C, and 1H resonance assignments for the non-exchangeable groups in MPB70 and three manually picked three-dimensional NOE peak lists corresponding to all NOEs involving amide protons (1589 peaks), NOEs between aliphatic protons and aromatic side chain or slowly exchanging backbone amide protons (750 peaks), and all NOEs between aliphatic protons (3434 peaks). In addition, the CANDID stage included constraints corresponding to the single disulfide bond present in MPB70 (Cys-8 to Cys-142) and to 35 χ1 angles (±30°) derived from analysis of TOCSY-HSQC and HNHB spectra. The NOE peak lists were prepared using XEASY, and the volumes of the cross-peaks were calculated using the Lorentzian line fitting and integration routines available in SPSCAN (www.molebio.uni-jena.de/wg/spscan). The CANDID calculations were carried out using the default parameter settings in CYANA 1.05 apart from increasing the average target value for NOEs involving backbone protons from 3.8 to 4.0 Å in the structure-independent NOE calibration routine used in cycle 1, raising the upper limit for observable NOEs to 6.0 Å and setting the chemical shift uncertainties to 0.02 ppm for 1H, 0.3 ppm for 15N, and 0.2 ppm for 13C. The final converged MPB70 structures were produced from 100 random starting coordinates using a torsion angle-based simulated annealing protocol combined with four cycles of redundant dihedral angle constraints, essentially as described previously (42Muskett F.W.

Carr M.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9552-9559Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The calculations were mainly based upon 2860 non-redundant, NOE-derived upper distance limits, assigned to unique pairs of protons using CANDID but also included 35 χ1 angle constraints and appropriate upper and lower distance limits corresponding to the Cys-8 to Cys-142 disulfide bond, and in the final round of the calculations to 45 hydrogen bonds involving backbone amide groups. The hydrogen bond constraints were only included for residues with backbone amide signals still detectable after 8 weeks in D2O and where the distance between the hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms was less than 2.5 Å and the NH to O bond angle was greater than 135° in converged structures obtained from the penultimate calculation cycle (residues 40, 41, 43–49, 51, 55, 61, 66–70, 72, 87, 98–103, 105, 114, 116, 118, 119, 121, 124, 126, 127, 134, 135, 140, 141, 145, 147, 151, 153–155, and 159). The standard simulated annealing protocol used consisted of a high temperature conformational search phase of 2000 steps followed by slow cooling over 8000 steps and conjugate gradient minimization at the end. The family of MPB70 structures obtained were analyzed using the programs CYANA (39Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (44Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). An exhaustive similarity search of the MPB70 coordinates against all structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank was carried out using Dali (Ref. 45Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar; available at www.ebi.ac.uk/dali), and optimal alignments between the structures for MPB70 and the fasciclin domains of fasciclin I were calculated using CE (Ref. 46Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar; available at cl.sdsc.edu/ce). Sequence-specific Assignments—The essentially complete sequence-specific 15N, 13C, and 1H backbone resonance assignments reported for MPB70 previously (9Bloemink M.J. Kemmink J. Dentten E. Muskett F.W. Whelan A. Sheikh A. Hewinson G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) were readily extended to the 13C and 1H side-chain signals using correlations observed in DQF-COSY, TOCSY, TOCSY-HSQC, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Apart from exchangeable side-chain groups, the only 1H signals that remained unidentified were from the backbone amides of G1 and D2 and from the Hγ of the side chain of Leu-119. The extent of the assignments obtained for 13C resonances was equally comprehensive with just 11 residues lacking complete assignments for the aliphatic signals (Gly-1, Leu-3, Thr-41, Thr-42, Val-55, Leu-94, Thr-107, Leu-119, Leu-133, Ile-155, and Pro-161), with resonances from typically only a single group remaining unidentified. In the case of MPB70, no attempts were made to assign the 13C signals of the aromatic rings, because this information was not required for the analysis of the 13C-edited NOESY spectrum, which was acquired from a sample of MPB70 in which the side chains of the aromatic residues were not 13C-labeled. Structural Calculations—The recently developed CANDID protocol proved very effective at determining unique assignments for the NOEs identified in three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra (40Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). At the end of the procedure (cycle 7) unique assignments were obtained for 94.3% (1498/1589) of the NOE peaks picked in the 15N/1H NOESY-HSQC spectrum and 96.3% (4030/4184) of those identified in the 13C/1H HMQC-NOESY spectrum. This level of success compares very favorably with our experience of manual iterative assignment of NOE peaks in protein spectra (42Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B.

Carr M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9619-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the automatic approach took only a few days as compared with several months for manual assignment. The uniquely assigned NOE peaks produced 2845 non-redundant 1H to 1H upper distance limits, which were used as the principle constraints in the final rounds of structural calculations. In contrast to the success in assigning NOEs, CANDID was relatively poor at producing MPB70 structures with no significant violations of NMR constraints or van der Waals interactions, with typically only one or two fully converged structures obtained from 100 random starting coordinates. This convergence problem may well reflect the complex topology of the MPB70 backbone and was solved by the inclusion of redundant dihedral angle constraints in the final rounds of simulated annealing calculations (41Güntert P. Wütrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The final family of MPB70 structures was determined using a total of 3066 NMR-derived structural constraints (an average of 18.8 per residue), including 2845 NOE-based upper distance limits (542 intra residue, 733 sequential (i, i+1), 562 medium range (i, i ≤ 4), and 1008 long range (i, i ≥ 5)) and 35 χ1 torsion angle constraints. The calculations also included 180 distance constraints required to impose 45 backbone hydrogen bonds and 6 distance constraints corresponding to the Cys-8 to Cys-142 disulfide bond. After the final round of CYANA calculations, 39 satisfactorily converged MPB70 structures were obtained from 100 random starting conformations. The converged structures contain no distance constraint or van der Waals violations greater than 0.5 Å and no dihedral angle violations greater than 5°, with an average value for the CYANA target function of 9.5 ± 1.3. The sums of the violations for upper distance limits, lower distance limits, van der Waals contacts, and torsion angle constraints were 39.8 ± 3.3 Å, 2.1 ± 0.3 Å, 18.3 ± 2.1 Å, and 11.7 ± 3.8°, respectively. Similarly, maximum violations for the converged structures were 0.39 ± 0.05 Å, 0.22 ± 0.03 Å, 0.30 ± 0.03 Å, and 3.35 ± 0.90°, respectively. The family of converged MPB70 structures, together with the NMR constraints, has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1NYO). The solution structure of MPB70 is determined to high precision, which is clearly evident from the superposition of the protein backbone shown for the family of converged structures in Fig. 1 (best fit for residues 3–128 and 132–162) and is reflected in low root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) values to the mean structure for both the backbone and all heavy atoms of 0.43 ± 0.05 Å and 0.71 ± 0.05 Å, respectively. A few N- and C-terminal residues (Gly-1, Asp-2, and Ala-163), together with a short surface loop formed from Gln-129 to Asn-131, showed no long range NOEs and medium range NOEs only in the case of Gln-129, which results in the conformations of these regions being somewhat less well defined, probably as a consequence of rapid local mobility. The MPB70 structures show good non-bonded contacts, with 62% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues found to have backbone torsion angles in the most favored regions, 33% in additional allowed regions, 3% in generously allowed regions, and only 1% in disallowed regions. In addition, no residues consistently adopt unfavorable backbone conformations. Structural Features of MPB70 —The backbone topology of MPB70 is illustrated by the ribbon diagram shown in Fig. 2, with the protein consisting of a seven-stranded β-barrel (β1 66–71, β2 102–104, β3 114–117, β4 123–128, β5 133–135, β6 138–147, and β7 150–155) and eight α-helices (α1 7–14, α2 22–27, α331–36, α441–48, α558–61, α673–78, α781–87, and α8 93–100) that pack together on one side of the barrel. The β-barrel is closed by one hydrogen bond between β2 and β3, and so, it alternatively can be thought of as a β-sandwich with strand 6 coiling to form part of two sheets (β6C-β7-β1-β2 and β3-β4-β5-β6N). All the strands are anti-parallel to each other except β1 and β7, and the residue offset for one transverse around the barrel is 10 (the shear number). As shown in Fig. 2, the circumference of the barrel is wider at the"

In contrast, mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from the Rac2 knockout mice utilize Rac1 for migration via αvβ3/αvβ5 and α4β1.

In a COS7 cell system, the expression of Syk kinase alone is sufficient to convert the α4β1 migration response to Rac2 dependence. Therefore, we present the first evidence that the α4β1 receptor in blood cells has evolved a Syk-Rac2 signaling axis to transmit signals required for integrin-directed migration suggesting that Syk kinase in part encodes myeloid Rac2 specificity in vivo.

Cell migration is an essential process during development and wound healing. During cell migration coordination between membrane traffic, cell substrate adhesion, and actin polymerization and reorganization is required for protrusion of the leading edge. Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is regulated by Rho family GTPases and, with a contribution from the endocytic cycle, serves to extend the forward edge of mammalian cells (1Borisy G.G. Svitkina T.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2de Curtis I. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Rho family GTPases have been recognized as the regulators of signal transduction pathways that mediate distinct actin cytoskeleton changes required for cell migration (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 4Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Ridley A.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases (including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) comprises a complex group of at least 15 proteins critically involved as molecular switches in a large number of biochemical events in many cell types (5Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 6Hall A. Nobes C.D. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Rac activation results from a combination of reduced association with GDP dissociation inhibitors and/or enhanced exchange of GDP to GTP promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Activated GTP-bound Rac proteins then transduce signals to down-stream effector proteins. Finally, through association with GT-Pase-activating proteins, the GTP-bound small GTPase returns to an inactive GDP-bound form by hydrolysis of the bound GTP. Importantly, the events by which cell surface receptors orchestrate the activation of Rac are likely dependent upon the upstream activation of distinct protein-tyrosine kinases and the recruitment of specific adapter proteins to specific subcellular locals to transmit specific signals. One feature of the Rac proteins is their capacity to regulate the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 8Scita G.

Dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is key for morphological changes observed under conditions of adhesion to the extracellular matrix and for cell migration. The structure and function of normal tissue is determined by reciprocal dialogue that is mediated in part through interactions with extracellular matrix, ECM. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BMMθs, bone marrow-derived macrophages; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; VN, vitronectin; FN, fibronectin; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; M-CSF, macrophage/colony-stimulating factor; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; WT, wild type; KO, knockout; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PE, phycoerythrin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BMMθs, bone marrow-derived macrophages; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; VN, vitronectin; FN, fibronectin; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; M-CSF, macrophage/colony-stimulating factor; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; WT, wild type; KO, knockout; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PE, phycoerythrin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. The ECM is a complex network of proteins and glycoproteins that provide both architectural support of the cells and contextual information to define the proper response to a given stimulus (12Howe A.

Members of the Rac sub-class are comprised of Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3. Rac1 and Rac2 share 92% sequence identity and differ primarily in the C-terminal 10 residues, whereas Rac1, but not Rac2, contains a polybasic region. Rac1 and Rac3 share 77% identity and Rac2 and Rac3 share 83% identity (13Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Despite the high degree of sequence conservation the Rac2 knockout mice display a number of hematopoietic defects (15Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A.

These studies clearly identify a role of Rac2 in blood cell-specific signaling. However, the mechanisms that underlie Rac2-specific signals in hematopoietic cells remain unclear. We sought to characterize a receptor-signaling event through a common receptor found in blood and nonblood cells to gain insight into the process, which encodes Rac2 specificity in the hematopoietic cell compartment. Although several reports suggest an importance for Rac in cell motility, the role of Rac2 in macrophage-specific integrin-dependent haptotaxis has not been extensively evaluated. Our current data provide evidence that the integrins, α4β1 and αvβ3/αvβ5, expressed in macrophages display a requirement for the Rac2 not seen in fibroblasts. Moreover, using a reductionistic approach in COS7 cells, we generate evidence that the presence of the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase Syk is sufficient to convert nonhematopoietic cells to Rac2 dependence in the context of an α4β1 migration response. Hence, we conclude that blood cells have evolved an integrin-specific signalsome, which involves the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Syk, in a signal transduction cascade that is selective for Rac2 and required for myeloid haptotaxis. Antibodies and Reagents—Rac2 Ab was a gift from Drs. G. Bokoch and U. Knaus (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Mouse mAb against Rac1 and a PAN-Rac antibody, which reacts with Rac1 and Rac2 (R56220), were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. The recombinant p21-activated kinase p21 binding domain (PAK-1 PBD, for the Rac2 pull-down assay) conjugated to agarose was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies. Murine-specific monoclonal antibodies, CD16/32, α1 (CD49a), α2 (CD49b), α4(CD49d), α5(CD49e), αv (CD51), β1(CD29), β3(CD61), and Mac1 (CD11b), and all related isotype control and PE-conjugated secondary Abs were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibodies were used to quantitate murine integrin expression in different cell lineages using flow cytometry and to block migration via specific integrins. M-CSF was bought from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human fibronectin (FN) and recombinant human FN peptides, H296 and CH271 were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA) or were a gift from Takara Shuzo (Otsu, Japan), respectively. Vitronectin was purified in our laboratory as described previously (20Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct.

Animals—Rac2-deficient (–/–) mice and their normal littermate in a C57 BL/6J genetic background have been described by Roberts et al. (15Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B.

C57BL/6J mice were used for wild type controls in these experiments. The Rac2 knockout mice used in this study had been back-crossed into C57BL/6J mice for >12 generations. Mice were housed in microisolation units under specific pathogen-free conditions and were fed autoclaved food and acidified water ad libitum. Mice used in these experiments were 8–12 weeks of age. Isolation of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages and Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMθs) were generated by flushing the bone marrow cavity with culture media (IMDM, Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). Following centrifugation at 1500 rpm, resuspended cells were lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer (0.155 m ammonium chloride, 0.01 m potassium bicarbonate, and 0.1 m EDTA) and kept at room temperature for 5 min. Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in macrophage medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml M-CSF. Fibroblasts were allowed to adhere for 4 h at 37 °C, and the nonadherent cells were transferred to another flask. This step was repeated after overnight incubation at 37 °C. On day 8, most of the adhering cells are macrophages (>80% MAC1-positive cells and 100% phagocytic activity via FcγRII/III). For MEFs, pregnant mice at day 13 post coitus were sacrificed. Both the uterine horns containing the fetuses were taken, and the embryonic sac was separated from the fetus. Cell suspension from the whole fetus was generated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) by mincing tissue followed by trituration. A portion of whole cell suspension was taken for genotyping, the rest were plated in embryo fibroblast culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. Analysis of Integrin and Mac1 Receptor Expression—Cells (macrophages or MEFs) isolated from wild type (WT) or knockout (KO) mice were collected, washed, and resuspended in incubation buffer (PBS contained 0.1% BSA) at 2 × 105 cells/sample. Following incubation with Fcγ receptor-blocking Ab (CD16/32), samples were washed once with PBS-0.1% BSA and incubated with one of the following mAbs (1 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The antibodies were either PE-conjugated anti-MAC1 or monoclonal antibodies against the murine integrin subunits: α4 (CD49d), α5 (CD49e), αv (CD51), α1 (CD49a), α2 (CD49b), β1 (CD29), or β3 (CD61) or the respective isotype control. After incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS-0.1% BSA and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody (PE-conjugated) and then incubated for 30 min on ice followed by adjustment to volume of 250 μl in PBS. After washing the cells twice with PBS-0.1% BSA, flow cytometric analyses were performed using FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Cell Migration and Adhesion Assays—Cell migration assays were performed on polycarbonate membranes using Transwell migration chambers (diameter 6.5 mm, pore size 8 μm; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). The underside of the membrane to which cells migrate was coated with 20 μg/ml of either fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen type1, or fragments of fibronectin H296 (binds α4β1) (22Mould A.P.

Transwells were placed into the lower chamber containing 600 μl of serum-free medium. Cells (8- to 10-day cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages or embryo fibroblasts) were scraped and washed in serum-free medium. 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of media/Transwell were added to the top of the migration chamber (uncoated side) and allowed to migrate to the coated side of the chamber for 4 h at 37 °C. Haptotaxis was quantitated as described previously (25Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J.

The haptotaxis response of each cell type was further confirmed by demonstrating the complete abrogation of migration by coating both sides of the membrane with vitronectin, H296, CH271, or FN. To confirm the specificity of the integrin migration and to functionally validate the anti-integrin antibodies used in our FACS analysis, we preincubated wild type macrophages with antibody against the αv or α4 integrin subunit (1 μg/ml). These cells were then examined for capacity to migrate toward vitronectin or H296 peptide in haptotaxis assay (see Fig. 3D). Cell adhesion assays were also performed. Briefly, flat bottom 96-well polystyrene plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 20 μg/ml of either fibronectin, vitronectin, or fragments of fibronectin (H296 or CH271) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed once with PBS, incubated with 20 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 37 °C for blocking nonspecific sites, and again washed twice with PBS. To examine cell adhesion to the coated surface, 1 × 105 cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, medium and unbound cells were removed by aspiration, and wells were washed carefully with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The stain was eluted with 10% acetic acid, and absorbance was determined at 600 nm with a microplate reader (Spectramax 250, Molecular Device) (28Suzuki T. Shoji S. Yamamoto K. Nada S. Okada M.

After 48 h, mice were sacrificed and bone marrow was isolated. For transduction, nontissue cultured plastic 6-well plates were coated with CH296 fibronectin peptide as described (29Hanenberg H. Xiao X.L. Dilloo D. Hashino K. Kato I. Williams D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The MIEG-3 retroviral vector has been described before (30Williams D.A.

Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the MIEG-3 vector contains internal ribosomal entry site sequences, which are located downstream of a FLAG epitope-tagged Rac2 cDNA (MIEG-3FR2), which drives the expression of EGFP in cells that express Rac2. The viral titers of MIEG-3 or MIEG-3FR2 viral supernatant were 2.5 × 104 and 1.4 × 105 colony forming units/ml, respectively. These retroviral supernatants were used to infect wild type and Rac2-deficient macrophage progenitors. 24-h bone marrow cultures (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated in the presence of freshly thawed retroviral supernatants supplemented with 100 ng/ml stem cell factor, 100 ng/ml megakaryocyte growth and development factor, 100 ng/ml granulocyte-CSF, and 50 ng/ml M-CSF (16Yang F.C.

Following the incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, supernatants along with nonadhering cells were removed; cells were washed, resuspended in fresh conditioned medium (virus free) containing all the above-mentioned supplements. After incubation at 37 °C for 20–24 h supernatant was removed, cells were washed and resuspended in freshly thawed retrovirus supernatant supplemented with all cytokines and plated in the same well. After 4 h of infection, supernatants were aspirated; cells were washed and then plated in virus-free conditioned medium. Cells were incubated for 36–48 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation, supernatant was removed and adhering cells were harvested (16Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A.

Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were isolated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStar Plus, BD Biosciences) under sterile conditions. The transfection efficiency range was 30–70%. EGFP-positive cells were washed and resuspended in IMDM for migration assay, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis for Rac2. Immunoblot Analysis of Rac1 and Rac2 Expression—Lysates of mouse bone marrow macrophages and embryo fibroblasts were prepared, and protein was estimated with Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using BSA as a standard. Protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with mouse mAb for Rac1 or rabbit polyclonal Ab for Rac2 (32Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and developed with an ECL method (Amersham Biosciences, UK). We also employed the PAN-Rac antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) against both Rac1 and Rac2 pull-down assays. Using purified recombinant Rac1 and Rac2, we have observed that this antibody detects both GTPases with 20% greater sensitivity for Rac2 in Western blots (data not shown). Assay for Integrin-induced Rac2 Activation—Macrophages (BMMθs) (from wild type animals) were obtained by culturing bone marrow for 10 days in the medium defined above. They were stimulated in 10 cm of nontissue culture-coated Petri dishes coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin, vitronectin, or fragments of fibronectin H296 (α4β1) or CH271 (α5β1) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were scraped and washed in serum-free medium (5 × 106 cells in 2 ml of serum-free media) and then plated onto vitronectin, fibronectin, and different fragments of fibronectins (H296 and CH271, 20 μg/ml) coated in 10-cm Petri dishes for 10 min. Following adhesion cells were chilled with Hanks' balanced salt solution at 4 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 nm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. For in vitro guanine nucleotide binding-positive control, cell lysate was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 100 μm GTPγS. GTP loading was stopped by addition of MgCl2 to 60 mm. Binding reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of Pak-1-agarose (GST fusion protein, corresponding to the p21 binding CRIB domain, PBD, residues 67–150, of human PAK-1, expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione agarose) to each sample and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C and processed as described (18Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Heterologous COS7 Migration System—COS7 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells on a 10-cm tissue culture dish overnight. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using the Lipofectamine reagent. Episomal plasmids were used to express Rac1, Rac2, or the EGFP-tagged Syk protein. After 4 h, medium was changed and cells were further incubated for 48 h. For the migration assay the underside of the polycarbonate membrane of the Transwell was coated with 20 μg/ml of specific ligand. 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of medium were added to the upper part of the well (noncoated side) and allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C. For Rac activation assay, cells were transfected with EGFP-Syk plus Rac2 or Rac1 (with proper vector controls). After 48 h of transfection, cells were stimulated on 10 cm of nontissue culture-coated Petri dishes coated with 20 μg/ml H296 peptide (α4β1) for 15 min. During all transfections the plasmid composition and the DNA concentrations were identical for all experimental groups. Expression of Rac2, Rac1, and EGFP-Syk were quantified using Western blot or FACS analysis (Fig. 6C). Statistics—The Student's t test was used to compare results generated in different experimental groups and to generate the p values reported herein. The targeted disruption of Rac2 has been shown to result in defects in hematopoietic cells in the context of blood-specific receptor signaling pathways (15Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B.

Herein, we sought to evaluate the effect of Rac2 deficiency on integrin receptor signals transmitted in blood (macrophage) versus nonblood (fibroblast) cells through the same integrin receptors. Therefore, we directly compared the effect of targeted disruption of Rac2 on α4β1, αvβ3/αvβ5, and α5β1 integrin function in macrophages and MEFs. Moreover, we sought to identify upstream elements of myeloid signaling pathways that might encode for Rac2 specificity. Expression of Rac2 and Rac1 in MEFs and BMMθs—It has previously been shown that Rac2 is the predominant Rac isoform in hematopoietic cells (13Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the levels of Rac1 and Rac2 protein in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and MEFs from Rac2 –/– and +/+ animals by immunoblotting with specific antibodies for Rac1 and Rac2 (Fig. 2). Rac2 was only expressed in BMMθ, whereas a similar amount of Rac1 was detected in BMMθ and MEFs (Fig. 2). These results confirm the selective expression of Rac2 in murine BMMθs. The data are similar to the previously reported expression pattern for Rac1 and Rac2 in murine neutrophils and mast cells (16Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M.

After ligand binding, Notch receptors are cleaved to release their intracellular domains. The intracellular domains, the activated form of Notch receptors, are then translocated into the nucleus where they interact with other transcriptional machinery to regulate the expression of cellular genes. To dissect the molecular mechanisms of Notch signaling, the cellular targets that interact with Notch1 receptor intracellular domain (N1IC) were screened. In this study, we found that endogenous transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1) was associated with exogenous N1IC in human K562 erythroleukemic cells. The ankyrin (ANK) domain of N1IC and zinc finger domains of YY1 were essential for the association of N1IC and YY1 according to the pull-down assay of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Furthermore, both YY1 and N1IC were present in a large complex of the nucleus to suppress the luciferase reporter activity transactivated by Notch signaling. The transcription factor YY1 indirectly regulated the transcriptional activity of the wild-type CBF1-response elements via the direct interaction of N1IC and CBF1. We also demonstrated the association between endogenous N1IC and intrinsic YY1 in human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that transcription factor YY1 may modulate Notch signaling via association with the high molecular weight Notch complex.

Notch genes encode evolutionarily conserved receptors that are utilized to control cell fate decisions during development. Notch signaling participates in several cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, depending upon the cellular context of Notch activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Human Notch was first identified as a gene involved in the t(7;9)(q34; q34.3) chromosomal translocation detected in some T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. This gene was shown to generate Notch1 receptor intracellular domain (N1IC), 1The abbreviations used are: N1IC, Notch1 receptor intracellular domain; YY1, Ying Yang 1; RAM, RAM23 domain; ANK, ankyrin repeats; PEST, proline-glutamate-serine-threonine-rich; TAD, transcriptional activator domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. an activated form of Notch1 receptor (4Ellisen L.W.

Further studies showed that the human Notch receptor family consists of four members (Notch1–4), located on chromosomes 9q34, 1p13-p11, 19p13.2-p13.1, and 6p21.3, respectively (5Larsson C.

Mita K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Notch receptors are single-span transmembrane proteins with several functional domains. In the extracellular domain, there are several epidermal growth factor repeats and three Lin/Notch repeats. The Notch intracellular domain consists of a RAM domain, ankyrin repeats (ANK), nuclear localization signal, a transcriptional activator domain (TAD), and a proline-glutamate-serine-threonine-rich (PEST) domain. The RAM domain is the primary binding site of activated Notch receptor with C promoter binding factor-1 (CBF1)/recombination signal binding protein-Jκ (RBP-Jκ) (7Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), a human homolog of Drosophila Su(H). The ANK repeat domain can also associate with CBF1 to modulate the interaction (8Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In the prevailing model of Notch signaling, Notch receptors are activated through binding with ligands on neighboring cells. The Notch intracellular domains are released and translocated into the nucleus after proteolytic cleavages triggered by ligand binding. Then Notch intracellular domains activate the expression of their target genes via both CBF1-dependent and -independent pathways (reviewed in Ref. 9Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The control of Notch signaling is very complicated and not yet fully understood. So far, there are several N1IC-associated cellular factors that have been identified to both positively and negatively modulate Notch signaling.

Although the members of Notch-associated factors and the downstream gene targets are expanding, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Notch signaling in diverse developmental systems remain unresolved. To further dissect Notch signaling, we screened and characterized activated Notch1 receptor-associated proteins in a hematopoietic system. The transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1) was identified to be associated with the activated form of Notch1 receptor in a high molecular weight complex in the nucleus, and this association modulated the CBF1-dependent gene expression. Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—The cDNA of Notch1 receptor intracellular domain was cloned by RT-PCR from the total RNA of HL-60 cells. The expression construct of pcDNA-HA-N1IC, a derivative of the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA3-HA2, contains the cDNA-encoded amino acid residues 1764–2444 of human Notch1 receptor with an HA tag at the N terminus. The fusion protein plasmids GST-ANKΔEP (28Oswald F. Täuber B. Dobner T. Bourteele S. Kostezka U. Adler G. Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Mol. Cell.

Reporter plasmids, 4×wtCBF1Luc and 4×mtCBF1Luc, contain four copies of wild-type or mutant CBF1-response elements in front of a simian virus 40 promoter-driven luciferase (39Hsieh J.J. Henkel T.

The CAT reporter plasmid (p(FPIII)6-CAT) contains six CBF1-binding sites fused to the thymidine kinase promoter element and bacterial CAT gene coding sequence (40Chen H. Chong Y. Liu C.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat and SUP-T1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum. For the establishment of stable K562 cell lines expressing HA-N1IC (K562/HA-N1IC), K562 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with a linearized expression plasmid of pcDNA-HA-N1IC (5 μg) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser electroporator. Forty-eight hours after electroporation, cells were diluted to about 0.8 cell/well in 96-well dishes and selected with 800 μg/ml G418. The stable clones derived from single cells were screened for the expression of HA-N1IC fusion protein by Western blot with anti-HA and anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the control, the linearized pcDNA3-HA2 vector was also electroporated into K562 cells to establish a stable cell line (K562/pcDNA3). For the CAT reporter assay, HEK293 cells (2 × 105) in 6-well culture plates were incubated with 2 ml of calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate containing 2.5 μg of p(FPIII)6-CAT reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of various expression plasmids (as indicated in the figure legends). To correct for transfection efficiency, 0.25 μg of pcDNA3.1/myc-his/LacZ was used as an internal control. Cells were harvested in the reporter lysis buffer 48 h after transfection. CAT activity was assayed as described previously (40Chen H. Chong Y. Liu C.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection of luciferase reporter assay, K562 cells (1 × 106) were seeded onto 6-well plates and transfected using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Reporter plasmids containing wild-type (4×wtCBF1Luc) or mutant (4×mtCBF1Luc) CBF1-response elements (1.0 μg) were cotransfected with pRL-TK (0.02 μg), pcDNA-HA-N1IC (1.0 μg), and pCMV-YY1 (1.0 μg) or their control vectors (1.0 μg). Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activities derived from both Firefly (4×wtCBF1Luc and 4×mtCBF1Luc) and Renilla (pRL-TK) luciferase proteins were measured using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was then used to normalize for transfection efficiency. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, the K562/HA-N1IC cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 5 μg of reporter plasmids 4×wtCBF1Luc and 4×mtCBF1Luc; cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Coimmunoprecipitation—To prepare whole-cell lysates, cells were lysed in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm sodium fluoride). Protein A-Sepharose was washed with NETN buffer to obtain a 50% (v/v) slurry. Five μl of anti-YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies and 50 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose were added into 450 μl of NETN buffer and then rotated at 4 °C for more than 1 h to prepare the slurry of antibody-conjugated protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was performed by rotating the mixture of cell lysates and mouse IgG-bound protein A-Sepharose (control) or antibody (anti-YY1 or anti-Notch1 C terminus)-conjugated protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for more than 1 h (41Yeh T.-S. Lo S.J. Chen P.-J. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6190-6198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laemmli sample buffer was added to the immunoprecipitated pellets and heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Western blot was performed with anti-Notch1 C terminus, anti-YY1, or anti-HA antibodies. GST Pull-down Assay—Escherichia coli strains DH5α harboring GST and GST fusion protein expression vectors were cultured for the purification of GST and GST fusion proteins. After induction by 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h, cells were harvested and lysed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and 1 mg/ml lysozyme at 4 °C for 30 min. Then Triton X-100 was added to cell suspensions to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the suspensions were rotated for another 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were loaded onto a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose resin, and the mixtures were gently rocked for 30 min at room temperature. The unbound proteins were decanted after centrifugation, and the resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline several times. Whole-cell extracts of K562/HA-N1IC and K562/pcDNA3 cells were prepared in NETN buffer as described above. To 500 μg of whole-cell extracts, 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose resin prebound with 0.5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins was added and then rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation to remove the unbound fraction, the slurry of glutathione-agarose resin was washed by NETN buffer three times and denatured in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Subcellular Fractionation—To prepare the nuclear extracts of K562/HA-N1IC and K562/pcDNA3 cells, the cell pellets were suspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the pellets of nuclei were resuspended in a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm sodium fluoride) and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The supernatants recovered after centrifugation were treated as nuclear extracts. Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Nuclear extracts (0.4 ml) of K562/HA-N1IC or K562/pcDNA3 cells were loaded on the top of 10.8 ml of a 10–60% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in NETN buffer. The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C for 15.5 h. The gradients were fractionated into 0.5-ml fractions each from the top, and aliquots of each fraction were subjected to immunoblotting for the detection of N1IC and YY1 proteins. The protein standards (catalase, 11.3 S, 232 kDa; thyroglobulin, 19.4 S, 669 kDa) were prepared in high salt buffer and run on a sucrose gradient. The collected fractions were assayed for protein to determine the corresponding positions of the protein standards on the gradients. Oligoprecipitation—The 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides with wild-type sequence (5′-AGATGCAGTCGCTGAGATTCTTTGGCCG-3′) or mutant sequence (5′-AGATGCAGTCGCCTGCAGTCTTTGGCCG-3′) of CBFl-binding sites were annealed with their complementary oligonucleotides for oligoprecipitation as described by Otsuka et al. (42Otsuka F. Iwamatsu A. Suzuki K. Ohsawa M. Hamer D.H. Koizumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23700-23707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) at room temperature for 15 min to cross-link DNA and protein, and the reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of NETN buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After the removal of cell debris, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose-bound anti-YY1 or anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies at 4 °C for 12–16 h. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed with NETN buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted with 150 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) twice by vortexing. Then 30 μg of RNase A, 36 μl of 5 m NaCl, and elution buffer were added to a final volume of 600 μl. The cross-linking of DNA and protein in the immunoprecipitates was reversed by heating at 67 °C for 5 h. After phenol extraction, DNA was precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in 50 μlofH2O. Five μl of each sample and control plasmid of 4×wtCBF1Luc (4 ng) were used as a template for PCR amplification using the specific primers 5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′. At 25, 30, and 35 cycles of amplification, PCR products (5 μl) were removed and run on a 1.0% agarose gel and then analyzed by ethidium bromide staining (43Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Association of the Intracellular Domain of Notch1 Receptor with YY1—Expression plasmids harboring various lengths (ANK, RAM-ANK, ANK-TAD, and N1IC) of Notch1 receptor intracellular domain were transfected into HEK293 cells to analyze CBF1-dependent transactivation activities by the CAT reporter assay. The expressed RAM-ANK, ANK-TAD, and N1IC, but not the ANK domain, were able to transactivate the reporter gene through the endogenous CBF1 with the highest activation by N1IC (Fig. 1). Results of the CAT assay reflect the fact that the RAM domain is the primary binding domain for CBF1, whereas ANK repeats interact weakly with CBF1, and TAD is important for transactivation activity (44Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of Notch signaling, we used a yeast two-hybrid system and pull-down assay combined with proteomic analyses to identify cellular factors associated with the human-activated Notch1 receptor, N1IC. The transcription factor YY1 is one of the identified candidates of N1IC-associated proteins. To confirm the association between YY1 and N1IC, coimmunoprecipitation was applied to stable N1IC-expressing K562 cell lines. Due to the rapid turnover and/or low level expression, the expression levels of the endogenous and exogenous N1IC were too weak to be detected in K562 cells (45Lam L.T. Ronchini C. Norton J. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19676-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The C-terminal PEST-like domain of Notch1 receptor contributes to instability and degradation of N1IC by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (26Gupta-Rossi N. Bail O.L. Gonen H. Brou C. Logeat F. Six E. Ciechanover A. Israël A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34371-34378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PEST domain of Notch1 receptor was omitted from this study in order to overexpress N1IC constitutively. The HA-N1IC fusion protein of about 98 kDa was immunoprecipitated from whole-cell extracts by antibodies against N1IC (Fig. 2A, left). After stripping, the HA-N1IC fusion protein was further confirmed by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2A, middle). Transcription factor YY1 was also detected after stripping and reprobing this immunoprecipitated blot with anti-YY1 antibody (Fig. 2A, right). Alternatively, the HA-N1IC fusion protein was also coimmunoprecipitated with cellular YY1 by anti-YY1 antibody (Fig. 2B). These results showed that ectopically expressed N1IC was associated with endogenous YY1 by the analysis of coimmunoprecipitation. Mapping the Associated Regions of N1IC and YY1 in Vitro by the GST Pull-down Assay—To dissect the region(s) essential for the association of YY1 and N1IC, the in vitro binding properties of these two proteins were examined by the GST pull-down assay. Partially purified GST and GST fusion proteins of N1IC and YY1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3). Whole-cell extracts of K562/pcDNA3 and K562/HA-N1IC cells were prepared for the pull-down assay by GST and GST fusion proteins. All fusion proteins of GST-ANKΔEP GST-ANK, GST-RAM-ANK, GST-ANK-TAD, and GST-N1IC were associated with endogenous YY1 of K562/pcDNA3 cells (Fig. 3A). This result shows that only the ANK domain of Notch1 receptor was sufficient to associate with YY1. Moreover, N1IC was only associated with the GST full-length YY1 fusion protein (GST-YY1, 1–414), but not with other truncated YY1 fusion proteins, e.g. GST-YY1-(1–54), GST-YY1-(1–80), GST-YY1-(1–154), and GST-YY1-(1–198) or GST-YY1-(1–295) (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the region of amino acid residues 295–414, the zinc finger domain region, of YY1 is essential for the association with N1IC. To determine further whether the region of amino acid residues 295–414 of YY1 is sufficient to associate with N1IC, partial purified GST and GST fusion proteins were used to pull-down N1IC in the whole-cell extracts of K562/HA-N1IC cells. N1IC was only associated with the GST full-length YY1 fusion protein (GST-YY1, 1–414) but not with truncated GST-YY1-(296–414) fusion protein (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that the zinc finger domain region of YY1 is essential, but not sufficient, for the association with N1IC. The Activated Notch1 Receptor Associated with YY1 in a Large Complex in the Nucleus—The intracellular domain of Notch1 receptor had been demonstrated to be associated with the transcription factor CBF1 and Mastermind-Like-1 (Maml) in an ∼1.5-MDa high molecular weight complex in the nucleus (47Jeffries S. Robbins D.J. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3927-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the association between the activated Notch1 receptor and YY1 occurs in the nucleus, sucrose gradient analyses were applied to nuclear extracts prepared from K562/pcDNA3 and HA-N1IC-expressing K562/HA-N1IC cells. When the collected fractions were analyzed by Western blot using anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibody, N1IC was detected in fractions 3–8 and 14–16 (Fig. 4A). After stripping and reprobing with anti-YY1 antibody, transcription factor YY1 was detected in fractions 1–12 and also in fractions 14–16. There were three distribution peaks of transcription factor YY1 in the sucrose gradient analysis, i.e. fractions 2–5, 8–10, and 14–16. The sucrose gradient analysis profile showed that N1IC and YY1 coexisted in both lower molecular weight fractions (fractions 3–5) and higher molecular weight fractions (fractions 14–16). In the absence of N1IC, YY1 showed the same sucrose gradient profile as that of K562/HA-N1IC cells. The presence of N1IC did not alter the distribution of endogenous YY1 in the sucrose gradient analysis. To determine whether the associated complex of N1IC and YY1 is present in these coexisting fractions, fractions 3–5, 8–10, and 14–16 were individually combined and immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies. YY1 was coimmunoprecipitated with N1IC in fractions 3–5 and 14–16 but not in fractions 8–10 (Fig. 4B). This result demonstrates that N1IC is associated with YY1 as both a lower molecular weight complex (fractions 3–5) and a higher molecular weight complex (fractions 14–16) in the nucleus. Suppression of Luciferase Reporter Activity Transactivated by Notch1 Receptor—Identification and elucidation of the physiological function of Notch receptor-associated proteins will provide insights into Notch signaling. To delineate the biological function of the association between N1IC and YY1 in Notch signaling, we used a reporter gene assay. K562 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing four copies of wild type or mutant CBF1-response elements (4×wtCBF1Luc and 4×mtCBF1Luc, respectively), N1IC-expressing construct, pcDNA3-HA-N1IC, and YY1-expressing construct, pCMV-YY1, or their control vectors. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Because N1IC can promote the expression of the reporter gene containing CBF1-response elements, there was a 54-fold enhancement of the luciferase activity by N1IC (Fig. 5). When cotransfected with the YY1 expression plasmid, this elevation of luciferase activity was suppressed by 39% to about 33-fold. This effect of YY1 was not observed in the luciferase reporter plasmid containing four copies of the mutant CBF1-response elements. The truncated YY1-(1–295), without the zinc finger domains, did not suppress the luciferase activity transactivated by N1IC, which also reflects the importance of the zinc finger domains in association between N1IC and YY1 as shown in Fig. 3B. This result implies that YY1 suppresses the luciferase reporter activity transactivated by Notch1 receptor. Intrinsic N1IC Associated with Endogenous YY1 in Jurkat and SUP-T1 Cells—It has been reported that the activated form of Notch1 receptor is unstable and can elicit biological effects at a very low protein concentration (45Lam L.T. Ronchini C. Norton J. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19676-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is possible that the constitutive overexpression of N1IC may cause the fortuitous association between N1IC and endogenous YY1. To exclude this possibility, we examined the association between N1IC and YY1 in Jurkat cells by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-YY1 antibody. The intrinsic N1IC could be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous YY1 (Fig. 6A). Alternatively, endogenous YY1 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with intrinsic N1IC using anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibody (data not shown). The intrinsic YY1 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous N1IC in SUP-T1 cells (Fig. 6B). These results showed that intrinsic N1IC might be associated with endogenous YY1 in cells. The YY1-N1IC-associated Complex Binds on the Wild-type CBF1-response Element but Not on the Mutant One—To prove that modulation of Notch1 signaling by YY1 was not an artifact from overexpression and/or alterations in signaling pathways, oligoprecipitation was performed to study the interaction between the YY1-N1IC-associated complex and DNA. In Jurkat cells, intrinsic N1IC and endogenous YY1 could be precipitated together with the 5′-biotinylated wild-type CBF1-response element but not the mutant one (Fig. 6C). However, YY1 could not be precipitated with the 5′-biotinylated wild-type CBF1-response element in K562 cells (data not shown). Additionally, the ChIP assay was also used to examine the specific association of transcription factor YY1 and N1IC with DNA in the context of living cells. Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids with wild-type (4×wtCBF1Luc) or mutant (4×mtCBF1Luc) CBF1-response elements. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested for the ChIP assay using mouse anti-IgG, anti-YY1, or anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies. The amplified PCR product of 470 bp was only present in the sample prepared from wild-type CBF1-response element-transfected cells but was not present in those transfected with the mutant one (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that transcription factor YY1 indirectly binds on the wild-type CBF1-response element via associating with N1IC which directly interacts with CBF1. A similar result was also obtained for the ChIP assay using K562/HA-N1IC cells. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the intracellular domain of human Notch1 receptor and transcription factor YY1. We show here that N1IC is associated with YY1 in the nucleus and that YY1 suppresses the CBF1-dependent luciferase reporter activity transactivated by Notch1 receptor. This is the first report regarding the role of the multifunctional transcription factor YY1 in CBF1-dependent Notch signaling. Jeffries et al. (47Jeffries S. Robbins D.J. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3927-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that a high molecular weight Notch complex of ∼1.5 MDa was present in the nucleus of N1IC-transformed RKE cells and in a human T-cell leukemia cell line. We demonstrate that YY1 is associated with N1IC as both small and large complexes in the nucleus and suppresses the CBF1-dependent luciferase reporter activity transactivated by N1IC. Therefore, YY1 may modulate Notch signaling via the large high molecular weight Notch complex. In sucrose gradient analysis, the distribution profile of YY1 in the nucleus did not vary whether N1IC is presented or not. This phenomenon may be due to the multifunctionality or abundance of YY1. The ubiquitous transcription factor YY1 plays several regulatory roles in the transcription of target genes. Only a small fraction of YY1 may be involved in the regulation of Notch signaling in the nucleus. Therefore, the distribution profile of YY1 in the absence of exogenous N1IC in the nucleus was the same as that in the presence of N1IC. YY1 is a complex multifaceted protein that may act as a transcriptional repressor (48Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9804-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 49Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T.

Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), a transcriptional activator (51Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), or a transcriptional initiator (52Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Differential expression of the YY1 protein in myocytes affects both transcription of specific genes and cell differentiation (53Chen C.-Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of N1IC with this multifunctional transcription factor YY1 may be relevant to the diversity of Notch signaling. These results imply that YY1 may regulate cell differentiation by itself or via the control of Notch signaling. YY1 is a ubiquitous protein abundantly expressed in both K562 and Jurkat cells. Although transient transfection of the YY1 expression plasmid showed no significant increase in the expression level of the YY1 protein in the luciferase reporter assay (data not shown), the low level of exogenous YY1 showed 39% suppression of CBF1-dependent luciferase activity transactivated by N1IC. One of the explanations is that only a small amount of exogenous YY1 is sufficient to suppress Notch transactivation. Alternatively, newly synthesized YY1 may differ from endogenous YY1 in compartmentalization or biological function. Only the newly synthesized exogenous YY1, not the endogenous YY1, bound with the high molecular weight Notch complex suppressed Notch transactivation. In this study, YY1 only partially suppressed the activation of CBF1-dependent luciferase activity transactivated by N1IC from 54- to 33-fold. Why did the exogenously expressed YY1 not completely block the activity of the reporter gene promoted by N1IC? Possibly, the amount of exogenous YY1 was insufficient to completely antagonize N1IC, and a very low concentration of N1IC can elicit its biological functions (45Lam L.T. Ronchini C. Norton J. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19676-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the reporter gene assay, transfection of the transcription factor YY1-expressing plasmid alone did not activate the CBF1-response element (Fig. 5). This result agreed with the inability to precipitate YY1 with the 5′-biotinylated wild-type CBF1-response element in K562 cells by streptavidin-agarose beads (data not shown). However, YY1 could be precipitated with the wild-type CBF1-response element in Jurkat cells (Fig. 6C) and N1IC-expressing K562 cells. The luciferase reporter plasmid with the wild-type CBF1-response element could also be precipitated with anti-YY1 and anti-Notch1 C-terminal antibodies in the ChIP assay (Fig. 6D). Therefore, transcription factor YY1 regulated the transcriptional activity of the wild-type CBF1-response element via an association with the high molecular weight Notch complex containing CBF1. The zinc finger domains, DNA binding domains of the transcription factor, are required for the association of YY1 with N1IC according to the GST fusion protein pull-down assay. Zinc finger domains are also important for the interaction of YY1 with several other cellular factors, including TBP, CBP/p300, TAFII55, TFIIB, E1A, c-Myc, SP1, and ATF/CREB (reviewed in Ref. 54Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In mapping the binding region of the activated Notch1 receptor, the ANK domain of N1IC alone was associated with endogenous YY1 (Fig. 3A). The ANK domain has been detected in many proteins, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, signal transduction and transcriptional regulators, cytoskeletal organizers, developmental regulators, and toxins (55Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 56Bork P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This functional motif is a well known region for the interaction between proteins (38Nekrep N. Geyer M. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5566-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 57Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Although only the ANK domain of N1IC is sufficient to associate with YY1, it alone cannot transactivate CBF1-dependent Notch signaling (Fig. 1B). The p300 protein associates with N1IC and acts as a transcriptional coactivator (28Oswald F. Täuber B. Dobner T. Bourteele S. Kostezka U. Adler G. Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7761-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The association between p300 and N1IC requires the CH3 region of p300, and deletion of the EP domain, a segment of 15 amino acid residues 3′ adjacent to the ANK domain, within N1IC destabilizes the interaction with p300 in vivo (28Oswald F. Täuber B. Dobner T. Bourteele S. Kostezka U. Adler G. Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7761-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The p300 protein also associates with YY1 through the C-terminal region of p300 that includes CH3 domain (46Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region of the four zinc fingers and the region around residues 150–200 of YY1 are required for strong and weak association with p300, respectively (54Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The association between N1IC and YY1 requires the ANK domain of N1IC and the four zinc fingers of YY1 (Fig. 3). Deletion of EP domain, ANKΔEP, did not affect the association of ANK domain of N1IC with YY1. This observation may exclude the possibility that N1IC associates with YY1 through p300 and explain the suppression effect of YY1 on CBF1-mediated transactivation activity of N1IC. We thank Dr. Y.-H.

https://openalex.org/W1993465569,"Levels of Rb2/p130 protein are increased 5–10-fold following all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of the retinoid-sensitive ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line CAOV3, but not the retinoid-resistant adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3. We found that this increase in Rb2/p130 protein levels in ATRA-treated CAOV3 cells was the result of an increased protein stability. Moreover, Rb2/p130 exhibited a decreased ubiquitination following ATRA treatment. Because phosphorylation frequently mediates ubiquitination of proteins, we examined the serine/threonine phosphatase activity in our CAOV3 cells following ATRA treatment. A significant increase in Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was found, which correlated with a rise in the level of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit-α. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down studies demonstrated that PP2A and Rb2/p130 associate. We have made use of a battery of Rb2/p130 mutants to determine the sites dephosphorylated in response to ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells. Obligate CDK4 phosphorylation sites seemed most important to the stability of the protein and are among the candidate sites that are dephosphorylated by PP2A following ATRA treatment. Finally, using both small interfering RNA specific to the catalytic subunit of PP2A and a variant of the SKOV3 cell line that overexpresses PP2A, we have shown that modulation of PP2A protein levels correlates with the ability of ATRA to inhibit growth of ovarian carcinoma cells. Our data suggest that ATRA mediates growth inhibition by stabilizing Rb2/p130 via a mechanism that involves induction of PP2A, an enzyme that can potentially dephosphorylate Rb2/p130, thereby protecting it from degradation by the proteasome. Levels of Rb2/p130 protein are increased 5–10-fold following all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of the retinoid-sensitive ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line CAOV3, but not the retinoid-resistant adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3. We found that this increase in Rb2/p130 protein levels in ATRA-treated CAOV3 cells was the result of an increased protein stability. Moreover, Rb2/p130 exhibited a decreased ubiquitination following ATRA treatment. Because phosphorylation frequently mediates ubiquitination of proteins, we examined the serine/threonine phosphatase activity in our CAOV3 cells following ATRA treatment. A significant increase in Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was found, which correlated with a rise in the level of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit-α. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down studies demonstrated that PP2A and Rb2/p130 associate. We have made use of a battery of Rb2/p130 mutants to determine the sites dephosphorylated in response to ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells. Obligate CDK4 phosphorylation sites seemed most important to the stability of the protein and are among the candidate sites that are dephosphorylated by PP2A following ATRA treatment. Finally, using both small interfering RNA specific to the catalytic subunit of PP2A and a variant of the SKOV3 cell line that overexpresses PP2A, we have shown that modulation of PP2A protein levels correlates with the ability of ATRA to inhibit growth of ovarian carcinoma cells. Our data suggest that ATRA mediates growth inhibition by stabilizing Rb2/p130 via a mechanism that involves induction of PP2A, an enzyme that can potentially dephosphorylate Rb2/p130, thereby protecting it from degradation by the proteasome. Ovarian cancer accounts for ∼33% of all newly diagnosed gynecologic cancers and 55% of gynecologic cancer deaths (1Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 2Daly M. Obrams G.I. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hoskins W.J. J. Cell. Biochem.

The relatively high mortality rate associated with ovarian carcinoma is attributed to the late stage at which these tumors are usually diagnosed. This is unfortunate for the patient, as the tumors may have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis. Taking this into account, it is clear that an effective late stage therapy for ovarian cancer is desirable. Retinoids are a group of natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A. Retinoids have been shown to play an important role in cell growth and differentiation by binding to their cognate nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RARs, retinoic acid receptors; RXRs, retinoid X receptors; ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; Rb, retinoblastoma; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; PP2ACα, protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit-α; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CLBL, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (5Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors, which can then bind to their consensus sequences in DNA (RAREs) and elicit the downstream biological effects of retinoids (7Gudas L.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 655-662PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have focused on the CAOV3 cell line, which is sensitive to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, and the SKOV3 cell line, which is resistant to ATRA treatment. ATRA has been shown previously to inhibit the growth of CAOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (8Wu S. Donigan A. Platsoucas C.D. Jung W. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Wu S. Zhang D. Donigan A. Dawson M.I. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell.

Cell Res. 1997; 237: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is also the phase of the cell cycle that is controlled by the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins, including Rb2/p130 (11Stiegler P. Giordano A. Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol. 1999; 21: 363-366PubMed Google Scholar). The Rb2/p130 phosphoprotein is a member of the Rb family of tumor suppressors. The three members of this family share a high degree of homology both in composition and in method of action (12Sidle A. Palaty C. Dirks P. Wiggan O. Kiess M. Gill R.M. Wong A.K. Hamel P.A. Crit.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). These “pocket” proteins maintain order at the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle through their ability to bind and sequester members of the E2F family of transcription factors (11Stiegler P. Giordano A. Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol. 1999; 21: 363-366PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sidle A. Palaty C. Dirks P. Wiggan O. Kiess M. Gill R.M. Wong A.K. Hamel P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which control the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. The growth regulatory activities associated with Rb2/p130 are mediated by its phosphorylation state, as this is clearly cell cycle-regulated (19Baldi A. De Luca A. Claudio P.P. Baldi F. Giordano G.G. Tommasino M. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and Rb2/p130 has been shown to be a substrate for cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. Rb2/p130 has three apparent phosphorylation states. These species can be distinguished by their migration on SDS-PAGE and are presumably produced by various phosphorylations of the many CDK sites on Rb2/p130. The two faster migrating forms are stable and characteristic of the G0 state of the cell cycle, whereas the third, slowest migrating form is the most hyperphosphorylated and targets the protein for degradation. Degradation of Rb2/p130 consequently leads to progression through the cell cycle. It is most likely that this third, hyperphosphorylated species results from phosphorylation of CDK4-specific sites, converting the protein from form 1 to form 3 and leading to its subsequent degradation. Although the phosphorylation of the Rb2/p130 protein has been extensively studied, the dephosphorylation of this protein is not yet well characterized. It is known, however, that certain serine/threonine phosphatases act to dephosphorylate the closely related protein Rb (22Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Yan Y. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31917-31924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Naderi S. Blomhoff H.K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore activate its growth-suppressive functions. In this work, we set out to determine the mechanism by which ATRA treatment leads to the accumulation of Rb2/p130 protein and subsequent growth arrest. Our results show that the increase in Rb2/p130 levels caused by ATRA treatment involves a reduction in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Rb2/p130. We also show a corresponding increase in the activity and protein level of protein phosphatase (PP) 2A following ATRA treatment. We were subsequently able to show a specific interaction between Rb2/p130 and PP2A that increased upon ATRA treatment. This interaction is functional, as a PP2A-specific phosphatase activity could be immunoprecipitated with Rb2/p130. We also show that inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity by chemical inhibitors resulted in hyperphosphorylation of Rb2/p130. This result supports the notion that PP2A dephosphorylates Rb2/p130 in CAOV3 cells. We also demonstrate that modulation of PP2A levels resulted in a corresponding change in the ability of ATRA to inhibit CAOV3 growth, suggesting that PP2A up-regulation is an important factor in the growth inhibition of CAOV3 cells mediated by ATRA. Taken together, our results suggest that PP2A is a mediator of retinoid-induced growth suppression in ovarian carcinoma cells. Cell Culture and Treatments—The human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines CAOV3 and SKOV3 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SKOV3 cells overexpressing RARα and RXRα (SK-RAR/RXR cells) were previously described by our laboratory (25Wu S. Zhang D. Zhang Z.P. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2839-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 nm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at all times in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. ATRA treatments were performed on days 0, 2, and 4, and all cells were harvested on day 5 for preparation of lysates or cell counting. This was done to avoid any inaccuracies arising from changes in cell density. Phosphatase inhibitors were added to the medium at the indicated concentrations along with ATRA at 2-day intervals. λ-Phosphatase treatment of cell lysates was performed for 15 min at 37 °C in assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2 at pH 7.5. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Rb2/p130 antibody (sc-317) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. This antibody can recognize all phosphorylated forms of Rb2. Antibodies used against PP2A catalytic subunit-α (PP2ACα) include sc-6110 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p185p (Exalpha Biologicals). The latter was used specifically to immunoprecipitate PP2ACα, as sc-6110 is not able to immunoprecipitate the protein. Anti-hemagglutinin (sc-805) and anti-PP1 (sc-7482) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. λ-Phosphatase (p0753s) was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. λ-Phosphatase is a manganese-dependent protein phosphatase with activity for phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The phosphatase inhibitors fostriecin, endothal, and okadaic acid were purchased from Sigma and were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. 10 nm okadaic acid will inhibit the activity of PP2A specifically, whereas 1μm okadaic acid will inhibit the activities of both PP1 and PP2A. Both fostriecin and endothal are PP2A-specific. ATRA was obtained as a generous gift from Hoffmann-La Roche. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (32Zhang D. Vuocolo S. Masciullo V. Sava T. Giordano A. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7935-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein content of the lysates was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of whole cell lysate was subsequently immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of appropriate the antibody. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (IP-04) purchased from Oncogene Research Products and were used to collect the antibodyantigen complexes. Immunoprecipitates were loaded on either a 7% (Rb2/p130) or a 12% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed overnight. Gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by Western blotting. After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:4000, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the ECL™ enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—Plasmids containing inserts corresponding to GST, GST-NH2 (amino acids 1–416 of Rb2/p130), GST-pocket (amino acids 417–1026 of Rb2/p130), and GST-COOH (amino acids 1027–1139 of Rb2/p130) were a generous gift of Dr. Antonio Giordano (Temple University). Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with 500 mg of whole cell extract from CAOV3 cells treated with 10-6m ATRA for 3 days. Incubation was carried out at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm MgCl2, and 8% glycerol). The beads were then washed five times with wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm MgCl2, and 8% glycerol). The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and detected by Western blotting. Phosphatase Assays—A radioactive protein serine/threonine phosphatase assay system was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Myelin basic protein substrate was prepared by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphatase activity was then determined by measuring the release of inorganic radioactive phosphate from the substrate (trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts) after incubation with various cell lysates. Phosphatase assays involving immunoprecipitated PP2A and Rb2/p130 were performed using a nonradioactive serine/threonine phosphatase assay system purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The substrate for dephosphorylation in this assay, RRA(pT)VA, is preferentially dephosphorylated by PP2A. It is known to be a poor substrate for PP1. Proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with the corresponding antibodies and then incubated for 4 h with protein A/G-agarose beads. The beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation wash buffer and twice with PP2A reaction buffer (as described in the kit) and used in the assay with or without inhibitors. Rb2/p130 Half-life Assays—The plasmids used in the preparation of in vitro transcribed and translated as well as in vivo wild-type and mutant Rb2/p130 proteins (pcDNA-HARb2 mutants) have been described previously (20Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine the persistence of the Rb2/p130 phosphorylation mutants in vitro, the mutant constructs were first transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysate. The TnT-Quick™ coupled transcription/translation system was purchased from Promega and used to make in vitro Rb2/p130. Plasmid DNA encoding the protein of interest was incubated with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate provided and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, 2 μl of the protein lysate was used in degradation assays. In vitro transcribed and translated wild-type and mutant Rb2/p130 proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were incubated with CAOV3 cell lysates for the indicated times at 37 °C. An ATP-regenerating buffer consisting of 10 nm creatine phosphate, 2 nm ATP, and 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase was also added to the reactions. At the indicated time points, samples were collected and loaded onto an acrylamide gel, which was then dried in a gel dryer. The resulting bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using Opti-Quant™ software (Packard Instrument Co.). To determine the persistence of these proteins in cells, the mutant Rb2/p130 plasmids were transiently transfected into CAOV3 cells using the calcium phosphate method. A cytomegalovirus-luciferase construct was cotransfected in all cases to correct for variation in transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, the medium was changed, and the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points after cycloheximide treatment, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blots were quantitated using the Total Lab™ software package from Nonlinear Dynamics (Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—PP2ACα primers were purchased from Ranson Hill (Toronto, Canada). Primers were synthesized as follows: forward, 5′-AATCCAACGTGCAAGAGGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-TCCAAACATTTGCATTTCCA-3′. mRNA was obtained from ATRA-treated and control CAOV3 cells using the RNAzol B™ protocol (Tel-Test, Fredericksburg, TX). RT-PCRs were performed using a kit from Clontech. PCR was carried out as indicated with the exception of the use of 35S-dATP (1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR product was sampled at three separate cycles to account for the linearity of the assay. Samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, analyzed using a PhosphorImager, and quantitated using Opti-Quant™. RT-PCR analysis was carried out in the same fashion for Rb2/p130 mRNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-ATGTGATGGCAAAGGTCACA-3′; and reverse, 5′-GAATGAGGTCTCCCCTCTCC-3′. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Design and Treatment—siRNAs to human PP2ACα were designed with 3′-overhanging thymidine dimers as described previously (50Elbashir S. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). The Ambion Gene Silencer™ siRNA preparation kit was used to synthesize three specific PP2A siRNAs using the DNA primers described by Pandey et al. (51Pandey A. Mellon S. Miller W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Using this kit, siRNAs are in vitro transcribed from a 29-mer DNA primer including the specific 21-nucleotide sequence of interest and an 8-nucleotide leader sequence used to facilitate T7 polymerase binding and transcription. CAOV3 cells were treated with ATRA on day 1. On day 2, the indicated concentrations of three different siRNAs were transfected into CAOV3 cells using the Ambion Silencer™ siRNA transfection kit as directed. The sense and antisense siRNA sequences used are summarized in Table I. 4 h later, the plates were washed with fresh medium and returned to the incubator. 72 h after transfection, the level of “knockdown” of PP2A protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. The effect on the growth of the cells was also assayed by direct cell counting. A paired t test to show significance between siRNA-treated samples and no-siRNA controls was performed using the Instat™ software package from GraphPAD (San Diego, CA).Table ISequences of siRNAs directed against PP2ACα129mRNA5′-AAAUGUGCAAGAGGUUCGUUG-3′Sense5′-AACAACGAACCTCTTGCACATCCTGTCTC-3′Antisense5′-AAATGTGCAAGAGGTTCGTTGCCTGTCTC-3′395mRNA5′-AAUGUCUGCGAAAGUAUGGGA-3′Sense5′-AATCCCATACTTTCGCAGACACCTGTCTC-3′Antisense5′-AATGTCTGCGAAAGTATGGGACCTGTCTC-3′745mRNA5′-AAUUGGUGUCAUGAUCGGAAU-3′Sense5′-AAATTCCGATCATGACACCAACCTGTCTC-3′Antisense5′-AATTGGTGTCATGATCGGAATCCTGTCTC-3′ Open table in a new tab ATRA Induces an Increase in Rb2/p130 Protein Levels in CAOV3 Ovarian Carcinoma Cells—As shown in Fig. 1A, ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells resulted in a significant increase in Rb2/p130 protein levels, although the mRNA levels remained relatively constant (Fig. 1B) (26Zhang D. Holmes W.F. Wu S. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because we have previously demonstrated that this increase is not seen in the ATRA-resistant cell line SKOV3 (26Zhang D. Holmes W.F. Wu S. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we reasoned that understanding how ATRA treatment leads to the accumulation of Rb2/p130 could provide insight into the mechanism of retinoid-mediated growth inhibition of CAOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Rb2/p130 Protein Increase following ATRA Treatment Is Due to Increased Protein Stability— Fig. 2 shows the turnover of the Rb2/p130 protein in CAOV3 cells following treatment with ATRA and cycloheximide. There was a clear increase in the stability of Rb2/p130 in ATRA-treated cells compared with ethanol-treated cells. Fig. 2B shows that ATRA treatment increased the half-life of the protein from 12 to >40 h. This experiment, along with the data in Fig. 1B, suggests that the increases in Rb2/p130 levels following ATRA treatment result from post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination of Rb2/p130 Decreases following ATRA Treatment in CAOV3 Cells—To ascertain the mechanism responsible for the degradation of the Rb2/p130 protein in our CAOV3 cells, we next examined the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the Rb2/p130 protein level increased in CAOV3 cells following treatment of these cells with the proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (CLBL). This inhibitor is the active metabolite of the previously described proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of the proteasome (27Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 28Fukuchi K. Maruyama H. Takagi Y. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the proteasome is responsible for degradation of Rb2/p130 in CAOV3 cells and that this system could possibly be modified by ATRA treatment. We next wanted to determine the extent of ubiquitination of the Rb2/p130 protein following ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells. After treating CAOV3 cells with CLBL alone or with ATRA and CLBL, samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Rb2/p130 antibody. The subsequent Western blot was then probed with an antibody to ubiquitin to assess the amount of ubiquitinated Rb2/p130. As shown in Fig. 3B, there was a clear decrease in the amount of ubiquitinated Rb2/p130 following ATRA treatment. To rule out the possibility that the decreased degradation of Rb2/p130 resulted from ATRA-mediated changes in the levels of proteasome component proteins, Western blotting was performed to assay the levels of a variety of proteasome components (HN3, LMP2, and XAPC7) following ATRA treatment. The representative Western blots shown in Fig. 3C demonstrate that the levels of these proteasome components did not change in response to ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells. This suggests that the decreased degradation of Rb2/p130 following ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells involves decreased targeting of ubiquitin to the protein, and not an alteration by ATRA of the expression of proteasome components. Increases in Phosphatase Activity in CAOV3 Cells Are Due to PP2A—It has been shown that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of target proteins can play a major role in whether or not they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (29Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously found that ATRA treatment causes both a decrease in hyperphosphorylated Rb2/p130 in CAOV3 cells and an increase in the amount of faster migrating Rb2/p130 forms, indicating that ATRA treatment results in a partial dephosphorylation of Rb2/p130 (32Zhang D. Vuocolo S. Masciullo V. Sava T. Giordano A. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7935-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taking these data into account, we next performed a phosphatase assay specific for serine/threonine phosphatases that could dephosphorylate the Rb2/p130 protein and cause its increased persistence in ATRA-treated CAOV3 cells. This assay involves the use of 32P-labeled myelin basic protein, which can be dephosphorylated by a wide variety of serine/threonine phosphatases. Lysates from ATRA-treated and control CAOV3 cells were incubated with the radiolabeled myelin basic protein, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts were quantitated. Fig. 4A reveals the dramatic increase in phosphatase activity seen following ATRA treatment. This is consistent with Rb2/p130 becoming dephosphorylated in response to ATRA treatment due to an increase in amount and/or activity of a cellular serine/threonine phosphatase. To identify which phosphatase could be responsible for the increased phosphatase activity in CAOV3 cells treated with ATRA, we also used the phosphatase inhibitors fostriecin and okadaic acid. Okadaic acid was added to the lysate and used at a concentration known to inhibit PP2A (10 nm) and at a higher concentration known to inhibit both PP2A and PP1 (1 μm) (33Sasaki K. Murata M. Yasumoto T. Mieskes G. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fostriecin was also used in the assay and is 40,000 times more specific for PP2A than any other serine/threonine phosphatase (34Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that both okadaic acid (at the low concentration) and fostriecin were able to almost completely inhibit the increase in phosphatase activity seen in CAOV3 lysates treated with ATRA. These data suggest that PP2A may be the major contributor to the up-regulation of phosphatase activity observed following ATRA treatment of CAOV3 cells. Taken together, these results implicate PP2A as a mediator of the previously shown ATRA-induced hypophosphorylation of Rb2/p130. It has been shown previously that certain serine/threonine phosphatases can dephosphorylate members of the Rb family (23Yan Y. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31917-31924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This, along with our previous experiments, led us to investigate the expression of two major serine/threonine phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, in CAOV3 cells following ATRA treatment. The PP2ACα protein was found to increase after 1 and 3 days of ATRA treatment by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). It is also interesting to note that the ATRA-resistant cell line SKOV3 expressed significantly lower levels of PP2A, although a small increase was observed after 3 and 5 days of ATRA treatment. This not only further implicates PP2A in the dephosphorylation of the Rb2/p130 protein in response to ATRA treatment, but may also give insight into the resistance to ATRA observed in SKOV3 cells. We next performed an experiment to determine whether the increase in PP2ACα protein levels following ATRA treatment resulted from an increase in the amount of PP2ACα mRNA. 35S RT-PCR was performed on control and 3-day ATRA-treated CAOV3 cells. Samples were taken at three separate cycles to ensure that the results were in the linear range of the assay. It is clear from Fig. 4C that there was an up-regulation of PP2ACα mRNA in CAOV3 cells in response to ATRA treatment. Rb2/p130 Phosphoryl"

Propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate induced severalfold increases in the expression of Glc-6-Pase mRNA. In reporter gene assays, propionate, valerate, caproate, and also octanoate increased Glc-6-Pase promoter activity by 6-16-fold. Butyrate, by itself, had little or no effect on promoter activity, but it induced a robust increase (45-fold) in promoter activity in cells co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the transcription factor HNF-4α (α isoforms of hepatic nuclear factor 4). HNF-4α also enhanced promoter activity induced by other short-chain fatty acids. A dominant negative form of HNF-4α abrogated the fatty acid-induced promoter activity, a finding that accentuates a role for HNF-4α in the transcription process studied here. In cells transfected with HNF-4α, short-chain fatty acids and trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, synergistically enhanced promoter activity, suggesting that hyperacetylation of histones is an important component of the transactivation of the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter by HNF-4α. Region-751/-466 of this promoter contains seven putative HNF-4α-binding motifs. Binding of HNF-4α to this region was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that HNF-4α is recruited to the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter during short-chain fatty acid-induced transcription from this promoter.

Hepatic Glc-6-Pase is a multicomponent complex located in the endoplasmic reticulum and consists of at least five different proteins (2Nordlie R.C. Bode A.M. Foster J.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Hormones and nutrients such as glucose and fatty acids, which are elevated in poorly controlled diabetes, profoundly modulate the expression of the gene for the catalytic unit (Glc-6-Pase) (7Massillon D.

Whereas glucose strongly activates expression of this gene, the effect of fatty acids is quite complex and appears to depend on the chain length and state of saturation of the fatty acid (1Chatelain F. Pegorier J.P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Rajas F. Gautier A. Bady I. Montano S. Mithieux G. J. Biol.

For example, polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit, while long-chain saturated fatty acids induce expression of this gene (1Chatelain F. Pegorier J.P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Rajas F. Gautier A. Bady I. Montano S. Mithieux G. J. Biol.

However, virtually nothing is known as to whether short-chain fatty acids modulate the expression of the Glc-6-Pase gene or any genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes. Although the role of nutrients as regulators of gene expression is well documented (10Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene transcription by long-chain saturated fatty acids has been attributed to stabilization of the mRNA (1Chatelain F. Pegorier J.P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the effects of saturated fatty acids may also involve gene transcription, although this has not been tested. Modulating effects of short-chain fatty acids, if any, have also not been explored. Here we have studied the effect of short-chain fatty acids on Glc-6-Pase gene expression because, like long-chain fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids can also play an important role in energy generation. Using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and the hepatoma cell line H4IIE, we show that short-chain fatty acids induce Glc-6-Pase gene transcription and that this induction occurs via recruitment of the transcription factor HNF-4α to the Glc-6-Pase promoter. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Rat hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (15Massillon D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4055-4062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Primary cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mm glucose (15Massillon D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4055-4062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum. Cells were transfected with 1 μgofa -751/+66 proximal portion of the mouse Glc-6-Pase gene promoter linked to luciferase reporter gene using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) at a 3:1 ratio of FuGENE 6 to DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because we found that various fatty acids induced reporter gene expression in conventional reporter constructs (e.g. Renilla and β-galactosidase) used for normalization in transfection experiments, making it impractical to use such plasmids for this purpose in our experiments, we normalized luciferase activity to the protein content of each sample. In co-transfection experiments, 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid was co-transfected with 100 ng of cDNA expression plasmid, and the total amount of DNA was adjusted, if necessary, by adding the empty plasmid. Cells were harvested 24 h after addition of fatty acids, washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then lysed with 300 μl of Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and 10 μl of the supernatant solution were assayed for luciferase activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method using a Bio-Rad assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each transfection was performed in duplicate at least three times. Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids harboring genes for wild-type and dominant negative HNF-4α were obtained from Dr. Todd Leff (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). cDNA for Glc-6-Pase was obtained from Dr. Rebecca Taub (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). cDNA for glucose-6-phosphate translocase was obtained by PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-ACACAGCTCAGCAGATCCG-3′ and 5′-CCTTAGGGACTGAGGTATTGGC-3′ (GenBank™ accession number NM_031589). The resulting cDNA was subcloned into pCMV-Tag 2A (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the nucleotide sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Northern Blotting—TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was assessed for purity by the 260/280 nm absorbancy ratios. Electrophoresis of the RNA (20 μg) was performed on a 1.2% formaldehydedenatured agarose gel in 1× MOPS running buffer. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and prehybridized for 4 h at 55 °C in Church buffer (0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin). Hybridization with the 32P-labeled probe that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences) was then carried out for 16 h at 55 °C in the same buffer. After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 55 °C. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray films for 12-48 h at -80 °C using intensifying screens. The autoradiogram was quantified by scanning densitometry using the Eastman Kodak Co. 1-D analysis software. RNA loading was monitored by ethidium bromide staining of the gels to visualize 18 and 28 S rRNAs. Histone Acetylation Assay—Histones were prepared by acid precipitation as follows. Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold 1× PBS and then scraped off the dishes into ice-cold PBS. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm PMSF), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 2.2 n HCl and then incubated on ice for an additional 30 min followed by centrifugation at 16,060 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Acetone (1 ml) was added to the supernatant fraction (which contained the acid-soluble proteins) and allowed to incubate overnight at 20 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 16,060 × g for 15 min, washed with acetone, and air-dried to obtain a white powder containing the histones. A total of 20 μg of protein was fractionated onto a 12% urea gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated overnight with 50 ng of anti-acetylated H3 antibody/ml (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or 1 μg of anti-acetylated H4 antibody/ml (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 2 h. The signals were enhanced by chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—H4IIE cells in 100-mm dishes were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was then neutralized at room temperature (5 min) by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and collected by scraping in 1 ml of 1% SDS containing 100 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/ml, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1× mixture of protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science. Lysates were mixed in a Vortex mixer, and insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C (for 5 min). The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1× mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were sonicated with a Fisher Sonic Dismembrator at setting 10 for six 20-s pulses to achieve an average DNA length of ∼1,000 bp. The remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant solution was diluted with 2 volumes of 1% Nonidet P-40, 350 mm NaCl and incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without 2 μg of anti-HNF-4α antibody. Prior to immunoprecipitation, 20% of the sonicated chromatin from each reaction was saved for assessing total input chromatin. These were processed along with the eluted immunoprecipitates beginning at the cross-link reversal step. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min; washed four times in 1% Nonidet P-40, 350 mm NaCl, 100 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/ml; resuspended in 125 μlof1% SDS, 16 μg of salmon sperm DNA/ml; and eluted by heating to 85 °C for 10 min. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation of the eluate for 6 h at 65 °C. Samples were diluted with 125 μl of water containing 160 μg of proteinase K/ml and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol containing 5 μg of glycogen/ml and then pelleted by microcentrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of H2O and analyzed by PCR using the following primers to analyze target sites (sites 4 and 5 in Fig. 4A): 5′-GGGCTCTGTCTTTATGGTCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTACTGCCGGAAGTGAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR cycles were 95 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Following 30 cycles of amplification, the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from H4IIE cells plated in 100-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested with a cell scraper, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 1,500 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.3 mm Na3VO4,5mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold storage buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm Na3VO4,5mm NaF, 1× mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 25% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatant fraction was frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Nuclear extracts (5 or 10 μg of protein) from H4IIE cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol, and the end-labeled oligonucleotide probe(50,000 cpm). For competition assays, the extracts were preincubated with 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. If antibody binding was to be tested, 4 μg of the indicated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated on ice for 30 min with the reaction mixture before adding the labeled probe. The samples were loaded onto a prerun, 16-cm-long, 1.5-mm-thick 4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1) gel prepared in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). After electrophoresis for 2-3 h at 200 V (at 4 °C), the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak films at -80 °C for 3-24 h with intensifying screens. The radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Each gel mobility shift assay was repeated with at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts. Western Blotting—Supernatants and nuclear extracts were prepared as described under“Nuclear Extracts.' Then 20 μg of nuclear extract proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then blocked in a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk prepared in 1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was then stained with fast green (Sigma). After destaining, the membrane was incubated with a goat polyclonal anti-HNF-4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (New England BioLabs). Short-chain Fatty Acids Induce Glc-6-Pase Gene Expression—In Northern blotting assays to assess the effects of short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate) on steady-state levels of Glc-6-Pase mRNA, acetate had no effect, whereas all other short-chain fatty acids tested induced robust increases in Glc-6-Pase mRNA levels in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (Fig. 1). This effect was genespecific because mRNA levels for glucose-6-phosphate translocase, which is associated with the Glc-6-Pase complex, was not affected by the various fatty acids tested (Fig. 1). Next we wondered whether short-chain fatty acids might affect the expression of another gene encoding a key gluconeogenic enzyme. In this regard, we assessed the effect of the short-chain fatty acids on steady-state levels of PEPCK mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1(third panel from top), the various short-chain fatty acids also increased PEPCK mRNA levels to varying degrees, the most potent being butyrate, which provoked a greater than 5-fold increase in PEPCK mRNA levels. Transcriptional Activation of Glc-6-Pase by Short-chain Fatty Acids Requires DNA Sequence Elements Located in the Non-coding Region—The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids induce Glc-6-Pase expression from the endogenous promoter. We then used the luciferase reporter gene assay to monitor transcription from the transfected promoter. For these experiments, H4IIE cells were transfected with a -751/+66 bp fragment of the Glc-6-Pase promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (-751/+66-LUC) (16Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional activity of this promoter construct in the presence of various short-chain fatty acids was then measured. In doseresponse pilot experiments, valerate was the most potent, producing maximal response at 1 mm, while propionate and caproate induced maximal promoter activity at 2.5 mm (data not shown). Therefore, subsequent experiments were carried out with a 2.5 mm concentration of each fatty acid with the exception of valerate, which was used at 1 mm. At these concentrations, caproate and valerate induced a 5-6-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 2A); propionate had a much lesser effect (about 2-fold), while acetate and butyrate had little or no effect (Fig. 2A). We also assessed the effect of the short-chain fatty acids on transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter, a promoter that responds also to gluconeogenic stimuli (17Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 18Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

When the H4IIE cells were transfected with a -490 bp proximal fragment of the PEPCK gene promoter that has all the necessary elements for hormonal regulation of this gene (20Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liu J. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 104: 89-100PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu J.S. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the short-chain fatty acids elicited substantial increases in PEPCK gene promoter activity, the most potent being butyrate and valerate, which induced 16-17-fold increases in the activity of the promoter (Fig. 2B). Taken together with the data on the mRNA levels for both PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase (see Fig. 1), these results suggest a concerted response to the inductive effect of these short-chain fatty acids by at least two genes encoding two different gluconeogenic enzymes. The little or no effect of butyrate on the Glc-6-Pase promoter activity was rather surprising considering that this fatty acid induced robust increases not only in Glc-6-Pase mRNA level (see Fig. 1, top panel) but also in PEPCK mRNA levels and PEPCK gene promoter activity (see Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that in other experiments described in Fig. 5 (A and B), the inductive effect of butyrate on Glc-6-Pase promoter activity was evident when the cells were co-transfected with expression plasmid for HNF-4α, suggesting that the mechanism of induction of this promoter by butyrate may be more complex than that by other short-chain fatty acids. We did not observe cell death in our studies with butyrate as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion; therefore, apoptosis reported in PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells cultured for 72 h with butyrate (23Hung W.C. Chuang L.Y. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was not manifest in our experiments. To identify the fatty acid-responsive region(s) within the Glc-6-Pase promoter, a series of deletions in the -751/+66-LUC construct was created by exonuclease digestion and by PCR. The constructs were then used in transient transfection assays (Fig. 3) with caproate as the test fatty acid. Sequence deletion in the -751/-553 segment resulted in induced promoter activity in both basal (about 4-fold) and fatty acid-stimulated (up to 18-fold) conditions. Deletions in the -466/-276 segment provoked a progressive decline in promoter activity, but beyond -276 bp there was no major effect of the fatty acid. Thus, it is apparent that the -751/-276 region of the promoter accounted for most of the robust transcriptional response to the fatty acid. Similar results were obtained with valerate. Our interest in deciphering the identity of the cis-positive elements that are involved in the transcriptional activation of Glc-6-Pase by the short-chain fatty acids was stimulated by the report (9Rajas F. Gautier A. Bady I. Montano S. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15736-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that overexpression of the transcription factor HNF-4α can transactivate the rat Glc-6-Pase promoter in HeLa cells, which normally do not express this gene. It is known that HNF-4α binds DNA as homodimers to the direct repeat of the nucleotide consensus sequence 5′-AGGTCA-3′ separated by one (DR1) or two base pairs (DR2) (24Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Inspection of the Glc-6-Pase promoter using the TRANSFAC data base (25Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) shows seven DR motifs as schematized in Fig. 4A. Six of these putative HNF-4-binding sites lie in the -751/-276 region of the promoter. To verify whether these sites actually bind HNF-4, EMSAs were performed. For these assays, we used two labeled probes corresponding to nucleotides -751/-686 (Fig. 4, B, C, and D) and -462/-382 (Fig. 4E) in the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter. The -751/-686 probe contains sites 1 and 2, while the -462/-382 probe contains sites 4 and 5 in Fig. 4A. Three or four protein-DNA complexes (see arrows in Fig. 4) were detected with both probes; with the -462/-382 probe the signals were more intense than with the -751/-686 probe, suggesting that binding sites in this probe may have higher affinity for HNF-4 than sites in the -751/-686 probe. In both cases, unlabeled probes competitively displaced these complexes as expected. In experiments with the -751/-686 probe, an oligonucleotide (CCAAGGTCACCATGTCATTT) (-749/-726) that contained the sequence (underlined) identified as site 1 in Fig. 4A was an effective competitor against the formation of these complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3). Against this probe, an oligonucleotide (TCCAGGACAACAAAGCCCTAC) (-459/-439) that contained the sequence (underlined) identified as site 4 in Fig. 4A was not as effective a competitor as the -749/-726 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4D, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3), although some displacement was noticeable. This was not surprising since site 4 is absent in the -751/-686 probe. However, in experiments conducted with the -462/-382 probe (Fig. 4E), this oligonucleotide (i.e. TCCAGGACAACAAAGCCCTAC) (-459/-439) was a much better competitor against this probe (Fig. 4E, lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 2 and 3) than against the -751/-686 probe (see Fig. 4D). This is consistent with the fact that site 4 is absent in the -751/-686 probe. Because the two probes used for these assays contain four of the seven DR motifs in the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter, we interpret these oligonucleotide competition data to mean that one or more of these sites can bind HNF-4α. To confirm this notion, anti-HNF-4α antibodies were used in the gel mobility shift assays. Although no clearly defined supershifted band was discernible, band intensity of the slowest moving band decreased in the presence of anti-HNF-4α antibodies (Fig. 4, B and E, compare lane 2 with lane 4 and lane 3 with lane 5 for both panels), a phenomenon usually indicating that the antibodies may be preventing DNA binding or that proteins binding to sequences adjacent to the transcription factor-binding site(s) interfere with binding of transcription factor to the probe used (26Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concept, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 266-268Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the interpretation that HNF-4α is contained in the protein component of this complex. If HNF-4α were relevant for short-chain fatty acid-induced regulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression, then transfection of plasmids harboring the gene for HNF-4α would be expected to increase transcription from the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter. Conversely transfection of dominant negative HNF-4α should interfere with transcription from this promoter. Both experimental approaches were utilized in this study. First, using the wild-type promoter (-751/+66-LUC) and a truncated version (-553/+66-LUC) that exhibited the highest promoter activity as seen in Fig. 3, co-transfection with an expression plasmid for HNF-4α provoked robust increases in promoter activity in response to various short-chain fatty acids as well as to octanoate, a medium-chain fatty acid (Fig. 5, A and B). With the wild-type promoter construct (-751/+66-LUC), transcriptional re"

We investigate here the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Mpk1p in protection against linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LoaOOH), a product of radical attack on an unsaturated lipid. MPK1 was found to be required for resistance to LoaOOH. Furthermore, Mpk1p was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to LoaOOH. This phosphorylation was dose-dependent and stimulated by sublethal concentrations as low as 1 μm in the external medium. Such low doses have been shown to result in resistance to subsequent challenge with a higher dose through the process of adaptation. However MPK1 was not essential for this adaptive response. MPK1 was also not involved in cell cycle modulation and acted independently of the cell cycle-regulating Oca1p. Transcriptional profiling of the mpk1Δ cells during LoaOOH stress indicated that Mpk1p may be important in effecting changes to the cell surface and metabolism during LoaOOH exposure. Furthermore, it revealed that Mpk1p is required for the regulation of 97 LoaOOH-responsive transcripts. Evidence is presented that the activation of Mpk1p may be caused by the activation of protein kinase C by LoaOOH.

Damage caused by reactive oxygen species to cellular constituents includes peroxidation of lipids. Peroxidation of membrane lipids is thought to directly interfere with membrane integrity and membrane-associated functions. It also leads to production of further toxic metabolites, such as lipid hydroperoxides and reactive aldehydes, including malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal (1Gutteridge J.M. Halliwell B.

Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). MAPK pathways are present and well conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. In multicellular organisms at least two families of MAPK (JNK and p38) are involved in stress responses (19Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the p38 homologue, Sty1, is also activated by a variety of stress conditions, including oxidative stress (20Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae p38 homologue, Hog1p, is activated in response to hyperosmotic stress and heat shock (21Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin MC.

In S. cerevisiae at least one more MAPK, Mpk1p (Slt2p), is stress responsive.The Mpk1p pathway (the cell-integrity pathway) is thought to be important in maintaining cellular integrity during cell wall remodeling, heat, and hypo-osmotic shock (25Mazzoni C.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The pathway is under the control of protein kinase C (PKC) and is comprised of a MAPK kinase kinase, Bck1p, two redundant MAPK kinases, Mkk1p and Mkk2p, and the Mpk1p MAPK (reviewed in Ref. 28Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).Here we report on the involvement of the cell-integrity pathway in an oxidative stress response of S. cerevisiae. Mpk1p is phosphorylated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in response to LoaOOH. MPK1 is required for proper resistance to the peroxide, but not for adaptation or cell cycle modulation. We also show that Mpk1p plays a role in the transcriptional response to the peroxide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—The strains used in the study are described in Table I. The strains were generated using standard yeast molecular biology methods. To delete OCA1, the HIS3 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers: GAGAGTCATCAATCACATCCATTTTCACAAGAAAGAGGTGTTCCACCTGGGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGC and GCGAATGGGCCGTGCATCCTGAAACATTTCAAACTTTAGGTAAATGGTCCTGTGCGGTATT (region of homology to the genomic OCA1 sequence is underlined). The product was used to replace the entire open reading frame of OCA1 (YNL099C) with HIS3 in the wild-type strain BY4741 (Brachmann et al., Ref. 29Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). Correct integration was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The oca2Δ (ynl056wΔ) and siw14Δ (ynl032wΔ) strains were obtained by dissection of the respective homozygous-deletion diploid mutants (Y37211 and Y35358 from Euroscarf) and the deletions confirmed. The triple deletion mutant was obtained by deleting the OCA1 gene, using the method described above, in the double siw14Δoca2Δ mutant, which was generated by mating, sporulation, and spore dissection. Synthetic complete medium (5Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used in all experiments. Yeast was grown at 30 °C with shaking. Liquid cultures were always 1:5 of the flask volume.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741 (wild-type)MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Euroscarfoca1ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 oca1::HIS3This studysiw14ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 siw14::KanMX4This studyoca2ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 oca2::KanMX4This studympk1ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 mpk1::KanMX4Euroscarfmpk1Δ oca1ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 mpk1::KanMX4 oca1::HIS3This studyoca1Δ siw14Δ oca2ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 siw14::KanMX4 oca2::KanMX4 oca1::HIS1This study Open table in a new tab LoaOOH Synthesis, Tests of Sensitivity, Adaptation, Cell Cycle Delay, and Actin Visualization—LoaOOH synthesis, spot tests for sensitivity, and the microtiter plate-based method for assessing adaptation and colony-forming ability have been described (4Evans M.V. Turton H.E. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For each spot-test at least three concentrations in the range of 0.05–0.3 mm LoaOOH were used. For caffeine sensitivity 12 mm caffeine was used and growth examined after 3 days. To examine the ability of cells to delay in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, strains were grown to OD600 = 0.4 and treated with 40 μm LoaOOH. After 90 min, samples were fixed in 75% (v/v) ethanol. Unbudded cells were scored based on cell and nuclear morphology after staining with 4′,6-diaminidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. To visualize actin, one volume of 150 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors were added to four volumes of cells. The cells were incubated for 5 min, followed by fixation in 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized in the same buffer without formaldehyde, with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and stained with TRITC-phalloidin (4 μg/ml; Sigma). Means and standard deviations of cell counts were calculated based on a binomial distribution as previously described (5Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).LoaOOH Treatment, Protein Extraction, and Western Blotting—Cells were grown to OD600 of 0.4, except for the 20 μm LoaOOH treatment where the starting OD600 was 0.2. Either the whole culture or an aliquot of the appropriate strain was treated for the indicated times with the indicated doses. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C after mixing with crushed ice prechilled at –80 °C (10 g of ice per 40 ml of cells). The cell pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and frozen in an ethanol bath at –80 °C. Proteins were extracted in 80 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate with 10 μl of yeast-specific and 25 μl of general protease inhibitors (Sigma) per ml) by agitating in a minibead-beater for 5 bursts of 30 s with acid-washed glass beads. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (BioRad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. 50 μg of protein per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE on a gradient gel (iGels; Gradipore, NSW, Australia). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Trans-Blot electrophoretic cell (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfer, the residual proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) to confirm even loading. Membranes were probed with either the phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or the anti-Mpkp antibody (yN-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) essentially as described (30Hahn J.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21278-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In each case the primary antibody was visualized with a suitable secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer). Each antibody reacted with a band of ∼43 kDa that was absent in the mpk1Δ strain.RNA Extraction and Microarray Analysis—Cells were treated, harvested, and frozen as above. The RNA was obtained by breaking cells in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) in a mini-bead beater in the presence of acid-washed glass beads at 4 °C, and extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was further purified using the RNeasy kit (Quiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany), including DNase I treatment. RNA quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, as well as by A 260/280 determination.Spotted oligonucleotide microarrays were obtained from the Clive and Vera Ramaciotti Centre for Gene Function Analysis (Sydney, Australia). Oligonucleotide probes (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) addressing 6250 yeast open reading frames were printed in duplicate on epoxy-coated glass substrates (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and were blocked immediately prior to use with ethanediol according to the manufacturer's instructions.RNA from the wild type, isolated before and after treatment was compared with a reference sample and the values were zero-transformed during analysis, while the RNA from the oca1Δ before and after treatment was compared with the equivalent RNA from the wild type. The RNA samples from mpk1Δ, before and after treatment, were directly compared. Each comparison was performed in duplicate. Labeling and hybridization was carried out according to a modification of the protocol described by Hughes et al. (31Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M. Ziman M. Schelter J.M. Meyer M.R. Kobayashi S. Davis C. Dai H. He Y.D. Stephaniants S.B. Cavet G. Walker W.L. West A. Coffey E. Shoemaker D.D. Stoughton R. Blanchard A.P. Friend S.H. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (Sigma). The cDNA was labeled by coupling the aminoallyl-dUTP to N-hydroxy succinimide esters of either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled cDNA of the two samples to be compared was mixed and hybridized to the array overnight at 37 °C in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied Science) containing 0.5 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA and 0.5 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The slides were then washed three times for 20 min in SSC (3 m sodium chloride, 0.3 m trisodium citrate, pH 7.5), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 50 °C, rinsed several times in SSC, dried by centrifugation, and scanned.Image analysis was performed in GenePix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments). The signal for a gene was deemed “present” if: (a) no artifacts were associated with the spot, and (b) the program could identify the spot intensity above the background intensity. The data were imported into GeneSpring 5.0 (Silicon Genetics), where all further analysis was performed. Data were normalized by the LOWESS normalization method. Only the genes deemed “present” on all six slides were further considered. Data from the experiments comparing oca1Δ to the wild type were processed in a similar manner.Functional enrichment in the obtained sets was determined using FunSpec (32Robinson M.D. Grigull J Mohammad N. Hughes T.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) addressing the MIPS data base. For information on individual gene products MIPS was consulted (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de). To find putative regulatory elements, yeast RSA regulatory tools was used (rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/). The frequency of the occurrence of the elements in the set was compared with the frequency in the genome determined using PatMatch (seq.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/SGD/PATMATCH/nph-patmatch) and the probability of accidental enrichment calculated based on a hypergeometric distribution.Supplementary Material—The normalized microarray data from the experiments analyzing the expression changes in the mpk1Δ and wild-type strains, and the derived gene lists are available as supplementary material.RESULTSMpk1p Is Required for Resistance to LoaOOH and Is Phosphorylated in Response to Peroxide—The investigation of the activation of the cell-integrity pathway in response to LoaOOH stems from our interest in the OCA1 gene. We have previously shown that this gene is required for resistance to LoaOOH, and for a G1 cell cycle delay in response to this peroxide (5Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other studies have pointed out that it encodes a putative tyrosine phosphatase and that it has two homologues in yeast (33Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 301-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar): SIW14 and the open reading frame of unknown function (YNL056W) that we named OCA2. The growth of yeast cells with deletions of either of the three genes on solid medium was inhibited by the presence of LoaOOH or caffeine (Fig. 1), and the caffeine sensitivity was especially pronounced. Caffeine sensitivity is one of the phenotypes of the mutants of the cell-integrity pathway (28Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that SIW14 interacts genetically with MPK1 (34Binley K.M. Radcliffe P.A. Trevethick J. Duffy K.A. Sudbery P.E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus it appeared possible that Oca1p may act in the cell-integrity pathway, and, in turn, that this pathway may be involved in mediating responses to LoaOOH.To test this hypothesis, the sensitivity to LoaOOH of the mpk1Δ mutant was examined by assessing its capacity to grow in the presence of LoaOOH. Indeed, the deletion of this gene resulted in pronounced sensitivity to LoaOOH (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Deletion of MPK1 results in LoaOOH sensitivity and in the wild-type strain Mpk1p is phosphorylated on exposure to the peroxide. A, the sensitivity of mpk1Δ to LoaOOH was tested as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, cells growing exponentially in SC medium were treated for the indicated times with 40 μm LoaOOH. Under these conditions ∼60% of cells retained their colony forming ability after 1 h. Cellular proteins were extracted, 50 μg of total protein per lane was separated on two SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to two polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. One was probed for dually phosphorylated Mpk1p (Mpk1pTpYp) while the other was probed for total Mpk1p (Mpk1p). For details see “Experimental Procedures.” C, levels of Mpk1pTpYp during treatment with 20 μm LoaOOH were examined as described for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sensitivity of the deletion strain may result from the involvement of Mpk1p in signaling the presence of LoaOOH. If that was the case, then the activity of Mpk1p should be modulated in response to the peroxide. MAPKs are known to be activated by dual phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue (18Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). We assessed the levels of this phosphorylated form of Mpk1p (Mpk1pTpYp) during treatment with LoaOOH using the antibody against dually phosphorylated human p42/44, which has been shown to recognize the doubly phosphorylated yeast homologue, Mpk1p (30Hahn J.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21278-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Treatment of the wild-type strain with 40 μm LoaOOH in exponential growth phase resulted in a rapid (within 5 min) increase in levels of Mpk1pTpYp. This response was transient and the level of Mpk1pTpYp returned to below the basal level within 60 min (Fig. 2B). The time taken for the level of Mpk1pTpYp to return to basal was longer in response to a lower dose (20 μm) indicating that this decline may be due to a feedback mechanism (Fig. 2C). The levels of total Mpk1p were also determined and were found not to change during treatment with 40 μm LoaOOH (Fig. 2B), confirming that the changes in the levels of the dually phosphorylated Mpk1p were due to post-translational modification.MPK1 Acts Independently of OCA1 and Is Not Required for the G1 Delay—For the reasons noted above, it seemed possible for Oca1p to be involved in the cell-integrity pathway. If it was acting upstream of Mpk1p, than the activation of this MAPK in the oca1Δ strain should be altered. However, OCA1 was not required for the phosphorylation of Mpk1p, nor were either of its two homologues (Fig. 3A). This effect was not the result of the possible functional redundancy of the three genes, since Mpk1p phosphorylation still occurred even in the triple deletion mutant (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, deletion of OCA1 exacerbated the sensitivity of a mpk1Δ strain (Fig. 3C; note that mpk1Δ is more sensitive than the oca1Δ). This allowed us to conclude that OCA1 and MPK1 act in two separate LoaOOH-resistance pathways.Fig. 3Oca1p does not act in the Mpk1p-delineated LoaOOH resistance pathway. In A, single mutants in OCA1, OCA2, and SIW14 were examined for the temporal changes in the levels of Mpk1pTpYp in response to 40 μm LoaOOH, as described in the caption to Fig. 2B, while in B, response in the triple deletion mutant is shown. C, the sensitivity to LoaOOH of the mpk1Δ was compared with that of the double mpk1Δoca1Δ mutant as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cell-integrity pathway is known to interact with the cell cycle machinery (36Madden K.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and thus MPK1 may provide another level of regulation of the LoaOOH-induced G1 delay. To examine this, wild-type and mpk1Δ cells were treated with 40 μm LoaOOH in the exponential growth phase. The G1 delay was assessed by scoring the percentage of unbudded cells present after 90 min of treatment when the most pronounced change was observed in the wild type. The accumulation of unbudded G1 cells occurred both in the mpk1Δ and the wild-type strain (Fig. 4). This was different from oca1Δ, which was included as a control in this experiment, and indicated that MPK1 was not required for this effect of LoaOOH. Furthermore, the cell cycle delay appeared even more pronounced in the mpk1Δ, which may be related to its increased sensitivity to LoaOOH.Fig. 4The mpk1Δ strain undergoes G1-delay in response to LoaOOH. The accumulation of unbudded cells in response to 40 μm LoaOOH during asynchronous-exponential growth was examined after treatment for 90 min in the wild-type, mpk1Δ, and oca1Δ strains. Cells were scored based on cell and nuclear morphologies, and the means and S.D. presented were calculated based on a binomial distribution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mpk1p Phosphorylation Is Stimulated by Sublethal Doses of LoaOOH but MPK1 Is Not Essential for Adaptation—Cells respond differently to different doses of LoaOOH. Cell cycle delay only occurs in response to medium to high doses (5Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) while low doses of LoaOOH induce resistance to subsequent treatment with an otherwise lethal dose, an adaptive response (4Evans M.V. Turton H.E. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further understand the physiological role of Mpk1p, the dose dependence of its phosphorylation was examined. It was found that this process was stimulated within 5 min of exposure to doses as low as 1 μm in external medium (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Mpk1p phosphorylation is stimulated by low doses of LoaOOH but MPK1 is not required for adaptation. A, aliquots of an exponentially growing culture were treated with a range of LoaOOH concentrations for 5 min and analyzed for the levels of Mpk1pTpYp as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. B, mpk1Δ and the wild-type strain were grown to exponential phase, diluted to OD600 of 0.1 in pre-warmed SC medium, and incubated in a microtiter plate for 1 h with (round symbols) or without (square symbols) 1 μm LoaOOH pretreatment. The cells were then treated with 30 μm LoaOOH (filled-in symbols) or left untreated (open symbols) and the culture growth monitored by measuring OD600. The lowest of three different pretreatment concentrations examined, all giving similar results, is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since Mpk1p phosphorylation was stimulated by such low concentrations of the peroxide, we examined the involvement of Mpk1p signaling in the adaptive response by determining the ability of the mpk1Δ strain to adapt. Exponentially growing wild-type and mpk1Δ strains were either exposed to a low dose (1 μm) of LoaOOH for 1 h, or left untreated, after which their ability to grow in the presence of higher concentrations of the peroxide was determined. Surprisingly, the cells could still mount an adaptive response even in the absence of Mpk1p (Fig. 5B), indicating that even though the protein was phosphorylated in response to very low doses of LoaOOH it was not essential for the adaptive response.MPK1 Is Involved in the Transcriptional Response to LoaOOH—Mpk1p has been shown to regulate at least two transcription factors, and the examination of genome-wide transcriptional changes upon artificial activation of Mpk1p revealed it to be involved in the regulation of cell-wall genes (36Madden K.

https://openalex.org/W1966793804,"From the genome analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis two putative genes namely GlyA and GlyA2 have been proposed to encode for the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase. We have cloned, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity their respective protein products, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, SHM1 and SHM2.

The most interesting structural observation was that the SHM1 contains 1 mol of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)/mol of enzyme dimer.

Functionally both the recombinant enzymes showed catalysis of reversible interconversion of serine and glycine and aldol cleavage of a 3-hydroxyamino acid. However, unlike SHMT from other sources both SHM1 and SHM2 do not undergo half-transamination reaction with d-alanine resulting in formation of apoenzyme but l-cysteine removed the prosthetic group, PLP, from both the recombinant enzymes leaving the respective inactive apoenzymes.

Recent years have seen increased incidence of tuberculosis in both developing and developed countries. Information available from the complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has the potential of providing the information that would generate knowledge that will enable to elucidate the unusual biology of its etiological agent, M. tuberculosis. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; H4PteGlu, N 5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl-l-glutamic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; T m, midpoint of thermal denaturation; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; PyP, pyridoxamine-P; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer.l-serine:tetrahydrofolate 5,10-hydroxymethyltransferase is a pyridoxyl 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. SHMT reaction plays a major role in cell physiology as it is considered to be a key enzyme in the pathway for interconversion of folate coenzymes that provide almost exclusively one-carbon fragments for the biosynthesis of a variety of end products such as DNA, RNA, ubiquinone, methionine, etc. (1Schirch V. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mc Neil J. Bognar A. Perlman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 371-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shane B. Vit. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The physiological role of SHMT is the reversible interconversion of serine to glycine and irreversible hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu to 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. In addition to these physiological reactions, SHMT also catalyzes, in the absence of H4PteGlu, the retroaldol cleavage of several 3-hydroxyamino acids, such as allo-threonine, and the transamination and slow racemization of d- and l-alanine (4Shostak K.

Biochem., 6508-6525Google Scholar). SHMT shows a ubiquitous distribution in nature, being found both in the prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, SHMT exists as both cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms (6Appling D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) encoded by the separate genes (7Garrow T. Brenner A. Whitehead M. Chen X.N. Duncan R. Korenberg J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chloroplast isoform has also been reported to be present in the plants (8Besson B. Neuberger M. Rebeille F. Dounce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar) and Euglena gracilis (9Sakamoto M. Masuda T. Yanagimoto Y. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Tanigawa Y. Z. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1914-1944Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Three molecular forms of SHMT have been detected in choanomastigotes of Crithidia fasciculata. One of them is cytosolic, whereas the other two forms are particle bound, one being mitochondrial and the other one very likely is glycosomal (10Capelluto D.G.S. Hellnnan U. Cazzulo J.J. Cannata J.J.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A single form of SHMT has been detected in epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi (11Capelluto D.G.S. Hellnnan U. Cazzulo J.J. Cannata J.J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structurally SHMT from a mammalian source is a homotetramer with a subunit molecular mass of about 53 kDa and contains 4 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme (12Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U.

Radaev S. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The three SHMT isoforms found in C. fasciculata also have tetrameric structure (10Capelluto D.G.S. Hellnnan U. Cazzulo J.J. Cannata J.J.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SHMT from Escherichia coli as well as from several other bacterial sources are dimeric and contain 2 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme (14Venkatesha B. Udgaonkar J.B. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the T. cruzi SHMT is present as a catalytically active monomer (11Capelluto D.G.S. Hellnnan U. Cazzulo J.J. Cannata J.J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structure has shown that the coenzyme PLP is covalently attached to the enzyme molecule and is located at the dimer interface (12Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U.

The tetrameric SHMT undergoes a reversible unfolding with the first step being dissociation of tetramer into dimer accompanied by the removal of the enzyme-bound PLP from the active site (15Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Regarding the second step it was not clear whether the stabilized dimer of SHMT unfolds directly or does so via the formation of monomer (15Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the dimeric SHMTs, both from E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, the first step of unfolding is dissociation of the native dimer into monomer followed by the unfolding of the stabilized monomer (16Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Bhatt A.N. Prakash K. Subramanya H.S. Bhakuni V.

However, for the thermophilic SHMT from Bacillus stearothermophilis, a highly cooperative unfolding of the native dimer into unfolded monomer was reported (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Searches of the M. tuberculosis genome for enzymes related to SHMT have lead to the identification of two genes namely the GlyA and GlyA2, which have been proposed as putative genes encoding for SHMTs in the organism. Here we report the cloning, overexpression, and purification of the recombinant SHM1 and SHM2, the protein products of the genes GlyA and GlyA2. Furthermore, the structural, functional, and stability properties as well as the comparative studies on thermal, pH-, urea-, and GdmCl-induced unfolding of both recombinant proteins have been discussed in detail. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of the Proteins of M. tuberculosis GlyA and GlyA2 Genes—The complete genes of M. tuberculosis encoding functional GlyA and GlyA2 were amplified separately by PCR from the genomic DNA. The different oligonucleotides used for GlyA, based on the reported gene sequence (GenBank™ accession number Rv1093), were upstream 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCTGCCCCGCTCGCTGAAGTT-3′ and downstream 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGGCCGACCAGACTCCACTC-3′ for histidine-tagged protein and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGCGGCCGACCAGACTCCACTC-3′ for non-histidine-tagged protein. The different oligonucleotides for GlyA2 (GenBank™ accession number Rv0070c) were upstream 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAACACCCTCAACGACTCCCTG-3′ and downstream 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTGTACGATGCAGTTCCGGGTA-3′ for histidine-tagged protein and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATGTACGATGCAGTTCCGTA-3′ for non-histidine-tagged protein. Reactions were carried out in two phases for 5 and 30 cycles in a total volume of 50 μl with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. For GlyA, the first cycle without overhang amplification was 95 °C, 1 min; 54 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; and the second cycle with overhang amplification was 95 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min with final extension for 10 min. For GlyA2, the first cycle without overhang amplification was 95 °C, 1 min; 44 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min, and the second cycle was similar to the first cycle except for the annealing temperature of 56 °C with final extension for 10 min. The amplified product was cloned into pET-22b between the NdeI and HindIII sites. DNA sequencing confirmed the homogeneity of the sequences. The resultant constructs were transformed into C41(DE3). A single colony was inoculated into 10 ml of 2× YT broth having ampicillin at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and grown overnight at 30 °C. It was then subcultured in 1 liter of 2× YT media containing similar ampicillin concentrations. For SHM1, the culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A 600 of 0.4 to 0.5 for 12 h at 30 °C, whereas SHM2 was grown for 18 h without any induction. The cell culture was harvested followed by suspension into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm PLP. Cells were sonicated and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. To remove the nonspecific binding protein constituents, the column was washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 400 mm NaCl and 80 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The fractions containing SHMT were pooled and glycerol and DTT were added to final concentrations of 8% and 1 mm, respectively. Excess imidazole was removed by dialysis against 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The purity of the purified proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE (19Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and ESI-MS and was found to be about 99% pure. Circular Dichroism Measurements—The CD measurements were made with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate and the results were expressed as relative ellipticity and plotted as percentage values. The CD spectra were obtained at enzyme concentrations of 2 and 10 μm for far-UV CD and visible CD measurements, respectively, with a 2-mm cell at 4 °C. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of denaturant under similar conditions. Synthesis of PyP-SHMT—The reduction of the PLP aldimine was achieved according to the procedure of Cai and Schirch (20Taylor R.T. Weisbach H. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 80-84Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity—SHMT activity of the purified recombinant proteins were determined as reported earlier (21Manohar R. Ramesh K.S. Appaji Rao N. J. Biosci. 1982; 4: 31-50Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Malkin L.Z. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 117-131PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.1-ml reaction mixture contained 400 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 1.8 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm PLP, 1.8 mm tetrahydrofolate, 3.6 mm l-[3-14C]serine, and approximately 1 μm protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of dimedone (400 mm in 50% ethanol). The reaction mixture was kept in boiling water bath for 5 min and the H-14CHO-dimedone adduct was extracted into 3 ml of toluene. A 1-ml volume of toluene extract was added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid (0.6% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole) and the radioactivity was measured on the scintillation counter. Activity was also measured by another reported method (23Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriology. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml reaction mixture contained 1–70 μg of enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase (100 μg), NADH (250 μm), 10 mm allo-threonine in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The reference cuvette contained all the chemicals except l-allo-threonine. The activity was observed as decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm. The NADH consumed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m-1 cm-1. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with PerkinElmer LS5B spectroluminesencemeter in a quartz cell with a 5-mm path length. All samples were incubated for 6 h under specified conditions before recording the spectra. For tryptophan fluorescence measurements the excitation wavelength was 290 nm and the spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. The protein concentration used was 2 μm and the measurement was carried out at 25 °C. For FRET studies the samples were excited at 290 nm and the spectra were recorded from 300 to 450 nm. Cross-linking Using Glutaraldehyde—To the native and urea- or GdmCl-treated SHMT (1 μm enzyme), an aliquot of 25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde was added to obtain a final glutaraldehyde concentration of 1%. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min followed by quenching of the cross-linking reaction by the addition of 200 mm sodium borohydride. After incubation for 20 min, 3 μl of 10% aqueous sodium deoxycholate was added. The pH of the reaction mixtures was lowered to 2–2.5 by the addition of orthophosphoric acid, which resulted in precipitation of the cross-linked proteins. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) the obtained precipitates were re-dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 1% SDS, and 50 mm DTT and heated at 90–100 °C for 5 min. The molecular mass of the cross-linked products was determined by 10% SDS-PAGE (19Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—The gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (manufacturer's exclusion limit 600 kDa for proteins) on AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). The columns were equilibrated and run on 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (or mentioned otherwise) and the desired urea or GdmCl concentration at 4 °C. The SHMT solution (10 μm) was incubated at the desired GdmCl or urea concentrations for 6 h at 4 °C. These samples (200 μl) were loaded on the column and run at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. pH-dependent Incubation—Recombinant SHM1 and SHM2 were dissolved in 10 mm citrate/glycine/Hepes buffer (pH of the solution maintained) of desired pH values and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C before making the measurements. Urea or Guanidinium Chloride Denaturation of SHMT—Recombinant SHM1 and SHM2 (2 μm) were dissolved in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of urea or GdmCl and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. These samples were then used for taking various measurements. The expression of both the SHM1 and SHM2 was good and the expressed proteins were present predominantly (>90%) in the soluble fraction. The enzymes present in the soluble fraction were purified by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” The yield of both the enzymes was in the range of 12 to 15 mg/liter. The purified proteins were homogenous as indicated by a single protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B) and a single peak in ESI-MS (data not shown). The purified enzymes were assayed for SHMT activity (21Manohar R. Ramesh K.S. Appaji Rao N. J. Biosci. 1982; 4: 31-50Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Malkin L.Z. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 117-131PubMed Google Scholar) and the specific activity of 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.3 units/mg was observed for the SHM1 and SHM2, respectively. The 280/425 absorbance ratio was 4.78 and 3.43 for the purified recombinant SHM1 and SHM2, respectively, which is within the limits of the values reported for SHMT from various sources (24Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 569-606Crossref Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the purified recombinant SHM1 and SHM2 were determined under non-dissociating conditions as described by Andrews (25Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 16: 5342-5349Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using the data of gel filtration experiments. Gel filtration of SHM1 and SHM2 on a Superdex S-200 column, calibrated with the various molecular weight standards, showed a single peak although with a slight difference in retention volume of 14.55 and 14.7 ml, respectively, for the two enzymes (Fig. 1C). When the elution volumes of the marker proteins were plotted as a function of log of molecular masses, the molecular masses of 91.2 and 87.1 kDa were obtained for SHM1 and SHM2, respectively. From the primary amino acid sequence, the molecular masses of 45.03 and 45.52 kDa were obtained for SHM1 and SHM2, respectively. The subunit masses of purified SHM1 and SHM2 were determined by SDS-PAGE. A single homogeneous protein band corresponding to molecular mass of about 45 kDa was observed for the two proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). The precise molecular weights of the two recombinant enzymes were obtained by ESI-MS experiments (data not shown). Molecular masses of 45.0 and 45.5 kDa were observed for SHM1 and SHM2, respectively, demonstrating that both the recombinant enzymes have very similar molecular masses. The results of the studies on subunit masses along with the size exclusion chromatography as reported above demonstrate that both SHM1 and SHM2 exist as dimers under physiological conditions. Furthermore, as both the proteins have similar molecular masses but significant differences are observed in their retention volumes (on size exclusion chromatography), it suggests that significant differences exist in the molecular dimensions of the two recombinant enzymes with SHM2 having a slightly more compact conformation (higher retention volume) than the SHM1 under physiological conditions. The SHMT is a PLP-dependent enzyme in which the PLP is covalently attached to the enzyme, bound as an aldimine to Lys-299 that is conserved in SHMT from various sources (12Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V.

Acta. 1998; 1384: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Visible CD studies on SHMT have shown that the visible CD signal is different between the holo- and the apo- or unfolded enzyme. The holoenzyme has a unique peak at 425 nm because of the bound PLP, which disappears on unfolding of the enzyme or on removal of PLP from the enzyme, i.e. on stabilization of apoenzyme (16Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The visible CD spectra of SHM1 and SHM2 are shown in Fig. 2A. For both the recombinant proteins a visible CD spectra centered at about 430 nm, showing the presence of the enzyme-bound PLP, was observed. However, at a similar enzyme concentration the visible CD signal for SHM2 was about 8 times greater than that observed for the SHM1 indicating that it probably has a higher content of PLP as compared with SHM1. To confirm this, the amount of PLP bound to the enzyme was determined for both recombinant enzymes by the method of Urevitch and Kallen (25Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 16: 5342-5349Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) after extensive dialysis of the purified recombinant enzymes against 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The SHM1 and SHM2 were found to contain 1 ± 0.2 and 2.3 ± 0.5 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme, respectively. The SHMT from mammalian sources are homotetramers and contain 4 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme (12Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the SHMT from E. coli as well as from other bacterial sources are dimeric and contain 2 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme (14Venkatesha B. Udgaonkar J.B. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All the SHMTs reported to date including SHM2 (reported in this paper) contain 2 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme dimer, however, SHM1 was found to contain only 1 mol of PLP/mol of enzyme dimer. This is the first report on such a unique stoichiometry of PLP and enzyme for SHMT. Secondary Structure—Far-UV CD studies were carried out on both SHM1 and SHM2 to analyze the differences in the secondary structure that exist between the two enzymes. For both SHM1 and SHM2, the far-UV CD spectra characteristic of a protein having both α-helix and β-sheet secondary structure was observed (Fig. 2B). However, for similar molar concentrations of enzyme, a significantly higher ellipticity was observed for SHM2 over the whole far-UV region (Fig. 2B). This observation suggests that SHM2 have a significantly higher secondary structure as compared with SHM1. Despite having similar subunit molecular mass as SHM1, the SHM2 was found to have a more compact conformation. One possible reason for this may be the presence of a significantly higher secondary structure in SHM2, which would result in stabilization of a compact conformation. Tryptophan Fluorescence—According to the primary amino acid sequence, SHM1 has two tryptophan molecules at positions 172 and 421, whereas SHM2 has a single tryptophan at position 175. The fluorescence spectra of SHM1 and SHM2 are shown in Fig. 2C. For both the enzymes the emission wavelength maxima for the tryptophan fluorescence was observed at about 339 nm, however, there were significant differences in fluorescence intensities of the two enzymes because of the difference in number of tryptophan moieties present in them. The buried tryptophan residues in folded protein show fluorescence emission maxima at 330–335 nm, whereas on unfolding of protein the tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima shifts to about 350 nm (27Angelaccio S. Pascarella S. Fattori E. Bossa F. Strong W. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, both in SHM1 and SHM2 the tryptophan molecule(s) is not completely buried but partially exposed to the solvent. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—For eSHMT it has been demonstrated that reduction of the PLP aldimine bond results in absorbance maxima at 355 nm that overlaps the emission spectrum of tryptophan. Hence, the PyP can be used as an energy acceptor of tryptophan fluorescence. For native eSHMT FRET is observed that abolishes on unfolding of enzyme (20Taylor R.T. Weisbach H. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 80-84Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, D and E, summarizes the results of FRET experiments on SHM1 and SHM2. For both the SHM1 and SHM2 in the native conformation two emission maxima, one around 339 nm (tryptophan fluorescence) and the other at 385 nm (PyP emission resulting from FRET) were observed. However, on unfolding of enzymes by incubation in 8 m urea only single emission maximum at 352 nm was observed. These observations demonstrate that for SHM1 and SHM2 in the native conformation there is FRET between tryptophan residues and the bound PLP suggesting that the tryptophan residue(s) is located less than 5 Å from PyP in the native conformation of these two enzymes and on denaturation of the enzymes these two moieties move apart resulting in the loss of FRET. Functional Properties—All the forms of SHMT for which a primary sequence is known contain the eight-residue conserved sequence, VTTTTHK(Pyr)T, near the active-site lysyl residue (Lys-229 as in eSHMT) that forms the internal aldimine with pyridoxal phosphate. The active site octa-peptide from SHMT is unusual in the sense that it has five threonine residues conserved in all the reported primary sequence of SHMTs (Fig. 3). Mutation studies have demonstrated that Thr-226 plays an important role in converting the gem-diamine complex to external aldimine complex. A T226A mutant of eSHMT has been shown to distinguish between substrates and substrate analogs in formation of the gem-diamine complex (28Schirch L. Jenkins N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 238: 3797-3800Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The primary sequence of SHM1 and SHM2 show significant changes in the conserved threonine sequence (Fig. 3). In SHM1, the Thr-225 (corresponding to Thr-227 of eSHMT) and Thr-222 (corresponding to Thr-224 of eSHMT) are replaced with valine and serine, respectively. In SHM2 the Thr-226 (corresponding to Thr-225 of eSHMT) is replaced by serine (Fig. 3). These alterations may lead to significant changes in substrate binding and complex formation in these enzymes. It has been reported that d-alanine reacts with SHMT to undergo a slow half-transamination reaction resulting in the formation of apoenzyme, pyridoxamine-P, and pyruvate (29Schirch V. Mason M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2578-2581Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Experimentally this reaction is detected by a decrease of the absorption"

To achieve catalysis, the enzyme requires a magnesium ion. Binding of magnesium to the enzyme induces significant conformational changes as monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy. EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase was rapidly inactivated by micromolar concentrations of ferrous sulfate in the presence of ascorbate at pH 8.0. The inactivated enzyme was cleaved into two fragments with molecular masses of 36 and 35 kDa. Using this affinity cleavage assay, we have located the magnesium binding-like motif to amino acids 355–377 of EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase. Sequence homology comparisons between EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase and other restriction endonucleases allowed us to identify a PD(X) n (D/E)XK-like sequence as the putative magnesium ion binding site. Point mutations generated in this region were analyzed for their role in methyltransferase activity, metal coordination, and substrate binding. Although the mutant methyltransferases bind DNA and S-adenosyl-l-methionine as well as the wild-type enzyme does, they are inactive primarily because of their inability to flip the target base. Collectively, these data are consistent with the fact that acidic amino acid residues of the region 355–377 in EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase are important for the critical positioning of magnesium ions for catalysis.

The enzymes require the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to modify their target base (1Ahmad I. Rao D.N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 361-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three classes of DNA MTases, namely, the C5 -cytosine MTases, N4 -cytosine MTases, and N6 -adenine-specific MTases have been identified on the basis of sequence homology and type of methylation catalyzed (2Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Dyden D.T.F. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore1999: 283-321Crossref Google Scholar). Structure-guided sequence comparison analysis revealed that all three classes of MTase are closely related to one another (4Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Sha M. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoP15I) adds a methyl group to the second adenine in the recognition sequence 5′-CAGCAG-3′ in the presence of AdoMet (6Meisel A. Krüger D.H. Bickle T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is an N6 -adenine MTase, and like all N6 -adenine MTases, M.EcoP15I contains two highly conserved sequences, FXGXG (motif I) at position 444–448 and DPPY (motif IV) at position 125–128 (7Hümbelin M. Suri B. Rao D.N. Hornby D.P. Eberle H. Pripfl T. Kenel S. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although mutations in motif I completely abolished AdoMet binding but left target DNA recognition unaltered, mutations in motif IV resulted in loss of enzyme activity, but AdoMet and DNA binding were not affected (8Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By employing chemical modification using thiol-directed agents and site-directed mutagenesis, it was demonstrated that cysteine 344 in M.EcoP15I was necessary for enzyme activity and played an essential role in DNA binding (9Reddy Y.V.R. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23866-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We showed that when M.EcoP15I binds to its recognition sequence, both the adenine bases in the recognition site appear to be structurally distorted supporting the proposed base flipping mechanism for this enzyme (10Reddy Y.V.R. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Structural and mutational analysis of several type II restriction endonucleases reveal the sequence PD(X) n (D/E)XK motif as a catalytic/Mg2+ binding signature motif (11Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3705-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The charged residues from the catalytic triad are implicated in metal ion-mediated catalysis (12Viadiu T.H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An inspection of amino acid sequences of DNA methyltransferases did not reveal any characteristic metal binding motif. However, in EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase, a PD(X) n (D/E)XK-like motif is present in which the partially conserved proline is replaced by methionine (7Hümbelin M. Suri B. Rao D.N. Hornby D.P. Eberle H. Pripfl T. Kenel S. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we report the identification and characterization of a magnesium binding motif in M.EcoP15I. We generated and characterized a number of mutations in the acidic residues in this region and demonstrate that several of these residues play a role in metal binding and catalysis. Our data allow us to conclude that methylation by the enzyme indeed requires magnesium and that magnesium binding to the PD(X) n (D/E)XK-like motif participates in base flipping. More importantly, our results have implications in understanding the role of metal ions in protein structure, function, and evolution of metal-independent methyltransferases.

The sequence of primer A was designed to change aspartic acid at position 355 to glycine and create a RsaI restriction site. Single-stranded DNA template containing uracil residues was prepared from E. coli strain CJ236 that harbored pGEM3Zf(–)M.EcoP15I. Primer A was hybridized to this single-stranded DNA, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was termed pGEM3Zf(–)M.EcoP15I-D355G. The mutants were identified by digesting the plasmid DNA with RsaI. Similarly, substitutions at other positions were made using appropriate primers (see Table I) whose sequences were designed such that a restriction site was created or eliminated (see Table I). In all cases, the mutants were identified by digesting the plasmid with the appropriate restriction enzyme. The resultant plasmids after mutagenesis are listed in Table I. Double and triple mutants were constructed using appropriate single-stranded DNA and primers (Table II). All mutants were confirmed by digesting the plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzyme. DNA fragments containing the individual mutations were released from the respective pGEM3Zf(–) constructs using EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes. These fragments were swapped separately into the pUC18 vector containing the wild-type M.EcoP15I gene. The resultant plasmids, for instance pD355G, pD355A, pD370A, pE372L, pD601A, pD358A/E377A, and pD355A/D358A/E377A, were used for expression and purification of mutant EcoP15I-D355A, D355G, D370A, E372L, D601A, D358A/E377A, and D355A/D358A/E377A, respectively.Table IIStrategy for introducing double or triple mutations in EcoP15I DNA methyltransferaseSingle-stranded DNA template usedSecond/third primeraFor details, see Table I. usedRestriction site(s)Resultant plasmidpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355ACRsaI/BalIpGEM3Zf(-) M.EcoP15I-D355A/D358ApGEM3Zf(-) M.EcoP15I-D355ADRsaI/XbaIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355A/E363LpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355AGRsaI/HaeIIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355A/E377ApGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D358ADBalI/XbaIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D358A/E363LpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D358AGBalI/HaeIIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D358A/E377ApGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D599AITfiI/StyIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D599A/D601ApGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D599AJTfiI/StuIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D599A/D603ApGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D599AKTfiI/NheIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D601A/D603ApGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355A/358ADRsaI/BalI/XbaIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355A/358A/E363LpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I D355A/358AGRsaI/BalI/HaeIIpGEM3Zf(—) M.EcoP15I-D355A/358A/E377Aa For details, see Table I.

Peak fractions from the heparin-Sepharose column containing the enzyme were pooled and concentrated by using Amicon ultrafiltration unit with 30-kDa cutoff membrane. The purity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was judged as being greater than 99% on SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). 2 μm M.EcoP15I was incubated with a freshly prepared solution of 0–500 μm ferrous sulfate in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The solution was incubated for 15 min on ice. Sodium ascorbate (final concentration 10 mm) was then added. Aliquots from the reaction mixture were assayed for residual enzyme activity at various times and were also analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS, to detect the presence of fragments generated by cleavage of the enzyme. The concentration of reactants and conditions for inactivation and cleavage of enzyme were maintained the same in all experiments, unless specified otherwise. Protection against inactivation was determined by incubating the enzyme with various metal ions before the addition of iron and ascorbate. 10 μm M.EcoP15I was dialyzed against 100–200 volumes of 10 mm EDTA and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 3 h at 4 °C. The dialysis was then repeated for 1 h against fresh dialysis buffer. The protein solution was passed through Chelex 100 resin prepared as described by the vendor to remove any metal contamination. All buffers were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy to confirm that there were no contaminating metals. For removal of the bound metal, a sample of M.EcoP15I was dialyzed sequentially versus 50 mm EDTA and then versus metal-free 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Metals were introduced into the apoenzyme by dialyzing a 10 μm protein sample against a 1 mm solution of the selected metal ions in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, followed by two changes of 100 volumes for removing excess metal. All metal analyses were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Each analysis was complemented by appropriate control experiments. The levels of Mg2+ were determined in a 10 μm solution of M.EcoP15I formulated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The standard error for these determinations was ± 5%. Total Mg2+ concentration was measured on a Hitachi, Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The system was calibrated using metal calibration standard solutions in the range of 0–2 ppm. The enzyme metal concentrations were about 1 ppm. Metal determinations were performed at two dilutions, each in duplicate. In Vitro M.EcoP15I Activity—MTase activity was monitored by incorporation of tritiated methyl groups into pUC18 DNA, and the specific activity of the enzyme was measured as described previously (8Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to Restriction Endonuclease—The sensitivity of the plasmid DNA containing the wild-type or mutant EcoP15I gene to restriction digestion by EcoP15I restriction enzyme (R.EcoP15I) was used to assay qualitatively for methylase activity. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the alkaline lysis method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subjected to R.EcoP15I digestion as described previously (9Reddy Y.V.R. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23866-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using duplexes I (Table I). The mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (15Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were visualized by exposing the dried gels to x-ray films for 12–16 h at –70 °C using film cassettes containing intensifying screen. AdoMet cross-linking was done as described (9Reddy Y.V.R. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23866-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra and the fluorescence intensities from titrations of M.EcoP15I were measured in a Shimadzu UV-160 recording spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were recorded over a wavelength of 300–400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Slit widths of 10 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission were used. Titrations of M.EcoP15I were carried out from 0 to 20 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2 or CaCl2. M.EcoP15I was incubated for 5 min at room temperature before the beginning of the titration. Each spectrum recorded was an average of three scans. All fluorescence measurements were made using 1-ml quartz cuvettes, with a 1-cm path length at 25 °C. The concentration of the protein used was 3 μm. The sample solution was mixed well and spectra recorded. At least 2–5 min time was given for stabilization of the reading. Appropriate corrections were made for dilution of the protein sample upon addition of metal ions as well as for the inner filter effect of protein and metal ions. All samples were incubated until the equilibrium was established under the particular set of conditions before measuring the steady-state fluorescence intensities. All fluorescence emission spectra and fluorescence intensities from titrations were corrected for protein tryptophan fluorescence by subtraction of control spectra and control titrations. In addition, fluorescence data were corrected for variable background emission of the solutions. Fluorescence intensities of all duplex oligonucleotides containing 2-AP showed a linear dependence on their concentrations. Each spectrum recorded was an average of three scans. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of the 2-AP-containing oligonucleotides were measured as described previously (10Reddy Y.V.R. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sequences of the oligonucleotides L and M used to measure steady-state fluorescence emission spectra are given in Table I. Titrations of 250 nm duplex oligodeoxynucleotides with M.EcoP15I were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 40 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of MgCl2. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter. All experiments were done at 25 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein solutions were incubated on ice for 5 min in 1-mm path length quartz cells in a final volume of 400 μl, and the CD spectrum was recorded. The observed ellipticities were converted to mean residue ellipticity [θMRE], using the following equation, [θMRE]=[θ]obs(mrm)/10cl(Eq. 1) where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, mrm is the mean residue molecular mass based on a molecular mass of 150 kDa, c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, and l is the path length of the cell in cm. The protein concentration used was 5 μm. The ellipticity of magnesium in this spectra was near zero. Each experimental spectrum represents the best fit at least three determinations. Limited proteolysis of M.EcoP15I was performed as described previously (15Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm M.EcoP15I in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer was incubated with 1% (w/w) Staphylococcus V8 protease (in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 20 min. The digestion was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer followed by boiling at 90 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. Requirement of Magnesium for DNA Methylation by M.EcoP15I—We investigated the effect of various metal ions on the methylation activity of M.EcoP15I, to determine the specificity of metal requirement. 2 μm M.EcoP15I was incubated with varying amounts of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ and the catalytic activity was determined (Fig. 1). The results of the methylation activity carried out with Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ ions clearly indicate that only in the presence of increasing amounts of Mg2+ was there a corresponding increase in methylation activity (Fig. 1). Maximum activity was seen after the addition of 6 mm MgCl2. Further additions of up to 25 mm of MgCl2 had no further effect on enzymatic activity. The metal ion concentration-dependent enzymatic activity assay illustrated that Mn2+ and Ca2+ do not facilitate catalytic reaction at any concentration, and therefore the requirement for metal ions is specific to Mg2+ (Fig. 1). The methylation activity seen in the presence of magnesium is recognition site-specific at the EcoP15I. This was demonstrated by the inability of M.EcoP15I-modified DNA to be cleaved by R.EcoP15I in the presence of ATP (data not shown). The stimulating influence of a magnesium ion on methylation activity may be associated with the enhanced ability of the enzyme to form a more stable complex with DNA. The lack of any activity in the presence of manganese or calcium could be attributed to the fact that the enzyme does not bind DNA in the presence of these two metal ions. However, earlier work from our laboratory clearly showed that M.EcoP15I was able to bind specifically DNA containing EcoP15I recognition sequence in the presence of manganese and calcium (15Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results presented above suggest that M.EcoP15I probably harbors a metal binding center important for methylation. Earlier, Hadi et al. (19Hadi S.M. Bachi B. Iida S. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that, although R.EcoP15I comprising the restriction (Res) and modification (Mod) subunits could methylate DNA in the absence of magnesium, EcoP15I modification subunit, which acts as a DNA MTase, methylated DNA only in the presence of Mg2+. More recently, Marks et al. (20Marks P. McGeehan J. Wilson G. Errington N. Kneale G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2803-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that the methylation reaction by AhdI methyltransferase is dependent in the presence of Mg2+ and inhibited by EDTA. Although all studied DNA MTases carry out methylation reactions in the absence of any metal ion, it is worth mentioning here that there are a few cases where the methylation reaction is stimulated in the presence of metal ions. It has been reported that the methylation reaction catalyzed by EcoB modification methylase (21Lautenberger J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6176-6182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BcgI (22Kong H. Smith C.L.

Inactivation of M.EcoP15I by Ferrous Sulfate—We intended to identify the metal binding region of M.EcoP15I using an affinity cleavage technique. Fenton chemistry uses transition metals to oxidize catalytically the peptide linkage that is in close proximity to the amino acid residues involved in metal ligation. Fe2+ is used as the redox active transition metal (26Fenton H.J.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1894; 65: 899-910Crossref Google Scholar). It is expected that Fe2+ would bind to the methyltransferase at the Mg2+ binding site. In the presence of ascorbate, ferrous sulfate caused a rapid time-dependent inactivation of M.EcoP15I at pH 8.0 and 4 °C with a half-time of about 5 min. As a control experiment, under the same conditions but without Fe2+ and ascorbate added, the enzyme was found to be completely stable during the experimental period (Fig. 2). Replacing ferrous sulfate with manganese sulfate or removing ascorbate from the incubation mixture did not lead to any inactivation (data not shown). Inclusion of 10 mm magnesium chloride, which was 25 times molar in excess over ferrous sulfate, in an enzyme solution, completely protected the enzyme from Fe2+-induced inactivation (Fig. 2). Addition of 10 mm MgCl2 to a partially inactivated enzyme solution prevented further inactivation of the remaining enzyme activity (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE Pattern of the Fe2 + -inactivated M.EcoP15I—Successful application of Fe2+-mediated cleavage depends on specific interactions between the metal ion and M.EcoP15I protein. This approach has been used successfully in identifying the metal binding sites of XPF-ERCC 1, a structure-specific DNA repair endonuclease (27Enzlin J.H. Scharer O.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), V(D)J recombinase (28Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), TaqI endonuclease (29Cao W. Barnay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and in a number of other type II restriction enzymes (30Hlavaty J.J. Benner J.S. Hornstra L.J. Schildkraut J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We first determined the concentration of FeSO4 required for cleavage to be 380 μm (Fig. 3A) and the optimal time required for the cleavage of M.EcoP15I to be 30 min (Fig. 3B). Extensively inactivated M.EcoP15I was subjected to PAGE under reducing conditions in the presence of SDS to examine the possible oxidative cleavage of the polypeptide chain. The native enzyme has a subunit of 73 kDa (15Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The inactivated enzyme was clearly cleaved into two fragments having molecular masses of 36 and 35 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). It must be mentioned here that the putative magnesium binding site, MDX 18ELK motif lies almost right in the middle of the protein se"
https://openalex.org/W2080525181,"Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) in mammalian cells is synthesized through the action of PtdSer synthase (PSS) 1 and 2, which catalyze the conversion of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively, to PtdSer. The PtdSer synthesis in intact cells and an isolated membrane fraction is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer, indicating that inhibition of PtdSer synthases by PtdSer is important for the regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis. In this study, to examine whether the inhibition occurs through the direct interaction of PtdSer with the synthases or is mediated by unidentified factor(s), we purified a FLAG and HA peptide-tagged form of Chinese hamster PSS 2 to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme, as well as the crude enzyme in a membrane fraction, was inhibited on the addition of PtdSer to the enzyme assay mixture. In contrast to PtdSer, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine did not significantly inhibit the purified enzyme. Furthermore, PtdSer-resistant PtdSer synthesis was observed on cell-free assaying of the membrane fraction prepared from a Chinese hamster ovary cell strain whose PtdSer synthesis in vivo is not inhibited by exogenous PtdSer. These results suggested that the interaction of PtdSer with PSS 2 or a very minor protein co-purified with PSS 2 was critical for the regulation of PSS 2 activity in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064997769,"SHP-2 is an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase with crucial functions in cell signaling and major pathological implications. It stays inactive in the cytosol and is activated by binding through its SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors on the cell surface. One such cell surface protein is PZR, which contains two tyrosine-based inhibition motifs responsible for binding of SHP-2. We have generated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein carrying the tandem tyrosine-based inhibition motifs of PZR, and the protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated by co-expressing c-Src in Escherichia coli cells. The purified phosphoprotein displays a strong binding to SHP-2 and causes its activation in vitro. However, when introduced into NIH 3T3 cells by using a protein delivery reagent, it effectively inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 induced by growth factors and serum but not by phorbol ester, in reminiscence of the effects caused by expression of dominant negative SHP-2 mutants and deletion of functional SHP-2. The data suggest that the exogenously introduced PZR protein specifically binds SHP-2, blocks its translocation, and renders it functionally incompetent. This is further supported by the fact that the phosphorylated PZR protein had no inhibitory effects on fibroblasts derived from mice expressing only a mutant SHP-2 protein lacking most of the N-terminal SH2 domain.

Earlier studies by overexpressing the catalytically inactive cysteine to serine mutant of SHP-2 in cell lines demonstrated that the enzyme plays a positive role in activation of ERK1/2 induced by growth factors (1Streuli M.

In Xenopus, a dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 blocks fibroblast growth factor- and activin-mediated induction of mesoderm (4Tang T.L. Freeman Jr., R.M. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In mice, disruption of the Shp-2 gene caused death of mouse embryos at mid-gestation (5Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M.

Further studies with cells derived from SHP-2-deficient mice demonstrated impairment in erythropoiesis and cell migration (6Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell.

Zampino G. Brunner H.G. Kremer H. van der Burgt I. Crosby A.H. Ion A. Jeffery S. Kalidas K. Patton M.A. Kucherlapati R.S. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, proportionate short stature, and heart disease. Excessive SHP-2 activity caused by mutation in the N-terminal SH2 domain is considered to be responsible for the pathogenesis. Furthermore, SHP-2 is an intracellular target of the CagA protein in Helicobacter pylori (10Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). H. pylori are associated with severe gastritis and gastric cancers, and CagA is introduced from the attached H. pylori into host cells and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and thereby activates SHP-2. Considering the important role of SHP-2 in cell signaling and its pathological implications, inhibition of the enzyme has great research and therapeutic values. However, a specific inhibitor of SHP-2 is still lacking. The catalytic domains of all classic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) share extremely high similarity in ternary structures. In fact, the catalytic domains of SHP-2 and its closest homologue SHP-1 share 60% sequence identity, but the ternary structures of the two catalytic domains are almost superimposible (11Yang J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to find highly selective inhibitors targeting the catalytic domains. On the other hand, PTPs are known to have highly specific functions, and this specificity is at least partly conferred by the non-catalytic domains or segments beyond the catalytic domains (3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). SHP-1 and SHP-2 both contain SH2 domains that play important regulatory and targeting roles. In vitro, purified SHP-1 and SHP-2 display very low specific activity (14Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This low level of activity is because of an internal suppression because the enzymes are significantly activated by removal of either C-terminal segments or SH2 domains (14Zhao Z. Bouchard P.

Furthermore, x-ray crystal structures of SHP-1 and SHP-2 reveal blocking of the catalytic center by the N-terminal SH2 domains (12Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vivo, SHP-1 and SHP-2 reside mainly in the cytosol where they are presumably inactive. It is generally believed that SHP-1 and SHP-2 are activated by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors and other proteins concomitant with translocation of the enzymes to the plasma membrane (1Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 183: 182-188Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 is controlled by membrane or membrane-associated proteins that recruit them. We reasoned that physiological functions of SHP-1 and SHP-2 could be efficiently blocked by exogenously introduced tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides or proteins that bind the enzymes and keep them in the cytosol or other cellular compartments where the enzymes are not functional. SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been known to be recruited to many receptors. Recently, we have isolated a cell surface glycoprotein designated PZR that specifically recruits SHP-2 through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) (20Zhao Z. Tan T.

Guerrah A. Tang H. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7882-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have prepared a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein carrying tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs of PZR from Escherichia coli cells coexpressing active c-Src. In this study, we introduced the GST fusion protein into cells by using the BioPorter reagent. This effectively inhibited growth factor- and serum-induced activation of ERK1/2 by blocking SHP-2 function. Our study thus provides a novel and highly specific method to interrupt the function of SHP-2 in intact cells.

Polyclonal anti-SHP-2, monoclonal anti-SHP-2, polyclonal anti-pERK(Thr202/Tyr204), monclonal anti-GST, and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Signal Transduction Laboratories, Cell Signaling Technology, Sigma, and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. SHP-1, SHP-2, and ΔSH2-SHP-2 were purified as previously described (14Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

Expression of GST Fusion Proteins Carrying the Intracellular Domain of PZR— Fig. 1A shows schematic structures of PZR and two recombinant fusion proteins. GST-ΔPZR represents a GST fusion protein carrying the intracellular domain of PZR corresponding to amino acid residues 192–269 of the molecule. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli cells and purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-pΔPZR is a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of GST-ΔPZR. The phosphorylation occurred only at the ITIMs of PZR and was achieved by co-expressing c-Src carried by a pET9a vector in E. coli cells as previously described (23Zhao R. Guerrah A. Tang H. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7882-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein was also purified from glutathione-Sepharose columns. SHP-2 Binding and Phosphatase Activity Assays—GST-pΔPZR, GST-PZR, and GST-pΔPZR immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with extracts of 293 cells overexpressing SHP-2. The cell extracts were made in Buffer A containing 25 mm β-glycerol-phosphate (pH 7.3), 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After washing three times with Buffer A, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS gels followed by immunoblotting or Coomassie Blue staining. To investigate the specific activation of SHP-2 by GST-pΔPZR, PTP activities of SHP-1, SHP-2, and ΔSH2-SHP-2 were measured with 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate in the presence of GST-ΔPZR or GST-pΔPZR. The assays were carried out at room temperature, and the assay system contained 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. BioPorter-mediated Transfer of Proteins into Cells—We employed the BioPorter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) to transfer GST-ΔPZR and GST-pΔPZR into NIH 3T3 cells following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 μl of BioPorter reagent was air-dried under a tissue culture hood for 2–3 h and then resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 3–6 μg of GST-ΔPZR or GST-pΔPZR. After 5 min incubation, the suspensions were mixed with 250 μl of plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were then added to NIH 3T3 cells (∼80–90% confluency) cultured in 12-well cell culture plates. Prior to the addition of the protein-BioPorter complex, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After addition of the complex, cells were further incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 culture incubator for 4–6 h before further treatment. Cell Stimulation, Extraction, and Western Blotting Analyses—After 3–6 h of incubation with GST-ΔPZR and GST-pΔPZR carried by the BioPorter reagent, cells were treated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for various periods of time, and the stimulation was stopped by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then extracted in the Buffer A. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and clear cell extracts were then separated by 10% SDS gels for Western blot analyses with specified antibodies. Detection was made by enhanced chemiluminescence, and quantification of the gel bands was performed by using a gel scanner. GST-pΔPZR Specifically Binds and Activates SHP-2 in Vitro—In our previous study (23Zhao R. Guerrah A. Tang H. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7882-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Src family protein-tyrosine kinases are at least partly responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR in cells, and we further showed that co-expression of GST-ΔPZR with c-Src in E. coli cells causes strong phosphorylation of GST-ΔPZR. The phosphorylation occurs on the tyrosyl residues of PZR embedded in ITIMs because mutation of the residues diminished the phosphorylation (23Zhao R. Guerrah A. Tang H. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7882-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By using glutathione-Sepharose columns, we were able to purify a large amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-pΔPZR from E. coli cell extracts. To analyze the ability of GST-pΔPZR to interact with SHP-2, we incubated glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying GST-pΔPZR with cell extracts obtained from 293 cells overexpressing SHP-2 (20Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, Western blotting analysis with anti-SHP-2 antibodies revealed a strong binding of SHP-2 with GST-pΔPZR but minimal binding with non-phosphorylated GST-ΔPZR. GST-pΔPZR-associated SHP-2 was also clearly detected by Coomassie Blue staining. In a sense, GST-pΔPZR provides a very effective method to enrich SHP-2 from cell extracts. Considering the fact that the GST-pΔPZR protein sample may not be 100% phosphorylated, the data suggest a near stoichiometric association of GST-pΔPZR with SHP-2. When similar experiments were conducted with cell extracts from 293 cells overexpressing SHP-1, a much smaller level of SHP-1 was detected by Western blotting, and no binding was seen in Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). This suggests a much preferable interaction of GST-pΔPZR with SHP-2 over SHP-1. These data agree with our previous results obtained with immunoprecipitation (20Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of GST-pΔPZR with SHP-2 is also demonstrated by specific activation of SHP-2 but not SHP-1 or ΔSH2-SHP-2 by GST-pΔPZR. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of GST-pΔPZR in phosphatase assay reactions resulted in near 20-fold activation of SHP-2, but non-phosphorylated GST-ΔPZR had no stimulatory effect. In contrast, GST-pΔPZR only caused marginal activation of SHP-1 and had no effects on ΔSH2-SHP-2, an SH2 domain-truncated form of SHP-2. These results further verify that PZR specifically interacts with the SH2 domains of SHP-2. Because GST-pΔPZR activate SHP-2 by binding to its SH2 domains, SHP-2 activation can be considered as a measure of the interaction between SH2 domains and GST-pΔPZR. The BioPorter Protein Delivery Reagent Efficiently Transfers GST-pΔPZR into Cultured Cells and Initiates its Interaction with SHP-2—To deliver GST-pΔPZR into live cells, we employed the BioPorter protein delivery reagent developed by Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. The BioPorter protein delivery reagent is a cationic lipid mixture that when complexed with proteins and peptides allows for direct intracellular delivery. The complex formed is non-covalent and it therefore does not interfere with the biological activity of the protein. This technique is rapid and relatively uncomplicated. With the BioPorter reagent, we were able to effectively deliver GST-ΔPZR and GST-pΔPZR into NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, both tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-pΔPZR and non-phosphorylated GST-ΔPZR were recovered in the cell extracts when the proteins complexed with the BioPorter reagent were incubated with the cells. In contrast, no incorporation of GST-pΔPZR into the cells was observed in the absence of the BioPorter reagent. Furthermore, transferred GST-pΔPZR was able effectively interact with SHP-2 as indicated by the “pull down” assays with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Therefore, the BioPorter reagent provides an effective way to deliver functional GST-pΔPZR into 3T3 cells to target SHP-2. In fact, Western blotting analyses of cell extracts and culture medium revealed that 15–20% of the GST fusion proteins entered the cells, and immunofluorescent cell staining showed nearly 100% cells were uploaded with the exogenously introduced fusion proteins in the entire cytoplasma (data not shown). Note that the efficient transfer mediated by the BioPorter reagent was obtained in serum-free medium, which is also used as the serum starvation step for stimulation of cells. GST-pΔPZR Efficiently Blocks Activation of ERK1/2 Induced by Serum and Growth Factors—SHP-2 has been defined as a positive signal transducer in growth factor signaling. To find out whether introduction GST-pΔPZR into cells block normal functions of SHP-2, we investigated activation of ERK1/2. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with mixtures of the BioPorter reagent and GST-ΔPZR or GST-pΔPZR in serum-free medium. After 3 and 6 h of incubation, the cells were treated with 15% FBS. Western blotting analyses of the cell extracts are shown Fig. 4. A 3-h incubation was sufficient to transfer the GST fusion proteins into the cells. A longer incubation period (6 h) did not significantly change the transfer efficiency or the stability of transferred proteins, but a higher concentration of GST-ΔPZR and GST-pΔPZR clearly favored the transfer. We employed a phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2 antibody to determine the activation of ERK1/2. The antibody detects ERK1 and ERK2 (p42 and p44 MAP kinase) only when they phosphorylated at the threonyl and tyrosyl residues that are required for activation of the enzymes. Upon stimulation with FBS, the control cells and the cells treated with non-phosphorylated GST-ΔPZR showed a marked increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 over the basal level. In contrast, the cells treated with GST-pΔPZR at both lower and higher concentrations exhibited essentially no response. Mobility shifts of ERK1/2 detected by a regular anti-ERK1/2 antibody further verified the data. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, a clear up-shift of the ERK2 band was seen with control and GST-ΔPZR cells but not with the cell treated with GST-pΔPZR. The mobility shift is also an indication of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Therefore, the data indicate that introduction of GST-pΔPZR into cells significantly inhibited FBS-induced activation of ERK1/2. We further analyzed the effects of GST-pΔPZR on activation of ERK1/2 induced by growth factors and the phorbol ester PMA. As shown in Fig. 5 (top panel), whereas GST-pΔPZR significantly reduced the activation of ERK1/2 induced by PDGF, epidermal growth factor, and insulin, it had no effect on that induced by PMA. This is reminiscent of the data obtained with cells overexpressing of the dominant negative mutant form of SHP-2 and cells derived from Shp-2Δ46–110 mice (20Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D.

The delivery of GST-pΔPZR into NIH 3T3 cells reduced FBS- and growth factor-induced ERK2 phosphorylation by 70–90% but had no effect on that induced by PMA. Taken together, the data indicate that introduction of GST-pΔPZR specifically inhibited growth factor- and serum-induced activation of ERK1/2 in a way similar to the expression of dominant negative SHP-2 or deletion of functional SHP-2.Fig. 5Different effects of GST-pΔPZR on activation of ERK1/2 induced by growth factors and phorbol ester PMA. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with 4 μg of GST-ΔPZR or GST-pΔPZR premixed with the BioPorter reagent for 4 h at 37 °C. Control experiments were performed without addition of GST-ΔPZR or GST-pΔPZR. The cells were stimulated with 15% FBS for 15 min, 10 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min, 0.1 nm PMA for 15 min, 40 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 5 min, or 0.5 μm insulin for 5 min. The cells were then extracted in Buffer A, and samples containing equal amounts of total proteins (20 μg) were subjected to Western blotting analyses with the indicated antibodies. The bottom panel shows a section of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane stained with Coomassie Blue to demonstrate equal protein loadings. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band at ∼90 kDa is indicated by arrows. The position of autophosphorylated PDGF receptor is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Quantitative representation of the effects of GST-pΔPZR on activation of ERK2 induced by growth factors and phorbol ester PMA. Experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The intensity of pERK2 bands was quantified by gel scanning and normalized against total proteins in cell extracts. Data represent relative intensity (mean ± S.D., n ≥ 3). The level of pERK2 at the basal level in control cells was defined as 1. EGF, epidermal growth factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Delivery of GST-pΔPZR into NIH 3T3 Cells Causes Hyper-phosphorylation of a 90-kDa Protein—By specifically targeting SHP-2, GST-pΔPZR may affect tyrosine phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins. We performed Western blotting analyses of cell extracts with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to find out whether this is indeed the case. When the whole cell extracts of NIH 3T3 cells were separated on SDS gels, the PDGF receptor running at ∼180 kDa was shown as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated band, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly enhanced upon stimulation of cells with PDGF (Fig. 5). However, introduction of neither GST-ΔPZR nor GST-pΔPZR in the cells had significant effects on its tyrosine phosphorylation at the basal level or under PGDF stimulation. Immunoprecipitation of the PDGF receptor followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analyses further verified the results with the PDGF receptor, and similar data were obtained with the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin receptor (data not shown). This suggests that GST-pΔPZR does not affect growth factor signaling at the receptor level. Interestingly, treatment of cells with GST-pΔPZR but not with GST-ΔPZR resulted in appearance of a broad tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band around 90 kDa (see Fig. 5). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was not altered in response to stimulation with growth factors. This protein likely corresponds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of similar molecular size observed in fibroblast cells derived from the Shp-2Δ46–110 mice (26Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This also suggests that GST-pΔPZR effectively blocks growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 by blocking the function of SHP-2. GST-pΔPZR Has No Inhibitory Effects on Activation of ERK1/2 in Functional SHP-2-deficient Fibroblast Cells—To prove further that the exogenously introduced GST-pΔPZR block the function of SHP-2, we employed functional SHP-2-deficient fibroblast cells derived from SHP-2Δ46–110 mice. The mice were generated by targeted deletion of exon 3 of the Shp-2 gene that results in expression of an N-terminal SH2 domain-truncated enzyme (5Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Fibroblast cells derived from wild type mice were used as control. As obtained with NIH 3T3 cells, the BioPorter reagent effectively delivered GST-pΔPZR into both SHP-2+/+ and SHP-2Δ46–110 cells. However, while wild type SHP-2 was found to be associated with GST-pΔPZR, N-terminal SH2 domain-truncated SHP-2Δ46–110 was not, suggesting that the remaining C-terminal SH2 domain in SHP-2Δ46–110 is not sufficient to mediate efficient interactions with ITIMs of PZR (Fig. 7A). This is further supported by the fact that pervanadate failed to induce associations of SHP-2Δ46–110 with endogenous PZR in contrast to the robust associations seen with native SHP-2 (Fig. 7B). We further treated the GST-pΔPZR-loaded cells with FBS and PDGF. As shown in Fig. 7C, SHP-2+/+ cells displayed strong activation of ERK1/2, but the activation was significantly inhibited by treatment of cells with GST-pΔPZR. In contrast, SHP-2Δ46–110 cells exhibited a much weaker response to FBS and PDGF, but GST-pΔPZR had no inhibitory effects. These data provide strong evidence that GST-pΔPZR inhibits serum- and growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 by blocking the normal function of SHP-2. In this study, we have demonstrated that a GST fusion protein carrying tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs of PZR effectively inhibited serum- and growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2. We believe that the inhibitory effects of GST-pΔPZR are mediated by blocking the normal function of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in the cells. This is supported by the following facts. First, the inhibitory role is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, and tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs of PZR specifically interact with the SH2 domain of SHP-2 in vitro. Second, the inhibitory effects are specific for growth factor but not for phorbol ester PMA. This agrees with the expression of the dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 and targeted disruption of SHP-2 in mice (24Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Therefore, this study provides a novel method and an effective reagent to block normal function of SHP-2 in intact cells. It should serve as a valuable tool for studying the biological function of SHP-2 and for developing therapeutic drugs targeted against SHP-2. We have turned a powerful in vitro activator of SHP-2 into an effective blocker of the enzyme in vivo. This is because of the structural and regulatory nature of the enzyme. The model shown in Fig. 8 provides a schematic explanation. The activity of SHP-2 is tightly regulated. During the resting state of cells, SHP-2 stays mostly in the cytosol where it remains inactive because of its internal suppressive structure. Upon stimulation, specific tyrosine-phosphorylated anchor proteins recruit SHP-2 through the SH2 domains and results in translocation and activation of the enzyme. Translocation is the key in regulation of the enzyme. In the cytosol or other cellular compartments where SHP-2 substrates do not exist, SHP-2 should be non-functional even if it is in an enzymatically active state. Therefore, a peptide or protein that binds the SH2 domains of SHP-2 and thereby blocks its translocation to desired locations should specifically inhibit the function of SHP-2. This notion is fully supported by our current experimental data. This view also explains the loss of SHP-2 function in SHP-2Δ46–110 mice in which exon 3 of the Shp-2 gene was deleted. Targeted deletion of exon 3 gave rise to an N-terminal SH2 domain-truncated enzyme (5Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The truncated enzyme is expressed in mouse cells and is presumably more active. However, it is apparently nonfunctional in vivo because of its inability to be recruited to desired locations (5Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 6Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 2001; 97: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A recent study with a total knockout of SHP-2 showed similar embryonic lethality and thereby excluded any possible gain-of-function of the truncated SHP-2 (discussed in Ref. 3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Both introduction of GST-pΔPZR in this study and the deletion of SHP-2 exon 3 in the earlier studies resulted in an enzymatically active but non-transferable enzyme, and the consequence is loss of SHP-2 function. It should be pointed out that because the affinity of SHP-2 to substrate is largely conferred by target domains and its catalytic domain possesses substrate specificity, this catalytically active but non-transferable enzyme per se should not cause nonspecific effects. On the other hand, if an exogenously introduced protein is localized to the plasma membrane and has the ability to recruit SHP-2, it should functionally activate SHP-2. This is probably the case with the CagA protein of H. pylori. CagA is localized to the plasma membrane of host cells and is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA recruits SHP-2 through SH2 domain binding to the plasma membrane and cause its functional activation. This is believed to be responsible for gastric tumors caused by bacteria. Recent studies have also linked mutations of Shp-2 with ∼50% of Noonan syndrome (9Tartaglia M. Mehler E.L. Goldberg R.

Many of these mutations involve residues that participate in the interaction of the N-SH2 and PTP domains that cause autoinhibition of PTP activity. It is generally thought that activation of SHP-2 is responsible for the pathogenesis. Based on current data, the activation of SHP-2 per se may not be important. Instead, the enhanced ability of SHP-2 to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide motifs and consequent translocation may be crucial. This explains the pathogenic effectiveness of some mutations of SHP-2 in Noonan syndrome that are not related to the N-SH2 and PTP domain interaction responsible for autoinhibition of the enzyme (33Tartaglia M. Kalidas K. Shaw A. Song X. Musat D.L. van der Burgt I. Brunner H.G. Bertola D.R. Crosby A. Ion A. Kucherlapati R.S. Jeffery S. Patton M.A. Gelb B.D. Am. J. Hum.

Gibbs R. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 20: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is apparent that inhibition of SHP-1 and SHP-2 function has important research and therapeutic values. Because the specific functions of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are defined by both catalytic and SH2 domains, inhibitors can target the SH2 domains as well as the catalytic domains. Determination of the crystal structures revealed very high structural similarity between SHP-1 and SHP-2, especially in the catalytic and N-SH2 domains (12Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 use the N-SH2 domain to keep the enzymes in the inactive conformation. However, the C-SH2 domain in the SHP-1 structure is differently orientated from that in SHP-2, and its secondary structure elements are relatively more openly organized (13Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-SH2 domains may play a major role in determining the specificity of SHP-1 and SHP-2, and therefore, targeting the C-SH2 domain may be more likely to produce specific inhibitors. Main methodology of drug development in industry has centered on the screening of vast libraries of molecules for biological activity upon which variants are produced to maximize beneficial medical characteristics. Recent developments in the understanding of the biochemistry of intracellular processes and protein-protein interaction have given rise to an alternative method by using peptides and proteins targeted at specific protein domains. New methods of noninvasive delivery of functional peptides and proteins to cells have made this feasible (35Dunican D.J. Doherty P. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Rojas M. Donahue J.P. Tan Z. Lin Y.Z. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed the BioPorter reagent to deliver GST-ΔPZR into NIH 3T3 cells. This method worked very well for NIH 3T3 cells when the transfer is conducted in serum-free conditions. We believe other delivery methods including attachment of cell-permeable peptide sequences can also be employed. We employed a tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion protein in our current study. In principle, synthetic diphosphotyrosyl peptides derived from the ITIM sequences should be equally effective. In addition, the strategy for functional inhibition of SHP-2 can be applied to SHP-1. SHP-1 and SHP-2 share over 50% sequence identity but their functions are often opposite. Our earlier studies demonstrated that SHP-1 preferentially binds LAIR-1, and the specificity is conferred by the interactions between the dual ITIMs and the dual SH2 domains (38Xu M. Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17440-17446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs of LAIR-1 should serve as a selective blocker of SHP-1. We are grateful to Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) for providing us with SHP-2+/+ and SHP-2Δ46–110 mouse fibroblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088416986,"Ikaros family transcription factors play important roles in the control of hematopoiesis. Family members are predicted to contain up to six classic zinc fingers that are arranged into N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain is responsible for site-specific DNA binding, whereas the C-terminal domain primarily mediates the homo- and hetero-oligomerization between family members. Although the mechanisms of action of these proteins are not completely understood, the zinc finger domains are known to play a central role. In the current study, we have sought to understand the physical and functional properties of these domains, in particular the C-terminal domain. We show that the N-terminal domain from Eos, and not its C-terminal region, is required to recognize GGGA consensus sequences. Surprisingly, in contrast to the behavior exhibited by Ikaros, the C-terminal domain of Eos inhibits the DNA-binding activity of the full-length protein. In addition, we have used a range of biophysical techniques to demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Eos mediates the formation of complexes that consist of nine or ten molecules. These results constitute the first direct demonstration that Ikaros family proteins can form higher order complexes in solution, and we discuss this unexpected result in the context of what is currently known about the family members and their possible mechanism of action.

In the mouse, Eos is primarily expressed in the developing central and peripheral nervous system but is also expressed elsewhere (10Honma Y. Kiyosawa H. Mori T. Oguri A. Nikaido T. Kanazawa K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting a wide-ranging role for Ikaros family proteins in development. Despite these differences in expression profile, sequence homology between family members suggests that, at a molecular level, the Ikaros family of proteins regulates development via common mechanisms. All family members contain highly conserved N- and C-terminal zinc finger (ZnF) 1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFC, gel filtration chromatography; rpHPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; CD, circular dichroism; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; PC-HC, pericentromeric-heterochromatin.1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFC, gel filtration chromatography; rpHPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; CD, circular dichroism; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; PC-HC, pericentromeric-heterochromatin. domains (see Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain consists of up to four ZnFs (depending on the splice variant), which are thought to bind sites in the regulatory regions of specific gene targets to modulate their expression (12Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The sequence of each ZnF suggests that they belong to the classical C2H2/TFIIIA ZnF family, although this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Classical ZnFs are well known for their sequence-specific DNA-binding ability (13Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Ikaros proteins comprises two ZnFs that mediate interactions between family members (14Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These homo- and heterotypic interactions are crucial for high affinity DNA binding in Ikaros and may allow an additional level of control over gene expression, because different combinations of family members differ in their ability to activate gene expression in transient-transfection assays (2Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Ikeda T. Gonzales E. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These C-terminal ZnFs also comply with the classical ZnF consensus sequence (see Fig. 1B), although no DNA-binding ability has yet been identified. Furthermore, they lack the typical TGEKP linker that is present in the majority of classical ZnFs (15Laity J.H. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This linker is known to play a role in DNA binding, and its absence lends weight to the suggestion that that C-terminal domain of Ikaros proteins may function purely to mediate protein-protein interactions. Little is currently known about the role of classical ZnFs in protein recognition. We have sought to understand the role of the C-terminal domain of Ikaros family proteins in more detail. We confirm that this domain from Eos (termed EosC) is not directly involved in DNA binding and that it may inhibit the DNA-binding ability of full-length Eos. We also test the binding of Eos to different family members and go on to characterize the EosC homo-oligomer in solution. Using a combination of gel filtration chromatography, light scattering, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, we demonstrate that Eos forms homomeric complexes comprising nine or ten molecules. Electron microscopy studies of purified EosC and an analysis of full-length Eos overexpressed in mammalian cells support this conclusion. These results are discussed in the context of the likely role of Ikaros family proteins in transcriptional regulation. Subcloning and Production of Proteins Used in DNA Binding Studies—For binding site selection experiments, the DNA-binding domain of Eos (EosN) was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to create the vector pGEX-2T.Eos101-231. EosN (along with a GST control) was overexpressed in a bacterial system using standard techniques. The production of MBP-EosC is discussed below. The plasmids pGAD10.Ikaros2 (isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen against the C terminus of Aiolos) and pGAD10.Eos have been described previously (16Perdomo J. Crossley M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The truncated Eos constructs used in the DNA binding studies were generated from pGAD10.Eos by standard PCR techniques. For mammalian expression the DNA sequences encoding Ikaros2, Eos, and the truncated Eos constructs were subcloned into the parental plasmid pMT2 for mammalian expression. The final vectors are pMT2.Ikaros2, pMT2.FLAG.Eos, pMT2.FLAG.Eos50-231, pMT2.FLAG.Eos50-331, pMT2.FLAG.Eos50-389, and pMT2.FLAG.Eos50-464. COS cells were transfected with 2 μg of the appropriate plasmid using the DEAE-dextran method (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were made 48-60 h post-transfection as follows: cells were washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 s), cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold Solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 ng/ml PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), left on ice for 10 min, and vortexed for 10 s. Cells were re-centrifuged, and the nuclei were resuspended in 30 μl of Solution C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 ng/ml PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Tubes were left on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was stored at -70 °C. Binding Site Selection Experiments—A degenerate oligonucleotide library with a core comprising 26 random nucleotides flanked by conserved sequences containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites was used (sequence available on request). The binding site selection experiments were performed as previously described (11Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assays—The sequences for the oligonucleotides that contain all 5-bp elements are available on request. The other oligonucleotides used were: AGAAGTTTCCATGACATCATGAATGGGGGTGGCAGAGA (contains the δA element); TGAAAAAGGTGGAAATTTAGAAATGTCCACTGTAGGACGTGGAA (γ-satellite sequence); AAACATGGAAAATGATAAAAACCACACTGTAGAACATATTAG (minor satellite sequence); and GTACCTCCATAGGGAAAATTATCCTAG (contains a single copy of a typical Ikaros/Eos recognition element). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (Australia). Prior to the assay, oligonucleotides were annealed in solution and end-labeled with 32P according to standard procedures using polynucleotide kinase and purified on native polyacrylamide gels by standard methods (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Gel-shift assays were set up in a total volume of 30 μl, comprising ∼1 pmol of 32P-labeled probe, ∼100 ng of protein/nuclear extract, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). For assays in Fig. 2, an additional 4.5 μg of either Anti-Flag®M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Ikaros antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or pre-immune serum was present. After incubation (ice, 20 min) the samples were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel made up in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gel was subjected to electrophoresis (15 V/cm, 4 °C, 3 h) in 0.5 × TBE buffer, dried, and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Experiments—Interactions between Eos/Trps1 and other Ikaros family proteins were investigated by cotransforming the yeast strain HF7c (Clontech Two-hybrid Matchmaker system protocol) with pGAD10.Eos and the partner plasmids pGBT9.Eos358-532, pGBT9.PegasusF4-5, and pGBT9.AiolosF5-6 or with pGBT9.Eos358-532 and the partner plasmids pGAD10-Ikaros2 or pGAD10-Trps1/1222-1281 (sequences available on request). Controls using empty pGBT9 or pGAD10 vectors, as appropriate, were also tested. Transformants were selected on Leu- Trp- minimal media plates after growth at 29 °C, and patched onto His- Leu- Trp- plates and further incubated to test for interactions. For positive interactions, yeast cells were resuspended in water, and the A 600 nm was adjusted to ∼0.15. Samples were serially diluted (100, 10-1, and 10-2), and equal volumes (10 μl) were deposited onto His- Leu- Trp- plates. The number of colonies was compared after a final incubation at 29 °C for ∼60 h. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of EosC and PegC—Constructs encoding the C-terminal domains of Eos (EosC, amino acids 474-532) and Pegasus (PegC, amino acids 361-419) were generated from a series of long (∼60-70 bp) overlapping oligonucleotides (18Casimiro D.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1407-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These were designed to optimize codon usage in Escherichia coli and to mutate putative non-zinc ligating Cys residues. Oligonucleotides were annealed and extended using PCR and amplified using short primers. Site-directed mutagenesis of EosC was used to create wild-type EosC from this mutant. Sequences of oligonucleotides and primers are available on request. The above constructs were inserted into pIH1120 (pIH1119 modified to contain a BamHI/EcoRI cloning site), thereby creating C-terminal fusions with maltose-binding protein (MBP). Constructs were overexpressed in the host strain BL21(DE3) grown in Luria broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and glucose (0.2% w/v). Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking until an A 600 nm of ∼0.6 was reached, whereupon protein overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm). After 4-6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C), and the resultant cell pellets were stored at -20 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The soluble fraction was applied to pre-equilibrated amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and washed with three column volumes of sonication buffer followed by three column volumes of thrombin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). EosC and PegC were eluted as fusions with MBP by the addition of maltose (50 mm, in thrombin buffer). MBP fusion proteins were either further purified by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) using a Superose-12 fast-protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, 0.8 ml/min, 4 °C) run in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or cleaved in solution by the addition of thrombin (4 °C, 2 h). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) using an Alltech™ Alltima C18 column (1 ml/min, 25 °C), and their identities were confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. Fractions were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy—MBP·EosC purified by GFC was adjusted with buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) to a final concentration of ∼6 μm. Measurements (repeated five times) were performed on a Varian Spectra AA20plus atomic absorption spectrometer at 213.9 nm using solutions of ZnNO3 as calibration standards. Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—Samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized rpHPLC-purified peptide in 50 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 50 μm ZnSO4 to a final concentration of 15 μm. The pH was adjusted to 5.0-6.0 using 1 m NaOH. CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. CD data were collected over the wavelength range 184-260 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s using a 1-mm path length cell. Final spectra were the sum of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm/min and were baseline-corrected. NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized EosC was dissolved in a solution containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and ZnSO4 (150 and 300 μm, respectively) to a final concentration of ∼140 μm. The pH was adjusted to 5.7 using 1 m NaOH, and D2O (5% v/v) and d 4-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid (20 μm) were added. One-dimensional NMR spectra (in either the presence or absence of Zn(II)) were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX600 NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance (HCN) probe head and three-axis pulsed-field gradients. Water suppression was achieved by pulsed-field gradients immediately prior to data acquisition. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) and a Lorentzian-Gaussian window function. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with an AnTi-60 rotor. Absorbance (280 and 360 nm) versus radius scans (0.001-cm increments) were collected at 3-h intervals until the samples had reached equilibrium. Data were recorded at three different speeds (7,500, 8,900, and 13,000 rpm) and loading concentrations (2, 5, and 10 μm). Analysis of the data was carried out using NONLIN software (19Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The density of the solvent and the partial specific volume of the peptide (adjusted to include the contribution of Zn(II); p = 0.719 g/ml) were estimated using SEDNTERP (20Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. SEDNTERP. University of New, Durham, NHe1995Google Scholar). Final parameters were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit to models incorporating homo-oligomerization, and examination of residuals was used to determine the goodness of fit. Gel Filtration, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitations—Nuclear extracts (300 μl) from COS cells transfected with 2 μg of pMT2-FLAG-Eos (described above) were loaded onto a Superose 6 fast-protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.015% Nonidet P-40 (0.2 ml/min, 4 °C). The collected fractions (0.75 ml) were combined with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Tubes were left on ice (15 min) and centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 1 m Tris (20 μl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with Anti-Flag®M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and visualized using Western Lightning® chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, MA). For immunoprecipitation, Eos-containing GFC fractions were incubated with agarose-conjugated Anti-Flag®M2 and washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The isolated complex was visualized by silver-staining following SDS-PAGE. Transmission Electron Microscopy—MBP·EosC was purified by GFC and dialyzed against water containing 1 mm DTT. Formvar-coated copper grids (200 mesh/inch, ProSciTech, Australia) were floated on drops of either MBP·EosC (∼0.4 mg/ml) or 1 mm DTT (control) for 30 s and negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.4 (30 s). After air-drying, the sample was observed in a Phillips Biofilter CM120 with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Dynamic Light Scattering—Right-angle light scattering was performed using a DynaPro-MS/X dynamic light scattering/molecular-sizing instrument (Protein Solutions). MBP·EosC was purified by GFC (final concentration, ∼0.6 mg/ml) and exchanged into three different solutions (see Table I) by dialysis. Scattering was measured 15 times at two temperatures (4 and 20 °C). Light scattering data were analyzed using the Dynamics software program (Protein Solutions). The intensity of light scattered at an angle of 90° was measured as a function of time, and these measurements were used to find the autocorrelation function. From this, the translational diffusion coefficient (D T) of the sample particles in solution was evaluated and the hydrodynamic radius (R H) of the sample particles was derived from D T using the Stokes-Einstein equation, D T = k b T/6πηR H, where k b is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, and η is the solvent viscosity. The mass of the sample particles was estimated from R H assuming that the particles are spherical and of standard density. Based on an attempt to fit the sizes of the sample particles to a monomodal (one particle size) distribution, the polydispersity gave an indication of the homogeneity of particle sizes in the sample.Table IDNA-binding sites recognized by GST-EosNConsensusgNtGGGANNG51210109033A2320011031T134000024C232000022Total101010101010101010 Open table in a new tab Function of the N- and C-terminal Domains of Eos—The DNA-binding specificity of Ikaros has been studied extensively by PCR site selection and gel-shift assays (12Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It has been found that an Ikaros protein with three or more ZnFs in its N-terminal domain binds DNA sequences with the core motif GGGAA (12Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and that the N- rather than the C-terminal domain drives this specificity. The ability of Eos to bind this typical Ikaros recognition element has also been demonstrated (11Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of Eos to bind additional DNA sites, we carried out PCR site selection experiments (21Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using the DNA-binding domain of Eos (amino acids 101-231) fused to GST (GST-EosN, Fig. 1A). Table I summarizes the results of sequencing 10 different oligonucleotides that were selectively bound by GST-EosN. These sequences conform to a similar consensus to that obtained for Ikaros, namely GGGA. These results demonstrate that Eos has the highest affinity for DNA sequences with this core motif and is consistent with the fact that the N-terminal ZnF domain of Eos is highly homologous to that of Ikaros. We also observed that Eos, like Ikaros, requires three or more ZnFs in its N-terminal domain to bind DNA (not shown). There have been indications that the C-terminal domain of Ikaros possesses weak DNA-binding abilities. For instance, it has been reported that the Ikaros C-terminal domain can bind to various GGGAA-containing probes (1Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B.

However, a consensus binding site has not been reported, presumably due to low association constants. It is generally difficult to establish convincingly that a protein domain is incapable of binding to DNA, because there always remains the possibility that the correct sequence has not been identified. However, based on the prediction that a DNA-binding, two-ZnF protein should recognize a sequence of ∼5-bp, we used a gel-shift assay to test the ability of MBP·EosC to bind a set of six overlapping, double-stranded oligonucleotides that contain all 5-bp DNA sequences. We observed that none of the probe was retained (not shown). We also tested the ability of MBP·EosC to bind the δA element of the CD3-δ enhancer, because weak binding to this element by the C-terminal domain of Ikaros has been observed (1Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Again, we did not detect any binding by MBP·EosC to this probe (not shown). Finally, MBP·EosC did not bind γ-satellite and minor satellite sequences, to which Ikaros has also been shown to bind (22Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These results provide strong evidence that the C-terminal domain of Eos does not bind DNA and that the DNA-binding activity of Eos is mediated solely by the N-terminal domain, EosN. The C-terminal Domain Appears to Inhibit DNA Binding—Given that the binding site selection experiments were performed with only the bacterially expressed N-terminal domain of Eos, we sought to confirm that full-length Eos also bound DNA sites with the core motif, GGGA. This ability was tested in a gel-shift assay using proteins overexpressed in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, we found that FLAG-tagged Eos was unable to bind a probe that contains a typical Ikaros/Eos recognition motif (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3). In contrast to this, Ikaros2 (a splice variant containing three N-terminal ZnFs) was able to bind the same probe with high affinity under identical conditions (lanes 4 and 5). The weak bands observed in lane 2 that are not present in lane 3 (in which Anti-Flag®M2 antibodies were added) are most likely Eos degradation products that lack the C-terminal domain (these degradation products are observed routinely in Western blots, not shown). These bands possess a considerably higher mobility when compared with the intense bands in lanes 4 or 5, which correspond to Ikaros/DNA and Ikaros/anti-Ikaros antibodies/DNA, respectively. Because the ability of GST-EosN to bind this probe in a gel-shift assay has been shown (11Perdomo J. Holmes M. Chong B. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38347-38354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we expressed the N-terminal domain of Eos (amino acids 50-231, truncation T1) in COS cells to assess the DNA-binding capacity of this domain in a mammalian cell context. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 6 and 7), FLAG-T1 bound the DNA probe strongly. This observation suggested the presence of an inhibitory domain in a region C-terminal of the DNA-binding ZnFs of Eos. To map the inhibitory region, additional Eos constructs (amino acids 50-331, T2; 50-389, T3; and 50-464, T4) were expressed in COS cells and tested for their ability to bind DNA with high affinity. As seen in Fig. 2 (lanes 8-13), all these proteins were able to recognize the probe with similar affinities. For each assay, nuclear extracts were visualized by Western blotting to confirm similar amounts of protein were added (not shown). Because the construct T4 includes most of Eos other than the two C-terminal ZnFs, we conclude that the C-terminal domain of Eos acts as an inhibitor of DNA binding. This is in direct contrast to results obtained for Ikaros in which this domain was found to be required for high-affinity DNA binding (14Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K.
