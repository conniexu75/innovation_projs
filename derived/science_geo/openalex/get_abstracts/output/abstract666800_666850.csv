How infections themselves shape this fundamental process remains largely unknown. Here, we show that gut microbiota from previously infected hosts display enhanced resistance to infection. This long-term functional remodeling is associated with altered bile acid metabolism leading to the expansion of taxa that utilize the sulfonic acid taurine. Notably, supplying exogenous taurine alone is sufficient to induce this alteration in microbiota function and enhance resistance. Mechanistically, taurine potentiates the microbiota's production of sulfide, an inhibitor of cellular respiration, which is key to host invasion by numerous pathogens. As such, pharmaceutical sequestration of sulfide perturbs the microbiota's composition and promotes pathogen invasion. Together, this work reveals a process by which the host, triggered by infection, can deploy taurine as a nutrient to nourish and train the microbiota, promoting its resistance to subsequent infection."

To better understand, we profiled and analyzed ∼32,500 single-cell transcriptomes of testicular cells from embryonic, fetal, and infant stages. Our data show that at 6-7 weeks postfertilization, as the testicular cords are established, the Sertoli and interstitial cells originate from a common heterogeneous progenitor pool, which then resolves into fetal Sertoli cells (expressing tube-forming genes) or interstitial cells (including Leydig-lineage cells expressing steroidogenesis genes). Almost 10 weeks later, beginning at 14-16 weeks postfertilization, the male primordial germ cells exit mitosis, downregulate pluripotent transcription factors, and transition into cells that strongly resemble the state 0 spermatogonia originally defined in the infant and adult testes. Therefore, we called these fetal spermatogonia ""state f0."" Overall, we reveal multiple insights into the coordinated and temporal development of the embryonic, fetal, and postnatal male germline together with the somatic niche."

Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) to 40-residue Aβ (Aβ40). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by γ-secretase along two pathways: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer Aβ peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified γ-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to Aβ48 and Aβ49 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual Aβ peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for Aβ40 and Aβ42 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of Aβ and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased Aβ42/40. However, all 14 disease-causing mutations led to inefficient processing of longer forms of Aβ ≥ 45 residues. In addition, the effects of certain mutations provided insight into the mechanism of processive proteolysis: intermediate Aβ peptides apparently remain bound for subsequent trimming and are not released and reassociated.

Cerebral plaques composed of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) are a defining pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (1Querfurth H.W. LaFerla F.M. Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3463) Google Scholar). Aβ is produced from the amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) through sequential proteolysis, by β-secretase shedding the ectodomain (2Cole S.L. Vassar R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 29621-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) followed by γ-secretase cutting within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the remnant 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) (3Wolfe M.S. Structure and function of the γ-secretase complex.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 2953-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides of 38 to 43 residues are secreted, with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (Aβ42) being predominantly and disproportionally deposited in AD plaques (4Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Visualization of Aβ42(43) and Aβ40 in senile plaques with end-specific Aβ monoclonals: Evidence that an initially deposited species is Aβ42(43).Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). A pathogenic role for Aβ42 was strongly supported by the discovery of dominant missense mutations in APP and presenilins—the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex—that cause early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) (5Tanzi R.E. The genetics of Alzheimer disease.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2a006296Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These mutations were found to elevate the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40, thereby increasing Aβ42 aggregation. Inconsistencies with the hypothesis that Aβ42 is the pathogenic variant in FAD emerged recently with a report on Aβ40 and Aβ42 production from 138 different FAD-mutant forms of the presenilin-1/γ-secretase complex, showing that many disease-causing mutations did not elevate Aβ42/Aβ40 (6Sun L. Zhou R. Yang G. Shi Y. Analysis of 138 pathogenic mutations in presenilin-1 on the in vitro production of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides by γ-secretase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E476-E485Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yet the involvement of Aβ in FAD seems inescapable: after more than 30 years of searching, the only mutations associated with FAD are found in the substrate and enzyme that produces Aβ. Solving this puzzle requires recognition that processing of the APP TMD by the membrane-embedded γ-secretase complex occurs processively. The enzyme first cleaves near the cytosolic end of the APP TMD at the ε site to give either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and release the corresponding APP intracellular domain (AICD) composed of C99 residues 49 to 99 or 50 to 99 (7Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. Distinct intramembrane cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein family resembling γ-secretase-like cleavage of Notch.J. Biol.

Carboxypeptidase cleavage generally every three amino acids then produces secreted Aβ peptides along two pathways: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38 (8Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase: Successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of beta-carboxyl terminal fragment.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Understanding how FAD mutations initiate the disease process requires a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of all the proteolytic steps carried out by γ-secretase on APP. Such analysis is challenging, as Aβ peptides of 45 residues and longer are difficult to detect and quantify by mass spectrometry (MS) and have no specific antibodies for ELISA. We have previously shown that five different FAD-mutant γ-secretase complexes are deficient in carboxypeptidase function (9Fernandez M.A. Klutkowski J.A. Freret T. Wolfe M.S. Alzheimer presenilin-1 mutations dramatically reduce trimming of long amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) by γ-secretase to increase 42-to-40-residue Aβ.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31043-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and increase the proportion of Aβ that is 45 residues and longer (10Quintero-Monzon O. Martin M.M. Fernandez M.A. Cappello C.A. Krzysiak A.J. Osenkowski P. Wolfe M.S. Dissociation between the processivity and total activity of γ-secretase: Implications for the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease-causing presenilin mutations.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9023-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, this limited study was accomplished using a long, hand-cast urea-PAGE system and western blotting, which is technically challenging, difficult to quantify, and insufficient for separating Aβ46 through Aβ49. Here we employ liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a central method to quantify the tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts to determine the levels of each Aβ peptide produced by purified γ-secretase from wild-type and 14 different FAD-mutant APP substrates. Few of these mutations elevated Aβ42, and not all increased the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. In contrast, we find that all 14 FAD mutations altered processive proteolysis by γ-secretase to elevate levels of Aβ peptides of 45 residues and longer. Moreover, we find that long Aβ intermediates are not released and reassociated with the enzyme for subsequent trimming; instead, they remain bound for further processing. We first investigated the effects of the APP FAD mutations on the production of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 peptides. For substrate, we used C100-FLAG, a standard recombinant C99-based substrate with an N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. We and others have employed this substrate routinely in biochemical γ-secretase assays, as it recapitulates C99 processing by the protease complex (11Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Presenilin 1 is linked with γ-secretase activity in the detergent solubilized state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12Bolduc D.M. Montagna D.R. Seghers M.C. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid-β forming tripeptide cleavage mechanism of γ-secretase.eLife. 2016; 5e17578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified C100-FLAG along with 14 different FAD-mutant versions (Fig. 2A). We also expressed γ-secretase in suspended human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using a tetracistronic construct encoding all four components (presenilin-1, nicastrin, Aph-1aL, and Pen-2) (13Lu P. Bai X.C. Ma D. Xie T. Yan C. Sun L. Yang G. Zhao Y. Zhou R. Scheres S.H.W. Shi Y. Three-dimensional structure of human γ-secretase.Nature. 2014; 512: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and then purified the complex to homogeneity. The WT and FAD-mutant substrates were subjected to proteolysis by 30 nM of γ-secretase under saturating conditions (5 μM of substrate) in two different systems, solubilized in detergent or reconstituted in proteoliposomes. These two systems were used in order to establish whether the detergent-solubilized conditions would give results regarding Aβ40 versus Aβ42 production that are similar to that of the more native-like conditions of proteoliposomes, as the high lipid concentrations of the latter would interfere with subsequent MS analysis of small peptide products. Levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 derived from proteolysis of the C100 substrates under both conditions were quantified by specific ELISAs (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). The detergent-solubilized condition produced approximately tenfold more Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides. However, the relative effects of the FAD mutations compared with WT substrate on both Aβ40 and Aβ42 are closely similar between the two conditions. Moreover, the ratios of Aβ42 to Aβ40 are nearly identical for all the substrate variants between the two different conditions. The ratios calculated showed that three FAD mutants I45V, V46F, and V46L did not lead to increases in Aβ42/Aβ40 in the detergent-solubilized system. Similarly, I45V and V46F did not exhibit increased Aβ42/Aβ40 in proteoliposomes (V46L reached a statistically significant increase in this system). The similar Aβ42-to-Aβ40 ratios for the detergent-solubilized and proteoliposome systems suggest that proteolytic processing of these C100 substrates by γ-secretase in the solubilized state takes place in a manner similar to what occurs within a lipid bilayer. Note that Aβ42/Aβ40 from WT substrate is higher than what occurs for C99 in cells because these in vitro reactions were performed under saturating substrate conditions (14Yin Y.I. Bassit B. Zhu L. Yang X. Wang C. Li Y.-M. γ-Secretase substrate concentration modulates the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23639-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, relative changes in Aβ42/Aβ40 between WT and FAD-mutant substrates can be determined with confidence. For instance, the I45F mutation gave the highest Aβ42/Aβ40 as expected (12Bolduc D.M. Montagna D.R. Seghers M.C. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid-β forming tripeptide cleavage mechanism of γ-secretase.eLife. 2016; 5e17578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The results above suggest that increased Aβ42/Aβ40 is not necessary for the pathogenesis of FAD, as not all FAD mutations in the APP TMD lead to such elevations. Therefore, we sought to analyze and quantify all other possible proteolytic products generated during APP TMD proteolysis by γ-secretase. Quantification of small peptide coproducts (tri- and tetrapeptides) generated during trimming is an indirect way to quantify the production of Aβ46, Aβ43, and Aβ40 along the Aβ40 pathway and the production of Aβ45, Aβ42, and Aβ38 along the Aβ42 pathway. The WT substrate generates ITL, VIV, IAT sequentially in the Aβ40 pathway and VIT, TVI and VVIA sequentially in the Aβ42 pathway (Fig. 1). An LC-MS/MS method was developed, based on Takami et al. (8Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase: Successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of beta-carboxyl terminal fragment.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), to analyze and quantify the small-peptide coproducts generated from the trimming of WT C100-FLAG substrate by γ-secretase. First, the mixtures from the detergent-based system and from the proteoliposome-based system were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis to detect small peptides. All small peptides expected to be generated were detected in the detergent-solubilized assay system (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the same method failed to detect peptides from the proteoliposome system (data not shown), likely due to low concentrations of the products from the proteoliposome system, as evident from the ELISA assays in Fig. 2, as well as interference by the high levels of lipids. For quantification of small-peptide production, standard curves of each peptide were generated by plotting the concentration of pure synthetic peptide versus the integrated areas of the three most abundant ion fragments from MS/MS. The standard curves show excellent linearity from 62.5 nM to 1000 nM for ITL, VIV, IAT, VIT, and TVI peptides, while VVIA showed excellent linearity from 31.25 nM to 1000 nM (Fig. S1). With all standard curves established, each peptide generated in the detergent-solubilized γ-secretase cleavage assay with WT C100-FLAG was monitored and quantified after 2, 4, 8, and 16 h reaction times. All small peptides from WT substrate were generated in a linear fashion with time up to 16 h (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the sequence of the carboxypeptidase trimming steps, Aβ40 pathway peptides were generated with relative rates ITL > VIV > IAT, and Aβ42 pathway peptides were generated with relative rates VIT > TVI > VVIA. Next, we quantified small peptides generated by γ-secretase from all 14 FAD-mutant substrates. Thirteen of the 14 mutant substrates produce two unique small peptides each—one from the Aβ40 pathway and one from the Aβ42 pathway—that are different from the small peptides generated from trimming of the WT substrate (Table S1), due to mutation within the trimmed Aβ sequence. Only the L52P-mutant substrate is processed to the same set of small peptides generated from the WT substrate. Standard curves for all the possible small-peptide coproducts from processive proteolysis of all 14 FAD-mutant substrates were generated and showed excellent linearity from 62.5 nM to 1000 nM (Fig. S1). Using these standard curves, each small peptide generated during proteolytic trimming for WT and all 14 FAD-mutant substrates was quantified (Fig. 4). For the Aβ40 pathway, levels of ITL produced from the Aβ49→Aβ46 trimming step (measuring the production of Aβ46 and degradation of Aβ49) decreased with all of the FAD-mutant substrates except for I45F when compared with WT substrate (Fig. 4A). Levels of downstream trimming products VIV from Aβ46→Aβ43 (a measure of production of Aβ43 and degradation of Aβ46) and IAT from Aβ43→Aβ40 (measuring production of Aβ40 and degradation of Aβ43) also decreased except for V44A, for which there were no significant changes compared with WT (Fig. 4, B and C). For the Aβ42 pathway, levels of VIT produced from the Aβ48→Aβ45 trimming step (production of Aβ45 and degradation of Aβ48) were significantly higher compared with WT substrate with mutant substrates V44A, V44M, V46I, and V46G and significantly lower with mutants I45F, I45T, I45V, T48P, and L52P (Fig. 4D). Levels of the next trimming product TVI, from Aβ45→ Aβ42 (production of Aβ42 and degradation of Aβ45), were increased in T43I, V44A, V46I, and V46G compared with WT and decreased in A42T, I45F, I45T, I45V, V46F, V46L, T48P, and L52P (Fig. 4E). Levels of the final trimming product VVIA, from Aβ42→Aβ38 (production of Aβ38 and degradation of Aβ42), also increased from substrate mutants V44A, V46I, V46G, and V46L compared with WT and decreased from A42T, T43A, I45F, I45T, I45V, T48P, and L52P mutants. (Fig. 4F). Up to this point, production and degradation of all Aβ peptides were quantified indirectly by analyzing coproducts (small peptides) by LC-MS/MS, except for production of Aβ48 and Aβ49. To quantify Aβ48 and Aβ49 generated by ε cleavage of APP substrate, levels of coproducts AICD 49 to 99 and AICD 50 to 99 peptides were determined using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and quantitative western blotting. First, AICD species generated in the detergent-solubilized system were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and monitored by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 5A). The ratios of signal intensities corresponding to AICD 49 to 99 to AICD 50 to 99 were calculated and tabulated for enzyme reactions with WT and all mutant substrates (Fig. 5B). The ratio of AICD 49 to 99 to AICD 50 to 99 from WT C100-Flag substrate was 1.28, and this ratio is increased with all the mutant substrates except for I45F and T48P, for which it is decreased. This indicates that most of the FAD mutations shift ε cleavage in favor of Aβ48 compared with WT substrate, consistent with previous reports (15Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Haass C. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ishiura S. Ihara Y.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, the I45F and T48P mutations favor ε cleavage producing Aβ49 (12Bolduc D.M. Montagna D.R. Seghers M.C. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid-β forming tripeptide cleavage mechanism of γ-secretase.eLife. 2016; 5e17578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unique among the substrate variants, the V46G mutation led to ε cleavage at three sites, forming AICD 47 to 99 along with AICD 49 to 99 and AICD 50 to 99. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of AICD products generated from the proteoliposome system and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies gave closely similar results (Fig. S2), again demonstrating that the detergent-solubilized system recapitulates γ-secretase cleavage of APP substrate as it occurs within a lipid bilayer. Because quantification of AICD 49 to 99 and AICD 50 to 99 levels by MALDI-TOF MS as above would require standards of these specific AICD isoforms that we did not possess, the same reaction mixtures were subjected to quantitative western blotting using anti-FLAG primary antibodies (Fig. 5C). Known concentrations of C100-FLAG were run in parallel to make a calibration curve, plotting band intensity with concentration of FLAG-tagged protein (Fig. 5C). From this standard curve, the concentration of total AICD-FLAG product generated in the enzyme reaction mixtures can be quantified (Fig. 5D). AICD product generated by γ-secretase from WT substrate was 1.06 ± 0.19 μM, giving a kcat of 2.2 ± 0.38 h−1, consistent with previously reported values (17Kamp F. Winkler E. Trambauer J. Ebke A.

Quantification of the total AICD product levels for each mutant substrate revealed increased ε cleavage compared with WT substrate for mutations V44A, V44M, V46I, V46G, V46F, and V46L and decreased ε cleavage for mutations A42T, I45F, I45T, and L52P mutant substrates. Mutations T43A, T43I, I45V, and T48P showed no change in total AICD production compared with that seen with WT substrate. The concentration of each AICD product (AICD 49–99 and AICD 50–99) could then be calculated using the total AICD level determined by quantitative western blot and the ratio of AICD 49 to 99 to AICD 50 to 99 determined from MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 5E). The calculated concentrations of AICD 49 to 99 and AICD 50 to 99 thereby provide the level of production of coproducts Aβ48 and Aβ49, respectively. In the case of V46G, detection of coproduct AICD 47 to 99 allowed determination of the level of Aβ46 produced directly through ε cleavage of this mutant substrate. The net level of each species of Aβ generated by γ-secretase from each APP substrate was calculated from the quantified coproducts (small peptides and AICD species). Net levels of Aβ peptides were determined by subtracting the concentration of small peptide coproduct of degradation from the concentration of peptide coproduct of production (Fig. 6A). The net concentration of each Aβ peptide species for WT and mutant substrates are illustrated and tabulated in Figure 6B, with net increases compared with WT substrate in green bold and net decreased in red italics. For WT substrate, net Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels determined by this indirect method are closely similar to that determined from the same enzyme reaction by specific ELISAs (Aβ40: 295 ± 31 nM by LC-MS/MS, 337 ± 5 nM by ELISA; Aβ42: 274 ± 15 nM by LC-MS/MS, 281 ± 33 nM by ELISA). This provides strong validation of the LC-MS/MS method for determining the net concentrations of each Aβ peptide. γ-Secretase processing of all FAD mutations in the APP TMD led to increased net levels in one or more Aβ peptides of 45 to 49 residues in length. The A42T mutation led to the elevation of Aβ46 and Aβ45 levels. The T43A mutation elevated Aβ48 and Aβ46 levels, while the T43I mutation increased Aβ48. Both V44A and V44M mutations led to increased Aβ49, Aβ48, and Aβ45 species. For the I45F mutant, Aβ46 peptide is elevated, consistent with our previous study showing that aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine are not tolerated in the P2’ position (12Bolduc D.M.

I45T and I45V mutations increased Aβ49 and Aβ48, respectively. The V46I mutant elevated Aβ49, Aβ48, and Aβ45, while V46G, V46F, and V46L resulted in increased Aβ48, Aβ46, and Aβ45 levels. The T48P mutant elevated Aβ49 and Aβ46, and L52P increased Aβ48. Only four mutations elevated Aβ42 (T43A, T43I, V44A, and V46G), and one (I45V) elevated the amyloidogenic Aβ43 peptide (20Saito T.

As seen by ELISA, mutations I45V and V46F did not increase Aβ42/Aβ40. Elevations of these long Aβ peptides from each of the 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by γ-secretase are due to lower efficiency in the first and/or second carboxypeptidase trimming steps, defined as the percent of Aβ peptide produced that is carried through the next processing step (Fig. S3). Aβ42 has been long accepted to be the pathogenic Aβ variant in Alzheimer’s disease. This particular Aβ variant is the major component of the cerebral extraneuronal amyloid plaques that characterize the disease, and FAD mutations in APP and the presenilins can elevate the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. However, unambiguous identification of pathogenic assemblies of aggregation-prone Aβ42 and elucidation of neurotoxic mechanisms have been elusive. The recent finding that many presenilin-1 FAD mutations do not elevate Aβ42/Aβ40 (6Sun L. Zhou R. Yang G. Shi Y. Analysis of 138 pathogenic mutations in presenilin-1 on the in vitro production of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides by γ-secretase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E476-E485Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) raises further concerns about Aβ42 as an essential initiator of pathogenesis. Understanding how FAD mutations alter APP processing by γ-secretase requires a rigorous, comprehensive, and quantitative analysis of all proteolytic steps, but to date this has not been performed for any FAD mutations. Here we conducted such a study of 14 different FAD missense mutations in the APP TMD and found, surprisingly, that all these mutations led to elevated levels of Aβ peptides of 45- to 49-residues in length. Such elevations are due to deficient first and/or second trimming steps by γ-secretase. The direct measure of these long Aβ peptides is challenging, as there are no specific antibodies for any of them and they are difficult to detect and quantify by MS. We previously reported in a limited study that five FAD-mutant presenilin-1/γ-secretase complexes were deficient in carboxypeptidase activity (9Fernandez M.A. Klutkowski J.A. Freret T. Wolfe M.S. Alzheimer presenilin-1 mutations dramatically reduce trimming of long amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) by γ-secretase to increase 42-to-40-residue Aβ.J. Biol.

However, detecting Aβ45 through Aβ49 required long, hand-cast urea-PAGE systems and western blotting that were difficult to quantify and did not separate Aβ peptides of 46 residues and longer. Moreover, many FAD mutations in the APP TMD lead to mutant forms of these long Aβ peptides that would run aberrantly on gels (23Fernandez M.A. Biette K.M. Dolios G. Seth D. Wang R. Wolfe M.S.

The dynamic nature of protein folding necessitates constant surveillance to ensure the production of functional proteins (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M.

Errors in transcription, translation, or exposure to chemical or oxidative stress exacerbates protein misfolding (2Roodveldt C. Outeiro T.F. Braun J.E.A.

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is monitored during and after protein synthesis to promote refolding by chaperones or clearance of terminally misfolded proteins by either the ubiquitin proteasome system or autophagy (3Peters L.Z. Karmon O. David-Kadoch G. Hazan R. Yu T. Glickman M.H. Ben-Aroya S.

Components of protein quality control (PQC) work together to sense and ameliorate cellular stress caused by protein misfolding to maintain proteostasis. Recent studies have identified an age-associated decline in the quantity, capacity, and efficiency of PQC components (4Stroo E. Koopman M. Nollen E.A. Mata-Cabana A.

Thus, maintaining proteostasis is especially important in postmitotic cells such as neurons. This decline is often manifested by the occurrence of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, in which misfolded proteins accumulate and overwhelm proteostasis pathways (6Kaushik S. Cuervo A.M.

The formation of aggregates is observed in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (7Saudou F. Humbert S.

The morphology, localization, and composition of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases is complex and heterogenous. Aggregates can be seeded by protein or RNA-based mechanisms and arise in distinct cellular compartments (11Sontag E.M. Samant R.S. Frydman J. Mechanisms and functions of spatial protein quality control.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 (28489421): 97-12210.1146/annurev-biochem-060815-014616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Certain types of aggregates such as aggresomes and inclusion bodies are believed to be protective by sequestering misfolded proteins into a single structure for disposal (12Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Aggresomes protect cells by enhancing the degradation of toxic polyglutamine-containing protein.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12 (12651870): 749-75710.1093/hmg/ddg074Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the morphology of aggregates can be quite distinct and impacts the cellular response. For example, aggregates caused by C9orf72 gene expansions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis form ribbon-like structures that trap proteasomes and exclude ribosomes (13Guo Q. Lehmer C. Martínez-Sánchez A. Rudack T. Beck F. Hartmann H. Pérez-Berlanga M. Frottin F. Hipp M.S. Hartl F.U. Edbauer D. Baumeister W. Fernández-Busnadiego R.

In contrast, CAG (glutamine, Q) expansions in the huntingtin gene that form polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregates in Huntington's disease are fibrillar and exclude proteasomes (14Bäuerlein F.J.B. Saha I. Mishra A. Kalemanov M. Martínez-Sánchez A. Klein R. Dudanova I. Hipp M.S. Hartl F.U. Baumeister W. Fernández-Busnadiego R.

To study molecular mechanisms behind protein aggregation, in vitro models of protein aggregation have been crucial. Microscopy-based studies investigating cellular aggregates have identified numerous factors that regulate the formation and dissipation of these structures and have informed our understanding of disease (15Hao R.

Quantification of protein aggregates has therefore become a convenient and widely accepted measure of disease phenotype severity (18den Engelsman J. Garidel P. Smulders R. Koll H. Smith B.

Our survey of literature relevant to this area suggests that current approaches for quantifying protein aggregates are often focused on manual image analysis (19Park J. Park Y. Ryu I. Choi M.-H.

Notably, it is not always clear whether the images were analyzed in a blinded fashion (22Zhou X. Ikenoue T. Chen X. Li L. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Rheb controls misfolded protein metabolism by inhibiting aggresome formation and autophagy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Manual analysis of aggregates is typically limited to scoring a single cellular feature, such as, area, number, or localization of the aggregate. Such an approach is incapable of capturing multiple features at single-cell resolution from hundreds of images. Furthermore, because manual analysis often reports a population phenotype, it is unable to detect subtle differences in subpopulations of cells. Finally, manual image analysis is subjective, error-prone, and labor-intensive. An increasing number of automatic and semiautomatic image analysis software such as ImageJ and CellProfiler are available to evaluate fluorescence images (24McQuin C. Goodman A. Chernyshev V.

Machine learning algorithms are also increasingly used to aid in the analysis of multiparametric, complex cellular phenotypes (26Moen E. Bannon D. Kudo T. Graf W. Covert M. Van Valen D. Deep learning for cellular image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 (31133758): 1233-124610.1038/s41592-019-0403-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, incorporating various image analysis modules within these systems to create an analysis pipeline can be time-intensive and unintuitive. These disadvantages highlight a clear need for a user-friendly, flexible, high-throughput cellular image analysis method to quantify aggregates. To improve ease, precision, speed, and reproducibility of aggregate quantification, we developed AggreCount, a novel image-processing macro, using ImageJ as a platform, to process, analyze, and quantify images. This automated tool uses common stains for nuclei, cell bodies, and aggregates as input and quantifies aggregate number, area, and cellular localization on a cell-by-cell basis. In addition to delivering an unbiased analysis of images, this level of detail provides increased analytical depth and better evaluation of subtle phenotypes that may otherwise be overlooked. All processing steps use native ImageJ plugins and functions such that additional downloads or plugins are not necessary. Furthermore, this tool is written in the ImageJ macro language, which is more accessible to those with limited programming knowledge. We have used AggreCount to analyze and quantify a variety of cellular aggregates including aggresomes, stress granules, aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS), and Htt polyQ inclusions. AggreCount will permit researchers to carry out unbiased quantification of diverse protein aggregates and is particularly suited to high-content image-based screening approaches. The general workflow for analysis with the AggreCount macro involves three phases: assembling images, macro setup, and batch analysis. Images that will be analyzed as part of one experiment must be gathered into a single folder (the macro code and detailed instructions to run AggreCount are provided in Figs. S2 and S3). AggreCount is compatible with both common (e.g. TIFF, JPEG, etc.) and proprietary file formats commonly used in microscopy that are recognized by ImageJ. Each image must consist of one channel for nuclei and one for aggregate quantification. An optional third channel may be used for cell body identification. After images are compiled, the macro may be run to determine analysis settings (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). The setup will guide the user through selecting appropriate channels for each fluorophore, adjusting the threshold, determining appropriate size cutoffs for aggregates, nuclei, and cells, as well as the best processing strictness for cell bodies. The main settings window (Fig. S1A) allows further refinement of the macro options. Once the variables are set, the user may proceed to batch analysis for all images in the folder. The collected data are saved as tab-delimited text files that can be imported into Excel or another data analysis software. After selecting the folder of image files to be analyzed and selecting the “setup” option, the first image in the analysis folder will be opened. The user will be prompted to select the channel for the nuclei, aggregates, and cell bodies (Fig. 1A). For cell body segmentation, we recommend a dedicated channel using commercially available dyes such as CellMask; however, an antibody that detects a cytosolic protein (here we have used ubiquitin) works equally well. The user may also select the stack and frame from z-stacks or movies. AggreCount will use the selected slice and frame for that channel for every image processed. For z-stacks or movies, it may be preferable to collapse the image (e.g. average Z projection) before analysis for more consistent results, although in such instances the nuclear localization of aggregates should be carefully assessed. The user will then be prompted (“get image”) to select an appropriate threshold in the aggregate channel using the ImageJ threshold tool (Fig. 1B). AggreCount will continue to loop through the prompt to allow the user to open multiple images using the “get image” option and continue refining the threshold. It is suggested that for each analysis, at least one image with aggregates and one image without aggregates are used as positive and negative controls, respectively, to set the threshold. The final threshold parameter defined by the user will be applied to all images. Once the threshold is established, the user is prompted (“next step”) to open an image that will be processed for nuclei and aggregates using the previously established threshold. The size and distance of each aggregate from the nucleus will be displayed on the composite image (Fig. 1C). This allows the user to empirically determine appropriate size cutoffs for aggregates and distance limits to the perinuclear region. The final setup step allows the user to view three different levels of strictness for determining cell ROIs (levels 2.5, 5, and 7.5) as examples (Fig. 1D). The user may use one of these levels or any integer between 1 and 10 by entering that value into the “cell strictness” box in the main AggreCount settings window. The main AggreCount settings window allows for manual changes to each option (Fig. S1). The values defined by the user during the setup phase will be autopopulated in the settings window. The remaining values are default values and may be changed. Perinuclear distance is the pixel distance on either side of the nuclear ROI that defines the perinuclear zone. This setting may be useful for quantification of structures such as aggresomes that reside adjacent to the nucleus. User-defined variables are available to set the aggresome, aggregate, nucleus, and cell body size minimums in microns. Additionally, there is an option to set a maximum size for aggregates. The selected channel, slice, and frame for each structure to be analyzed will be displayed and may be changed manually. If there is no channel for cell bodies or if the analysis does not require the identification of cell bodies, the user should uncheck “Find cell bodies.” The macro will calculate distances but not assign aggregates to cells. Unchecking the “save results” option allows the macro to be run without any files being saved and may be useful when optimizing settings. Otherwise, the macro will create a new folder to save the result files. These results consist of summary text files: (i) summary analysis for all images (AC_analysis\dataset_summary.txt), (ii) all cells (AC_analysis\dataset_cells.txt), and (iii) all aggregates (AC_analysis\dataset_aggregates.txt). Additionally, a detailed results file ('FileName'_analysis.txt) and a .zip file containing cell, nuclei, and aggregate ROIs identified for each image will be saved. Finally, an explanation of each data field is saved as a text file “dataset_description” for users to reference. In batch mode, AggreCount will proceed to analyze each image in the analysis folder. Images will open in the background and will not be visible to the user. The status of the analysis may be monitored in the summary table. The nuclei can be visualized using standard dyes (4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, Hoechst, or DRAQ5, for example), and processing of nuclei images is minimal (Fig. 2A). The macro uses the “enhance contrast” function before subtracting background as a function of the mean pixel intensity. The proportion of the mean that is subtracted can be modulated by changing the “strictness” setting in the settings window. Then a median filter is applied to smooth the image while maintaining borders. Properly defined borders are critical for this analysis because the nucleus ROIs define subcompartments within the cell. The image is then thresholded using the “make binary” function followed by the “dilate” and “fill holes” functions. “Dilate” is used to better define the border of the nucleus because the intensity of the fluorescent stain is often reduced at the edges of nuclei causing the outermost portion to be excluded during the “make binary” function. The default method for processing aggregate images aims to enhance relatively small, bright puncta (Fig. 2B). The first step uses a crude background subtraction based on the mean pixel intensity of all areas with fluorescent signal to remove diffuse fluorescent noise. This is followed by isolating bright puncta using the difference of Gaussians approach (27Iwabuchi S. Kakazu Y. Koh J.Y. Harata N.C. Evaluation of the effectiveness of Gaussian filtering in distinguishing punctate synaptic signals from background noise during image analysis.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2014; 223 (24333471): 92-11310.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.12.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The image is then converted to 16-bit, and the threshold that was set previously is applied. This binary image is used with the “analyze particles” function to capture ROIs, which are filtered based on the previously set size criteria. To analyze aggregates at single cell resolution, AggreCount uses two methods for cell body processing: segmentation and thresholding (Fig. 2, C–E). The main difference between these methods is that segmentation defines a cell by the portion of the image that contains it, whereas thresholding aims to capture the cell as a ROI without any surrounding area. Segmentation (Fig. 2D) is often more accurate in differentiating cells that are in close proximity, whereas thresholding (Fig. 2C) provides information on the cell itself such as size and pixel intensity but may omit portions of cells or erroneously merge adjacent cells. The cell area may be an important metric if treatments collapse the cytoplasm, which may spatially restrict aggregates to the perinuclear zone. AggreCount provides both methods so the user may choose the appropriate one for their images. Images of differing cell density may require optimization of segmentation parameters so testing multiple images is good practice. Segmentation is achieved using the “find maxima” function that finds points of maximal fluorescent intensity in local areas in a merged image of the cell body and nucleus. This function utilizes a prominence setting that determines the trough required between maxima, which can be changed from the settings window using the cell body strictness option. After the maxima are determined, a pixel intensity-based watershed algorithm segments the image into a Voronoi diagram, which is used for ROI capture (Fig. 2, D and E). The cell thresholding method uses a process similar to that of the nuclei processing that enhances contrast, subtracts background as a proportion of the mean (that may be changed with the strictness option), and applies a median filter (Fig. 2C). If cell bodies are not stained, the user may deselect the “find cell bodies” option in the main settings window. The macro will proceed with localization analysis but will not be able to provide analysis on a cell-by-cell basis. Once nuclei and aggregate ROIs have been captured, AggreCount will proceed to calculate the distance between aggregates and nuclei (Fig. 3A, panels i and ii). These distances are used to spatially classify aggregates within the cell and are calculated based on all the pixel coordinates encompassing the perimeters of the aggregate and nucleus (Fig. 3A, panel iii). The distance of each coordinate of the aggregate is calculated for each coordinate of the nucleus perimeter using the distance formula (Fig. 3A, panel iv). If the “find cell bodies” option is unchecked, aggregate distance will be calculated from the nearest nuclei. This value is used to localize the aggregate within one of three subcellular compartments: cytosol, perinuclear zone, or nucleus (Fig. 3B). The user defines the distance by which the perinuclear zone is determined using the perinuclear distance option in the settings window. This value is calculated on either side of the nucleus. Any aggregate that is at least partially contained in this zone is categorized as perinuclear. Thus, aggregates classified as perinuclear can reside on either side of the nuclear envelope. We have specified the default value for perinuclear distance cutoff as 10 pixels for 60× magnification images; higher values may result in cytosolic and nuclear aggregates being classified as perinuclear. The cutoff value should be empirically adjusted for images of different magnification using control images that display the desired phenotype. Aggregates that are farther inside the nucleus are considered nuclear, and aggregates that are excluded from both the perinuclear zone and the nucleus are considered cytosolic. Cell segmentation is performed using a watershed algorithm; thus, cells with complex morphology are difficult to properly segment. Therefore, aggregates in cell types with long processes such as neurons cannot be effectively classified by cellular compartment using AggreCount unless aggregates occur solely in the cell body and nucleus. As can be seen in Fig. S1C, AggreCount is unable to effectively segment cells with long processes such as motor neurons. We present several examples of different cellular aggregates to demonstrate the versatility of AggreCount for their quantification. First, we quantified ubiquitin-positive aggresomes and aggregates that arise in cells upon proteasome inhibition. Aggresomes are perinuclear, membrane-delimited structures that form via retrograde trafficking of smaller cytosolic aggregates via the dynein motor (28Kopito R.R. Aggresomes, inclusion bodies and protein aggregation.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10 (11121744): 524-53010.1016/S0962-8924(00)01852-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). HeLa Flp-in TRex cells were treated with the reversible proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for 8 or 18 hr before being fixed and stained for ubiquitin and nuclei (Hoechst) (Fig. 4A). Images were analyzed using AggreCount. As shown in Fig. 4B, both time points have an increased number and size of aggregates compared with the untreated controls. The AggreCount analysis allows for the stratification of aggregates by subcellular location at single cell resolution. This deeper analysis reveals that the 18 hr treatment reduces the number of cytosolic aggregates while the number of perinuclear and nuclear aggregates remain stable (Fig. 4C). However, the size of the perinuclear aggregates greatly increases (Fig. 4, D and E). We asked how AggreCount compared with other methods used for aggregate quantification. As mentioned above, existing methods primarily involve manual analysis; therefore we determined how long it took for an experienced ImageJ user to manually analyze the same set of images as AggreCount. In addition, we also used an existing CellProfiler pipeline that counts cellular speckles. We found no significant difference in the findings between these two methods and AggreCount for analyzing the number of aggregates per cell (Fig. S4A). However, manual quantification required over an hour for image analysis, whereas both AggreCount and CellProfiler were able to analyze the same set of images in ∼90 s. Importantly, manual quantification and CellProfiler do not provide any information pertaining to the subcellular localization of aggregates. Thus, a significant advantage of AggreCount is the ability to spatially localize aggregates in a facile manner. Although sample preparation and good imaging practices yield the most robust analysis (see “Experimental procedures”), we find that the difference of Gaussians method used for thresholding aggregates enables AggreCount to be adept at overcoming image thresholding challenges such as uneven background illumination and image saturation (Fig. S4, B and C). Puromycin treatment causes premature chain termination during translation and the accumulation of defective ribosomal products (29Aviner R.

https://openalex.org/W3092456180,"Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be recapitulated in animals by administration of α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the brain. However, the mechanism by which these PFFs induce toxicity is unknown. Iron is implicated in PD pathophysiology, so we investigated whether α-synuclein PFFs induce ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death pathway. A range of ferroptosis inhibitors were added to a striatal neuron-derived cell line (STHdhQ7/7 cells), a dopaminergic neuron-derived cell line (SN4741 cells), and WT primary cortical neurons, all of which had been intoxicated with α-synuclein PFFs. Viability was not recovered by these inhibitors except for liproxstatin-1, a best-in-class ferroptosis inhibitor, when used at high doses. High-dose liproxstatin-1 visibly enlarged the area of a cell that contained acidic vesicles and elevated the expression of several proteins associated with the autophagy-lysosomal pathway similarly to the known lysosomal inhibitors, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1. Consistent with high-dose liproxstatin-1 protecting via a lysosomal mechanism, we further de-monstrated that loss of viability induced by α-synuclein PFFs was attenuated by chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 as well as the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitors, leupeptin, E-64D, and Ca-074-Me, but not other autophagy or lysosomal enzyme inhibitors. We confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy that heparin prevented uptake of α-synuclein PFFs into cells but that chloroquine did not stop α-synuclein uptake into lysosomes despite impairing lysosomal function and inhibiting α-synuclein toxicity. Together, these data suggested that α-synuclein PFFs are toxic in functional lysosomes in vitro. Therapeutic strategies that prevent α-synuclein fibril uptake into lysosomes may be of benefit in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3089023152,"Myelination plays an important role in cognitive development and in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), where failure of remyelination promotes permanent neuro-axonal damage. Modification of cell surface receptors with branched N-glycans coordinates cell growth and differentiation by controlling glycoprotein clustering, signaling, and endocytosis. GlcNAc is a rate-limiting metabolite for N-glycan branching. Here we report that GlcNAc and N-glycan branching trigger oligodendrogenesis from precursor cells by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α cell endocytosis. Supplying oral GlcNAc to lactating mice drives primary myelination in newborn pups via secretion in breast milk, whereas genetically blocking N-glycan branching markedly inhibits primary myelination. In adult mice with toxin (cuprizone)-induced demyelination, oral GlcNAc prevents neuro-axonal damage by driving myelin repair. In MS patients, endogenous serum GlcNAc levels inversely correlated with imaging measures of demyelination and microstructural damage. Our data identify N-glycan branching and GlcNAc as critical regulators of primary myelination and myelin repair and suggest that oral GlcNAc may be neuroprotective in demyelinating diseases like MS."

https://openalex.org/W3093180754,"Neutrophils are primary host innate immune cells defending against pathogens. One proposed mechanism by which neutrophils prevent the spread of pathogens is NETosis, the extrusion of cellular DNA resulting in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The protease neutrophil elastase (NE) has been implicated in the formation of NETs through proteolysis of nuclear proteins leading to chromatin decondensation. In addition to NE, neutrophils contain three other serine proteases that could compensate if the activity of NE was neutralized. However, whether they do play such a role is unknown. Thus, we deployed recently described specific inhibitors against all four of the neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). Using specific antibodies to the NSPs along with our labeled inhibitors, we show that catalytic activity of these enzymes is not required for the formation of NETs. Moreover, the NSPs that decorate NETs are in an inactive conformation and thus cannot participate in further catalytic events. These results indicate that NSPs play no role in either NETosis or arming NETs with proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3119619412,"Autophagy is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis through removing impaired organelles. It has recently been found to play pivotal roles in diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with increased bone fracture risk and loss of bone density. However, the mechanism whereby autophagy modulates DM-induced bone loss is not fully elucidated. Previous work has shown that 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) exerts positive effects on autophagy, thus affecting bone metabolism. Here, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in the regulation of diabetic bone metabolism. Using Micro-CT, Elisa, histology, and histomorphometry analysis, we demonstrated that 1,25D rescues glucose metabolism dysfunction and ameliorates bone loss in diabetic mice. In vitro, 1,25D alleviated primary osteoblast dysfunction and intracellular oxidative stress through reducing prolonged high-glucose-mediated excessive autophagy in primary osteoblasts, reflected by decreased protein level of Beclin1 and LC3. Of note, the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAP) ablated the positive effects of 1,25D in diabetic environment, leading to a marked increase in autolysosomes and autophagosomes, examined by mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling. The excessive autophagy induced by high glucose was deleterious to proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts. Additionally, biochemical studies identified that PI3K/Akt signaling could be activated by 1,25D, resulting in the inhibition of FoxO1. We confirmed that FoxO1 deficiency alleviated high-glucose-induced autophagy and improved biological functions of primary osteoblasts. Together, our results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway is involved in the osteoprotective effect of 1,25D by attenuating autophagy in diabetes, providing a novel insight for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-caused bone loss.

Diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic systematic disease, is rapidly growing in the whole world. Apart from some well-known complications of diabetes, the development of DM has also posed great threat to bone health, thus affecting quality of human life (1Schmidt A.M. Highlighting diabetes mellitus: The epidemic continues.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2018; 38: e1-e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Epstein S. Defeudis G. Manfrini S. Napoli N. Pozzilli P. Diabetes and disordered bone metabolism (diabetic osteodystrophy): Time for recognition.Osteoporos. Int. 2016; 27: 1931-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies have revealed that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are responsible for impaired bone turnover and remodeling, with enhanced bone metabolism disorders and even worse fracture outcomes (3Lecka-Czernik B.

The potential of 1,25D supplementation in the treatment of many disorders, for example, cancer, kidney diseases, has been well documented (5Dusso A.S.

Biol. 2018; 177: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There is growing literature demonstrating that vitamin D could be a drug candidate for DM since it has protective impacts on β-cell function, inflammatory response, and insulin secretion (7Mitri J. Pittas A.G. Vitamin D and diabetes.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2014; 43: 205-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Sacerdote A. Dave P. Lokshin V. Bahtiyar G. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and vitamin D.Curr. Diabetes Rep. 2019; 19: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also, the role of 1,25D in the osteogenesis under diabetic condition has generated substantial interest for its clear effects on bone metabolism. However, the underlying function of 1,25D and molecular signal transduction pathways involved remains largely unclear. Autophagy is a vital mechanism sustaining cellular homeostasis, which is involved in activating stress responses, removing impaired organelles, eliminating misfolded proteins, regulating growth, and renewing cellular development (9Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5253) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of autophagy is critical in various diseases, especially cancer, neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders (10Amaravadi R. Kimmelman A.C. White E. Recent insights into the function of autophagy in cancer.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1913-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 11Guo F. Liu X. Cai H. Le W.

Biological functions of autophagy genes: A disease perspective.Cell. 2019; 176: 11-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In addition, the potential relationship between autophagy and diabetes has been increasingly reported. It appears that autophagy might exert positive effects on maintaining insulin homeostasis due to its role in the regulation of β-cell differentiation and survival (13Marasco M.R. Linnemann A.K. β-Cell autophagy in diabetes pathogenesis.Endocrinology. 2018; 159: 2127-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). But research about the role of autophagy in nontargeted cells in diabetes, for example, osteoblastic cells, is limited, which encourages us to investigate the influences of autophagy on diabetic bone metabolism. Furthermore, whether 1,25D regulation in the osteoprotective process is related with autophagy in a high-glucose (HG) environment has not yet been fully established. Previous research has indicated that 1,25D could activate PI3K/Akt signaling transduction pathway to modulate cellular functions (14Lee C.T. Wang J.Y. Chou K.Y. Hsu M.I. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) modulates the effects of sublethal BPA on mitochondrial function via activating PI3K-Akt pathway and 17β-estradiol secretion in rat granulosa cells.J.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), as a kind of lipid kinases, plays a central role in many signal pathways and then affects cellular biology (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Guillermet-Guibert J. Graupera M. Bilanges B. The emerging mechanisms of isoform-specific PI3K signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Akt could be activated by PI3K via phosphorylation. Malfunction of PI3K/Akt signaling is partially required for the insulin resistance and oxidative stress, thus accelerating the progression of diabetes (17Huang X. Liu G. Guo J. Su Z.

Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) is a key transcription factor widely expressed in the bone tissues. In osteoblasts, it could mediate downstream genes participated in antioxidant response, differentiation, viability, and apoptosis (19Yao H. Yao Z. Zhang S. Zhang W. Zhou W.

Importantly, FoxO1 has been identified as one of the potential targets of Akt, which could be inhibited via phosphorylation process (22Saline M. Badertscher L. Wolter M. Lau R. Gunnarsson A. Jacso T. Norris T. Ottmann C. Snijder A. AMPK and AKT protein kinases hierarchically phosphorylate the N-terminus of the FOXO1 transcription factor, modulating interactions with 14-3-3 proteins.J. Biol.

Commun. 2015; 6: 6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Studies have suggested that suppression of FoxO1 improves the ability of insulin to maintain glucose levels. While insulin could promote the formation of osteoblasts and further inhibit the FoxO1 activity, highlighting the potential function of FoxO1 in coordinating bone turnover with glucose homeostasis (24I O.S. Zhang W. Wasserman D.H. Liew C.W. Liu J. Paik J. DePinho R.A. Stolz D.B. Kahn C.R. Schwartz M.W. Unterman T.G.

Med. 2012; 18: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Besides, FoxO1 is regarded as a crucial mediator contributing to the modulation of autophagy in various cells, such as cardiomyocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, thereby affecting multiple physiological and pathological processes (26Guo X. Lin H. Liu J. Wang D. Li D. Jiang C. Tang Y. Wang J. Zhang T. Li Y.

Transl. Med. 2018; 10eaan0746Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, FoxO1 might also play an important role in regulating autophagic activity in osteoblasts and then influencing osteogenic functions. Based on this evidence, this study aimed to explore the effects of 1,25D on autophagy in osteogenesis in vivo and vitro under diabetic situation and determine the role of FoxO1 in this process. We revealed herein that 1,25D could attenuate bone loss through alleviating diabetes-mediated excessive autophagy via PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway. In other words, 1,25D inhibited hyperglycemia-induced autophagy through FoxO1 inactivation, thereby enhancing differentiation and proliferation in HG-treated osteoblasts. Besides, overexpression of FoxO1 enhanced autophagic activity and disrupted the osteoprotective effects of 1,25D, but deletion of FoxO1 reversed these adverse influences on osteoblasts functions. Our results suggested novel perspectives of 1,25D treatment in maintaining normal bone metabolism during diabetes therapy. In vivo, wild-type (WT) mice were used. Firstly, we found that serum glucose level significantly increased and insulin decreased in DM group compared with the control group (Fig. 1A). To determine the level of our therapeutic 1,25D dose regime in mice, serum 1,25D concentration was tested 4 h after three consecutive times of administration. Results showed that serum level of 1,25D increased sharply in diabetic mice treated with 1,25D. And 1,25D reversed those negative effects caused by hyperglycemia in DM group and greatly enhanced the circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, we found that serum value of osteocalcin (Ocn) and alkaline phosphatase (Alp), the biomarkers of osteogenesis, were inhibited dramatically in DM group. But increased levels of Ocn and Alp were detected in DM-1,25D group, with statistical significances in contrast to DM group (Fig. 1B). To observe the effects of 1,25D on bone tissues, micro-CT analysis was applied to determine details of bone mass and microstructure. The 3D images from Micro-CT measurements displayed obvious bone loss of femurs in DM group (Fig. 1C). Compared with control group, diabetic mice showed a sharp decline in bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume per total volume (BV/TV), and mean trabecular number (Tb.N), yet a significant rise in mean trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), implying loss of bone mass and structural deterioration in DM group. Nevertheless, 1,25D treatment ameliorated changes in these parameters caused by diabetes, displaying increased BMD, BV/TV, Tb.N and decreased Tb.Sp (Fig. 1D). Also, HE and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining revealed that 1,25D rescued diabetes-induced bone loss in mice (Fig. 1E), with a remarkably reduced osteoclasts number induced by diabetes (Fig. 1F). Additionally, there were no statistical difference between Ctrl group and Ctrl-1,25D group in terms of bone trabecular parameters and serum values of markers tested above (Tables S1 and S2). These results indicated that 1,25D could ameliorate bone loss in diabetic mice. To explore the impacts of 1,25D on osteogenesis over diabetic hyperglycemia condition, primary osteoblasts were exposed to high concentration of glucose. CCK-8 assay is a rapid and highly sensitive test widely used to study cell proliferation. Number of viable cells was detected based on WST tetrazolium salt following the manufacturer’s instructions (CCK-8, Dojindo) (29Petrocca F. Visone R. Onelli M.R. Shah M.H. Nicoloso M.S. de Martino I. Iliopoulos D. Pilozzi E. Liu C.G. Negrini M. Cavazzini L. Volinia S. Alder H. Ruco L.P. Baldassarre G. et al.E2F1-regulated microRNAs impair TGFbeta-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in gastric cancer.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 272-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, CCK-8 test revealed that the proliferative activity of primary osteoblasts slightly increased when cells were cultured in high glucose at 1 day, but it was gradually suppressed as the incubation period prolonged, with a significant difference compared with control group at 7 days. However, 1,25D treatment rescued cell viability at 4 days and 7 days. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, which has been identified as a reflection of oxidative stress level in cells, displayed a prominent increase in HG group. But 1,25D downregulated ROS level markedly in HG-1,25D group, indicating its resistance to cellular redox imbalance caused by elevated glucose (Fig. 2B). ALP activity, Alp staining, and Alizarin Red staining were conducted to evaluate the differentiation potential of primary osteoblasts in HG environment. Results in Figure 2, C and F showed impaired osteogenic differentiation following HG treatment. Nevertheless, 1,25D attenuated this adverse impact on primary osteoblasts differentiation, showing higher ALP activity in HG-1,25D group than HG group. Also, exposure to high concentration of glucose led to fewer calcium nodules in medium after 21-day osteogenic induction, yet 1,25D treatment promoted the alizarin red-positive nodules, restoring the capacity of late osteogenic differentiation for primary osteoblasts (Fig. 2F). Besides, protein levels of Alp and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) decreased drastically in HG group, while 1,25D treatment led to enhanced expression levels of these markers (Fig. 2D). In accordance with the data above, the mRNA expressions of Alp, osteopontin (Opn), and Runx2 showed similar variations (Fig. 2E). In vivo, it was also found that Runx2 and Opn expressions exhibited consistent results as observed in vitro according to immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2G). These findings suggested that 1,25D could promote osteogenesis under diabetic hyperglycemia situations in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the effect of 1,25D on autophagy in primary osteoblasts, western blot analysis was performed to measure the protein expressions of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I. Beclin1, one of the most widely studied autophagy-related proteins, participates in many stages of autophagy including autophagosome formation, phagosome maturation, etc (30Cao Y. Klionsky D.J. Physiological functions of Atg6/Beclin 1: A unique autophagy-related protein.Cell Res. 2007; 17: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Levine B. Liu R. Dong X. Zhong Q. Beclin orthologs: Integrative hubs of cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and physiology.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As another mammalian autophagosome marker protein monitoring the autophagy activity, LC3 could transform into autophagosome-associated lipidated form (LC3II) from cytosolic nonlipidated form (LC3I) when autophagy was stimulated (32Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). First of all, we observed that Beclin1 expression and LC3II/LC3I ratio in primary osteoblasts were time-dependent following HG treatment. The longer HG treatment it took, the higher levels of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I were, suggesting enhanced autophagic activity caused by glycometabolism abnormality in primary osteoblasts (Fig. 3A). 1,25D treatment was then conducted in concentration gradient under HG condition. As displayed in Figure 3B, 1,25D downregulated Beclin1 expression and LC3II accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. That is, we found that 10 nM 1,25D was most effective and used for subsequent experiments. Then augmentation of Beclin1 and higher ratio of LC3II/LC3I were observed in HG group, but 1,25D supplementation reversed these negative effects notably, reflected by decreased Beclin1 expression and LC3II/LC3I ratio in HG-1,25D group (Fig. 3C). To further examine the role of autophagy in osteogenic function of primary osteoblasts exposed to HG, rapamycin (RAP), as the major agonist for autophagy, was used in this study. Cells were incubated with 100 nM RAP (Sigma). The level of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I ratio was enhanced dramatically when RAP was applied alone in primary osteoblasts cultured in HG environment. Although 1,25D could alleviate HG-mediated autophagic activity as the results described above, 1,25D treatment couldn’t mitigate elevated autophagy induced by RAP (Fig. 4, A and B). To better understand the underlying mechanism, we applied mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling to detect autophagic flux. Green fluorescent protein, known as GFP, was sensitive to acidic conditions of the lysosome lumen. Red fluorescent protein, in brief, RFP, was used to track autophagy-related protein LC3. The colocalization of green and red fluorescence displayed yellow puncta, which referred to autophagosomes. After lysosomes and autophagosomes fused and autolysosome formed, GFP would weaken even quench in this acidic microenvironment. Thus, only red fluorescence could be detected at this time and red spots indicated autolysosome. The increased number of yellow and red puncta reflected the enhancement of autophagic flux (33Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3355) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4C, 1,25D treatment reduced HG-mediated autophagic flux in primary osteoblasts, but this effect was counteracted by RAP, which dramatically increased red and yellow puncta, indicating a higher level of autophagic flux. Simultaneously, protein levels of Runx2 and Alp were inhibited when cells were exposed to HG, but improved under the treatment of 1,25D (Fig. 5A). However, the protein expression of these two osteogenic biomarkers decreased significantly when RAP was applied (Fig. 5A), accompanied by similar variations of mRNA expressions of Alp, Opn, and Runx2 (Fig. 5B). HG and RAP could both lead to a marked decrease in these mRNA expressions compared with the HG-1,25D group (Fig. 5B). For cell viability, CCK-8 assay revealed that 1,25D did not always exert positive effects at all time points. The significant differences were observed as time prolonged, especially at 4 days and 7 days, showing the protective role of 1,25D in HG-treated primary osteoblasts. However, RAP exacerbated inhibitory effects on the viability of primary osteoblasts (Fig. 5C). Based on these data, we speculated that 1,25D could attenuate HG-induced autophagy and thereby potentiate viability and osteogenic differentiation of primary osteoblasts. Also, we confirmed that excessive autophagy by RAP was detrimental to biological characteristics of primary osteoblasts.Figure 5Effects of excessive autophagy on osteogenic differentiation in high-glucose environment. A, protein expression levels of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) were tested by western blot analysis, n = 3.

Liu G. Guo J. Su Z. The PI3K/AKT pathway in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2018; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 34Wymann M.P. Zvelebil M. Laffargue M. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase signalling--which way to target?.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI3K/Akt signaling participates in the effect of 1,25D on the biological function of primary osteoblasts in HG environment, cells were pretreated in a 2-h incubation of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY29, 50 mol/l, Sigma). Given that 1,25D could induce a time-dependent Akt and FoxO1 phosphorylation as previously reported (35Xiong Y. Zhang Y. Xin N. Yuan Y. Zhang Q. Gong P. Wu Y. 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 promotes bone formation by promoting nuclear exclusion of the FoxO1 transcription factor in diabetic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 20270-20280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), relevant analysis was detected after a 2-h treatment of 1,25D. It was observed that p-Akt/Akt level increased when 1,25D was added in primary osteoblasts cultured in HG (p-Akt is the active form of Akt via phosphorylation), which implied that PI3K/Akt signaling was activated by 1,25D. However, p-Akt/Akt ratio declined measurably after LY29 was added. Meanwhile, the production of p-FoxO1, inactive form of FoxO1 via phosphorylation, was promoted appreciably in primary osteoblasts exposed to HG with 1,25D treatment. Then the ratio of p-FoxO1/FoxO1 increased, indicating that FoxO1 was restrained by 1,25D treatment, contrary to the results added with LY29 (Fig. 6A). Additionally, immunofluorescence assay showed that FoxO1 expression was enhanced and accumulated in nucleus in HG environment, while 1,25D inhibited FoxO1 activity and promoted its nuclear exclusion. The application of LY29 further increased the expression level of FoxO1, promoting the translocation of FoxO1 from cytoplasm to nucleus (Fig. 6B). Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress was reflected by the increased level of ROS. To further explore the role of ROS in the FoxO1 distribution under HG condition, primary osteoblasts were treated in a 2-h incubation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC, Sigma), a kind of known scavenger of ROS. And we detected FoxO1 distribution between the nucleus and the cytosol after 24 h. Consistent with the data above, HG led to the remarkably increased accumulation of FoxO1 in nucleus. When NAC was added, the shuttle of FoxO1 from nucleus to cytoplasm was promoted, suggesting that FoxO1 activity was suppressed when ROS production decreased (Fig. 6C). According to Figure 6D, results of real-time qPCR displayed the inhibitory effects of HG and LY29 on the mRNA levels of Alp, Opn, and Runx2, while 1,25D upregulated the expressions of these osteogenic markers and had a positive influence on osteogenic differentiation. And we found that autophagic activity in primary osteoblasts was repressed with 1,25D supplementation, yet enhanced by LY29 under HG condition, showing a higher level of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I ratio compared with other groups (Fig. 6E). These evidences indicated that PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway was involved in the osteoprotective effect of 1,25D treatment under HG condition, and oxidative stress might play a critical role in this process. To further investigate the function and mechanism of FoxO1 in the regulation of diabetic bone metabolism, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of FoxO1 (FoxO1Len) in primary osteoblasts was constructed. Also, conditional FoxO1 knockout primary osteoblasts (FoxO1KO) were isolated from KO mice and cultured. FoxO1 overexpression led to a remarkable increase of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I ratio in HG-treated primary osteoblasts following 1,25D treatment, while FoxO1 knockout exhibited opposite effects on these two autophagic markers (Fig. 7A). According to mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling analysis shown in Figure 7B, both 1,25D treatment and FoxO1 knockout could reduce HG-mediated enhanced autophagic flux, while FoxO1 overexpression led to a higher level of intracellular autophagic flux, showing more autolysosomes and autophagosomes in HG-treated primary osteoblasts. In contrast to HG-1,25D group, ALP activity decreased notably in HG-1,25D-FoxO1Len group, while it was potentiated in HG-1,25D-FoxO1KO group (Fig. 8A). According to CCK-8 assay, cell proliferation was promoted by 1,25D under HG condition. But it was impaired when FoxO1 overexpressed, which abrogated th"

We utilized a FRET approach to examine the kinetics of structural changes in the force-generating lever arm in myosin V. We directly compared the FRET results with single-molecule mechanical events examined by optical trapping. We introduced a mutation (S217A) in the conserved switch I region of the active site to examine how myosin couples structural changes in the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions with force generation. Specifically, S217A enhanced the maximum rate of lever arm priming (recovery stroke) while slowing ATP hydrolysis, demonstrating that it uncouples these two steps. We determined that the mutation dramatically slows both actin-induced rotation of the lever arm (power stroke) and phosphate release (≥10-fold), whereas our simulations suggest that the maximum rate of both steps is unchanged by the mutation. Time-resolved FRET revealed that the structure of the pre– and post–power stroke conformations and mole fractions of these conformations were not altered by the mutation. Optical trapping results demonstrated that S217A does not dramatically alter unitary displacements or slow the working stroke rate constant, consistent with the mutation disrupting an actin-induced conformational change prior to the power stroke. We propose that communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions of myosin assures a proper actin-binding interface and active site have formed before producing a power stroke. Variability in this coupling is likely crucial for mediating motor-based functions such as muscle contraction and intracellular transport.

Variability in this coupling is likely crucial for mediating motor-based functions such as muscle contraction and intracellular transport. Understanding how motor proteins such as myosin couple structural changes in their ATPase cycle with mechanical force is a fundamental question in biophysics. Indeed, the actomyosin ATPase mechanism is utilized for many different mechanical tasks in cells including muscle contraction, cell division, and organelle transport (1Hartman M.A. Spudich J.A.

The large family of myosins, which includes over 20 classes and more than 40 different human genes, is defined by a structurally conserved motor domain and uses a conserved ATPase cycle to convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work (2Heissler S.M. Sellers J.R. Various themes of myosin regulation.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 (26827725): 1927-194610.1016/j.jmb.2016.01.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E.

A detailed understanding of the structural and functional aspects of the myosin ATPase pathway will enhance our ability to utilize myosins as drug targets to treat various genetic and pathological diseases (5Trivedi D.V.

The lever arm hypothesis suggests that myosins generate force by coupling specific conformational changes in the active site to large conformational changes in the actin-binding and lever arm regions (4Robert-Paganin J.

The lever arm domain consists of a single α-helix that extends from the motor and binds a variety of calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. When myosin is bound to actin, its cytoskeletal track, the rotation of the lever arm can produce a power stroke that drives actin filament sliding or allows myosin to walk along actin filaments. A key question in the field is how does actin binding trigger the dramatic acceleration in the release of the products of ATP hydrolysis, specifically phosphate release, which can be accelerated over 1000-fold (9Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W.

There have been many approaches to addressing this question, including X-ray crystallography (4Robert-Paganin J. Pylypenko O. Kikuti C. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A.

The challenge is to integrate all of the results in the literature into a model that describes the sequence of events associated with actin-binding, lever arm rotation (referred to as the power stroke), and force generation (referred to as the working stroke). Structural studies have defined two main conformations of the lever arm, the pre–power stroke state, in which ATP or the products of ATP hydrolysis are tightly bound to the active site, and a post–power stroke state, in which ADP or no nucleotide is bound (16Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Structural and functional insights into the myosin motor mechanism.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39 (20192767): 539-55710.1146/annurev.biophys.050708.133751Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Crystallography results on myosin VI have provided insight into the phosphate release mechanism by demonstrating evidence of the escape route of phosphate through a phosphate tunnel or back door (17Llinas P. Isabet T. Song L. Ropars V. Zong B. Benisty H. Sirigu S. Morris C. Kikuti C. Safer D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. How actin initiates the motor activity of myosin.Dev.

Based on the crystallography studies, as well as other results in the literature, this group proposed that myosin binding to actin triggers structural changes in the active site that allow phosphate to be released through the back door. They propose that once phosphate is transitioned from the active site into the tunnel, strong actin binding and lever arm swing can occur and then finally phosphate leaves the tunnel into solution (4Robert-Paganin J. Pylypenko O. Kikuti C. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Force generation by myosin motors: a structural perspective.Chem. Rev. 2020; 120 (31689091): 5-3510.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this model, only when myosin is tightly bound to its track does it trigger the movement of the force-generating lever arm and allow the release of phosphate, a highly irreversible step in the absence of load. Consequently, studies that have directly measured the lever arm rotation by FRET in real time demonstrated that the power stroke occurs before the release of phosphate is observed (18Trivedi D.V. Muretta J.M. Swenson A.M. Davis J.P. Thomas D.D. Yengo C.M. Direct measurements of the coordination of lever arm swing and the catalytic cycle in myosin V.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, recent ultra-fast optical trapping studies on myosin II suggest that the power stroke and observed working stroke occur rapidly after attachment to actin, without any delay that might be caused by an intermediate with phosphate in the tunnel (21Woody M.S. Winkelmann D.A. Capitanio M. Ostap E.M. Goldman Y.E.

Both models suggest that the power stroke and strong actin binding are tightly coupled. There are several key questions that remain to test current models. Foremost is defining structural changes in the active site that are triggered by attachment to actin and required for the power stroke and phosphate release. Carefully chosen point mutations designed to inhibit the lever arm rotation or phosphate release could provide a powerful test of these models. It is also unclear whether all myosins follow the same sequence of events or whether there are variations within the myosin family that are important for tuning myosins for their biological function. We have developed a method of measuring the rotation of the lever arm in myosin V in real time using FRET, which involves labeling myosin V containing a single IQ motif with FlAsH at its N terminus and exchanging QSY-labeled calmodulin at the first IQ motif (18Trivedi D.V.

We directly measured lever arm rotation in the recovery and power stroke steps of the myosin V ATPase cycle and found that the power stroke occurs in two steps: a rapid step that is faster than phosphate release and a slower step that occurs before ADP release (18Trivedi D.V.

In the current paper we use a point mutation in the conserved switch I region of the active site to demonstrate the coupling between the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions during the power stroke and phosphate release steps. We also characterized the impact of the mutation in single-molecule mechanics and kinetics in an optical trapping assay. Our results have led to a model suggesting that the transition from a weak-binding state to an initial force-bearing state requires structural changes in the active site and that these actin-induced structural changes are crucial for triggering the power stroke. Thus, generating the myosin power stroke requires priming the key structural elements for force generation; actin-binding region, active site, and lever arm. The switch I region of the active site, which shares homology with other P-loop ATPases including kinesin and G-proteins, consists of a consensus motif (NXXSSR) (Fig. 1A) (23Kull F.J. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. The case for a common ancestor: kinesin and myosin motor proteins and G proteins.J. Muscle Res.

The measurements not involving FRET were done with unlabeled WT and S217A in KMg50 buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT), whereas the FRET measurements were performed with MV-F.QSY-CaM in KMg50 buffer with 1 mm TCEP instead of DTT. In our previous work we demonstrated that our fluorescence labeling strategy had a slight impact on steady-state ATPase and in vitro motility (<2-fold) because of a reduction in the ADP release rate constant, whereas other steps in the ATPase cycle were unchanged (18Trivedi D.V.

Open table in a new tab We performed transient and structural kinetic analysis to determine how the S217A mutation impacts the key structural and biochemical transitions in the myosin ATPase cycle. The data were analyzed based on the established kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) of the ATPase cycle also utilized in recent manuscripts (18Trivedi D.V. Muretta J.M. Swenson A.M. Davis J.P. Thomas D.D. Yengo C.M. Direct measurements of the coordination of lever arm swing and the catalytic cycle in myosin V.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In Scheme 1, the rate constants going from left to right are indicated with a positive subscript (e.g. k+i), whereas those going right to left have a negative subscript (e.g. k−i). The rate of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the absence of actin was measured by mixing MV 1IQ with varying concentrations of ATP and monitoring the enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. S1). The data were fit to a hyperbolic function, and the maximum rate of tryptophan fluorescence change was determined, which is thought to report the ATP hydrolysis rate constant (k+H+k−H). The second-order binding constant for ATP binding to myosin can be obtained by determining the slope of linear portion of the curve a low ATP concentrations (K1Tk+2T). We found that S217A reduces the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis 40-fold while slightly enhancing the second-order binding constant for ATP binding to myosin (Fig. S1 and Table 1). ATP binding to myosin triggers movement of the lever arm into the pre–power stroke state (recovery stroke), which is important for priming myosin for force generation. The rate of the recovery stroke was examined by monitoring the FRET signal associated with the FlAsH-QSY donor–acceptor pair upon mixing MV-F:QSY-CaM with varying concentrations of ATP (Fig. 2, A–C). The FlAsH fluorescence increase was best fit to a two-exponential function at most ATP concentrations (Fig. 2C). The amplitude of the fast phase dominated the signal (90% or greater) in both S217A and WT. By fitting the fast and slow rate constants to a hyperbolic function, we determined that S217A increases the maximum rate of the fast recovery stroke rate constant (k+RCF) (Fig. 2A), whereas the slow phase of the recovery stroke (k+RCS) (Fig. 2B) was fairly similar to WT. Because the slower phase of the recovery stroke represents a small fraction of the total signal, we have not attempted to include this transition in our kinetic modeling. Myosin adopts a weak actin-binding conformation upon binding to ATP that dramatically weakens its affinity for actin. Pyrene actin is quenched when myosin is tightly bound to actin, and upon ATP binding there is an increase in pyrene fluorescence that can be used to monitor the rate of ATP binding and maximum rate of transition into the weak binding states (Fig. S2). In S217A the fluorescence transients were best fit to a two-exponential function, and the fast phase was ∼70% of the signal, whereas in WT most transients were single-exponential. We found that S217A decreases the maximum rate of ATP-induced transition into the weak binding states (k´+2T) (2-fold) and second-order rate constant (K´1Tk´+2T) for ATP binding (4-fold) (Fig. S2 and Table 1). The slower phase of the ATP-induced dissociation transients may be associated with an isomerization prior to ATP binding found in other myosins (30Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. Kinetic analyses of a truncated mammalian myosin I suggest a novel isomerization event preceding nucleotide binding.J. Biol.

The power stroke and phosphate release rate constants are accelerated when myosin with the products of ATP hydrolysis in the active site (M.ADP.Pi) binds to actin (Fig. 3). We performed sequential mix experiments to examine the actin-activated power stroke and phosphate release rate constants. We monitored the FRET signal upon mixing MV-F.QSY-CaM with substoichiometric ATP, allowing the reaction to age for 20 s and then mixing with varying concentrations of actin. The FlAsH fluorescence transients used to monitor the change in FRET were best fit by a two-exponential function (Fig. 3C). In WT, the fast and slow power stroke rate constants were hyperbolically dependent on actin concentration as we previously reported (18Trivedi D.V. Muretta J.M. Swenson A.M. Davis J.P. Thomas D.D. Yengo C.M. Direct measurements of the coordination of lever arm swing and the catalytic cycle in myosin V.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The fast and slow phases of the FRET transients were linearly dependent on actin concentration in S217A (Fig. 3B). Although the maximum rate of the fast power stroke was not determined for S217A, the actin dependence of the fast power stroke rate constant was found to be 20-fold slower in S217A than WT (KAssoc × kPWF = 0.9 ± 0.1 versus 19.4 ± 0.9 μm−1·s−1, respectively). Similarly, the slow power stroke was 5-fold slower at 30 μm actin in S217A compared with WT.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a common infectious disease caused by the infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). In a summary report from the World Health Organization in 2019, TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide (1WHO Global Tuberculosis Report. World Health Organization, 2019Google Scholar). As the pathogenesis of TB is very complex, it raises great difficulties in the precisely effective intervention of TB. Currently, pathogen-host interaction is an important hallmark for TB pathogenesis and progression. MTB invades host macrophages through various intercellular organelles to participate in various biological processes such as cellular energy metabolism, inflammatory response, and endocytosis. Inflammasomes consist of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) containing caspase-recruitment domains (CARD), NALPs (NACHT-LRRs) containing pyrin domains (PYD), and NAIPs (neuronal apoptosis-inducing protein) containing BIR domains (2Martinon F.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a molecular platform activated upon signals of cellular “danger” to trigger innate immune defenses through the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β (4Schroder K.

MTB infection associated with NLRP3 inflammasome requires the involvement of the bacterial virulence factor ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target) (10Mishra B.B. Moura-Alves P. Sonawane A. Hacohen N. Griffiths G. Moita L.F. Anes E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein ESAT-6 is a potent activator of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome.Cell Microbiol. 2010; 12 (20148899): 1046-106310.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01450.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). IL-1β plays a major role in host resistance to MTB (11Mayer-Barber K.D. Barber D.L. Shenderov K. White S.D. Wilson M.S. Cheever A. Kugler D. Hieny S. Caspar P. Nuñnez G. Schlueter D. Flavell R.A.

IL-1 receptor 1 is essential for IL-1–mediated signaling events in mycobacterial infection (12Sugawara I. Yamada H. Hua S. Mizuno S. Role of interleukin (IL)-1 type 1 receptor in mycobacterial infection.Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 45: 743-75010.1111/j.1348-0421.2001.tb01310.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggestive of a beneficial role of IL-1β in TB infectious diseases (13Mayer-Barber K.D. Andrade B.B. Oland S.D. Amaral E.P. Barber D.L. Gonzales J. Derrick S.C. Shi R. Kumar N.P.

Thus, how NLRP3 inflammasome is activated during MTB infection is important for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of TB. Currently, studies have unveiled the pivotal roles of mitochondria in the initiation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential couples with NLRP3 inflammasome activation (14Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469 (21124315): 221-22510.1038/nature09663Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two signals (15Bauernfeind F.G. Horvath G. Stutz A. Alnemri E.S. MacDonald K. Speert D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Monks B.G.

One is called initiator or primer that is activated through transcriptional regulation to induce NF-κB–dependent expression of both proIL-1β and NLRP3. Another is called activator by which NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and activated to release IL-1β. However, the underlying mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation are not well understood. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role in the priming step. Mitophagy blockade leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, and increases ROS production from mitochondria (14Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469 (21124315): 221-22510.1038/nature09663Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial membrane is involved in the initiation and regulation of an innate immune system (16Misawa T. Takahama M. Saitoh T. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites mediate innate immune responses.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2017; 997 (28815531): 187-19710.1007/978-981-10-4567-7_14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) are the membranes that mitochondria physically interact with ER. MAMs play key roles in material transfer and signal transduction including Ca2+ signaling. Inactivated NLRP3 proteins reside mostly on the ER. Stimulated by activators, NLRP3 and ASC colocalize with MAMs in the perinuclear region (14Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J.

Diacylglycerol rapidly accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and recruits protein kinase D. Protein kinase D at the Golgi contributes to ASC oligomerization, phosphorylation of NLRP3 at Ser-293, and release of NLRP3 from MAMs, resulting in the assembly of the mature NLRP3 inflammasome in the cytosol (17Zhang Z.

These molecular episodes suggest that MAMs may be the location of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), a mitochondrial outer membrane that regulates mitochondrial fusion within cells, facilitates the maintenance of cell homeostasis. MFN2 on the ER bridges ER and mitochondria by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic complexes with mitofusin 1 or 2 on the surface of mitochondria (18de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Mitofusin 2 tethers endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.Nature. 2008; 456 (19052620): 605-61010.1038/nature07534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Thus, MFN2 tethers ER to mitochondria implying that MFN2 participates in MAM establishment (18de Brito O.M. Scorrano L.

Under RNA virus infection, MFN2 interacts with NLRP3, promoting NLRP3 recruitment to mitochondria and subsequently IL-1β secretion (9Ichinohe T. Yamazaki T. Koshiba T. Yanagi Y.

U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24127597): 17963-1796810.1073/pnas.1312571110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown about the roles of mitochondria and MFN2 in MTB infection. Previous genome-wide association studies result and our study have shown highly expressed MFN2 in the TB group compared with the healthy control (HC) group (19Qi H. Zhang Y. Sun L. Chen C. Xu B. Xu F. Liu J. Liu J. Chen C. Jiao W. Shen C. Xiao J. Li J. Guo Y. Wang Y. et al.Discovery of susceptibility loci associated with tuberculosis in Han Chinese.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 (29036319): 4752-476310.1093/hmg/ddx365Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we first reported that mitochondrial MFN2 interacts and activates NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes IL-1β secretion upon MTB stimulation. To study the differential transcription profiling between TB patients and HCs, transcriptome microarray analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) from active TBs and HCs. All 18,853 mRNAs in the microarray were used to draw a heatmap of differential genes according to their expression levels. The genes that exhibited significant changes in expression were used for further validation. The TB group (n = 15) exhibited a significantly different profile compared with the HC (n = 15) group (Fig. 1a). A total of 1,595 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified between the two groups. Of these, 335 mRNAs were up-regulated (fold-change ≥ 2), and 1,260 mRNAs were down-regulated (fold-change ≥ 2). We next determined GO annotation to infer the functions of the 1,595 differentially expressed mRNAs, which were classified into three categories: cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The differentially identified mRNAs were subcategories into 35 hierarchically structured GO classifications (Table S1). The majority of mRNAs in the cellular component category had mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme complex and mitochondrial related function. The biological process category showed regulation of natural killer cell and cytokine production involved in inflammatory function. This result indicated that the identified mRNAs involved in these GO categories might imply the most important roles in the TB infection process. To obtain more information of the differentially expressed mRNAs, pathway analysis was conducted using KEGG. Using a standard of p < 0.05 and impact factor threshold >0, the pathway analysis results demonstrated that several immune response pathways such as NOD−like receptor signaling pathway, cytokine−cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathway were enriched (Table S2), suggesting that the immune response was significantly associated with MTB infection. The differentially expressed mRNAs between TBs and HCs were selected for rank function analysis to reveal the mRNAs with the prominent rank changes (△Rank) between two groups. By referring to our previous genome-wide association study result (19Qi H. Zhang Y. Sun L. Chen C. Xu B. Xu F. Liu J. Liu J. Chen C. Jiao W. Shen C. Xiao J. Li J. Guo Y. Wang Y. et al.Discovery of susceptibility loci associated with tuberculosis in Han Chinese.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 (29036319): 4752-476310.1093/hmg/ddx365Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and other published results (20Francisco N.M. Fang Y. Ding L. Feng S. Yang Y. Wu M. Jacobs M. Ryffel B. Huang X. Diagnostic accuracy of a selected signature gene set that discriminates active pulmonary tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases.J.

These differentially expressed mRNAs were grouped as a biomarker panel, which distinguished TBs from HCs (Fig. 1b) and were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1c). Heatmap images showed that hierarchical clustering of 15 identified mRNAs, where an increasing blue color shows increasing mRNA expression levels (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, from the differential mRNA expression profiling between TBs and HCs, a mitochondria outer member protein, MFN2, showed higher expression in TBs (Fig. 1, b and c). We calculated that MFN2 mRNA levels of 8 out of 15 TBs had 1.5-fold higher than the average MFN2 mRNA level of 15 HCs. The up-regulation of MFN2 during MTB infection has not been reported before, but is consistent with RNA virus infection (9Ichinohe T. Yamazaki T. Koshiba T. Yanagi Y. Mitochondrial protein mitofusin 2 is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation after RNA virus infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24127597): 17963-1796810.1073/pnas.1312571110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that MFN2 may take part in cell responses after pathogen infection. We further validated MFN2 mRNAs expression by real-time PCR and protein levels by immunoblotting in an independent sample set, which included additional 20 TB patients and 20 HCs. Total RNA and protein were extracted from PBMCs of active TBs and HCs. Our results showed that MFN2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in TB patients (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2a), and the protein levels of MFN2 increased in TB patients (Fig. 2, b and c). Taken together, this implies that MFN2 may play a role in MTB infection. To investigate whether MFN2 expression is induced after MTB challenge, we used two kinds of cells, PBMCs isolated from a healthy person and macrophages differentiated from the THP-1 cell line. These two kinds of cells were both stimulated by heat-inactivated MTB lysate and MTB antigen ESAT-6. We found that MFN2 expression was both up-regulated in PBMCs and THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages upon MTB stimulation (including MTB lysate and ESAT-6) and IL-1β secretion was increased (Fig. 2, d–f). These results are consistent with that ESAT-6 promotes the secretion of IL-1β from THP-1 macrophages (10Mishra B.B. Moura-Alves P. Sonawane A. Hacohen N. Griffiths G. Moita L.F. Anes E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein ESAT-6 is a potent activator of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome.Cell Microbiol. 2010; 12 (20148899): 1046-106310.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01450.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In addition to this, we also found that MTB lysate reacted as an inducer of IL-1β secretion. Likewise, we found that after ESAT-6 stimulation of the THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages, MFN2 protein levels and IL-1β secretion were increased in a time-dependent manner at the maximum 16 h post-stimulation (Fig. 2, g and h). These results suggest that MTB stimulation promotes the up-regulation of MFN2, further supporting our clinical observation of MFN2 increase in the TB group. To further investigate the involvement of mitochondria of macrophages during MTB stimulation, we conducted immunofluorescence analyses on THP-1 macrophages treated with MTB lysate or ESAT-6. Our results showed that after stimulation, the percentage of punctuated mitochondrial increased and a majority of mitochondria aggregated around the nuclei rather than dispersed in the cytosol (Fig. 3, a–d). We further investigated the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential after MTB stimulation in live cells. MitoTracker Red CMX Ros (red), which passively diffuses across the plasma membrane and accumulates in functional mitochondria, is an indicator of membrane potential. We observed that macrophage mitochondria were labeled by this dye and changed from string (thread) shape to dot or donut shapes after treatment with MTB lysate or ESAT-6, suggesting that the mitochondrial membrane potential was disrupted (Fig. 3, d–f). It has been reported that mitochondrial morphology and location changes are related to inflammatory responses. Here, we showed that MTB stimulation alters THP-1 macrophage mitochondria in both morphology and distribution. After stimulation, mitochondria changes from string shape to dot shape and aggregates (Fig. 3, a–g). Furthermore, TEM showed that the ultrastructure of mitochondria appeared in a hyperfusion pattern after MTB stimulation (Fig. 3, i–k). We speculated from these results that MTB stimulation causes mitochondria hyperfusion and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, which is consistent with a previous report (21Lebeau J. Saunders J.M. Moraes V.W.R. Madhavan A. Madrazo N. Anthony M.C. Wiseman R.L. The PERK arm of the unfolded protein response regulates mitochondrial morphology during acute endoplasmic reticulum stress.Cell Rep. 2018; 22 (29539413): 2827-283610.1016/j.celrep.2018.02.055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We then tested whether mitochondrial hyperfusion is caused by high expression of MFN2. THP-1 macrophages were transfected by a recombinant MFN2 plasmid to overexpress MFN2. We found that mitochondria had similar morphological changes from strings to dots with hyperfusion and aggregated around the nuclei (Fig. 3h). These data suggest that functional mitochondria and MFN2 may be involved in the inflammatory response upon MTB stimulation The inflammasome is a protein complex involved in the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β release. It has been reported that the MTB protein ESAT-6 is a potent activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (10Mishra B.B. Moura-Alves P. Sonawane A. Hacohen N. Griffiths G. Moita L.F. Anes E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein ESAT-6 is a potent activator of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome.Cell Microbiol. 2010; 12 (20148899): 1046-106310.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01450.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that MFN2 may be involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation upon MTB stimulation. Using immunofluorescence analyses in MTB-stimulated macrophages, in contrast to unstimulated macrophages, the localization of NLRP3 aggregated around the nuclei, and colocalization of NLRP3 (red) and MFN2 (green) in mitochondria was observed after stimulation. Under resting conditions (unstimulated macrophages), the majority of NLRP3 was mainly located in the cytosol of THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 3, l–n). The perinuclear accumulation of mitochondria upon stimulation is suggestive of inflammasome assembly and activation. This observation agrees with other studies to show NLRP3 inflammasome localization on mitochondria and MAMs (14Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469 (21124315): 221-22510.1038/nature09663Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Meszaros G. He W. Xu Y. de Fatima Magliarelli H. Mailly L. Mihlan M. Liu Y. Puig Gámez M. Goginashvili A. Pasquier A. Bielska O. Neven B. Quartier P. Aebersold R. et al.Protein kinase D at the Golgi controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 (28716882): 2671-269310.1084/jem.20162040Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that MFN2 participates in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome after MTB stimulation. To further define whether MFN2 is involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we conducted RT-qPCR and immunoblotting of cell lysates after MTB or ESAT-6 stimulation. As early as 6 h post-stimulation, NLRP3, MFN2, Caspase-1 p45, pro-IL-1β, and Caspase-1 p20 were up-regulated at protein expression levels, and at 16 h after stimulation their expression levels reached the highest except for that Caspase-1 p20 reached the highest protein expression level at 24 h (Fig. 4a). Also, we collected cell lysates after 16 h ESAT-6 stimulation and performed RT-qPCR to detect the inflammasome complex genes in the cell lysates of both stimulated and unstimulated groups. Two representative genes of the inflammasome complex (IL-1B, CASP-1) together with the MFN2 gene were significantly increased after ESAT-6 stimulation (Fig. 4, b–d). These results suggest that ESAT-6 and MTB stimulation may activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and MFN2 likely plays a role in this process. To confirm these observations, endogenous immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to monitor the interaction between MFN2 and NLRP3 in MTB-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. We collected cell lysates after 16 h MTB or ESAT-6 stimulation, endogenous NLRP3 was precipitated by antibodies to MFN2 in macrophages (Fig. 4e), suggesting the physical interaction between MFN2 and NLRP3. To further investigate whether MFN2 and NLRP3 function in a coordinated manner, we conducted siRNA MFN2 interference to knockdown MFN2 in THP-1 macrophages. Notably, MFN2 knockdown macrophages had a significantly reduced secretion of IL-1β and decreased active caspase-1 after being stimulated with MTB (Fig. 4, f and g). Collectively, these data suggest that MFN2 is required for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome after MTB stimulation. To further confirm the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human TB infection, PBMCs from 5 active TB patients and 5 healthy controls were isolated. The mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, CASP-1, and MFN2 were higher in the TB group (Fig. 5, a–d). Serum IL-1β levels in TBs were found significantly higher than HCs (Fig. 5e). These in vivo results confirm that MFN2 is required for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome after MTB infection. Using transcriptome analysis, we found higher expression of MFN2 in a subset of 15 genes, which is capable of distinguishing TB patients from healthy controls. Different TB-specific subsets have been revealed such as a panel of three genes (GBP5, DUSP3, and KLF2) (22Sweeney T.E. Braviak L. Tato C.M. Khatri P. Genome-wide expression for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis: a multicohort analysis.Lancet Respir. Med. 2016; 4 (26907218): 213-22410.1016/S2213-2600(16)00048-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and a combination of four genes (GBP1, IFITM3, P2RY14, and ID3) (23Maertzdorf J.

Med. 2016; 8 (26682570): 86-9510.15252/emmm.201505790Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A few of these differentially expressed genes (e.g. GBP5 and KLF2) in TB patients are reproduced in our cohort, suggesting that genetic background of different populations and other unknown factors may have an impact on the candidate genes inferred from transcriptomic studies (24Sarup P. Sørensen J.G. Kristensen T.N. Hoffmann A.A. Loeschcke V. Paige K.N. Sørensen P.

It has been shown that mitochondrion is involved in innate immunity. Pathogens modulate cellular pathways to adapt intracellular environment. The mitochondrial membrane protein MAVS plays an important role in the anti-virus pathway (25Subramanian N. Natarajan K. Clatworthy M.R. Wang Z. Germain R.N. The adaptor MAVS promotes NLRP3 mitochondrial localization and inflammasome activation.Cell. 2013; 153 (23582325): 348-36110.1016/j.cell.2013.02.054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Other mitochondrial membrane proteins may also be involved in regulating the host defense to pathogens (26Wang J.P. Rought S.E. Corbeil J. Guiney D.G. Gene expression profiling detects patterns of human macrophage responses following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 39 (14625100): 163-17210.1016/S0928-8244(03)00223-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that MFN2, a well-known mitochondrial fusion protein, is a newly defined mitochondrial protein that is involved in the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome during MTB stimulation, resulting in IL-1β secretion for host immune defense. Up-regulation of MFN2 can impair mitochondria dynamics and morphology through recruiting NLRP3 to mitochondria outer member. These observations agree with other reports on the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α after MTB infection (27Ragno S. Romano M. Howell S.

The chimeric protein comprises a calpain domain and a unique circularly permutated globin domain. ADGB expression levels are most abundant in mammalian testis, but its cell-type-specific expression, regulation, and function have remained unexplored.

Correlation analysis suggested coregulation of ADGB with FOXJ1, a crucial transcription factor of ciliogenesis. Investigating the transcriptional regulation of the ADGB gene, we characterized its promoter using epigenomic datasets, exogenous promoter-dependent luciferase assays, and CRISPR/dCas9-VPR-mediated activation approaches. Reporter gene assays revealed that FOXJ1 indeed substantially enhanced luciferase activity driven by the ADGB promoter. ChIP assays confirmed binding of FOXJ1 to the endogenous ADGB promoter region. We dissected the minimal sequence required for FOXJ1-dependent regulation and fine mapped the FOXJ1 binding site to two evolutionarily conserved regions within the ADGB promoter. FOXJ1 overexpression significantly increased endogenous ADGB mRNA levels in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. Similar results were observed upon RFX2 overexpression, another key transcription factor in ciliogenesis. The complex transcriptional regulation of the ADGB locus was illustrated by identifying a distal enhancer, responsible for synergistic regulation by RFX2 and FOXJ1.

Globins are small globular metallo-proteins consisting of about 150 amino acids, which comprise eight α-helical segments in a characteristic 3-over-3 α-helical sandwich structure. This conserved “globin fold” identifies them as members of a large protein superfamily. Globins contain a heme prosthetic group, by which they can reversibly bind gaseous ligands such as O2, CO, and NO. Historically, the familiar vertebrate O2-binding hemoglobin (HB), a tetramer of α- and β-globins, and the monomeric myoglobin (MB) were among the first proteins whose sequences and structures were determined already over 50 years ago. Genomic analyses have considerably altered and extended our view of the globin family in mammals, leading to the discovery of novel globin types such as neuroglobin (NGB) and cytoglobin (CYGB), which are expressed in nerve and fibroblast-like cells, respectively (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. A vertebrate globin expressed in the brain.Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 2Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Cytoglobin: A novel globin type ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate tissues.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Both globin types perform yet-to-be-illuminated functions, which possibly reside in antioxidant defense, reactive oxygen species signaling, or even lipid metabolism (3Burmester T. Hankeln T. Function and evolution of vertebrate globins.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2014; 211: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Keppner A. Maric D. Correia M. Koay T.W. Orlando I.M.C. Vinogradov S.N. Hoogewijs D. Lessons from the post-genomic era: Globin diversity beyond oxygen binding and transport.Redox Biol. 2020; 37: 101687Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel family of large, chimeric proteins containing a globin-like domain was discovered and termed androglobin (ADGB) based on its preferential expression in mammalian testis tissue (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ADGB is a chimeric protein of about 1500 amino acids, which contains an embedded globin domain. This globin domain is permutated with respect to its characteristic alpha helices and interrupted by a calmodulin-binding motif. Nevertheless, the globin domain appears to be able to bind oxygen in vitro (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of ADGB shows high sequence similarity to the human protease calpain 7, although functionally important amino acid residues are mutated. ADGB was shown to be highly conserved throughout the metazoan tree of life, and orthologous copies of the ADGB gene could be found from humans and other vertebrates down to very basal taxa such as the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, the placozoan Trichoplax adherens, and even the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which suggests an elementary and possibly conserved function in metazoans. ADGB is predominantly expressed in later stages of spermatogenesis in mammalian testes and, to a much lower extent, in the lung and brain tissue (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An important role of ADGB in spermatogenesis was supported by analysis of published microarray data revealing that endogenous levels of human ADGB mRNA were lower in the testes of infertile men versus their healthy counterparts. An in vitro cell culture study suggested that ADGB could act as an oncogene in glioma formation and an ADGB knockdown could inhibit the growth of glioma cell lines (6Huang B. Lu Y.S. Li X. Zhu Z.C. Li K. Liu J.W. Zheng J. Hu Z.L. Androglobin knockdown inhibits growth of glioma cell lines.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2014; 7: 2179-2184PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, studies on ADGB expression patterns and gene regulation were scarce, and the functional role of ADGB has remained elusive. Since the expressional profile of a gene, specifically addressing the organs and their cell types, can provide a valuable hint at its possible function (as illustrated e.g., by the specific presence of HB in erythrocytes), we revisited the expression patterns of ADGB using an integrative approach of bioinformatical data mining. In particular, novel RNA-Seq datasets from bulk and single-cell experiments were analyzed with the aim to recognize common patterns with functional implications. The data yielded valuable insight into the properties of ADGB-expressing cell types, which led us to characterize in detail the gene-regulatory landscape determining ADGB expression. We comprehensively mined epigenomic databases for accessible chromatin and promoter/enhancer-associated histone marks, identified transcription factors binding to the ADGB locus using reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, and further characterized several functional distal enhancers in the ADGB locus. Finally, we performed ADGB overexpression in vitro to elicit a cellular phenotype. These different lines of experimental evidence converged and convincingly pointed out that the cellular function of ADGB is associated with the presence of motile cilia. The wealth of gene expression data, which have been produced since the initial description of ADGB in 2012, enabled us to define a much more detailed expression profile of the gene in mammalian tissues and cell types. As such, the bulk RNA-Seq data of the Human Protein Atlas (7Uhlen M. Fagerberg L. Hallstrom B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson A. Kampf C. Sjostedt E. Asplund A. Olsson I. Edlund K. Lundberg E. Navani S. Szigyarto C.A. et al.Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) revealed the fallopian tube of the female reproductive tract as a novel expression site of ADGB mRNA (Fig. 1A). Transcript levels were even higher than in the lung, which was initially described as the second highest ADGB-expressing human organ (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To study this further, and noticing a shortage of data from healthy human samples, we evaluated bulk RNA-Seq data from the female reproductive tract of cattle. The bovine data sets confirmed Adgb expression in the oviducts, showing the highest amount of Adgb expression of all cattle organs analyzed, and in endometrial tissue (Fig. 1B). Human endometrial data appeared largely devoid of ADGB RNA, but sequencing data of separate stromal and epithelial fractions (8Altmae S. Koel M. Vosa U. Adler P. Suhorutsenko M. Laisk-Podar T. Kukushkina V. Saare M. Velthut-Meikas A. Krjutskov K. Aghajanova L. Lalitkumar P.G. Gemzell-Danielsson K. Giudice L. Simon C. et al.Meta-signature of human endometrial receptivity: A meta-analysis and validation study of transcriptomic biomarkers.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) revealed restriction of ADGB expression to the epithelial fraction only (Fig. S1). Both human and cattle RNA-Seq data revealed a high interindividual variability in expression intensity, which suggested a temporal and/or spatial restriction of Adgb expression in the female reproductive tract. To study the gene expression footprint of the hypothetical Adgb-expressing cell type involved, we subdivided the bovine endometrial samples into 2 groups, “Adgb-high” (TPM >20, n = 4) and “Adgb-low” (TPM <5, n = 4), and performed differential gene expression analysis to infer genes associated with either high or low levels of Adgb. Subsequent overrepresentation analysis (Table 1, Supplemental File 1) revealed that genes associated with high amounts of Adgb were connected to GO-terms such as “cilium and axoneme assembly”, “dynein-dependent microtubular transport”, “microtubular movement” and, interestingly, the “sperm flagellum.” An independent clustering approach to identify genes with an Adgb-type expression pattern using an additional data set of human fallopian tube samples (9Schuster H. Peper J.K. Bosmuller H.C. Rohle K. Backert L. Bilich T. Ney B. Loffler M.W. Kowalewski D.J. Trautwein N. Rabsteyn A. Engler T. Braun S. Haen S.P.

A. 2017; 114: E9942-E9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) generated a smaller subset of genes, which were even more strongly associated with cilia-related processes such as “cilium movement”, “determination of left-right-symmetry” and the “differentiation of lung epithelial cells” (Table 2, Supplemental File 2). Among these approximately 100 Adgb-associated genes, we found Foxj1, the master transcription factor of ciliogenesis (10Yu X. Ng C.P. Habacher H. Roy S. Foxj1 transcription factors are master regulators of the motile ciliogenic program.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and Dnah5, a protein known for its specific localization to motile cilia of the respiratory tract (11Whitfield M. Thomas L.

The tissue with the highest amount of Adgb expression, however, was inconsistent between the samples of the two species (Fig. 1, A and B). A possible explanation could be that the samples were at different stages of the menstrual cycle, given that ciliogenesis is estrogen-dependent (12Comer M.T. Leese H.J. Southgate J.

Additionally, depending on the part of the oviduct that was dissected, the ratio of epithelial cells to connective tissue and thus the overall number of ciliated cells may vary between samples (14Barton B.E.

Experimentally, we confirmed the fallopian tube and the endometrium as novel expression sites via RT-qPCR analysis in cattle. In addition, we also determined the amount of Dnah5 and Foxj1 mRNA in these samples (Fig. 1C). Foxj1 transcript levels showed a positive correlation with Adgb expression in the endometria and oviducts (R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.72, respectively). The association between Dnah5 and Adgb in the endometrium was even stronger (R2 = 0.93). Though not as prominent, there was also a significant positive correlation between expression of Adgb and Dnah5 in the oviducts (R2 = 0.74). Immunohistochemistry analysis further confirmed the localization of Adgb protein in the epithelia in the bovine endometrium and specifically in multiciliated cells in the oviduct (Fig. S2). We previously reported the lung to show the second highest Adgb mRNA expression, after the testes (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bulk RNA-Seq data from this tissue, however, led to inconclusive results with high interindividual variability and overall low levels of expression, or, as in some human samples, no expression at all (Fig. 1). Therefore, we considered analyzing available single-cell RNA-Seq data obtained from the murine lung (16Montoro D.T. Haber A.L. Biton M. Vinarsky V. Lin B. Birket S.E. Yuan F. Chen S. Leung H.M. Villoria J. Rogel N. Burgin G. Tsankov A.M. Waghray A. Slyper M. et al.A revised airway epithelial hierarchy includes CFTR-expressing ionocytes.Nature. 2018; 560: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To prove that this method was sensitive enough to detect Adgb mRNA expression, we first reanalyzed single-cell RNA-Seq data from murine testis (17Lukassen S. Bosch E. Ekici A.B. Winterpacht A. Characterization of germ cell differentiation in the male mouse through single-cell RNA sequencing.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 6521Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We could show that, in accordance with Hoogewijs et al. (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Adgb mRNA expression was restricted to later stages of spermatogenesis, where round spermatids differentiate into elongating spermatids and form the flagellum, a motile microtubular structure very similar to a motile cilium. Fully differentiated condensed spermatids, however, did not express Adgb mRNA anymore (Fig. S3). Following this proof of principle, we performed clustering analysis on single-cell RNA-Seq data sets from epithelial fractions of murine lungs (dataset from Montoro et al. (16Montoro D.T. Haber A.L. Biton M. Vinarsky V. Lin B. Birket S.E. Yuan F. Chen S. Leung H.M. Villoria J. Rogel N. Burgin G. Tsankov A.M. Waghray A. Slyper M. et al.A revised airway epithelial hierarchy includes CFTR-expressing ionocytes.Nature. 2018; 560: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)). This revealed a distinct entity of lung cells expressing Adgb. Using known cell-type markers from literature, and in accordance with our original report, we identified these cells as being multiciliated (Fig. 2). As we had observed in the correlation analysis on fallopian tube samples, Adgb expression correlated well with Dnah5 and Foxj1, although the overall number of Adgb-positive cells was lower. An additional round of clustering of these ciliated cells revealed no subtypes with noticeable differences in Adgb expression, so that we assume that Adgb-negative ciliated cells are due to dropout artifacts because of rather low endogenous levels of Adgb mRNA (Fig. S4). No Adgb expression was observed in progenitors of multiciliated cells, such as basal cells (Fig. 2). Cell subcluster 4 (Fig. S4) showed slightly lower levels of both, Adgb and Foxj1, but a higher amount of expression of the basal cell marker Aqp3 (16Montoro D.T. Haber A.L. Biton M. Vinarsky V. Lin B. Birket S.E. Yuan F. Chen S. Leung H.M. Villoria J. Rogel N. Burgin G. Tsankov A.M. Waghray A. Slyper M. et al.A revised airway epithelial hierarchy includes CFTR-expressing ionocytes.Nature. 2018; 560: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This could indicate that Adgb expression rises during differentiation and is rather associated with later stages of ciliogenesis or with a maintenance function in cells with already established cilia. Cells with multiple motile cilia are not only found in the airways and the reproductive tract, but also in the ventricles of the brain, where they maintain proper circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (reviewed in (18Spassky N. Meunier A. The development and functions of multiciliated epithelia.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). To obtain further evidence for a functional association of Adgb and motile cilia, and looking to explain the previously reported low expression in brain tissue (5Hoogewijs D. Ebner B. Germani F. Hoffmann F.G. Fabrizius A. Moens L. Burmester T. Dewilde S. Storz J.F. Vinogradov S.N. Hankeln T. Androglobin: A chimeric globin in metazoans that is preferentially expressed in mammalian testes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we reanalyzed single-cell RNA-Seq data from mouse brains enriched for ependymal cells and their neuronal progenitors (19Campbell J.N. Macosko E.Z. Fenselau H. Pers T.H. Lyubetskaya A. Tenen D. Goldman M. Verstegen A.M. Resch J.M. McCarroll S.A. Rosen E.D. Lowell B.B. Tsai L.T. A molecular census of arcuate hypothalamus and median eminence cell types.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As expected, we could specifically detect Adgb mRNA expression in fully mature ependymal cells, although only in a small proportion of cells (Fig. 3). In addition, a subpopulation of tanycytes (designated as “2”) showed a moderate amount of Adgb positive cells. GO term analysis of genes overrepresented in ependymocytes and tanycytes “2” again showed a high amount of cilia-associated genes (Fig. 3D). Further analysis revealed that Adgb-positive tanycytes belong to the α-subtype, whereas β-tanycytes were Adgb-negative. Although not multiciliated such as lung epithelial cells or ependymocytes, α-tanycytes can be biciliated with the motile 9 + 2 microtubule conformation, whereas β-tanycytes only form 9 + 0 immotile cilia, if any (20Mirzadeh Z. Kusne Y. Duran-Moreno M. Cabrales E. Gil-Perotin S. Ortiz C. Chen B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Sanai N. Alvarez-Buylla A. Bi- and uniciliated ependymal cells define continuous floor-plate-derived tanycytic territories.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data point at an association of Adgb with cilia formation and/or function and a possible regulation by Foxj1. Gene expression is determined to a great extent by epigenetics and regulatory elements at promoters. As information on this for ADGB is scarce, we first inspected data derived from the ENCODE consortium. ENCODE data illustrate that the upstream region surrounding the ADGB first exon displays strong DNase hypersensitivity, enrichment of the promoter histone mark H3K4me3, and substantial transcription factor occupancy, all indicating chromatin accessibility and suggesting putative promoter activity (Fig. S5). Furthermore, chromatin segmentation states coupled to HMM motifs suggest promoter activity of this region in six different cell lines. Additional analysis of epigenetic modifications typical of active chromatin regions showed that H3K4me3 was also enriched at this region in multiple additional cell lines. (Fig. S5). This epigenetic profile reflecting open chromatin is in striking contrast to the rather limited, cell-type-specific expression of ADGB (see Discussion). To experimentally explore the basal activity of the putative human ADGB promoter, several potential promoter fragments (431 bp, 1031 bp, and 1981 bp long and starting at −33 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site—TSS) were cloned in a pGL3-luciferase basic vector (Fig. 4A). Reporter gene assays were performed in three cell lines able to form cilia (21Gerdes J.M. Liu Y. Zaghloul N.A. Leitch C.C. Lawson S.S. Kato M. Beachy P.A. Beales P.L. DeMartino G.N. Fisher S.

Following transfection in HeLa and MCF-7 cells, moderate but consistent basal promoter activity could be observed (Fig. 4A). No substantial changes were seen in HEK293 cells. Based on screening of ENCODE-integrated ChIP-sequencing data for candidate promoter regulating factors, these vectors were cotransfected in HeLa cells and consistently increased ADGB promoter-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. S6A). Additional cotransfection experiments with increasing amounts of GATA-3 encoding plasmids indicated GATA-3-dependent regulation of the ADGB promoter in a dose-dependent way (Fig. S6B). Next, we employed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technology to activate transcription at the ADGB promoter. CRISPRa is based on a fusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) with the activation domains of three potent transcription factors, VP64, p65, and Rta (dCas9-VPR), which is targeted to a specific genom"
https://openalex.org/W3120575083,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of tau and amyloid-beta in the brain, and recent evidence suggests a correlation between associated protein aggregates and trace elements, such as copper, iron, and zinc. In AD, a distorted brain redox homeostasis and complexation by amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau may alter the isotopic composition of essential mineral elements. Therefore, high-precision isotopic analysis may reveal changes in the homeostasis of these elements. We used inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)-based techniques to determine the total Cu, Fe, and Zn contents in the brain, as well as their isotopic compositions in both mouse brain and serum. Results for male transgenic tau (Line 66, L66) and amyloid/presenilin (5xFAD) mice were compared with those for the corresponding age- and sex-matched wild-type control mice (WT). Our data show that L66 brains showed significantly higher Fe levels than did those from the corresponding WT. Significantly less Cu, but more Zn was found in 5xFAD brains. We observed significantly lighter isotopic compositions of Fe (enrichment in the lighter isotopes) in the brain and serum of L66 mice compared with WT. For 5xFAD mice, Zn exhibited a trend toward a lighter isotopic composition in the brain and a heavier isotopic composition in serum compared with WT. Neither mouse model yielded differences in the isotopic composition of Cu. Our findings indicate significant pathology-specific alterations of Fe and Zn brain homeostasis in mouse models of AD. The associated changes in isotopic composition may serve as a marker for proteinopathies underlying AD and other types of dementia.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for about two-thirds of the currently reported 50 million dementia cases worldwide. By 2050, about 152 million people are likely to be diagnosed with dementia. With a current cost of about a trillion US dollars a year (expected to double by 2030) and being a major cause of death, dementia is a growing global health concern that places a significant burden on societies and healthcare systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop interventions and treatments to reverse or at least slow down the progression of AD (1Gernot R. Jochen K. Grazyna N. Constantin K. Karima S. Dilyara L.

Kim S.J. Hong S. Kim Y. Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease utilizing amyloid and tau as fluid biomarkers.Exp. Mol. Med. 2019; 51: 1-10Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The pathology of AD involves the misprocessing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which results in the accumulation and buildup of soluble and fibrillar amyloid-beta (Aβ) and other metabolites (5Koss D.J. Jones G. Cranston A. Gardner H. Kanaan N.M. Platt B. Soluble pre-fibrillar tau and β-amyloid species emerge in early human Alzheimer’s disease and track disease progression and cognitive decline.Acta Neuropathol. 2016; 132: 875-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additionally, hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein, leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, composed of a truncated 100-amino acid fragment of tau (6Wischik C.M. Novak M. Edwards P.C. Klug A. Tichelaar W. Crowther R.A. Structural characterization of the core of the paired helical filament of Alzheimer disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Selective inhibition of Alzheimer disease-like tau aggregation by phenothiazines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Both tau and Aβ aggregation contribute to AD pathology, but hypotheses differ as to which of these is the primary causative factor (8Kametani F. Hasegawa M. Reconsideration of amyloid hypothesis and tau hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease.Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both are hallmarks of AD used for the ultimate postmortem confirmation of AD (4Lee J.C. Kim S.J. Hong S. Kim Y. Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease utilizing amyloid and tau as fluid biomarkers.Exp. Mol. Med. 2019; 51: 1-10Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous observations of hot spots of certain metals alongside tau/Aβ accumulation suggested that spatial or even mechanistic correlations exist between tau/Aβ and certain trace elements. Essential trace elements such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) have fundamental physiological roles in, e.g., enzymatic reactions, oxygen transport, and cellular signaling; their homeostasis is therefore crucial for proper functioning of the brain (9Michalke B.

However, more mechanistic studies indicate several possible pathways relating Cu, Fe, and Zn with AD pathology (18Bonda D.J. Lee H.-g. Blair J.A. Zhu X. Perry G.

We have used quadrupole-based and sector field inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for quantification of the total element contents of Cu, Fe, and Zn and multicollector sector field inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for measuring their isotope ratios (expressed as delta (δ) values) and demonstrated the traceable and precise determination of the total element contents and isotope ratios of Cu, Fe, and Zn. Mutant tau expressing mice showed a lighter isotopic composition of Fe (enriched in the lighter isotopes) in the brain and to a lower extent in blood serum, as well as higher Fe contents in the brain than matched wild-type (WT) mice. For the 5xFAD mice compared with controls, a trend toward a lighter Zn isotopic composition was observed in the brain tissue and blood serum. The results of this study may provide a step forward concerning the potential use of the Cu, Fe, and Zn isotopic information for diagnostic purposes and/or to achieve a more profound understanding of AD. Analytical methods applied in the different research facilities involved were evaluated and thereafter implemented for the traceable quantitative determination and for the accurate and precise isotopic analysis of Cu, Fe, and Zn in the brain tissue and blood serum of L66 and 5xFAD mice, as well as of their respective controls. The measurements undertaken and research facilities responsible are summarized in Table 1. Only SI-traceable data (here mass fractions) or data being traceable to the same internationally accepted source (accomplished via the use of delta values against internationally accepted isotopic reference materials) are metrologically comparable.

Details for mouse housing facilities, as well as for facilities conducting MS measurements are indicated. All animals were males. Given that diet is the major source of metal exposure and that mouse groups received different chows in the different housing facilities, the animals’ chow was also analyzed for its Cu, Fe, and Zn isotopic compositions. L66 mice and their NMRI wild-type (NMRI-WT) controls (housed at Charité) received the same chow (V1534-3) for the first 10 months, but between 10 and 12 months (time of sacrifice) L66 received a different chow with higher protein content (V1124–3) because they developed a considerable tremor. Total contents of Cu, Fe, and Zn in both types of chow were in line with the manufacturers’ data. However, their δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ67Zn, and δ68Zn values were significantly different from each other (Table S1). Conversely, 5xFAD mice and their C57BL6/J wild-type (BL6-WT) controls received the same chow during the whole experimentation period; the total contents of Cu, Fe, and Zn in this chow were in line with the manufacturers’ data. The total contents of Cu, Fe, and Zn in mouse brain (per wet tissue weight) were determined by sector field and quadrupole-based inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS and Q-ICP-MS, respectively). Since the amount of serum collected was insufficient for accurate quantification, only isotopic analysis was conducted (see below). Quantitative determination of the elements of interest in the brain tissue indicated that L66 mice had higher contents of Fe than NMRI-WT (p < 0.05, see Fig. 1 and Table S2A). Also for Cu and Zn, a higher content was observed in the brain tissue of L66 mice, though the increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.071 and p = 0.455, respectively). Post-hoc analysis (the chow was analyzed along with the mice brain and serum) of the metal contents in the diet of the animals did not suggest that differences in the metal contents of the diets were at the origin of these observations. Element quantification of 5xFAD brains (Fig. 1 and Table S2B) indicated significantly lower levels of Cu (p < 0.05), but a higher content of Zn in brain tissue of 5xFAD mice compared with BL6-WT (p < 0.01). The isotopic compositions of Cu, Fe, and Zn in the brain tissue and blood serum were compared at group levels and the results obtained, expressed as δ-values, are presented in Figures 2, 3 and 4 (detailed data in Tables S3 and S4).

https://openalex.org/W3091718821,"Pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) is a key glycolytic enzyme and transcriptional coactivator and is critical for tumor metabolism. In cancer cells, native tetrameric PKM2 is phosphorylated or acetylated, which initiates a switch to a dimeric/monomeric form that translocates into the nucleus, causing oncogene transcription. However, it is not known how these post-translational modifications (PTMs) disrupt the oligomeric state of PKM2. We explored this question via crystallographic and biophysical analyses of PKM2 mutants containing residues that mimic phosphorylation and acetylation. We find that the PTMs elicit major structural reorganization of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an allosteric activator, binding site, impacting the interaction with FBP and causing a disruption in oligomerization. To gain insight into how these modifications might cause unique outcomes in cancer cells, we examined the impact of increasing the intracellular pH (pHi) from ∼7.1 (in normal cells) to ∼7.5 (in cancer cells). Biochemical studies of WT PKM2 (wtPKM2) and the two mimetic variants demonstrated that the activity decreases as the pH is increased from 7.0 to 8.0, and wtPKM2 is optimally active and amenable to FBP-mediated allosteric regulation at pHi 7.5. However, the PTM mimetics exist as a mixture of tetramer and dimer, indicating that physiologically dimeric fraction is important and might be necessary for the modified PKM2 to translocate into the nucleus. Thus, our findings provide insight into how PTMs and pH regulate PKM2 and offer a broader understanding of its intricate allosteric regulation mechanism by phosphorylation or acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W3122737533,"Aberrant Notch activation has been implicated in multiple malignancies and the identification of NOTCH receptors and related pathways is critical for targeted therapy. In this study, we aim to delineate the most prominent dysregulated NOTCH receptor and comprehensively reveal its deregulation in gastric cancer (GC). In the four Notch members, NOTCH3 was found uniformly upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes in multiple GC datasets. siRNA-mediated NOTCH3 knockdown demonstrated antitumor effects by suppressing cell proliferation, inhibiting monolayer formation, and impairing cell invasion abilities. Its depletion also induced early and late apoptosis. NOTCH3 was confirmed to be a direct target of two tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-491-5p and miR-875-5p. The activation of NOTCH3 is partly due to the silence of these two miRNAs. Through RNA-seq profiling and functional validation, PHLDB2 was identified as a potent functional downstream modulator for NOTCH3 in gastric carcinogenesis. PHLDB2 expression demonstrated a positive correlation with NOTCH3, but was negatively correlated with miR-491-5p. Akt-mTOR was revealed as the downstream signaling of PHLDB2. The NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt co-activation was found in 33.7% GC patients and the activation of this axis predicted poor clinical outcome. GC cells treated with siNOTCH3, siPHLDB2, miR-491-5p, miR-875-5p, were more sensitive to Cisplatin and 5-FU. Taken together, the NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt cascade plays oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis and serves as a therapeutic target. Our study provided insights into Notch-mediated underlying molecular mechanisms and implied translational potential."
https://openalex.org/W3090206755,"Homologous recombination (HR) repairs DNA double-strand breaks using intact homologous sequences as template DNA. Broken DNA and intact homologous sequences form joint molecules (JMs), including Holliday junctions (HJs), as HR intermediates. HJs are resolved to form crossover and noncrossover products. A mismatch repair factor, MLH3 endonuclease, produces the majority of crossovers during meiotic HR, but it remains elusive whether mismatch repair factors promote HR in nonmeiotic cells. We disrupted genes encoding the MLH3 and PMS2 endonucleases in the human B cell line, TK6, generating null MLH3-/- and PMS2-/- mutant cells. We also inserted point mutations into the endonuclease motif of MLH3 and PMS2 genes, generating endonuclease death MLH3DN/DN and PMS2EK/EK cells. MLH3-/- and MLH3DN/DN cells showed a very similar phenotype, a 2.5-fold decrease in the frequency of heteroallelic HR-dependent repair of restriction enzyme-induced double-strand breaks. PMS2-/- and PMS2EK/EK cells showed a phenotype very similar to that of the MLH3 mutants. These data indicate that MLH3 and PMS2 promote HR as an endonuclease. The MLH3DN/DN and PMS2EK/EK mutations had an additive effect on the heteroallelic HR. MLH3DN/DN/PMS2EK/EK cells showed normal kinetics of γ-irradiation-induced Rad51 foci but a significant delay in the resolution of Rad51 foci and a 3-fold decrease in the number of cisplatin-induced sister chromatid exchanges. The ectopic expression of the Gen1 HJ re-solvase partially reversed the defective heteroallelic HR of MLH3DN/DN/PMS2EK/EK cells. Taken together, we propose that MLH3 and PMS2 promote HR as endonucleases, most likely by processing JMs in mammalian somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W3091110419,"Cancer cachexia is characterized by reductions in peripheral lean muscle mass. Prior studies have primarily focused on increased protein breakdown as the driver of cancer-associated muscle wasting. Therapeutic interventions targeting catabolic pathways have, however, largely failed to preserve muscle mass in cachexia, suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved. In pursuit of novel pathways, we used untargeted metabolomics to search for metabolite signatures that may be linked with muscle atrophy. We injected 7-week-old C57/BL6 mice with LLC1 tumor cells or vehicle. After 21 days, tumor-bearing mice exhibited reduced body and muscle mass and impaired grip strength compared with controls, which was accompanied by lower synthesis rates of mixed muscle protein and the myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic muscle fractions. Reductions in protein synthesis were accompanied by mitochondrial enlargement and reduced coupling efficiency in tumor-bearing mice. To generate mechanistic insights into impaired protein synthesis, we performed untargeted metabolomic analyses of plasma and muscle and found increased concentrations of two methylarginines, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, in tumor-bearing mice compared with control mice. Compared with healthy controls, human cancer patients were also found to have higher levels of ADMA in the skeletal muscle. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with ADMA impaired protein synthesis and reduced mitochondrial protein quality. These results suggest that increased levels of ADMA and mitochondrial changes may contribute to impaired muscle protein synthesis in cancer cachexia and could point to novel therapeutic targets by which to mitigate cancer cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W3092866699,"RecQ family helicases are highly conserved from bacteria to humans and have essential roles in maintaining genome stability. Mutations in three human RecQ helicases cause severe diseases with the main features of premature aging and cancer predisposition. Most RecQ helicases shared a conserved domain arrangement which comprises a helicase core, an RecQ C-terminal domain, and an auxiliary element helicase and RNaseD C-terminal (HRDC) domain, the functions of which are poorly understood. In this study, we systematically characterized the roles of the HRDC domain in E. coli RecQ in various DNA transactions by single-molecule FRET. We found that RecQ repetitively unwinds the 3'-partial duplex and fork DNA with a moderate processivity and periodically patrols on the ssDNA in the 5'-partial duplex by translocation. The HRDC domain significantly suppresses RecQ activities in the above transactions. In sharp contrast, the HRDC domain is essential for the deep and long-time unfolding of the G4 DNA structure by RecQ. Based on the observations that the HRDC domain dynamically switches between RecA core- and ssDNA-binding modes after RecQ association with DNA, we proposed a model to explain the modulation mechanism of the HRDC domain. Our findings not only provide new insights into the activities of RecQ on different substrates but also highlight the novel functions of the HRDC domain in DNA metabolisms."

Among these, subfamily 4 (GH5_4) contains numerous broad-selectivity endoglucanases that hydrolyze cellulose, xyloglucan, and mixed-linkage glucans. We previously surveyed the whole subfamily and found over 100 new broad-specificity endoglucanases, although the structural origins of broad specificity remained unclear. A mechanistic understanding of GH5_4 substrate specificity would help inform the best protein design strategies and the most appropriate industrial application of broad-specificity endoglucanases. Here we report structures of 10 new GH5_4 enzymes from cellulolytic microbes and characterize their substrate selectivity using normalized reducing sugar assays and MS. We found that GH5_4 enzymes have the highest catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of xyloglucan, glucomannan, and soluble β-glucans, with opportunistic secondary reactions on cellulose, mannan, and xylan. The positions of key aromatic residues determine the overall reaction rate and breadth of substrate tolerance, and they contribute to differences in oligosaccharide cleavage patterns. Our new composite model identifies several critical structural features that confer broad specificity and may be readily engineered into existing industrial enzymes. We demonstrate that GH5_4 endoglucanases can have broad specificity without sacrificing high activity, making them a valuable addition to the biomass deconstruction toolset."

Little, however, is known regarding its extracellular role in maintaining a non-supportive cancer microenvironment. Here, we show that BATF2 inhibits glioma growth and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) recruitment. Interestingly, extracellular vesicles (EVs) from BATF2-overexpressing glioma cell lines (BATF2-EVs) inhibited MDSCs chemotaxis in vitro. Moreover, BATF2 inhibited intracellular SDF-1α and contributes to decreased SDF-1α in EVs. In addition, BATF2 downregulation-induced MDSCs recruitment were reversed by blocking SDF-1α/CXCR4 signalling upon AMD3100 treatment. Specifically, detection of EVs in 24 pairs of gliomas and healthy donors at different stages revealed that the abundance of BATF2-positive EVs in plasma (BATF2+ plEVs) can distinguish stage III-IV glioma from stage I-II glioma and healthy donors. Taken together, our study identified novel regulatory functions of BATF2 in regulating MDSCs recruitment, providing a prognostic value in terms of the number of BATF2+ plEVs in glioma stage."

https://openalex.org/W3093331104,"Intrinsically disordered protein domains often have multiple binding partners. It is plausible that the strength of pairing with specific partners evolves from an initial low affinity to a higher affinity. However, little is known about the molecular changes in the binding mechanism that would facilitate such a transition. We previously showed that the interaction between two intrinsically disordered domains, NCBD and CID, likely emerged in an ancestral deuterostome organism as a low-affinity interaction that subsequently evolved into a higher-affinity interaction before the radiation of modern vertebrate groups. Here we map native contacts in the transition states of the low-affinity ancestral and high-affinity human NCBD/CID interactions. We show that the coupled binding and folding mechanism is overall similar but with a higher degree of native hydrophobic contact formation in the transition state of the ancestral complex and more heterogeneous transient interactions, including electrostatic pairings, and an increased disorder for the human complex. Adaptation to new binding partners may be facilitated by this ability to exploit multiple alternative transient interactions while retaining the overall binding and folding pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3092643383,"Identification of antibody-binding epitopes is crucial to understand immunological mechanisms. It is of particular interest for allergenic proteins with high cross-reactivity as observed in the lipid transfer protein (LTP) syndrome, which is characterized by severe allergic reactions. Art v 3, a pollen LTP from mugwort, is frequently involved in this cross-reactivity, but no antibody-binding epitopes have been determined so far. To reveal human IgE-binding regions of Art v 3, we produced three murine high-affinity mAbs, which showed 70–90% coverage of the allergenic epitopes from mugwort pollen–allergic patients. As reliable methods to determine structural epitopes with tightly interacting intact antibodies under native conditions are lacking, we developed a straightforward NMR approach termed hydrogen/deuterium exchange memory (HDXMEM). It relies on the slow exchange between the invisible antigen-mAb complex and the free 15N-labeled antigen whose 1H-15N correlations are detected. Due to a memory effect, changes of NH protection during antibody binding are measured. Differences in H/D exchange rates and analyses of mAb reactivity to homologous LTPs revealed three structural epitopes: two partially cross-reactive regions around α-helices 2 and 4 as well as a novel Art v 3–specific epitope at the C terminus. Protein variants with exchanged epitope residues confirmed the antibody-binding sites and revealed strongly reduced IgE reactivity. Using the novel HDXMEM for NMR epitope mapping allowed identification of the first structural epitopes of an allergenic pollen LTP. This knowledge enables improved cross-reactivity prediction for patients suffering from LTP allergy and facilitates design of therapeutics.

Mapping invisible epitopes by NMR spectroscopyJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 51PreviewDefining discontinuous antigenic epitopes remains a substantial challenge, as exemplified by the case of lipid transfer polyproteins, which are common pollen allergens. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by NMR can be used to map epitopes onto folded protein surfaces, but only if the complex rapidly dissociates. Modifying the standard NMR-exchange measurement to detect substoichiometric complexes overcomes this time scale limitation and provides new insights into recognition of lipid transfer polyprotein by antibodies. Full-Text PDF Open Access Interaction of antibodies with their antigen-binding sites (epitopes) is vital to maintain health but may also contribute to immunological diseases. To understand these interactions, determination of binding specificities and precise epitope localization is a crucial but not trivial task (1Abbott W.M. Damschroder M.M. Lowe D.C.

A reliable technique to investigate binding of an antigen with its respective antibody is X-ray crystallography. This, however, typically requires production and extensive testing of truncated antibody fragments that need to generate high-quality (co-)crystals (2Mirza O. Henriksen A. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N.

More recently, MS-based approaches have used hydrogen/deuterium exchange to reveal binding regions (4Willison L.N. Zhang Q. Su M. Teuber S.S. Sathe S.K. Roux K.H. Conformational epitope mapping of Pru du 6, a major allergen from almond nut.Mol.

Differences in exchange rates can be measured at the peptide mass level, but resolution is typically poor, because it mostly depends on the accessibility of proteolytic cleavage sites. Another option i.e. screening of immobilized synthetic peptides covering the entire antigen sequence is straightforward but limited to analysis of continuous, linear epitopes (6Garcia-Casado G.

A powerful technique for mapping protein interactions is NMR spectroscopy using chemical shift deviations (8Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73 (23962882): 1-1610.1016/j.pnmrs.2013.02.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, the large molecular size of the mAb-antigen complexes prevents a straightforward application. Analogous to X-ray crystallography, so far Fab fragments of the mAbs obtained by enzymatic cleavage are a typical prerequisite for analyses (9Simonelli L. Pedotti M. Bardelli M. Jurt S. Zerbe O. Varani L. Mapping antibody epitopes by solution NMR spectroscopy: practical considerations.Methods Mol.

However, Fab fragments often show low stability, and although the size of the Fab-antigen complex is still large and challenging for NMR measurements, it was successful in several cases. Typically, additional deuteration of the protein and special NMR techniques like TROSY experiments are required (10Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Attenuated T2 relaxation by mutual cancellation of dipole-dipole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy indicates an avenue to NMR structures of very large biological macromolecules in solution.Proc.

Whereas weak interactions typically with a fast-exchange regime can be well-analyzed, tight interactions with low koff rates are challenging. Moderately tight interactions involving large proteins can be studied by cross-saturation experiments like chemical exchange saturation transfer or dark-state exchange saturation transfer as long as there is sufficient exchange during the NMR experiment, ideally with exchange time scales between 10 ms and 1 s (17Fawzi N.L.

However, these methods rely on exchange between the free and the bound form, and they fail if the koff rates are much slower than a scan of the NMR experiment. For interactions with antibodies, deuteration of the 15N-labeled binding partner largely improves the performance (16Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. A novel NMR method for determining the interfaces of large protein-protein complexes.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (10700281): 220-22310.1038/73331Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Another strategy for tight interactions involves weakening of affinity e.g. by the use of detergents (15Ichikawa S. Takai T. Inoue T. Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Ogura K. Inagaki F. Hatanaka H.

However, such additions might influence the results, as the fold and stability of the antibody and antigen can be affected. NMR-detected H/D exchange has also been used for interaction mapping with antibodies, either based on directly observable fragments (19Gouda H. Shiraishi M. Takahashi H. Kato K. Torigoe H. Arata Y.

Considering all mentioned applications, we currently lack a straightforward, high-resolution method for determination of structural epitopes of antigens interacting very tightly with intact antibodies under native conditions. Identification of antibody-binding epitopes is required to efficiently study IgE cross-reactivity, design novel vaccines, and monitor allergen immunotherapies (22Pomes A.

At present, more than 100 tertiary structures of allergens have been solved, but information on their antibody-binding epitopes is very limited (23Pomes A. Chruszcz M. Gustchina A. Minor W.

So far, no information on the localization of antibody-binding sites accounting for the IgE (cross)-reactive epitopes of Art v 3 is available. Thus, Art v 3 serves as an excellent representative to study structural epitopes using high-affinity antibodies. For this purpose, we developed a novel NMR-based approach termed hydrogen/deuterium-exchange memory (HDXMEM). This method utilizes the equilibrium of free and mAb-bound protein, which results in reduced H/D exchange rates of antibody-bound regions due to a memory effect. To reveal antigen-antibody interaction at the residue level, murine monoclonal antibodies that covered relevant human IgE-binding epitopes of Art v 3 were used for mapping. Together with reduced antibody reactivity to Art v 3 epitope variants, distinct residues relevant for IgE binding and LTP cross-reactivity were determined. To generate mAbs, mice were immunized with recombinant Art v 3.0201 (for simplicity termed Art v 3). We produced the nontagged allergen using Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami cells enabling disulfide bond formation relevant for the LTP fold (25Wildner S. Griessner I. Stemeseder T. Regl C. Soh W.T. Stock L.G. Völker T. Alessandri C. Mari A. Huber C.G. Stutz H. Brandstetter H. Gadermaier G. Boiling down the cysteine-stabilized LTP fold—loss of structural and immunological integrity of allergenic Art v 3 and Pru p 3 as a consequence of irreversible lanthionine formation.Mol. Immunol. 2019; 116 (31654938): 140-15010.1016/j.molimm.2019.10.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The protein showed the correct identity and high purity (>98%) as verified by gel electrophoresis and MS (Fig. S1, A and B). Recombinant Art v 3 was subcutaneously administered six times, and murine spleens were harvested after 56 days (Fig. S1C). After generating hybridoma cells, single B cells were obtained by limiting dilution. Three clones with high affinity to Art v 3 were selected, and mAbs were purified using protein G columns (Fig. S1D). We finally obtained 10–12 mg of each Art v 3–specific IgG1 antibody (i.e. mAb I, mAb II, and mAb III). All mAbs efficiently bound the native protein in ELISA, whereas no reactivity was observed when Art v 3 was reduced and alkylated (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the obtained mAbs recognize structural epitopes on the disulfide bond–stabilized structure. To characterize the binding affinity between Art v 3 and the mAbs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) measurements. Highly comparable binding affinities ranging from 5.5 to 75.6 nm were observed with both techniques (Fig. 2). Recognition by mAb I generated a large enthalpy gain, but the binding had to overcome an entropic barrier (positive −TΔS). Interaction with mAb II again generated a smaller enthalpy gain than entropy gain, resulting in a very similar ΔG and thus KD compared with mAb I. Interaction with mAb III showed a slightly lower affinity and was mainly entropy-driven. These results suggest that despite similar affinities, the antibody-binding mechanisms on the molecular level must be quite different. Interestingly, the SAW data revealed extremely slow binding kinetics (Fig. S2A). Dissociation rate constants (koff) extracted from fitting the decay phases were in the range of 10−5 to 10−4 s−1 for the three mAbs, corresponding to half-lives on the order of several hours (Fig. S2B). To determine whether purified murine mAbs cover relevant human IgE-binding epitopes, we performed ELISAs using sera of 21 mugwort pollen–allergic patients. All sera were positive to Art v 3, whereas IgE binding to homologous LTPs revealed diverse and patient-specific sensitization patterns (Table S1). In ELISA, preincubation with mAb I reduced on average 90% (range 29–98%) of IgE binding. Both, mAb II and mAb III led to a decrease in IgE reactivity of around 70%. The specificity of the assay was verified using an unrelated mAb as control (Fig. 1B). Based on these data, our mAbs qualify as surrogate antibodies for mapping structural IgE-binding regions of Art v 3. To verify whether Art v 3 adopts the typical LTP fold in solution and to subsequently map epitopes on the amino acid level, we used NMR spectroscopy to sequence-specifically assign the backbone chemical shifts. This was achieved using recombinant 13C15N-labeled Art v 3 (Fig. S1, A and B) and standard triple-resonance experiments HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO (39Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments for the structure determination of proteins in solution employing pulsed field gradients.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

An extensive buffer exchange to phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, was required to obtain a homogeneous protein preparation, as judged from the 15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. S3) providing a protein fingerprint, in which every amino acid is represented by one signal. The chemical shift assignment determined at 298 K was used to predict the secondary structure of Art v 3 in solution (Fig. S4). Localization of α-helices is in agreement with regions determined in the crystal structure (PDB entry 6FRR), thus confirming the correct folding of this Art v 3 preparation in solution. To evaluate whether traditional NMR titration studies are feasible to map binding epitopes, as suggested by Razzera et al. (40Razzera G. Gadermaier G. de Paula V. Almeida M.S. Egger M. Jahn-Schmid B. Almeida F.C. Ferreira F. Valente A.P. Mapping the interactions between a major pollen allergen and human IgE antibodies.Structure. 2010; 18 (20696401): 1011-102110.1016/j.str.2010.05.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a series of 15N HSQC spectra was used to monitor the binding of the individual mAbs to the 15N-labeled allergen. This resulted in a gradual disappearance of Art v 3 signals, indicative of a slow exchange regime and a formed complex that was beyond the size limit of NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the disappearance of all NMR signals. Neither changes in peak positions nor changes in line widths were observed (Fig. S5), which could have been used for epitope mapping. Instead, the signal intensity of all NH signals decreased uniformly for all residues with increasing mAb concentration. In summary, interactions of Art v 3 with mAbs could not be mapped by traditional two-dimensional NMR titrations because no chemical shift perturbations or line broadening effects were observed. To map the functional epitopes of Art v 3 with the three intact mAbs in situ despite the tight binding and extremely slow koff rates, we developed an innovative approach based on H/D exchange. This overcomes the limitations of conventional H/D exchange measurements because such tight interactions between antigens and intact mAbs that are not directly detectable by NMR spectroscopy due to their large size, or rely on a tedious protocol of quenching the exchange and separating the antigen from the mAb for each time point (21Paterson Y. Englander S.W. Roder H.

Although Hdac3 functions within mesenchymal lineage skeletal cells are defined, little is known about Hdac3 activities in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In this study we conditionally deleted Hdac3 within Ctsk-expressing cells and examined the effects on bone modeling and osteoclast differentiation in mice. Hdac3 deficiency reduced femur and tibia periosteal circumference and increased cortical periosteal osteoclast number. Trabecular bone was likewise reduced and was accompanied by increased osteoclast number per trabecular bone surface. We previously showed that Hdac3 deacetylates the p65 subunit of the NF-κB transcriptional complex to decrease DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Hdac3-deficient osteoclasts demonstrate increased K310 NF-κB acetylation and NF-κB transcriptional activity. Hdac3-deficient osteoclast lineage cells were hyper-responsive to RANKL and showed elevated ex vivo osteoclast number and size and enhanced bone resorption in pit formation assays. Osteoclast-directed Hdac3 deficiency decreased cortical and trabecular bone mass parameters, suggesting that Hdac3 regulates coupling of bone resorption and bone formation. We surveyed a panel of osteoclast-derived coupling factors and found that Hdac3 suppression diminished sphingosine-1-phosphate production. Osteoclast-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate acts in paracrine to promote bone mineralization. Mineralization of WT bone marrow stromal cells cultured with conditioned medium from Hdac3-deficient osteoclasts was markedly reduced. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, type 1a1 collagen, and osteocalcin was also suppressed, but no change in Runx2 expression was observed. Our results demonstrate that Hdac3 controls bone modeling by suppressing osteoclast lineage cell responsiveness to RANKL and coupling to bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W3092901735,"Distinct cell types emerge from embryonic stem cells through a precise and coordinated execution of gene expression programs during lineage commitment. This is established by the action of lineage specific transcription factors along with chromatin complexes. Numerous studies have focused on epigenetic factors that affect embryonic stem cells (ESC) self-renewal and pluripotency. However, the contribution of chromatin to lineage decisions at the exit from pluripotency has not been as extensively studied. Using a pooled epigenetic shRNA screen strategy, we identified chromatin-related factors critical for differentiation toward mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Here we reveal a critical role for the chromatin protein, ARID4B. Arid4b-deficient mESCs are similar to WT mESCs in the expression of pluripotency factors and their self-renewal. However, ARID4B loss results in defects in up-regulation of the meso/endodermal gene expression program. It was previously shown that Arid4b resides in a complex with SIN3A and HDACS 1 and 2. We identified a physical and functional interaction of ARID4B with HDAC1 rather than HDAC2, suggesting functionally distinct Sin3a subcomplexes might regulate cell fate decisions Finally, we observed that ARID4B deficiency leads to increased H3K27me3 and a reduced H3K27Ac level in key developmental gene loci, whereas a subset of genomic regions gain H3K27Ac marks. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic control through ARID4B plays a key role in the execution of lineage-specific gene expression programs at pluripotency exit."

These processes are also controlled by Ca2+, and consequently, cross talk between these signals is considered likely. However, systematic quantitative evaluation has not yet been reported. To fill this gap, we constructed optogenetic tools to control the activity of small GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, Ras, Rap, and Ral) using an improved light-inducible dimer system (iLID). We characterized these optogenetic tools with genetically encoded red fluorescence intensity-based small GTPase biosensors and confirmed these optogenetic tools’ specificities. Using these optogenetic tools, we investigated calcium mobilization immediately after small GTPase activation. Unexpectedly, we found that a transient intracellular calcium elevation was specifically induced by RhoA activation in RPE1 and HeLa cells. RhoA activation also induced transient intracellular calcium elevation in MDCK and HEK293T cells, suggesting that generally RhoA induces calcium signaling. Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms linking RhoA activation to calcium increases were shown to be different among the different cell types: In RPE1 and HeLa cells, RhoA activated phospholipase C epsilon (PLCε) at the plasma membrane, which in turn induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The RhoA–PLCε axis induced calcium-dependent nuclear factor of activated T cells nuclear translocation, suggesting that it does activate intracellular calcium signaling.

Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily have been identified as molecular switches because they exist in two states, namely a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state (“ON”) and a guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state (“OFF”) (1Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. The Ras superfamily at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 2Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Signaling interplay in ras superfamily function.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These states are known to be regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) as activators and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) as inactivators. Rho and Ras subfamily small GTPases localize to the plasma membrane, respond to extracellular stimuli, and regulate a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation (1Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. The Ras superfamily at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 2Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Signaling interplay in ras superfamily function.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Several of these biological processes are also regulated by the universal second messenger ionic calcium (Ca2+) (3Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. The versatility and universality of calcium signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar, 4Cullen P.J. Lockyer P.J.

Thus, functional links must exist between the signaling pathways regulated by Rho/Ras family small GTPases and Ca2+. Small GTPases and Ca2+ share some downstream factors that are coordinately regulated. For example, RhoA and Ca2+ regulate myosin II activity via myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation (6Ikebe M.

J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In addition, small GTPases and Ca2+ are known to regulate each other’s functions. Specifically, many GEFs and GAPs are regulated both positively and negatively by Ca2+ (4Cullen P.J. Lockyer P.J. Integration of calcium and Ras signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Res. 2004; 1742: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and some small GTPases regulate intracellular calcium signaling by activating phospholipase C (PLC) (11Harden T.K. Hicks S.N.

Brown J.H. Holz G.G. Role of phospholipase Cε in physiological phosphoinositide signaling networks.Cell. Signal. 2012; 24: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PLC converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to two second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 reportedly binds to the IP3 receptor (IP3R) to release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This PLC-mediated calcium influx is the major calcium signaling pathway in nonexcitable cells. Despite the importance of cross talk between small GTPases and intracellular calcium, details of these processes remain poorly understood. In particular, assessment of the influence of small GTPases on intracellular calcium concentrations immediately after activation has been difficult because this activity cannot be directly controlled in cells. However, optogenetics has changed this situation over the last decade. Optogenetics is a pivotal tool for advancing cell biology because it enables the control of specific signaling molecules at high spatiotemporal resolution both in vitro and in vivo (13Toettcher J.E.

The optogenetic control of small GTPases was first reported by Hahn’s group (16Wu Y.I. Frey D. Lungu O.I. Jaehrig A. Schlichting I. Kuhlman B. Hahn K.M. A genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac controls the motility of living cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In their study, constitutively active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 were fused to the blue-light-excited light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 (LOV2) of phototropin from Avena sativa (17Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domains of the blue-light photoreceptor phototropin (nph1): Binding sites for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide.Proc. Natl.

Photoactivatable (PA)–Rac1 and PA–Cdc42 were inactive in the dark because of steric hindrance of effector-binding sites by the LOV2 domain. Blue light irradiation induces conformation changes in the alpha helix (Jα) that connects LOV2 domains to small GTPases, allowing them to bind effectors. However, this approach was difficult to optimize between “ON” and “OFF” states for other small GTPases.

We have constructed optogenetic tools to control the activity of six members of the Rho and Ras subfamily GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, Ras, Rap, and Ral) by light-inducing GEF translocation to the plasma membrane using the iLID system. Using these optogenetic tools, we examined small GTPase-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization for the first time. Unexpectedly, transient elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations was only induced by optogenetic RhoA activation. These RhoA-mediated calcium transients were observed in all cell types examined, but the molecular mechanisms were different among the cell types. Furthermore, we found that RhoA activated PLCε in RPE1 and HeLa cells, which induced intracellular calcium signaling. Specific control of Rho/Ras family small GTPase activity at high spatiotemporal resolution was achieved using optogenetic tools. Among the several light-inducible heterodimerization systems, we chose the iLID system because of the reasons that follow: (i) it is based on the AsLOV2 domain that can work without exogenously adding a chromophore to mammalian cells; (ii) iLID-SspB heterodimerization can be controlled by blue light with rapid on/off kinetics (seconds), which is suitable in controlling small GTPase activity at high spatiotemporal resolution; and (iii) the molecular weight of proteins is small, allowing high-level expression in cells and relative ease of establishing a lentivirus vector for stable cell lines. To evaluate the system, we first constructed an optogenetic tool to control RhoA activity (opto-RhoA; Fig. 1A). Similar to previous studies (23Wagner E. Glotzer M.

The CAAX motif of K-Ras (CAAXKras) was fused to the C terminus of iLID to induce its localization to the plasma membrane. Further, a nuclear export signal (NES) was inserted between mVenus and SspB to avoid nuclear colocalization, as originally reported (19Guntas G. Hallett R.A. Zimmerman S.P. Williams T. Yumerefendi H. Bear J.E. Kuhlman B. Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the single plasmid mVenus-SspB-LARG-DH, and iLID-CAAXKRas was linked with the cDNA of the self-cleaved P2A peptide. Therefore, the observation of mVenus fluorescence confirmed that both fragments were expressed. In the dark, mVenus-SspB-LARG-DH was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B, 458-nm light OFF). Blue light irradiation using a 458-nm laser induced iLID–SspB heterodimerization, which in turn induced the localization of LARG-DH to the plasma membrane, at which it could activate RhoA (Fig. 1B, 458-nm light ON). Then, we characterized this light-induced translocation using the mCherry version of opto-RhoA, in which mVenus was replaced with mCherry (Fig. S1). Blue light was irradiated using a laser line of confocal microscope, while imaging CFP (458-nm), GFP (488-nm), and YFP (515-nm) channels. Translocation occurred in a laser-power-dependent manner following irradiation with both 458- and 488-nm light, and a laser power of 2% was sufficient for maximum translocation (Fig. S1, A and B). Upon light irradiation, mCherry-SspB-LARG-DH rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane. After irradiation was terminated, the localization reverted within 1 min similarly as observed in the original iLID system (Fig. S1D) (19Guntas G. Hallett R.A. Zimmerman S.P. Williams T. Yumerefendi H. Bear J.E. Kuhlman B. Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Conversely, 515-nm irradiation at 1–2% laser power did not affect the localization of mCherry-SspB-LARG-DH (Fig. S1C). The use of 515-nm light with higher laser power (5 and 10%) of 515-nm light affected the localization in a laser-power-dependent manner. Next, we examined RhoA activation by opto-RhoA using a RhoA activity reporter, namely mCherry fused with the Rho-binding domain derived from the RhoA-specific effector rhotekin (mCherry-RBDrhotekin) (28Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. Rhotekin, a new putative target for Rho bearing homology to a serine/threonine kinase, PKN, and rhophilin in the Rho-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Opto-RhoA and mCherry-RBDrhotekin were transfected into HeLa cells, and cells were locally irradiated with a 458-nm laser (Fig. 1C and Video S1). During irradiation, mVenus-SspB-LARG-DH rapidly accumulated in the irradiated area, whereas mCherry-RBDrhotekin accumulated gradually (Fig. 1D). Their accumulation disappeared after irradiation was terminated. These data suggest that RhoA activity can be controlled spatiotemporally using opto-RhoA as previously reported (23Wagner E.

We next constructed optogenetic tools for five other members of Rho and Ras family GTPases (Rac1, Cdc42, Ras, Rap, and Ral) implicated in regulating intracellular calcium signaling (11Harden T.K.

Signal. 2012; 24: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), as well as empty control using the same system (Fig. 2A). LARG-DH of opto-RhoA was replaced with the GEF domains of specific GEFs for each small GTPase (see details in the Experimental procedure section). Most of these constructs were previously applied in optogenetic analyses (19Guntas G. Hallett R.A. Zimmerman S.P. Williams T. Yumerefendi H. Bear J.E. Kuhlman B. Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Veith I. Singh M.K. Fuhrmann L. De Beco S. Remorino A. Takaoka S. Palmeri M. Berger F. Brandon N. El Marjou A. Vincent-Salomon A. Camonis J. Coppey M. Parrini M.C. Ralb directly triggers invasion downstream ras by mobilizing the wave complex.Elife. 2018; 7: 1-23Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We named these optogenetic tools opto-X (X: target GTPase). To evaluate these optogenetic tools, we first assessed their light-induced translocation using mCherry versions of opto-GTPases (Fig. S2). Excluding opto-Rap, the constructs exhibited similar translocation kinetics both during and after blue light irradiation even though they exhibited different levels of translocation. Opto-Rap translocation was slower than other opto-GTPases, and it took approximately 50 s to reach maximum translocation. Next, to evaluate the functions of these tools, we employed genetically encoded red fluorescence intensity-based small GTPase biosensors (29Kim J. Lee S. Jung K. Oh W.C. Kim N. Son S. Jo Y.J. Kwon H.B. Do Heo W. Intensiometric biosensors visualize the activity of multiple small GTPases in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The biosensors consisted of a dimerization-dependent red fluorescent protein (ddRFP)B-fused Rho/Ras binding domain (RBD) and ddRFPA-fused small GTPases. When small GTPases were activated, their specific RBD interacted with small GTPases. Then, ddRFPA and ddRFPB formed a dimer that in turn increased their fluorescence intensity. Rac1, Cdc42, and HRas biosensors were already reported (29Kim J. Lee S. Jung K. Oh W.C. Kim N. Son S. Jo Y.J. Kwon H.B. Do Heo W. Intensiometric biosensors visualize the activity of multiple small GTPases in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, we constructed RhoA, Rap1A, and RalB biosensors in this study. RBDs were selected to align with the FRET biosensors of these small GTPases and/or baits for active GTPases GST-pull-down assay as follows: RBD derived from rhotekin for RhoA, RalGDS for Rap1A, and Sec5 for RalB. RhoA biosensor exhibited an increase in fluorescence intensity upon treatment of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and Rap1A and RalB biosensors exhibited that the same upon treatment of epidermal growth factor (EGF), thus confirming that these biosensors can monitor GTPases activities (data not shown). As expected, fluorescence intensity was significantly increased after blue light illumination in cells coexpressing opto-GTPases and the corresponding small GTPase biosensors (Fig. 2, C–H and S3). The changes in fluorescence intensity of H-Ras biosensor by opto-Ras were highly variable and the p-value was higher than others. Therefore, to evaluate the function of opto-Ras, we also performed ERK nuclear translocation assay, which is generally used to evaluate Ras activity (26Toettcher J.E. Weiner O.D. Lim W.A. Using optogenetics to interrogate the dynamic control of signal transmission by the Ras/Erk module.Cell. 2013; 155: 1422-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Zhang K. Duan L. Ong Q. Lin Z. Varman P.M. Sung K. Cui B. Light-mediated kinetic control reveals the temporal effect of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in PC12 cell neurite outgrowth.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e92917Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4). Opto-Ras induced ERK nuclear translocation significantly, although the variability was also large. This experiment confirmed that opto-Ras activates Ras as intended. Interestingly, both the activation and inactivation of Rho family small GTPases (Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42) occurred with similar speed as opto-GTPase translocation (Fig. 2, C–E). By contrast, the activation and inactivation of Ras family small GTPases (HRas, Rap1A, and RalB) were more gradual than those of Rho family small GTPases (Fig. 2, F–H). The activities of both HRas and Rap1A persisted even 20 min after the irradiation was terminated. We also examined the specificity of these tools (Fig. 2, C–H and Fig. S3 and S4) regardless of whether they activate other family members of small GTPases, especially for the same family members. Among these optogenetic tools, opto-Cdc42 activated both RhoA and Rac1 (Fig. 2, C and D and Fig. S3, A and B), although not in a statistically significant manner, and opto-Ras activated RalB (Fig. 2H and S3F). The activation for Rac1 by opto-Cdc42 was weaker than that by opto-Rac1. In addition, the activation of RhoA by opto-Cdc42 was more gradual than that by opto-RhoA. Meanwhile, the optogenetic activation of both Rac1 and RhoA by Cdc42 has been reported (22de Beco S. Vaidžiulytė K. Manzi J. Dalier F. di Federico F. Cornilleau G. Dahan M. Coppey M. Optogenetic dissection of Rac1 and Cdc42 gradient shaping.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31O’Neill P.R. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. Subcellular optogenetic activation of Cdc42 controls local and distal signaling to drive immune cell migration.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these results likely reflect indirect effects via Cdc42 activation rather than a specific process (see also the Discussion section). Conversely, RalB activation by opto-Ras was not surprising because Ral is a well-known downstream factor of Ras (2Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Signaling interplay in ras superfamily function.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In summary, all opto-GTPases could specifically activate their corresponding GTPases as intended. We monitored changes of intracellular calcium concentrations with a genetically encoded red fluorescent calcium indicator R-GECO1 that is known to detect physiological calcium changes as found during neural activity and muscle contraction (32Zhao Y. Araki S. Wu J. Teramoto T. Chang Y.F. Nakano M. Abdelfattah A.S. Fujiwara M. Ishihara T. Nagai T. Campbell R.E. An expanded palette of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators.Science (80-). 2011; 333: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Opto-GTPases and the calcium reporter R-GECO1 were transfected into human nontransformed (RPE1) and cancer (HeLa) cells. Changes of intracellular calcium concentrations induced by persistent activation of small GTPases were observed via confocal microscopy. Among the GTPases, only RhoA was identified to induce transient elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations in both RPE1 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, S5, and Video S2). We also tested a YA mutant of opto-RhoA (opto-RhoAYA) that possessed an LARG Y940A mutation that abolished GEF activity (33Martz M.K. Grabocka E. Beeharry N. Yen T.J. Wedegaertner P.B. Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) is a novel RhoGEF in cytokinesis and required for the proper completion of abscission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Opto-RhoAYA rarely induced calcium transients (1 out of 136 RPE1 cells and 0 out of 133 HeLa cells; Fig. 3C), confirming that calcium transients were induced by RhoA activation and not by blue light irradiation or by photoswitch translocation to the plasma membrane. Further, we examined RhoA-mediated calcium transients in MDCK and HEK293T cells. These cells also exhibited the calcium transients immediately after RhoA activation (30% and 41% of cells in MDCK (n = 50) and HEK293T (n = 52) cells, respectively; Fig. S5 and Video S2). Thus, all cells examined exhibited RhoA-mediated calcium transients. Of note, membrane blebbing, produced by actomyosin-mediated cellular contraction induced by RhoA activation (34Charras G.T. Ya"

The adipose tissue microenvironment drives specific metabolic reprogramming of adipose tissue macrophages, contributing to the induction of tissue inflammation. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a mitochondrial anion carrier, is thought to separately modulate inflammatory and metabolic processes in macrophages and is up-regulated in macrophages in the context of obesity and diabetes. Here, we investigate the role of UCP2 in macrophage activation in the context of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Using a myeloid-specific knockout of UCP2 (Ucp2ΔLysM), we found that UCP2 deficiency significantly increases glycolysis and oxidative respiration, both unstimulated and after inflammatory conditions. Strikingly, fatty acid loading abolished the metabolic differences between Ucp2ΔLysM macrophages and their floxed controls. Furthermore, Ucp2ΔLysM macrophages show attenuated pro-inflammatory responses toward Toll-like receptor-2 and -4 stimulation. To test the relevance of macrophage-specific Ucp2 deletion in vivo, Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl mice were rendered obese and insulin resistant through high-fat feeding. Although no differences in adipose tissue inflammation or insulin resistance was found between the two genotypes, adipose tissue macrophages isolated from diet-induced obese Ucp2ΔLysM mice showed decreased TNFα secretion after ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared with their Ucp2fl/fl littermates. Together, these results demonstrate that although UCP2 regulates both metabolism and the inflammatory response of macrophages, its activity is not crucial in shaping macrophage activation in the adipose tissue during obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Dynamic changes in tissue microenvironments can drive specific metabolic alterations in tissue-resident immune cells in an attempt to accommodate appropriate changes in immune cell functioning (8Loftus R.M.

It is well known that modifications in metabolic signatures are closely related to immune cell functioning, demonstrated for instance by pro-inflammatory immune cells that rely on glycolytic pathways (9Lachmandas E.

Activation of macrophages in the context of obese adipose tissue was found to lead to unique changes in the metabolic signature of these adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) (5Xu X. Grijalva A.

This “metabolic activation” of macrophages was also linked to functional changes, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines (10Boutens L. Hooiveld G.J. Dhingra S. Cramer R.A. Netea M.G. Stienstra R. Unique metabolic activation of adipose tissue macrophages in obesity promotes inflammatory responses.Diabetologia. 2018; 61 (29333574): 942-95310.1007/s00125-017-4526-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is clear that modifications in metabolic signatures are crucial for appropriate immune cell functioning, yet might also drive immune cell dysfunction (11O'Neill L.A.J. Kishton R.J. Rathmell J.

Hence, specific metabolic reprogramming of adipose tissue macrophages driven by the lipid-enriched adipose tissue microenvironment during obesity might contribute to increased adipose tissue inflammation. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial carrier protein belonging to the SLC25 family of transporters (12Bouillaud F. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Ricquier D. UCPs, at the interface between bioenergetics and metabolism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 (27091404): 2443-245610.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.04.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although UCP2 mRNA is widely expressed throughout different tissues in mice, UCP2 protein can only be detected in spleen, lung, stomach, adipose tissue, and isolated immune cells, including macrophages (13Pecqueur C.

Potentially, the presence of UCP2 protein in immune cell–rich tissues such as spleen, lung, and adipose tissue could largely be attributable to the infiltration of immune cells. UCP2 shows a 59% homology to its family member uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), known for robust uncoupling activity, although any uncoupling activity attributed to UCP2 is likely not physiological (12Bouillaud F.

Because of its involvement in both immune cell functioning and defining cellular metabolism of glucose versus fatty acids, UCP2 potentially provides an interesting target in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying immunometabolic reprogramming and activation of macrophages in the context of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. To investigate whether UCP2 plays a role in activation of adipose tissue macrophages, we first set out to determine the role of UCP2 in macrophages during inflammatory activation. Secondly, we evaluated the consequences of the absence of UCP2 in macrophages on the development of HFD-induced obesity and its complications including adipose tissue inflammation, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Our results reveal that UCP2 deficiency drives a distinct increase in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in activated macrophages. Furthermore, specific Ucp2 deletion attenuates pro-inflammatory activation in macrophages but does not alter the development of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. We compared the regulation of UCP2 in three adipose tissue macrophage models: ATMs isolated from mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) versus a low-fat diet (LFD) (10Boutens L. Hooiveld G.J. Dhingra S. Cramer R.A. Netea M.G. Stienstra R. Unique metabolic activation of adipose tissue macrophages in obesity promotes inflammatory responses.Diabetologia. 2018; 61 (29333574): 942-95310.1007/s00125-017-4526-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) co-cultured with obese versus lean adipose tissue; and human adipose tissue macrophages isolated from obese diabetic patients versus obese nondiabetic patients (33Dalmas E. Venteclef N. Caer C. Poitou C. Cremer I. Aron-Wisnewsky J. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Bayry J. Kaveri S.V. Clément K. André S. Guerre-Millo M. T cell–derived IL-22 amplifies IL-1β–driven inflammation in human adipose tissue: Relevance to obesity and type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2014; 63 (24520123): 1966-197710.2337/db13-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). In all three macrophage-related models, Ucp2 mRNA expression was up-regulated. Furthermore, after 10 to 16 weeks of HFD feeding in mice, Ucp2 expression was increased in the adipose tissue (Fig. 1B). These levels likely correspond with the influx of immune cells into the adipose tissue, because increased Ucp2 expression in the adipose tissue of HFD-fed versus LFD-fed (Ctrl) mice is mainly attributable to the stromal vascular fraction, including ATMs, and not to adipocytes (Fig. 1C). To be able to determine the role of UCP2 in regulating macrophage metabolism and activation in more detail, we generated mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of UCP2, using the Cre/loxP system coupled to the Lys2 (LysM) promoter, resulting in Ucp2ΔLysM mice and their floxed control littermates (Ucp2fl/fl). The myeloid-specific deletion of UCP2 significantly silenced protein expression of UCP2 in BMDMs derived from Ucp2ΔLysM mice compared with Ucp2fl/fl control mice (Fig. 1D) and resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward decreased Ucp2 mRNA expression in macrophage-rich tissues such as gonadal adipose tissue, spleen, and liver (Fig. 1E). To understand the impact of UCP2 on cellular metabolism, we used extracellular flux assays. Basal glycolysis (Fig. 2A) and maximal glycolytic capacity (Fig. 2B) were significantly increased in Ucp2ΔLysM versus Ucp2fl/fl macrophages, both during control conditions and during TLR4 agonist LPS-induced inflammation. Furthermore, relative mRNA expression of the glycolytic enzyme Pfkfb3 was increased in Ucp2ΔLysM macrophages after LPS treatment, as was the production of lactate (Fig. S2, A and B). Basal (Fig. 2C) and maximal (Fig. 2D) respiration were significantly increased in Ucp2ΔLysM macrophages compared with Ucp2fl/fl cells during control conditions, and only basal respiration followed this pattern after LPS-induced inflammation. Strikingly, fatty acid loading abolished all differences observed in basal and maximal glycolysis (Fig. 2, E and F) and respiration (Fig. 2, G and H) between Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl macrophages, in addition to abolishing differences in Cpt1a expression (Fig. S2C). Hence, UCP2 deficiency abolishes OA:PA-stimulated increases in glycolysis and maximal respiration. Obesity-induced low-grade adipose tissue inflammation is linked to inflammatory activation of macrophages in adipose tissue with an important contribution of TLR2 and TLR4 receptor activation in driving metabolic inflammation (34Könner A.C. Brüning J.C. Toll-like receptors: linking inflammation to metabolism.Trends Endocrinol.

To study the role of UCP2 in macrophage activation, we tested the inflammatory response of Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl macrophages toward TLR2 receptor agonist Pam3CysK (P3C) and TLR4 receptor agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on both a transcriptional and a functional level (Fig. 3, A–E and Fig. 4, A–D). Treatment for 6 or 24 h with either LPS or P3C significantly increased the mRNA expression and protein secretion of all measured cytokines. Although most differences were relatively subtle, the pro-inflammatory response was generally attenuated in Ucp2ΔLysM versus Ucp2fl/fl macrophages treated with LPS, illustrated by lower Il1b expression after 24 h and lower Il6 expression for both time points; Tnfa expression was not different (Fig. 4, A–C). For P3C, the differential effect was seen in Il1b expression for both time points. Accordingly, anti-inflammatory Il10 expression was mostly up-regulated in Ucp2ΔLysM compared with Ucp2fl/fl macrophages, whereas Il1ra was clearly up-regulated after 6 h following LPS stimulation (Fig. 3D). On protein level, macrophage-specific deficiency of UCP2 generally subtly decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα following LPS treatment while increasing IL10 secretion (Fig. 4, A–D).Figure 4Lack of UCP2 modulates cytokine secretion toward a less pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages.

Ucp2ΔLysM and their Ucp2fl/fl littermates were rendered obese and insulin resistant by being fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks, using a low-fat diet as control. No differences between the two genotypes were found in body weight gain (Fig. 5A), feed intake (Fig. 5B), or adipose tissue and liver weights (Fig. 5C and Fig. S3). Additionally, plasma levels of triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, cholesterol, adiponectin, and leptin did not show any differences between Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl mice (Fig. 5, D and E). Subsequently, we isolated adipose tissue macrophages from the Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl mice fed a high-fat diet. To compare these to macrophages that did not reside in a lipid-rich microenvironment, we additionally isolated macrophages from the peritoneum of these mice and measured the release of inflammatory cytokines of both types of macrophages unstimulated, or upon an inflammatory stressor (LPS). In the Ucp2ΔLysM adipose tissue macrophages, no decrease was found in IL6 (Fig. 6A), but a significant decrease was found in the levels of TNFα (Fig. 6B) and ILRa (Fig. 6D), and a similar trend for IL10 (Fig. 6C) after LPS stimulation. In contrast, both IL6 and TNFα levels remained unchanged in peritoneal macrophages isolated from Ucp2ΔLysM versus Ucp2fl/fl mice after ex vivo LPS stimulation (Fig. 6, E and F). Next, we assessed inflammation of total adipose tissue. Flow cytometry of the stromal vascular fraction derived from gonadal adipose tissue (gWAT) of obese Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl mice revealed that there was no relative difference in general (F4/80+) or pro-inflammatory (F4/80+CD11c+) macrophage populations between the two genotypes (Fig. 7A). Additionally, relative mRNA expression of macrophage markers Cd68 and Adgre1 (F4/90) did not differ significantly (Fig. 7B). Moreover, mRNA expression of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response of adipose tissue (Il1b, Tnfa, Il6, and Il10) was not found to be significantly altered between the genotypes (Fig. 7C), as was the release of IL6 and IL10 (Fig. 7D). The density of crownlike structures stained for macrophage marker F4/80 did not differ between obese adipose tissue from Ucp2ΔLysM versus their Ucp2fl/fl littermates (Fig. 7E and F). Also, no differences were found in the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in the liver, nor any differences in liver histology (Fig. S4, A–C). On a systemic level, we found no significant differences in either insulin tolerance (Fig. 8, A and B) or glucose tolerance (Fig. 8, C and D) in Ucp2ΔLysM and Ucp2fl/fl mice. Furthermore, nonfasted levels of both insulin and glucose did not differ significantly between the two genotypes after either low-fat or high-fat diet feeding (Fig. 8, E and F).Figure 8UCP2 deletion in macrophages does not impact systemic insulin or glucose tolerance. A–D, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (A and B) and oral glucose tolerance test (C and D) of Ucp2fl/fl and Ucp2ΔLysM mice fed an HFD for 16 weeks.

Here, we demonstrate that lack of UCP2 leads to an up-regulation of both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in macrophages, which is overruled after an influx of lipids. Furthermore, UCP2-deficiency specifically attenuates the macrophage response to inflammation, without impacting overall adipose tissue inflammation or systemic glucose homeostasis. The expression of UCP2 protein is not linked to mRNA expression levels because of translational regulation of UCP2 (16Hurtaud C. Gelly C. Bouillaud F. Lévi-Meyrueis C.

Previous work has shown that loss of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hey1 in mice causes abnormal fourth PAA development and lethal great vessel anomalies resembling congenital malformations in humans. However, how Hey1 mediates vascular formation remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that Hey1 in vascular endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells, played essential roles for PAA development and great vessel morphogenesis in mouse embryos. Tek-Cre–mediated Hey1 deletion in endothelial cells affected endothelial tube formation and smooth muscle differentiation in embryonic fourth PAAs and resulted in interruption of the aortic arch and other great vessel malformations. Cell specificity and signal responsiveness of Hey1 expression were controlled through multiple cis-regulatory regions. We found two distal genomic regions that had enhancer activity in endothelial cells and in the pharyngeal epithelium and somites, respectively. The novel endothelial enhancer was conserved across species and was specific to large-caliber arteries. Its transcriptional activity was regulated by Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo, but not by ALK1 signaling and other transcription factors implicated in endothelial cell specificity. The distal endothelial enhancer was not essential for basal Hey1 expression in mouse embryos but may likely serve for Notch-dependent transcriptional control in endothelial cells together with the proximal regulatory region. These findings help in understanding the significance and regulation of endothelial Hey1 as a mediator of multiple signaling pathways in embryonic vascular formation.

Despite these lines of evidence, it is not clear how these upstream signaling pathways control cell type specificity of the Hey family expression in various embryonic tissues. For example, Hey1 and Hey2 are mutually exclusive in the atrial and ventricular myocardium, whereas they look co-regulated in the atrioventricular canal and endocardium (3Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M.

Expression in the pharyngeal epithelium is observed only for Hey1, whereas that in the dorsal ganglion is specific to Hey2. Detailed analyses of transcriptional regulation are necessary to further dissect distinct and complementary roles of Hey family genes in different embryonic tissues. In this study, we generated Hey1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice and demonstrated that the Hey1 expression in endothelial cells was indispensable for proper pharyngeal arch artery (PAA) development and great vessel morphogenesis. We further performed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based enhancer screen and identified distal enhancers that were specific to different cell types with Hey1 expression. The novel endothelial enhancer possesses transcriptional activity recapitulating endogenous endothelial expression in large-caliber arteries downstream of Notch signaling. These data will provide important information to further understand Hey1 function and its regulatory mechanisms in cardiovascular development and disease. To clarify a cell type that requires Hey1 function for the great vessel formation, we generated a novel Hey1 cKO mouse line (Fig. S1). Hey1 is expressed in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells in developing vasculature (14Morioka T. Sakabe M. Ioka T. Iguchi T. Mizuta K. Hattammaru M. Sakai C. Itoh M. Sato G.E. Hashimoto A.

The Tek-Cre–mediated Hey1 deletion in endothelial cells caused abnormalities of great vessel structure, namely interruption of the aortic arch type B (IAA-B), right-sided aortic arch (RAA), and aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery (ARSA) at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) and postnatal day 0.5 (Fig. 1, A and B), which reproduced congenital anomalies observed in Hey1 null mice (15Fujita M. Sakabe M. Ioka T. Watanabe Y. Kinugasa-Katayama Y. Tsuchihashi T. Utset M.F. Yamagishi H. Nakagawa O. Pharyngeal arch artery defects and lethal malformations of the aortic arch and its branches in mice deficient for the Hrt1/Hey1 transcription factor.Mech. Dev. 2016; 139 (26577899): 65-7310.1016/j.mod.2015.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We did not detect morphological defects of the heart and signs of circulation failure in Tek-Cre–mediated cKO embryos. Micro-CT analysis clearly showed the three-dimensional image of unordinary running and branching of the aorta in cKO embryos with RAA at E18.5 (Fig. 1C and Movies S1 and S2). On the other hand, the Hey1 deletion in vascular smooth muscle cells did not affect great vessel morphogenesis (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicated that endothelial Hey1 expression was indispensable for the thoracic great vessel formation. IAA-B, RAA, and ARSA are all attributable to the fourth PAA defects at early developmental stages (42Barry A. The aortic arch derivatives in human adult.Anat. Rec. 1951; 111 (14894834): 221-23810.1002/ar.1091110207Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the structures of pharyngeal arches and PAAs of endothelial cKO embryos. In control embryos, third, fourth, and sixth PAAs were well-formed in corresponding pharyngeal arches by E10.5 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the disruption of endothelial tube structure was observed in fourth PAAs of endothelial cKO embryos at E10.5 and E11.5 (Fig. 2A), whereas the size and structure of pharyngeal arches were maintained. Pan-endothelial (Pecam1) and arterial endothelial (Nrp1 and Gja5) markers were clearly expressed in the disorganized vasculature (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Pecam1+ endothelial cells indicated that other endothelial marker genes were also expressed at normal levels in Hey1 cKO as well as null embryos (Fig. S2, A and B), suggesting that general endothelial cell differentiation was not compromised. Migration and distribution of neural crest–derived cells, which were marked with Tfap2a (AP2α) and Crabp1, were not altered by the Hey1 deficiency (Fig. S3, A and B); on the other hand, the expression of a smooth muscle marker Acta2 (α smooth muscle actin) was almost undetectable in the affected fourth PAA (Fig. 2C). These characteristics were identical to that in Hey1 null embryos (15Fujita M. Sakabe M. Ioka T. Watanabe Y. Kinugasa-Katayama Y. Tsuchihashi T. Utset M.F. Yamagishi H. Nakagawa O. Pharyngeal arch artery defects and lethal malformations of the aortic arch and its branches in mice deficient for the Hrt1/Hey1 transcription factor.Mech.

Great vessel anomalies occurred in some endothelial cKO mice but not in others (Fig. 1B), which was unrelated to the extent of Hey1 down-regulation because its mRNA level in Pecam1+ cells did not markedly vary among cKO embryos (Fig. S2A). As is generally accepted for other genetic models showing great vessel malformations (24Byrd N.A. Meyers E.N. Loss of Gbx2 results in neural crest cell patterning and pharyngeal arch artery defects in the mouse embryo.Dev.

Dyn. 2012; 241 (22674535): 1310-132410.1002/dvdy.23812Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is likely that endothelial Hey1 deficiency predisposes cKO mice to fourth PAA defects. cKO embryos retained ∼30% of Hey1 transcripts in the Pecam1+ endothelial cell population, whereas null embryos showed only negligible Hey1 mRNA expression (Fig. S2A). As described in its original paper (40Kisanuki Y.Y. Hammer R.E. Miyazaki J. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M. Tie2-Cre transgenic mice: a new model for endothelial cell-lineage analysis in vivo.Dev. Biol. 2001; 230 (11161575): 230-24210.1006/dbio.2000.0106Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), the Tek-Cre-mediated recombination of the Rosa allele was observed in all identifiable endothelial cells by E10.5 (Fig. S4); however, the Hey1 floxed allele should have relatively low efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination. There may be mosaicism of the Hey1 allele recombination, although it is difficult to examine it with single-cell resolution. Nevertheless, it is of note that even a partial reduction of endothelial Hey1 expression was enough to affect fourth PAA development. Considering the importance of endothelial Hey1 expression for proper vascular development, we attempted identification of tissue-specific enhancers for Hey1 transcription to understand how Hey1 expression was regulated during embryonic development. The BAC construct that encompassed ∼173 kb surrounding mouse Hey1 gene (−140 to +33kb) was used for F0 transgenic mouse LacZ reporter analysis (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) and Fig. S5 (A and B), the full-length BAC-LacZ reporter (designated as “a”) showed transcriptional activity that reproduced endogenous Hey1 expression in the cardiovascular system, pharyngeal epithelium, and somites at E9.5. A shorter reporter that lacked the −140 to −43 kb region (b) lost the activity in the atria, pharyngeal epithelium, and somites but was positive specifically in large-caliber arteries, including PAA, the dorsal aorta, and intersomitic vessels. On the other hand, the deletion without the −43 to −0.3 kb region (c) did not drive the reporter expression in these arteries, whereas it retained the activity in the pharyngeal epithelium and somites. These results suggested presence of multiple cis-regulatory regions for Hey1 transcription in different embryonic tissues. The BAC-LacZ reporter analysis located the pharyngeal/somitic enhancer to the region between −140 and −43 kb. Consistently, a 0.6-kb fragment in the −50 kb region showed robust enhancer activity in the pharyngeal epithelium and somites (Fig. S6A). The activity of full-length BAC-LacZ reporter was reduced by the lack of the 0.6-kb fragment selectively in these tissues, whereas that in the vasculature was maintained (Fig. S6A). In addition, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated excision of the corresponding area significantly decreased endogenous Hey1 expression in a tissue-specific manner (Fig. S6B), clearly indicating its sufficiency and necessity as a new pharyngeal/somitic enhancer. BAC-LacZ studies indicated that the endothelial enhancer was present between −43 and −0.3 kb (Fig. 3, A and B), and we further examined how endothelial Hey1 transcription was controlled in mouse embryos. It was previously reported that the HEY1 expression was synergistically activated by Notch and ALK1 signaling in endothelial cells (Fig. S7A) (34Larrivée B. Prahst C. Gordon E. del Toro R. Mathivet T. Duarte A. Simons M. Eichmann A. ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway.Dev.

Transcriptional activity driven by the proximal region (−0.5 to +0.2 kb) was up-regulated by the Notch 1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) expression and BMP9 treatment (Fig. 4A) in luciferase reporter assays, which was consistent with the previous finding using BMP6 (33Itoh F.

https://openalex.org/W3120372887,"<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a significant threat in both healthcare and industrial biofouling. Surface attachment of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is particularly problematic as surface association induces virulence and is necessary for the ensuing process of biofilm formation, which hampers antibiotic treatments. Previous efforts have searched for dispersal agents of mature biofilm collectives, but there are no known factors that specifically disperse individual surface-attached <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. In this study, we develop a quantitative single-cell surface-dispersal assay and use it to show that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> itself produces factors that can stimulate its dispersal. Through bioactivity-guided fractionation, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we elucidated the structure of one such factor, 2-methyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (MHQ). MHQ is an alkyl quinolone with a previously unknown activity and is synthesized by the PqsABC enzymes. Pure MHQ is sufficient to disperse <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> but the dispersal activity of natural <i>P. aeruginosa</i> conditioned media requires additional factors. Whereas other alkyl quinolones have been shown to act as antibiotics or membrane depolarizers, MHQ lacks these activities and known antibiotics do not induce dispersal. In contrast, we show that MHQ inhibits the activity of Type IV Pili (TFP) and that TFP targeting can explain its dispersal activity. Our work thus identifies single-cell surface dispersal as a new activity of <i>P. aeruginosa-</i>produced small molecules, characterizes MHQ as a promising dispersal agent, and establishes TFP inhibition as a viable mechanism for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> dispersal."

Capitalizing on this therapeutically, however, has been only moderately successful because of the relatively small magnitude of these differences and because cancers may further adapt their metabolism to evade metabolic pathway inhibition. Mice lacking the peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (Ehhadh) and supplemented with the 12-carbon fatty acid lauric acid (C12) accumulate the toxic metabolite dodecanedioic acid (DDDA), which causes acute hepatocyte necrosis and liver failure. We noted that, in a murine model of pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB) and in primary human HBs, downregulation of Ehhadh occurs in association with the suppression of mitochondrial β- and endosomal/peroxisomal ω-fatty acid oxidation pathways. This suggested that HBs might be more susceptible than normal liver tissue to C12 dietary intervention. Indeed, HB-bearing mice provided with C12- and/or DDDA-supplemented diets survived significantly longer than those on standard diets. In addition, larger tumors developed massive necrosis following short-term DDDA administration. In some HBs, the eventual development of DDDA resistance was associated with 129 transcript differences, ∼90% of which were downregulated, and approximately two-thirds of which correlated with survival in numerous human cancers. These transcripts often encoded extracellular matrix components, suggesting that DDDA resistance arises from reduced Ehhadh uptake. Lower Ehhadh expression was also noted in murine hepatocellular carcinomas and in subsets of certain human cancers, supporting the likely generality of these results. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of C12 or DDDA dietary supplementation that is nontoxic, inexpensive, and likely compatible with more standard chemotherapies.

The abundance of glycolytic intermediates provided by Warburg-type respiration is believed to serve as a ready source of the reducing equivalents, ribose sugars, nucleotides, and amino acids needed to sustain tumor growth. ATP production is also increased and may match or even exceed the levels attained by oxidative phosphorylation, the downregulation of which is a prominent feature of many cancers (8Diaz-Ruiz R.

We previously observed that murine models of pediatric and adult liver cancer, namely hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as their human counterparts, also remodel their metabolism and become more reliant on glycolysis than on fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Consistent with this, total mitochondrial mass and transcripts encoding virtually all enzymes in the mitochondrial-based β-FAO pathway are markedly downregulated (18Dolezal J.M. Wang H. Kulkarni S.

In addition to β-FAO, most cells also engage in the nonenergy-generating ω-oxidation of very long–chain fatty acids >20 carbons in length. However, an additional role of this pathway is to catabolize a significant fraction of lauric acid, the 12-carbon medium-chain fatty acid that is too small to be efficiently transported by the fatty acid carrier carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) and too large to enter mitochondria passively as do short-chain fatty acids. ω-oxidation initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum via reactions involving the cytochrome P450 members Cyp4a10 (CYP4a11 in humans) and Cyp4a14, with subsequent catabolism occurring via peroxisomal β-oxidation. Some of the end products of this pathway such as succinate and AcCoA can be utilized for anabolic purposes, whereas others, such as adipate and suberate, are excreted. Lauric acid (hereafter C12) is the main fatty acid component of coconut oil (23Kumar S.N. Variability in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) germplasm and hybrids for fatty acid profile of oil.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2011; 59: 13050-13058Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and is metabolized by hepatocytes to dodecanedioic acid (DDDA), a highly toxic dicarboxylic acid that is further metabolized by the bifunctional enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (Ehhadh) (24Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha: An adaptive metabolic system.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal mice, which readily tolerate either C12- or DDDA-enriched diets, ehhadh−/− mice accumulate high levels of DDDA, develop hepatic inflammation and necrosis, and succumb within days to acute liver failure (25Ding J.

In addition to downregulating mitochondrial β-oxidation, we show here that experimental murine HBs and HCCs also markedly suppress the ω-oxidation/peroxisomal pathway (18Dolezal J.M. Wang H.

This suggested that these tumors and perhaps other cancers possess a metabolic vulnerability in the form of C12 and/or DDDA intolerance analogous to that of ehhadh−/− mice. Indeed, we also show that the life spans of HB-bearing mice can be significantly extended by dietary supplementation with C12 and/or DDDA provided shortly after tumor initiation. Similarly, large pre-existing tumors develop massive necrosis in response to short-term implementation of DDDA-enriched diets. Several different human cancer types, including HB and HCC, also show striking downregulation of ehhadh expression suggesting that these too might be sensitive to C12 and/or DDDA. Collectively, our studies identify a novel metabolic susceptibility that could be targeted via relatively simple means and with minimal toxicity without compromising standard chemotherapeutic options. HBs were generated by hydrodynamic tail vein injection of Sleeping Beauty vectors encoding a patient-derived 90 bp in-frame oncogenic deletion mutant of β-catenin (hereafter, Δ(90)) and a missense mutant (S127A) of yes-associated protein (hereafter, YAPS127A), the terminal effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway (19Jackson L.E.

https://openalex.org/W3120444631,"The role of lipids in modulating membrane protein function is an emerging and rapidly growing area of research. The rational design of lipids that target membrane proteins for the treatment of pathological conditions is a novel extension in this field and provides a step forward in our understanding of membrane transporters. Bioactive lipids show considerable promise as analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain and bind to a high-affinity allosteric-binding site on the human glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2 or SLC6A5). Here, we use a combination of medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling to develop a rational structure–activity relationship for lipid inhibitors and demonstrate the key role of the lipid tail interactions for GlyT2 inhibition. Specifically, we examine how lipid inhibitor head group stereochemistry, tail length, and double-bond position promote enhanced inhibition. Overall, the l-stereoisomer is generally a better inhibitor than the d-stereoisomer, longer tail length correlates with greater potency, and the position of the double bond influences the activity of the inhibitor. We propose that the binding of the lipid inhibitor deep into the allosteric-binding pocket is critical for inhibition. Furthermore, this provides insight into the mechanism of inhibition of GlyT2 and highlights how lipids can modulate the activity of membrane proteins by binding to cavities between helices. The principles identified in this work have broader implications for the development of a larger class of compounds that could target SLC6 transporters for disease treatment. The role of lipids in modulating membrane protein function is an emerging and rapidly growing area of research. The rational design of lipids that target membrane proteins for the treatment of pathological conditions is a novel extension in this field and provides a step forward in our understanding of membrane transporters. Bioactive lipids show considerable promise as analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain and bind to a high-affinity allosteric-binding site on the human glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2 or SLC6A5). Here, we use a combination of medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling to develop a rational structure–activity relationship for lipid inhibitors and demonstrate the key role of the lipid tail interactions for GlyT2 inhibition. Specifically, we examine how lipid inhibitor head group stereochemistry, tail length, and double-bond position promote enhanced inhibition.

One in 10 adults worldwide is diagnosed with chronic pain each year (1Goldberg D.S. McGee S.J. Pain as a global public health priority.BMC Public Health. 2011; 11: 770Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Despite the high rate of chronic pain, there is a lack of safe and effective treatment options, which in turn has significant social and economic consequences (2Volkow N. Benveniste H. McLellan A.T. Use and misuse of opioids in chronic pain.Annu. Rev. Med. 2018; 69: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the mammalian central nervous system, the neurotransmitter glycine inhibits the pain-signaling pathway (3Todd A.J. Neuronal circuitry for pain processing in the dorsal horn.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Synaptic concentrations of glycine are controlled by the two glycine transporters, GlyT1 and GlyT2, which are responsible for clearing glycine from synapses (4Eulenburg V. Armsen W. Betz H. Gomeza J.

GlyT2 is expressed by presynaptic neurons and is also responsible for replenishing presynaptic glycine concentrations to maintain glycinergic neurotransmission. Inhibitors of GlyT2 slow the reuptake of glycine to prolong glycine neurotransmission (5Cioffi C.L. Modulation of glycine-mediated spinal neurotransmission for the treatment of chronic pain.J. Med.

One of the most promising bioactive lipids from this series, oleoyl d-lysine (C18ω9-d-Lys), is a selective and potent GlyT2 inhibitor that is metabolically stable, blood–brain barrier permeable, and produces analgesia in a rat model of neuropathic pain with minimal side effects (13Mostyn S.N.

They reduce but do not completely block glycine transport, which allows presynaptic glycine concentrations to be maintained for subsequent repackaging into synaptic vesicles to maintain glycinergic neurotransmission (14Vandenberg R.J.

The most potent bioactive lipids bear positively charged (Lys) or aromatic (Trp) amino acid head groups and inhibit GlyT2 with IC50 concentrations of less than 50 nM (13Mostyn S.N. Rawling T.

Within the allosteric-binding site, oleoyl-l-lysine (C18ω9-l-Lys) orients tail down so that the tail intercalates between aliphatic-rich regions of TM5 and TM8 and the oleoyl double bond is in close proximity to TM5 (6Mostyn S.N.

The amino acid head group is accessible to the extracellular solution and stabilized by aromatic residues in TM7, TM8, and EL4 (6Mostyn S.N. Wilson K.A. Schumann-Gillett A. Frangos Z.J. Shimmon S.

Identification of an allosteric binding site on the human glycine transporter, GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics.Elife. 2019; 8e47150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present work, we use a combination of medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling to explore the structure–activity relationship for lipid inhibitors of GlyT2 to understand how head group stereochemistry and chemical features of the acyl tail affect inhibitor activity and interaction with GlyT2 at a molecular level. The effects of head group stereochemistry are investigated for the most potent previously identified lipid inhibitors, C18ω9-Lys and C18ω9-Trp. To further understand the effect of structure on inhibitor potency, a series of acyl-lysine analogs were synthesized with variations in the tail length (C18, C16, and C14) and position of the double bond within the lipid tail (ω9, ω7, ω5, and ω3; Fig. 1). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to provide a structural basis for the effect of chemical changes on lipid inhibitor properties. We demonstrate that the potency of the lipid inhibitors was greatly influenced by a combination of both the stereochemistry of the head group and the length and saturation of the lipid tail. Furthermore, inhibitor potency is shown to depend on deep penetration of the lipid tail into a stabilized location in the allosteric-binding site. This study develops a comprehensive structure–activity relationship for lipid inhibitors of GlyT2. This is critical for future rational design of more effective GlyT2 inhibitors for the treatment of chronic pain and may have broader implications for modulation of other SLC6 transporters. Bioactive lipids bearing Lys or Trp head groups in the l-configurations are among the most potent GlyT2 inhibitors in the series, inhibiting GlyT2 with IC50 concentrations of 25.5 and 54.6 nM, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, when the head group is converted to the d-configuration, the Lys analog (C18ω9-d-Lys) retains potency, whereas the Trp analog (C18ω9-d-Trp) is inactive (Table 1) (6Mostyn S.N.

To investigate the molecular basis of this activity, MD simulations of 500 ns were performed in triplicate, in which one molecule of either the l- or d-stereoisomers of C18ω9-Lys or C18ω9-Trp was docked into the extracellular allosteric-binding site of our GlyT2 homology model (15Subramanian N.

Only binding poses in which the lipid tail was inserted into the extracellular allosteric-binding site and the double bond was in close proximity to TM5 were considered (6Mostyn S.N. Wilson K.A.

Regardless of head group amino acid type or stereochemistry, the transporter remains in an outward-occluded conformation (where the intracellular gate distance is >4.1 Å, and the extracellular gate distance is <14.0 Å; Table S1) and the membrane properties are not affected by lipid inhibitor binding (Table S2).Table 1Activity of acyl-lysine analogs at GlyT2 and GlyT1Inhibitorl-Head group stereochemistryd-Head group stereochemistryIC50 (nM)% Maximal inhibitionActivity at GlyT1IC50 (nM)% Maximal inhibitionActivity at GlyT1C18 ω9 Trp54.6aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).86.2aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).>10 μMaPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).>10 μMaPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).14.2aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).>10 μMaPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).C18ω9 Lys25.5aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).86.8aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).>3 μMaPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).48.3aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).91.0aPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).>3 μMaPreviously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6).C16ω7 Lys66.6 (49.9–88.7)90.2 ± 2.1>3 μM602 (373–856)96.2 ± 2.1>3 μMC14ω5 Lys703 (414–1250)96.2 ± 7.3>3 μM1380b95% Confidence interval was not able to be calculated. n = 3 to 7 for all measurements.79.7 ± 3.6>3 μMC18ω5 Lys67.5 (31.7–143)81.3 ± 5.1>3 μM64.9 (36.3–123)87.6 ± 3.7>3 μMC16ω3 Lys10.8 (8.37–13.8)94.9 ± 1.6>3 μM699 (343–1480)91.8 ± 8.6>3 μMa Previously published data from Mostyn et al., 2019 (6Mostyn S.N.

Open table in a new tab Both C18ω9-l-Lys and C18ω9-d-Lys remain bound in the allosteric site throughout the combined 1500 ns of MD simulation with the lipid tail in an extended conformation (∼17–20 Å measured from the end of the tail to the stereocenter; Fig. S1), intercalated between TM5, TM7, and TM8 (Figs. 2A and S2). The amino acid head groups remain in close proximity to the protein/bilayer–water interface and interact with the extracellular regions of TM5, TM7, TM8, and EL4, including hydrogen bonding with cationic arginine residues (i.e., R439, R531, and R556) and stacking with nonpolar residues (i.e., F526 and W563). The tail is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket lined by L436, V523, Y550, A553, and F567 (Fig. 2B and C), in agreement with previous studies (6Mostyn S.N. Wilson K.A. Schumann-Gillett A. Frangos Z.J. Shimmon S. Rawling T. Ryan R.M. O'Mara M.L. Vandenberg R.J. Identification of an allosteric binding site on the human glycine transporter, GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics.Elife. 2019; 8e47150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interactions that occur with both the head group and tail are sustained for >75% of the total simulation time (Table S3). Notably, the more potent inhibitor, C18ω9-l-Lys, has deeper penetration into the binding pocket than C18ω9-d-Lys. Y550 is a key residue in the interaction of both isomers. Y550 interacts with C18ω9-l-Lys above the oleoyl double bond. The change of stereochemistry to C18ω9-d-Lys decreases the depth of penetration of the oleoyl tail and shifts the interaction with Y550 below the double bond of C18ω9-d-Lys. In this position, the Y550 hydroxyl forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of W563, so that the lipid tail is sandwiched between Y550 and W563, with W563 interacting directly with the double bond with a CH–π interaction. The interactions of Y550 and W563 with both isomers correlate with mutagenesis data reporting that the GlyT2 Y550L and W563L mutants are not inhibited by C18ω9-l-Lys or C18ω9-d-Lys (6Mostyn S.N. Wilson K.A. Schumann-Gillett A. Frangos Z.J. Shimmon S. Rawling T. Ryan R.M. O'Mara M.L. Vandenberg R.J. Identification of an allosteric binding site on the human glycine transporter, GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics.Elife. 2019; 8e47150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast to the lysine-based analogs, the potency of the bioactive lipids bearing Trp head groups is significantly impacted by stereochemistry such that the d-isomer is inactive against GlyT2 (Table 1) (6Mostyn S.N. Wilson K.A. Schumann-Gillett A. Frangos Z.J. Shimmon S. Rawling T. Ryan R.M. O'Mara M.L. Vandenberg R.J. Identification of an allosteric binding site on the human glycine transporter, GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics.Elife. 2019; 8e47150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In MD simulations, C18ω9-l-Trp binds to the GlyT2 allosteric site in a similar conformation as C18ω9-l-Lys. C18ω9-l-Trp is again intercalated between TM5, TM7, and TM8 with the double bond in close proximity to TM5 (Figs. 3A and S3). The d-isomer, C18ω9-d-Trp, alters its orientation around the stereocenter so the C18ω9 tail points toward EL4, rather than facing the pocket formed by TM5, TM7, and TM8. While C18ω9-d-Trp still binds to the GlyT2 extracellular allosteric site, it adopts a much more curled conformation than C18ω9-l-Trp (∼13 Å versus ∼18 Å measured from the end of the tail to the stereocenter; Fig. S1). This curled conformation results in a shallower binding interaction and reduced depth of penetration of C18ω9-d-Trp into the extracellular allosteric site, which alters the coordination of the lipid tail within the binding pocket. Key head group interactions with R439 and F526 were maintained. Residues L436, V523, Y550, A553, and L557 that interact with the lipid tail of C18ω9-d-Lys, C18ω9-l-Lys, and C18ω9-l-Trp instead form interactions with the head group of C18ω9-d-Trp (Fig. 3B and C and Table S3). Only one interaction forms with the C18ω9-d-Trp lipid tail for >75% of the simulation time. Without these key residues stabilizing the position of the acyl tail of C18ω9-d-Trp within the binding site, the tail does not remain bound between TM5, TM7, and TM8 over the course of the MD simulation as observed for the active lipid inhibitors. Instead the lipid tail leaves the allosteric-binding site and reorients in the solution toward EL4, where it adopts a variety of conformations. Despite C18ω9-d-Trp remaining bound in the extracellular allosteric-binding site throughout the total simulation time and the seemingly favorable interaction of the C18ω9-d-Trp head group, no inhibition of GlyT2 is achieved. This indicates that in order for the bioactive lipids to inhibit GlyT2, the tail must be stabilized within the extracellular allosteric-binding site, positioned between TM5, TM7, and TM8. This is in agreement with the inability of free amino acids to cause inhibition (16Carland J.E. Thomas M. Mostyn S.N. Subramanian N. O’Mara M.L. Ryan R.M. Vandenberg R.J. Molecular determinants for substrate interactions with the glycine transporter GlyT2.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017; 9: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The lipid inhibitors described previously contain 18 carbon acyl tails with a cis-double bond in the Δ9 position (i.e., nine bonds from the amide linkage to the amino acid head group), and penetration of the lipid tails into the allosteric site appears to be a critical determinant of inhibitory activity. To investigate the effect of tail length on GlyT2 inhibitory activity, we synthesized d- and l-lysine–based inhibitors with truncated tails. Double bonds were maintained in the Δ9 position, and overall chain lengths were reduced to C16 or C14 (C16ω7-Lys and C14ω5-Lys, respectively). The chemical structures of these new lipids are shown in Figure 1, and their synthesis and characterization are described in the Supporting information section. Newly synthesized acyl lysine analogs were then tested against GlyT2 and also tested for selectivity by testing against the closely related GlyT1 transporter using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology (see Table 1 for inhibitory data). While C18ω9-l-Lys and C18ω9-d-Lys had similar levels of activity, head group conformation greatly affected the potencies of the chain-shortened analogs. C16ω7-l-Lys inhibited GlyT2 with an IC50 of 66.6 nM, but the corresponding d-isomer was ninefold less potent (IC50 of 602 nm; Fig. 4B). Further shortening of the tails to Lys C14ω5 produced a similar preference for l- versus d-, albeit with marked decrease in the potency compared with the C18 analogs (IC50 concentrations of 770 and 1380 nM for Lys-l-C14ω5 and Lys-d-C14ω5, respectively; Fig. 4D). To provide a structural explanation of this difference in activity with changing tail length, C16ω7 and C14ω5 acyl lysines in the l- and d-configurations were docked to the extracellular allosteric-binding site, and 500 ns of unrestrained MD simulations were performed in triplicate. Throughout all simulations, GlyT2 remains in an outward-occluded conformation, regardless of the tail length of the acyl lysines (Table S1). The membrane properties are not affected (Table S2). MD simulations showed that both C16ω7-l-Lys and C14ω5-l-Lys remained bound in the allosteric-binding site throughout the simulation, with the tail positioned between TM5, TM7, and TM8 (Figs. 5A and S4). The Lys head groups of both C16ω7-l-Lys and C14ω5-l-Lys remain in close proximity to the protein/bilayer–water interface, interacting with the extracellular regions of TM5, TM7, TM8, and EL4. C16ω7-l-Lys adopts a similar orientation to that observed for C18ω9-l-Lys, in close proximity to the key binding pocket residues (Fig. 5B and Table S4). As was observed for C18ω9-l-Lys, the C16ω7-l-Lys head group interacts with R436 and F526. Similarly, the l-Lys C16ω7 tail is located between TM5, TM7, and TM8 in the extracellular allosteric-binding site where it interacts with L436, V523, Y550, L557, and F567, and the bottom of the pocket is flanked by V214. As was the case for C18ω9-l-Lys, Y550 interacts with the lipid tail just above the double bond of C16ω7-l-Lys. The similarities between the overall orientation and interactions of C18ω9-l-Lys and C16ω7-l-Lys with key residues in the binding pocket provide a structural basis for the potent inhibition of GlyT2 by both molecules. Further shortening of the lipid tail to give C14ω5-l-Lys significantly reduces the depth of the tail penetration into the binding pocket (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, shortening of the lipid tail dramatically alters C14ω5-l-Lys head group interactions. The C14ω5-l-Lys head group interacts with the membrane, forming hydrogen bonds with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) head groups (Fig. S5). There are no interactions with the C14ω5-l-Lys head group that persisted for >75% of the total simulation time (Fig. 5C and Table S4). In contrast, the tail maintains interactions with key residues (i.e., L436, V523, Y550, and F567) for >75% of the total simulation time. In both C14ω5-l-Lys and C16ω7-l-Lys, the tail only penetrates as deep as F567 (Fig. 5, B and C), which interacts with C6 of C18ω9-l-Lys and C5 of C16ω7-l-Lys. This change in orientation of C14ω5-l-Lys (IC50 of 703 nm) relative to C16ω7-l-Lys (IC50 of 66.6 nm) and C18ω9-l-Lys (IC50 of 25.5 nm) correlates with the dramatic decrease in GlyT2 inhibition observed for C14ω5-l-Lys. On change of stereochemistry to the d-configuration, C16ω7-d-Lys and C14ω5-d-Lys only remain bound in the extracellular allosteric site for approximately one third (∼500 ns) of the total simulation time. This is in contrast to C18ω9-d-Lys, which remains bound throughout the entire simulation. Furthermore, C16ω7-d-Lys and C14ω5-d-Lys adopt a different conformation in the extracellular allosteric-binding pocket to C18ω9-d-Lys (Figs. 6A and S6). Specifically, the C16ω7-d-Lys head group interacts with the head groups of membrane POPC lipids (Fig. S4B) while maintaining interactions with key GlyT2 residues (F526, R439, and R556; Fig. 6B and Table S4). While the C16ω7-d-Lys tail group is positioned in the extracellular allosteric-binding pocket in a similar orientation to C18ω9-d-Lys and interacts with L436, V523, Y550, and F567, none of these interactions persist for >75% of the total simulation time (Fig. 6B and Table S4). The reduced occupancy and different binding orientation of C16ω7-d-Lys (IC50 of 602 nm) in the extracellular allosteric-binding site in part explain the 12-fold reduced potency relative to C18ω9-d-Lys (IC50 of 48.3 nm). In the case of C14ω5-d-Lys, the d-Lys head group interacts with F526 and R439 in a similar manner to C18ω9-d-Lys. However, the C14ω5-d-Lys tail protrudes into the surrounding membrane where it interacts with POPC at the protein–lipid interface (Fig. S7). In this orientation, L443 is the only key residue interacting with the lipid tail for >75% of the total simulation time (Fig, 6C). The lack of interactions and reduced occupancy in the extracellular allosteric-binding site may in part explain why C14ω5-d-Lys is not an effective inhibitor of GlyT2 (IC50 of 1380 nm). To assess the effect of the double-bond position on activity, we synthesized C18ω5-Lys and C16ω3-Lys, which contain cis-double bonds in the Δ13 position (Fig. 1). Both l- and d-isomers of C18ω5-Lys inhibit GlyT2 with IC50 concentrations of 67.5 and 64.9 nM, respectively (Fig. 4A and Table 1). This trend is consistent with the results for C18ω9-l-Lys and C18ω9-d-Lys, where the configuration of the amino acid head group did not greatly alter the activity. However, when the length of the acyl chain was decreased to C16, the position of the double bond produced a marked difference in inhibitory activity between isomers. Thus, C16ω3-l-Lys is a potent inhibitor of GlyT2 (IC50 of 10.8 nM), whereas the corresponding d-isomer was 65-fold less potent, with an IC50 of 699 nm (Fig. 4C). To provide a structural explanation of this difference in activity with changing tail length, the l- and d-isomers of C18ω5 and C16ω3 Lys were docked to the extracellular allosteric-binding pocket and simulated for 500 ns in triplicate. Regardless of the presence of a bound inhibitor, GlyT2 again remains in an outward-occluded conformation (Table S1) throughout the simulations, and the membrane properties are not affected (Table S2). Both stereoisomers with C18 tails (C18ω5-l-Lys and C18ω5-d-Lys) remained bound in the allosteric pocket throughout all simulations. The overall binding conformation and potencies of C18ω5-l-Lys and C18ω5-d-Lys were similar to that of the C18ω9-l-Lys and C18ω9-d-Lys (Fig. 7A). The head group interactions with F526, L443, and R439 are maintained (Figs. 7B and C and S8 and Table S5), and the tails of C18ω5-l/d-Lys are located between TM5, TM7, and TM8, interacting with the nonpolar residues (e.g., V214, L436, Y550, L557, and F567) and Y550 interacts with the lipid tail above the double bond (Fig. 7), giving a structural basis for their activity. Major differences in the binding interactions of the C16 isomers were observed, consistent with their IC50 concentrations. C16ω3-l-Lys, the most potent inhibitor of GlyT2 in this lipid series, remains bound in the allosteric pocket throughout the combined MD simulations, whereas C16ω3-d-Lys only remains bound in the extracellular allosteric-binding pocket for approximately one-third of the total simulation time. In the case of C16ω3-l-Lys, the head group interacts with F526, L443, and R439, as observed for C18ω9-l-Lys (Figs. 8 and S9). Unlike other inhibitory lipids, the C16ω3-l-Lys tail does not adopt an extended conformation but instead has a curled conformation in the allosteric-binding site between TM5, TM7, and TM8. The curled C16ω3-l-Lys tail interacts with W215, Y550, L557, F567, and L436 (Fig. 8B and Table S5). The interaction between C16ω3-l-Lys and W215 is unique and notable because W215 is directly adjacent to the glycine-binding site and physically separates the extracellular allosteric site and the vestibular substrate-binding site. Interactions with W215 may reflect communication between the extracell"

This modification sterically blocks binding of several classes of antibiotics to 23S rRNA, resulting in a multidrug-resistant phenotype in bacteria expressing the enzyme. ErmC is an erythromycin resistance methyltransferase found in many Gram-positive pathogens, whereas ErmE is found in the soil bacterium that biosynthesizes erythromycin. Whether ErmC and ErmE, which possess only 24% sequence identity, use similar structural elements for rRNA substrate recognition and positioning is not known. To investigate this question, we used structural data from related proteins to guide site-saturation mutagenesis of key residues and characterized selected variants by antibiotic susceptibility testing, single turnover kinetics, and RNA affinity-binding assays. We demonstrate that residues in α4, α5, and the α5-α6 linker are essential for methyltransferase function, including an aromatic residue on α4 that likely forms stacking interactions with the substrate adenosine and basic residues in α5 and the α5-α6 linker that likely mediate conformational rearrangements in the protein and cognate rRNA upon interaction. The functional studies led us to a new structural model for the ErmC or ErmE-rRNA complex."

MtCM, the CM from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has less than 1% of the catalytic efficiency of a typical natural CM and requires complex formation with 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase for high activity. To explore the full potential of MtCM for catalyzing its native reaction, we applied diverse iterative cycles of mutagenesis and selection, thereby raising kcat/Km 270-fold to 5 × 105m−1s−1, which is even higher than for the complex. Moreover, the evolutionarily optimized autonomous MtCM, which had 11 of its 90 amino acids exchanged, was stabilized compared with its progenitor, as indicated by a 9 °C increase in melting temperature. The 1.5 Å crystal structure of the top-evolved MtCM variant reveals the molecular underpinnings of this activity boost. Some acquired residues (e.g. Pro52 and Asp55) are conserved in naturally efficient CMs, but most of them lie beyond the active site. Our evolutionary trajectories reached a plateau at the level of the best natural enzymes, suggesting that we have exhausted the potential of MtCM. Taken together, these findings show that the scaffold of MtCM, which naturally evolved for mediocrity to enable inter-enzyme allosteric regulation of the shikimate pathway, is inherently capable of high activity.

The potential of a microbial cell to respond to changing environmental conditions is reflected in its ability to reorganize the metabolic flux. Allosteric feedback regulation of enzymes, where effector binding to an allosteric site tunes the activity of a distant active site, instantaneously achieves such a response. Typically, this type of regulation employs allosteric sites on the enzyme itself. Alternatively, an allosteric site can be temporarily provided by transient protein-protein interactions, also called “inter-enzyme allostery”, as first described for shikimate pathway enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (1Munack S.

Indeed, tight feedback regulation of metabolic flux is particularly important for the shikimate pathway, because it metabolizes a significant portion of organic carbon for the biosynthesis of energetically costly aromatic compounds in bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, plants, and protozoan parasites (3Haslam E.

The pathway starts with the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate to form 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) catalyzed by DAHP synthase (DS). Six subsequent enzymatic steps lead to the biosynthesis of the branch-point metabolite chorismate, the last common precursor of the aromatic amino acids and other essential aromatic compounds. The first committed step toward l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate (Fig. 1A), catalyzed by chorismate mutase (CM). Because DS and CM are the central nodes of the shikimate pathway, organisms have developed a variety of strategies both at the genetic (4Herrmann K.M. Weaver L.M. The shikimate pathway.Annu. Rev.

We applied several cycles of mutagenesis and selection to identify mutations in MtCM that increase CM efficiency in the absence of interacting MtDS (Figure 2, Figure 3).

Transformation with plasmid libraries carrying mutagenized M. tuberculosis aroQδ genes allows for rapid identification of survivors and thereby of active enzymes from typically 106 variants per evolutionary round under the appropriate selective conditions (Fig. 2B). As the starting point for the directed evolution we constructed H6-MtCM, an N-terminally His-tagged version of the WT MtCM that facilitates biochemical characterization. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 9 × 102m−1 s−1) of H6-MtCM is preserved within a factor of two of the parental enzyme (Table 1). H6-MtCM does not support the growth of KA12/pKIMP-UAUC on minimal medium lacking Tyr and Phe when its gene is introduced on the high-copy plasmid pKTNTET, downstream of the tightly repressed Ptet promoter (Fig. 2). pKTNTET additionally carries the genes tetR encoding the tet repressor and bla for ampicillin resistance.

Residues Thr52, Arg53, Leu54, and Val55 from the H1-H2 loop were randomized via NNK (N = A/C/G/T, K = G/T) codons, and the resulting gene library was transformed into KA12/pKIMP-UAUC to select for active catalysts (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis of the mutant H6-MtCM genes from 34 transformants growing after 4 days at 30 °C on M9c minimal medium revealed a remarkable pattern. With the exception of two clones showing Cys, Val55 was replaced by an aspartate residue in all selected MtCM variants (Fig. 4A and Fig. S1). Positions 53 (Arg) and 54 (Leu) of MtCM were somewhat more variable and tolerated chemically similar replacements. Position 52 (Thr) showed a slight preference for both Pro and Ser instead of the WT Thr in MtCM. Variant PHS08-3p3 (henceforth called 3p3), which combines the two substitutions T52P and V55D, has a 22-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 2.1 × 104m−1 s−1) than H6-MtCM.Figure 4Selected MtCM sequences from evolutionary cycles I and II.

https://openalex.org/W3093128360,"Highly engineered phytases, which sequentially hydrolyze the hexakisphosphate ester of inositol known as phytic acid, are routinely added to the feeds of monogastric animals to improve phosphate bioavailability. New phytases are sought as starting points to further optimize the rate and extent of dephosphorylation of phytate in the animal digestive tract. Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatases (MINPPs) are clade 2 histidine phosphatases (HP2P) able to carry out the stepwise hydrolysis of phytate. MINPPs are not restricted by a strong positional specificity making them attractive targets for development as feed enzymes. Here, we describe the characterization of a MINPP from the Gram-positive bacterium Bifidobacterium longum (BlMINPP). BlMINPP has a typical HP2P-fold but, unusually, possesses a large α-domain polypeptide insertion relative to other MINPPs. This insertion, termed the U-loop, spans the active site and contributes to substrate specificity pockets underpopulated in other HP2Ps. Mutagenesis of U-loop residues reveals its contribution to enzyme kinetics and thermostability. Moreover, four crystal structures of the protein along the catalytic cycle capture, for the first time in an HP2P, a large ligand-driven α-domain motion essential to allow substrate access to the active site. This motion recruits residues both downstream of a molecular hinge and on the U-loop to participate in specificity subsites, and mutagenesis identified a mobile lysine residue as a key determinant of positional specificity of the enzyme. Taken together, these data provide important new insights to the factors determining stability, substrate recognition, and the structural mechanism of hydrolysis in this industrially important group of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3120812668,"Pathogenic microorganisms often reside in glycan-based biofilms. Concentration and chain length distribution of these mostly anionic exopolysaccharides (EPS) determine the overall biophysical properties of a biofilm and result in a highly viscous environment. Bacterial communities regulate this biofilm state via intracellular small-molecule signaling to initiate EPS synthesis. Reorganization or degradation of this glycan matrix, however, requires the action of extracellular glycosidases. So far, these were mainly described for bacteriophages that must degrade biofilms for gaining access to host bacteria. The plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii (P. stewartii) encodes the protein WceF within its EPS synthesis cluster. WceF has homologs in various biofilm forming plant pathogens of the Erwinia family. In this work, we show that WceF is a glycosidase active on stewartan, the main P. stewartii EPS biofilm component. WceF has remarkable structural similarity with bacteriophage tailspike proteins (TSPs). Crystal structure analysis showed a native trimer of right-handed parallel β-helices. Despite its similar fold, WceF lacks the high stability found in bacteriophage TSPs. WceF is a stewartan hydrolase and produces oligosaccharides, corresponding to single stewartan repeat units. However, compared with a stewartan-specific glycan hydrolase of bacteriophage origin, WceF showed lectin-like autoagglutination with stewartan, resulting in notably slower EPS cleavage velocities.

Many microorganisms produce extracellular matrices composed of polymeric substances to organize themselves in microbial communities (1Flemming H.C. Wingender J. Szewzyk U. Steinberg P. Rice S.A.

Development and regulation of single- and multi-species Candida albicans biofilms.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The production of these biofilms exerts a multitude of effects not only on the lifestyle of the embedded cells, but also on their interactions with the environment and their pathogenicity. Biofilms specifically regulate the access of external substances such as antimicrobial drugs, functioning clearly beyond simple diffusion barriers (3Moradali M.F. Rehm B.H.A. Bacterial biopolymers: From pathogenesis to advanced materials.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rather, biofilms show high spatiotemporal dynamics due to complex and multidimensional regulatory mechanisms for their formation and dispersal (4Serra D.O. Hengge R.

Genetic control of biofilms has been linked to the effects of small-molecule messengers for quorum sensing in bacterial communities (6Hengge R. Targeting bacterial biofilms by the green tea polyphenol EGCG.Molecules. 2019; 24: 2403Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a consequence, an extracellular polymeric substance is produced that determines the overall biophysical properties of a biofilm through its specific biomacromolecular composition (3Moradali M.F. Rehm B.H.A. Bacterial biopolymers: From pathogenesis to advanced materials.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).

In this work, we have characterized the enzymatic modification of biofilms formed by the plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (P. stewartii) (17Roper M.C. Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii: Lessons learned from a xylem-dwelling pathogen of sweet corn.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2011; 12: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). P. stewartii infects sweet corn and maize where it colonizes the xylem with dense biofilms containing the exopolysaccharide stewartan as key virulence factor. Consequently, free water flow in the plants is blocked, ultimately leading to wilting of leaves and necrosis of crops. Stewartan is an anionic heteropolymer of heptasaccharide repeat units (RU) (Fig. 1): Its backbone structure [→3)-α-d-GalpI(1→6)-β-d-GlcpII(1→3)-β-d-GalpIII(1→] is branched at GalI with [(4→1)-β-d-GlcApIV(4→1)-α-d-GalpV(6→1)-β-d-Glcp] (18Nimtz M.

Biofilm formation in P. stewartii is regulated by cell-density-dependent quorum sensing that controls three gene systems (19Carlier A. Burbank L. von Bodman S.B.

Microbiol. 2009; 74: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most stewartan biosynthetic genes are located on the wce-I cluster that encodes for a Wzy-dependent exopolysaccharide synthesis pathway (19Carlier A. Burbank L. von Bodman S.B.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3171) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases encoded by wce-I catalyze stewartan RU assembly. However, the glycosyltransferase gene region (wceB, K, M, N) contains two additional genes, wceJ and wceF. WceJ was found to be a nonfunctional pyruvate-transferase, which is not required for P. stewartii virulence. The wceF gene (formerly designated as cpsH) is highly conserved in Pantoea and Erwinia species (Table S1 and Fig. S1). It encodes an 80 kDa polypeptide chain (736 amino acids) following a Tat-secretion signal. A function for the corresponding protein WceF has so far not been described. Mutations in wceF resulted in an increased stewartan exopolysaccharide size of up to 7.6 MDa and suggested a role of WceF in stewartan chain length control (21Schollmeyer M. Langlotz C. Huber A. Coplin D.L. Geider K. Variations in the molecular masses of the capsular exopolysaccharides amylovoran, pyrifolan and stewartan.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2012; 50: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the crystal structure of WceF and its interaction with purified stewartan exopolysaccharide. WceF shows high structural similarity to bacteriophage tailspike proteins (TSPs) and is enzymatically active on stewartan, proposing a role in exopolysaccharide modification when P. stewartii is in the mucoid, biofilm producing state. We recombinantly expressed, purified, and crystallized WceF lacking the N-terminal 28 amino acids of the Tat-signal peptide that encodes for export via the Tat-pathway for folded proteins (22Cline K. Mechanistic aspects of folded protein transport by the twin arginine translocase (tat).J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 16530-16538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Tat-signal peptide sequences are typically cleaved off by a signal peptidase once the protein has been transported. We therefore consider that our recombinant construct (WceF residues 29–736) represents the native form of WceF. We solved its crystal structure to 2.55 Å resolution, using a selenomethionine variant for phasing (Table S2). WceF residues 34 to 736 were resolved in the electron density. As confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography, WceF is a native homotrimer of about 200 kDa (Fig. S2). Each peptide chain is composed of an N-terminal head domain, a neck domain, the central right-handed parallel β-helix domain followed by a short triple β-helix, a β-sandwich, and a C-terminal stem domain (Fig. 2). The head domain (residues 34–146) is made of two β-sheets containing four antiparallel β-strands flanked by three α-helices. Electron density was not resolved for the following 25 residues. A five-stranded Greek-key motif surrounding one α-helix then forms the neck domain (residues 166–229) of WceF. The central body of WceF is formed by a large three-stranded β-helix (residues 236–514) of eight complete rungs capped by an N-terminal α-helix (residues 252–265). At the C-terminus of the β-helix, the chain makes a β-hairpin turn and two 120° kinks that form two turns of a triple β-helix in the native trimer (residues 517–531). The intertwined chains then again separate and individually form a β-sandwich domain with a jelly roll fold composed of eight antiparallel β-strands arranged in two four-stranded sheets (residues 531–667). At the C terminus, two smaller antiparallel β-sheets of three and two strands, respectively, are connected by a large loop (residues 678–736). All C-terminal peptide regions following the β-helix domain highly intertwine in the native trimer structure. The WceF N-terminal head domain (residues 34–146) is classified in the Conserved Domain Database (CCD) as head domain due to its resemblance to the N-terminal domain of the TSP of bacteriophage P22 (23Steinbacher S. Miller S. Baxa U. Budisa N. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R.

Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 1336-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among all hits were many bacteriophage TSP containing trimers of parallel, right-handed β-helices structurally similar to WceF (Table S3). Moreover, structural similarities with a diverse set of anionic polysaccharide degrading enzymes, mainly polygalacturonases, were confirmed for the WceF β-helix domain (residues residues 236–514). Bacteriophage TSPs are thermostable enzymes to ensure bacteriophage infectivity even under harsh extracellular conditions (31Barbirz S. Becker M. Freiberg A. Seckler R. Phage tailspike proteins with beta-solenoid fold as thermostable carbohydrate binding materials.Macromol Biosci. 2009; 9: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Their native trimeric β-helix assemblies are kinetically stabilized, resulting in slow denaturation at temperatures above 70 °C, even in the presence of detergents. In contrast, and in spite of its trimeric assembly of β-helices similar to the one found in TSPs, WceF rapidly denatured in the presence of 2% (w/v) SDS even at room temperature (Fig. 3B). WceF migrated as a monomer in SDS-PAGE, whereas the TSPs of bacteriophages P22 and HK620 remained native trimers in the presence of SDS. As shown before, P22TSP only denatured into monomers after heating to 100 °C for several minutes prior to electrophoresis (32Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Phage P22 tailspike protein: Removal of head-binding domain unmasks effects of folding mutations on native-state thermal stability.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, the bacterial protein WceF is notably less stable in the presence of detergent compared with the P22TSP of bacteriophage origin. This is in agreement with a calculated overall lower WceF trimer interface stabilization (Fig. S9). For P22TSP and WceF, similar trimer interface areas were found; however, due to their markedly different surface properties, the WceF trimer interface was predicted to contribute less stabilization compared with the P22TSP interface. We produced N-terminally truncated WceF variants to assess their influence on trimer stabilization (Fig. S4). Constructs lacking only the P22TSP-homologous head domain (residues 34–146) were soluble but rapidly aggregated, presumably because they were impaired in trimer stabilization. Constructs lacking more N-terminal residues, i.e., the neck domain or the α-helix cap preceding the β-helix were insoluble. This is in contrast to P22TSP, where the N-terminal head domain was dispensable for trimer stabilization (33Danner M. Fuchs A. Miller S. Seckler R. Folding and assembly of phage P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase lacking the N-terminal, head-binding domain.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we hence conclude that Wcef is a stable native trimer only in the presence of all its N-terminal domains. Depolymerization activity on polysaccharide capsules, exopolysaccharide biofilms, or lipopolysaccharide is typically found in bacteriophage TSPs where it can essentially drive the infection process (34Latka A. Maciejewska B. Majkowska-Skrobek G. Briers Y. Drulis-Kawa Z. Bacteriophage-encoded virion-associated enzymes to overcome the carbohydrate barriers during the infection process.Appl. Microbiol.

Chem. 2019; 294: 11751-11761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, right-handed, parallel β-helices of prokaryotic origin have been often found to be involved in glycan binding (36Bradley P. Cowen L. Menke M. King J. Berger B. BETAWRAP: Successful prediction of parallel beta -helices from primary sequence reveals an association with many microbial pathogens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore tested WceF interactions with stewartan as the P. stewartii major biofilm exopolysaccharide component. Stewartan isolated from three-day-old P. stewartii biofilms is highly viscous in solution (14Dunsing V. Irmscher T. Barbirz S. Chiantia S. Purely polysaccharide-based biofilm matrix provides size-selective diffusion barriers for nanoparticles and bacteriophages.Biomacromolecules. 2019; 20: 3842-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, when mixed with WceF, stewartan solutions lost their viscosity after about 3 days at room temperature (Fig. S5). From this, we assumed stewartan cleavage and analyzed WceF-stewartan mixtures for reducing end formation (Fig. 4A). Reducing ends were produced slowly over a time course of more than eight days only, tested with the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinon-hydrazone (MBTH) method (37Zhang Y.Q. Wang Z.P. Zhang J. Chen C.G. Wu Q. Zhang L.L. Zhang X.Y. Quantitative determination of chitinolytic activity of lysozyme using half-deacetylated chitosan as a substrate.Carbohydr. Polym. 2011; 85: 554-559Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, after this time, we observed a sudden, about 30-fold increase in reducing end formation velocity. WceF or stewartan alone did not produce reducing ends over the whole 300 h time course of the experiment. WceF showed highest activity at pH 5 (Fig. 4B) that decreased with increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 4C). No absorption increase at 235 nm was found during the whole experiment time as it would be characteristic for double bond formation due to a putative polysaccharide lyase activity. We thus conclude that WceF is a glycoside hydrolase specific for stewartan. P. stewartii is host for a number of bacteriophages. To compare WceF with a bacteriophage enzyme, we analyzed the tailspike depolymerase from podovirus φEa1H. φEa1HTSP shares about 25% sequence identity with WceF (38Hartung J.S. Fulbright D.W. Klos E.J. Cloning of a bacteriophage polysaccharide depolymerase gene and its expression in Erwinia amylovora.Mol. Plant Microbe. 1988; 1: 87-93Crossref Google Scholar). φEa1HTSP cleaved stewartan at significantly higher velocity than WceF, i.e., the enzymatic formation of reducing ends from stewartan reached saturation within 30 min (Fig. 5). Moreover, φEa1HTSP was active over a broad pH range between 5 and 10 and independent of the salt concentration (Fig. S6). Also, we had to use a tenfold lower φEa1HTSP enzyme concentration (0.14 μM) compared with the experiments with WceF (1.50 μM) to be able to follow the time course of the enzymatic reaction. The bacteriophage depolymerase φEa1HTSP was therefore notably more efficient than the bacterial enzyme WceF. As described earlier, we used φEa1HTSP to produce stewartan oligosaccharides of one and two repeat units, respectively (Fig. S7) (39Nimtz M. Mort A. Domke T. Wray V. Zhang Y.X. Qiu F. Coplin D. Geider K. Structure of amylovoran, the capsular exopolysaccharide from the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora.Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 287: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). φEa1HTSP cleaves the φ-1,3-glycosidic bond of two backbone galactoses in stewartan (cf. Fig. 1). We used these oligosaccharides as standards in capillary electrophoresis (CE) to analyze stewartan cleavage products obtained by either WceF or φEa1HTSP (Fig. 6). Due to the different glycosidic bond cleavage velocities found for both enzymes, we compared oligosaccharide products after different reaction times, i.e., 197 h for WceF and 6 min for φEa1HTSP, respectively. From the very similar CE elution profiles compared with the stewartan 1RU standard, we conclude that WceF had depolymerized stewartan to 1RU heptasaccharides (7mers). In contrast, after the short reaction time, φEa1HTSP had mainly produced 2RU tetrakaidekasaccharides (14mers). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography and MALDI-MS analysis further confirmed that WceF had produced 1RU fragments of stewartan (Fig. S7). We therefore propose that WceF, like φEa1HTSP, is a β-1,3 galactosidase. Concentrated stewartan solutions at about 10 mg ml−1 had shown earlier a notable diffusion hindrance for nanoparticles (14Dunsing V. Irmscher T. Barbirz S. Chiantia S. Purely polysaccharide-based biofilm matrix provides size-selective diffusion barriers for nanoparticles and bacteriophages.Biomacromolecules. 2019; 20: 3842-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Native trimers of WceF are large proteins (ca. 200 kDa, cf. Fig. S2) that may diffuse only slowly in viscous stewartan solutions. As WceF indeed exhibited a very slow initial phase of reducing end formation (cf. Fig. 4), we analyzed the diffusion behavior of an ATTO 488-labeled WceF with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7). We found that in the absence of stewartan, WceF was slightly prone to aggregation, as indicated by the presence of small fluorescent spots. However, when WceF was mixed with stewartan, we observed much larger fluorescent spots with an estimated diameter of 3 to 10 μm, indicating that WceF had associated into roughly spherical protein aggregates. Particles of this size are too large to freely diffuse in stewartan (14Dunsing V. Irmscher T. Barbirz S. Chiantia S. Purely polysaccharide-based biofilm matrix provides size-selective diffusion barriers for nanoparticles and bacteriophages.Biomacromolecules. 2019; 20: 3842-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stewartan solutions at about 1 mg ml−1 hence were able to autoagglutinate WceF. WceF, while binding to stewartan, however, does not mask cleavage sites for the stewartan depolymerase φEa1HTSP. Free diffusion of phage particles in the stewartan matrix was restored equally well both in the presence and in the absence of WceF, as shown by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (14Dunsing V. Irmscher T. Barbirz S. Chiantia S. Purely polysaccharide-based biofilm matrix provides size-selective diffusion barriers for nanoparticles and bacteriophages.Biomacromolecules. 2019; 20: 3842-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. S8). Glycan-modifying proteins have been regularly described in the synthesis and export machines that control bacterial and fungal extracellular polysaccharides involved in encapsulation or biofilm formation. In this respect, the presence of enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds seems counterintuitive, and, indeed, biochemical characterization of these proteins combined with mutagenesis studies points to their multifaceted functional roles in polysaccharide modification (7Bamford N.C.

This study aimed to examine the net benefits of statins according to predicted CVD risk. Methods and findings A cohort of 40 to 79-year-old Korean adults without CVD was generated from the National Health Information Database 2006–2017. Major CVD event rates and all-cause mortality in 58,265 users who initiated statins during 2007–2010 were compared with those in 58,265 nonusers matched on propensity scores, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2017. Additionally, simulation was performed for the population-based cohort of 659,759 adults. CVD risk was predicted using the 2018 revised Pooled Cohort Equations. In propensity score-matched cohort, the CVD hazard ratios (95% CIs) in occasional, intermittent, and regular statin users were 1.06 (0.93–1.20), 0.82 (0.70–0.97), and 0.57 (0.50–0.64), respectively. The corresponding mortality hazard ratios were 1.01 (0.92–1.10), 0.87 (0.78–0.98), and 0.71 (0.66–0.77), respectively. In stratified analyses, the relative risk reductions were similar, irrespective of age, sex, or predicted CVD risk. Accordingly, absolute risk reductions were greater in higher risk categories. In 6-year follow-up simulation cohorts, regular statin use could reduce 17 CVDs and 28 deaths in 1000 adults with a 10-year risk of ≥10.0% vs 10 CVDs and 14 deaths in 1000 with ≥2 major risk factors. However, in actual adults with a risk of ≥10%, statin use was insufficient and estimated to reduce 3 CVDs and 4 deaths in 1000. Limitations of this study include assessment of medication use based on the prescription data, lack of information on the intensity of statins, and limited generalizability to individuals with very old age or other ethnicity. Conclusions CVD risk calculators were valid in decision-making for primary prevention statin therapy. Proper risk assessment and regular statin use in patients at high predicted risk would reduce outcome risks much more than present in Asian populations."
https://openalex.org/W3092205767,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a tissue-specific transcription factor that is required for normal kidney development and renal epithelial differentiation. Mutations of HNF-1β produce congenital kidney abnormalities and inherited renal tubulopathies. Here, we show that ablation of HNF-1β in mIMCD3 renal epithelial cells results in activation of β-catenin and increased expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a downstream effector in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Increased expression and nuclear localization of LEF1 are also observed in cystic kidneys from Hnf1b mutant mice. Expression of dominant-negative mutant HNF-1β in mIMCD3 cells produces hyperresponsiveness to exogenous Wnt ligands, which is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lef1. WT HNF-1β binds to two evolutionarily conserved sites located 94 and 30 kb from the mouse Lef1 promoter. Ablation of HNF-1β decreases H3K27 trimethylation repressive marks and increases β-catenin occupancy at a site 4 kb upstream to Lef1. Mechanistically, WT HNF-1β recruits the polycomb-repressive complex 2 that catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation. Deletion of the β-catenin-binding domain of LEF1 in HNF-1β-deficient cells abolishes the increase in Lef1 transcription and decreases the expression of downstream Wnt target genes. The canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, is also a direct transcriptional target of HNF-1β through binding to negative regulatory elements in the gene promoter. These findings demonstrate that HNF-1β regulates canonical Wnt target genes through long-range effects on histone methylation at Wnt enhancers and reveal a new mode of active transcriptional repression by HNF-1β."
https://openalex.org/W3119808865,"DNA methylation regulates gene transcription and is involved in various physiological processes in mammals, including development and hematopoiesis. It is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases including Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. For Dnmt3b, its effects on transcription can result from its own DNA methylase activity, the recruitment of other Dnmts to mediate methylation, or transcription repression in a methylation-independent manner. Low-frequency mutations in human DNMT3B are found in hematologic malignancies including cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, hairy cell leukemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, Dnmt3b is a tumor suppressor in oncogene-driven lymphoid and myeloid malignancies in mice. However, it is poorly understood how the different Dnmt3b activities contribute to these outcomes. We modulated Dnmt3b activity in vivo by generating Dnmt3b+/− mice expressing one wild-type allele as well as Dnmt3b+/CI and Dnmt3bCI/CI mice where one or both alleles express catalytically inactive Dnmt3bCI. We show that 43% of Dnmt3b+/− mice developed T-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloproliferation over 18 months, thus resembling phenotypes previously observed in Dnmt3a+/− mice, possibly through regulation of shared target genes. Interestingly, Dnmt3b+/CI and Dnmt3bCI/CI mice survived postnatal development and were affected by B-cell rather than T-cell malignancies with decreased penetrance. Genome-wide hypomethylation, increased expression of oncogenes such as Jdp2, STAT1, and Trip13, and p53 downregulation were major events contributing to Dnmt3b+/− lymphoma development. We conclude that Dnmt3b catalytic activity is critical to prevent B-cell transformation in vivo, whereas accessory and methylation-independent repressive functions are important to prevent T-cell transformation.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that contributes to a regulation of gene transcription in mammalian cells. Its association with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications in gene promoters results in gene repression (1Zhang T. Cooper S. Brockdorff N.

Methylation can also enhance transcription by promoting more efficient binding of transcription factors to their recognition sites (3Neri F. Rapelli S. Krepelova A. Incarnato D. Parlato C. Basile G.

DNA methylation is involved in regulation of normal development, differentiation, X chromosome inactivation, and genomic imprinting. It also participates in hematopoiesis, and its deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of immune disorders, hematologic malignancies, and cancer (5Celik H. Kramer A. Challen G.A.

Four catalytically active enzymes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3c) and one catalytically inactive cofactor (Dnmt3L) belong to the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in mice. All Dnmts contribute to genome-wide methylation with Dnmt1 considered to be the main maintenance enzyme while Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b primarily involved in de novo activities (9Okano M. Bell D.W.

Various other modes can affect activity of DNMT3B in cells. For instance, along with DNMT3A, DNMT3B belongs to the top 1% of underexpressed genes in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (25Upchurch G.M. Haney S.L. Opavsky R.

For instance, a protein TCL1 that is overexpressed in a number of human T-cell malignancies, including mature leukemias, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell malignancies, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma and CLL (28Yuille M.R.

Others reported oncogenic functions for Dnmt3b in MYC-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) likely due to its role in tumor maintenance (35Poole C.J. Zheng W. Lodh A. Yevtodiyenko A.

Here we utilized genetic approaches to understand whether modulation of Dnmt3b activities in vivo by either decreasing gene dose using germline inactivation of one allele (Dnmt3b+/−) or decreasing or elimination of its CA through the use of recently generated catalytically inactive Dnmt3bCI allele (Dnmt3b+/CI and Dnmt3bCI/CI). Similarly to our previous study of Dnmt3a+/− mice, our data identify Dnmt3b as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in T-cell lymphomas (TCL) and CLL (36Haney S.L. Upchurch G.M. Opavska J.

Promoter hypomethylation and expression is Conserved in mouse chronic lymphocytic leukemia induced by decreased or inactivated Dnmt3a.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 1190-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We further found that several hypomethylated and overexpressed oncogenes including Jdp2, Trip13, and Stat1 may contribute to TCL along with downregulation of p53. A development of TCL was suppressed in Dnmt3b+/CI and Dnmt3bCI/CI suggesting that CA is less important for their development. Rather, a reduction in AF may be responsible for TCL development. This is further supported by methylation data from MYC-induced T-cell lymphomas with modulated Dnmt3b activities in which AF seemed to substantially suppress loss of methylation. In contrast, the observed development of CLL and BCLs in these mice suggest the importance in prevention of B-cell transformation. Furthermore, we found that CA is largely dispensable for postnatal development with mice surviving but developing ICF-like syndrome. In summary, our data show that Dnmt3b is a multifunctional protein involved in control of genes important to prevent ICF and tumorigenesis. To evaluate the long-term consequences of Dnmt3b haploinsufficiency in mice, we generated and observed cohorts of Dnmt3b+/+ and Dnmt3b+/− mice for 18 months. While control Dnmt3b+/+ and subset of Dnmt3b+/− mice remained healthy, with no signs of deregulated hematopoiesis, 44% of Dnmt3b+/− mice developed various hematologic malignancies including TCL, (20%) characterized by enlarged spleens and lymph nodes (Fig. 1, A and B, S1 and not shown). Histological analysis of spleens showed a near-complete effacement of the red pulp by massively expanded white pulp (Fig. 1C). Small-to medium-sized cells were present in both spleen and lymph nodes, and expressed markers of mature T-cells–CD3, CD5, TCRβ, and CD8 were negative for the expression of CD4, TCRγδ, NK-1.1, and CD16 (Fig. 1, C and D and not shown). In one case, we also observed a development of CD4+CD8+ immature TCL suggesting that decreased Dnmt3b levels may promote transformation of T-cells at earlier stages of the development (Figs. 1D and S1). Dnmt3b+/− lymphomas were likely monoclonal because most T-cells in the tumor uniformly expressed the same TCR receptor, e.g., TCR-vβ 5.1 to 5.2 in tumor 1 or TCR-vβ 7 in tumor 2 (Fig. 1E). Cells showed full tumorigenic potential as transplantation of Dnmt3a+/- lymphoma cells induced peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) within 2 months in sublethally irradiated wild-type FVB recipient mice and while the same effect could be also observed upon subsequent transplantation of cells from tumors developed in recipient mice (Fig. 1, F and G). Tumors retained expression of Dnmt3b from wild-type allele suggesting that decreased levels of Dnmt3b, but not a complete inactivation, are sufficient to drive the disease development (Figs. 1H and S2). While Dnmt1 protein was downregulated, Dnmt3a level was increased in Dnmt3b+/- TCL possibly reflecting functional compensation for decreased Dnmt1/3b levels (Fig. 1H). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the long-term Dnmt3b heterozygosity results in development of mostly mature CD8-positive TCLs similar to human PTCL–not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). The second most common disease observed in Dnmt3b+/− cohort was a CLL-like disease observed in three mice and characterized by splenomegaly and CD5+B220+CD19+ B-1a cells expansion of more than 20% in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow (Figs. 1A, 2, A–C, S1 and data not shown). Three mice showed signs of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL)—a less progressed form of CLL—in which the percentage of B-1a cells (CD5+B220+CD19+) in the blood is between 2% and 20%, with simultaneous expansion in the spleen and bone marrow (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Importantly, splenic cells from mice with either MBL or CLL were able to induce disease in recipient mice (Fig. 2, D and E), demonstrating that both populations contain true leukemic cells. Therefore, we refer to both conditions as CLL-like disease. In addition to PTCL and CLL, we also observed the development of a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in one of the Dnmt3b+/− mice (Figs. 1A, S1 and data not shown). These mice showed expansion of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow (data not shown). Thus, our data identify Dnmt3b as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in the prevention of TCLs and CLL that also may play a role in prevention of myeloid malignancies in mice. Gene knockout of one allele in Dnmt3b+/− mice decreases all functions of Dnmt3b protein including CA, AF, and methylation-independent repressive functions, thus precluding us to appreciate individual activities in in vivo. To determine the extent to which Dnmt3b CA plays a role in hematopoiesis and in its TS functions, we next utilized allele expressing catalytically inactive Dnmt3b (Dnmt3bCI) from endogenous locus. Dnmt3BWT and Dnmt3bCI protein levels are similar in mouse embryo and adult tissues demonstrating that an amino acid substitutions did not adversely affect regulation of Dnmt3b expression or protein stability as we reported previously (17Nowialis P. Lopusna K. Opavska J. Haney S.L. Abraham A. Sheng P. Riva A. Natarajan A. Guryanova O. Simpson M. Hlady R. Xie M. Opavsky R. Catalytically inactive Dnmt3b rescues mouse embryonic development by accessory and repressive functions.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unlike Dnmt3b-/- mice, Dnmt3bCI/CI mice survived embryogenesis, but the importance of Dnmt3b CA in adult mice remains unclear (17Nowialis P. Lopusna K. Opavska J. Haney S.L. Abraham A. Sheng P. Riva A. Natarajan A. Guryanova O. Simpson M. Hlady R. Xie M. Opavsky R. Catalytically inactive Dnmt3b rescues mouse embryonic development by accessory and repressive functions.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As a prelude to assessing its role in hematopoiesis, we first analyzed postnatal development in cohorts of Dnmt3b+/CI and Dnmt3bCI/CI mice. Dnmt3b+/CI mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates and lived long lives. Dnmt3bCI/CI mice were relatively normal, but their body weight was ∼20% lower than wild-type littermates at weaning, and this difference persisted throughout their postnatal lives (Fig. 3, A and B). Despite decreased size, both Dnmt3bCI/CI males and females had normal life span and were fertile with litter size similar to controls (Fig. 3C). However, inguinal fat was significantly reduced with smaller white adipose tissue (WAT) deposits in Dnmt3bCI/CI mice compared with controls (Fig. 3, D and E). Additionally, inguinal WAT showed presence of multilocular, brown-like adipocytes suggesting that Dnmt3b‘s CA plays a role in regulation of their development (Fig. 3, F and G). Previously, a development of brown adipocytes was linked to hypomethylation of genes responsible for mitochondrial respiratory chain and fatty acid oxidation (37Xiao H. Kang S. The role of DNA methylation in thermogenic adipose biology.Epigenetics. 2019; 14: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) is implicated in a regulation of fat deposition and body size (38Stratikopoulos E. Szabolcs M. Dragatsis I. Klinakis A. Efstratiadis A. The hormonal action of IGF1 in postnatal mouse growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 19378-19383Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we next analyzed its expression in liver—a major organ for its production - of Dnmt3bCI/CI mice and found a small but significant reduction in transcript levels (Fig. 3H). Cerebral hyperplasia was also observed in Dnmt3bCI/CI mice, but the molecular mechanism behind this remains unclear (Fig. S3A). Dnmt3bCI/CI also had craniofacial defects including shortened nose, which is typical of ICF syndrome observed in humans and linked to DNMT3B mutations (Fig. S3, B and C). Consistently with the syndrome, hematopoiesis was less efficient with mildly decreased production of CD11b+ myeloid, CD3+ T-cells, and especially CD19+ B220+ B-cells observed in the spleens of Dnmt3bCI/CI mice (Figs. 3, I and J and S4). Altogether, our data show that Dnmt3b’s CA is dispensable for postnatal development and fertility, but its absence results in a decreased body weight at least partially due to a fat deposition decrease likely associated with reduced Igf1 production in Dnmt3bCI/CI mice. Loss of Dnmt3b’s CA induces phenotypes consistent with ICF syndrome in humans, in particular craniofacial defects and less efficient adult hematopoiesis. To determine if Dnmt3b’s CA is important for its TS function in mouse spontaneous lymphomagenesis, we compared survival in cohorts of Dnmt3b+/+, Dnmt3b+/CI, and Dnmt3bCI/CI mice. Similar to Dnmt3b+/−, Dnmt3b+/CI mice developed a spectrum of hematologic malignancies including TCL, CLL, and myeloproliferation (Figs. 4A and S5). Compared with Dnmt3b+/− mice with 44%, a combined disease penetrance in Dnmt3b+/CI mice was reduced to 35% (23/67mice) with 65% of mice remaining healthy during the observational period of 18 months. Importantly, the disease spectrum was substantially changed with MBL and CLL being the most frequent diseases observed in these mice 20% (13/67 mice) and 6% (4/67 mice), respectively (Figs. 4A and S5). MBL and CLL were characterized by enlarged spleen and expansion of CD5+CD19 + B220+ cells in the spleen and blood (Fig. 4, B–D and not shown) similar to Dnmt3b+/− mice. These cells induced disease in recipient mice upon serial transplantation into sublethally irradiated mice demonstrating their true leukemic nature (Fig. 4E). In addition, we also observed a development of immature BCL characterized by expansion of CD19+CD5-IgM-IgD-cells in the spleen (Fig. 4F). TCL development was less frequent relative to Dnmt3b+/− mice with only 4% (3/67) of mice developing CD8+ TCL (Figs. 4A, S5 and S6). As observed in Dnmt3b+/− TCL, Dnmt3b+/CI TCL tumors were serially transplantable into sublethally irradiated recipient mice demonstrating full tumorigenic transformation (not shown). In total, 2/67 mice developed myeloproliferation characterized by expansion of CD11B-cells in the bone marrow (Fig. S7). While the disease spectrum was similar in Dnmt3bCI/CI mice, the penetrance of leukemia/lymphoma development was decreased with 31% of observed mice developing MBL/CLL and PTCL (Fig. 4A). In summary, these data suggest that CA contributes substantially to Dnmt3b’s TS function, in particular in B-cell malignancies. The development of TCL and CLL in Dnmt3b+/− mice resembles phenotypes observed in Dnmt3a+/− and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ mice raising a possibility that similar molecular events drive lymphomagenesis in these settings (26Peters S.L.

We previously reported that σ1RE102Q elicits toxicity in cells. The σ1R forms oligomeric states that are regulated by ligands. Nevertheless, little is known about the effect of ALS-related mutations on oligomer formation. Here, we transfected NSC-34 cells, a motor neuronal cell line, and HEK293T cells with σ1R-mCherry (mCh), σ1RE102Q-mCh, or nontagged forms to investigate detergent solubility and subcellular distribution using immunocytochemistry and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The oligomeric state was determined using crosslinking procedure. σ1Rs were soluble to detergents, whereas the mutants accumulated in the insoluble fraction. Within the soluble fraction, peak distribution of mutants appeared in higher sucrose density fractions. Mutants formed intracellular aggregates that were co-stained with p62, ubiquitin, and phosphorylated pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2-α kinase in NSC-34 cells but not in HEK293T cells. The aggregates had significantly lower recovery in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Acute treatment with σ1R agonist SA4503 failed to improve recovery, whereas prolonged treatment for 48 h significantly decreased σ1RE102Q-mCh insolubility and inhibited apoptosis. Whereas σ1R-mCh formed monomers and dimers, σ1RE102Q-mCh also formed trimers and tetramers. SA4503 reduced accumulation of the four types in the insoluble fraction and increased monomers in the soluble fraction. The σ1RE102Q insolubility was diminished by σ1R-mCh co-expression. These results suggest that the agonist and WT σ1R modify the detergent insolubility, toxicity, and oligomeric state of σ1RE102Q, which may lead to promising new treatments for σ1R-related ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3093393350,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy metabolism that phosphorylates a wide range of proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. AMPK consists of three subunits: α, β, and γ. AMPKα and β are encoded by two genes, the γ subunit by three genes, all of which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. It is not fully understood, whether individual isoforms have different functions. Using RNA-Seq technology, we provide evidence that the loss of AMPKβ1 and AMPKβ2 lead to different gene expression profiles in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), indicating isoform-specific function. The knockout of AMPKβ2 was associated with a higher number of differentially regulated genes than the deletion of AMPKβ1, suggesting that AMPKβ2 has a more comprehensive impact on the transcriptome. Bioinformatics analysis identified cell differentiation as one biological function being specifically associated with AMPKβ2. Correspondingly, the two isoforms differentially affected lineage decision toward a cardiac cell fate. Although the lack of PRKAB1 impacted differentiation into cardiomyocytes only at late stages of cardiac maturation, the availability of PRKAB2 was indispensable for mesoderm specification as shown by gene expression analysis and histochemical staining for cardiac lineage markers such as cTnT, GATA4, and NKX2.5. Ultimately, the lack of AMPKβ1 impairs, whereas deficiency of AMPKβ2 abrogates differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that AMPK affects cellular physiology by engaging in the regulation of hiPSC transcription in an isoform-specific manner, providing the basis for further investigations elucidating the role of dedicated AMPK subunits in the modulation of gene expression."

Forty-five fecal samples of barking deer were collected from the study area (Murree-Kotli Sattian-Kahuta National Pak); summer (28) and winter (17). The micro-histological analysis revealed that more plant species are available in its habitat during the summer season (27) as compared to winter (19). Due to browsing nature barking deer mostly feed on trees in both seasons. While shrubs are slightly higher in winters. In summer barking deer consumed 10 Trees, 6 Shrubs, 5 Herbs, and 6 kinds of grass species. Dominant tree species were Phyllanthus emblica and Acacia modesta .

Now it has been recognized that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a key regulation paradigm in the physiology and pathology of prokaryotes (9Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Deutscher J. Mijakovic I.

Bacteriol. 2019; 201: e00205-e00219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Yet, our knowledge on prokaryotic protein tyrosine phosphorylation system is very limited. Vibrio vulnificus is the most deadly foodborne pathogen, causing gastroenteritis, wound infection, and severe septicaemia with an over 50% mortality rate (12Baker-Austin C. Oliver J.D. Vibrio vulnificus: New insights into a deadly opportunistic pathogen.Environ. Microbiol. 2018; 20: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is also an important pathogen for marine animals, causing huge economic loss in aquaculture industry (13Fouz B. Larsen J.L. Amaro C. Vibrio vulnificus serovar A: An emerging pathogen in European anguilliculture.J. Fish Dis. 2006; 29: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In V. vulnificus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in the production of capsular polysaccharide (CPS), one essential virulence factor for the pathogen to escape host immune response (14Pettis G.S. Mukerji A.S. Structure, function, and regulation of the essential virulence factor capsular polysaccharide of Vibrio vulnificus.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 3259Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The CPS synthesis gene locus of V. vulnificus is similar to that of the group 1 or 4 capsules of Escherichia coli (15Wright A.C. Powell J.L. Kaper J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Identification of a group 1-like capsular polysaccharide operon for Vibrio vulnificus.Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6893-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and CPS production has been basically elucidated. Three conserved proteins Wza-Wzb-Wzc are responsible for polymerization control and translocation of CPS (16Sachdeva S. Palur R.V. Sudhakar K.U. Rathinavelan T. E. coli group 1 capsular polysaccharide exportation nanomachinary as a plausible antivirulence target in the perspective of emerging antimicrobial resistance.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specifically, Wza is the translocon of CPS, while Wzc and Wzb form a kinase/phosphatase pair required for high-level polymerization of polysaccharide (Fig. 1). Wzc belongs to the family of bacterial tyrosine kinases (BY kinases), a distinct class of kinases that have no homologs in eukaryotes. Wzc acts as an autokinase to phosphorylate its own tyrosine-rich C-terminal tail and other sites, resulting in a high phosphorylated Wzc, while the cognate phosphatase Wzb dephosphorylates Wzc to a low phosphorylation state. The cycling of Wzc between high and low phosphorylation states regulates the production of CPS, with the mechanism remaining elusive (16Sachdeva S. Palur R.V. Sudhakar K.U. Rathinavelan T. E. coli group 1 capsular polysaccharide exportation nanomachinary as a plausible antivirulence target in the perspective of emerging antimicrobial resistance.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Whitfield C. Biosynthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The exact situation in V. vulnificus is unknown yet but supposed to work in an analogous manner. Nevertheless, there are experiment evidences to directly connect tyrosine phosphorylation to CPS production in V. vulnificus. In studies of colony morphologies, Wzb of V. vulnificus (VvWzb) was found to be a switch of morphological transition among opaque, translucent, and intermediate phases through controlling CPS production (18Chatzidaki-Livanis M. Jones M.K. Wright A.C. Genetic variation in the Vibrio vulnificus group 1 capsular polysaccharide operon.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Deletion of VvWzb led to CPS production defect and attenuated virulence of the bacterium. It was also observed that the expression levels of Wzb and Wzc were correlated to CPS production (19Phippen B.L. Oliver J.D. Role of anaerobiosis in capsule production and biofilm formation in Vibrio vulnificus.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). So far, V. vulnificus Wzb and Wzc have not been biochemically characterized yet, which hinders further understanding of the phosphorylation events in this deadly pathogen. In this study, we would focus on the characterization of VvWzb. VvWzb belongs to the family of low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP). LMWPTPs are small (ca. 18 kDa), evolutionally conserved and important enzymes involved in various cellular processes of all kingdoms of life (20Caselli A. Paoli P. Santi A. Mugnaioni C. Toti A.

So far, a number of structures of LMWPTPs from both eukaryotes and prokaryotes have been determined (21Su X.D. Taddeit N. Stefanl M. Ramponlt G. Nordlund P.

They share a common α/β fold; the active site crevice is composed of three characteristic loops, named the P-, D-, and W-loops, respectively. The P-loop bears the characteristic active-site motif “CXGNXCRS” (X can be any amino acid) with the first cysteine as the catalytic nucleophile; this loop is at the bottom of the active site crevice, extensively interacting with the phosphate group of substrate, thus named P-loop. The D-loop forms a wall of the active site crevice. It contains a catalytically important aspartate residue, which acts as a general acid/base, and also contains a tyrosine residue to stabilize the phenyl ring of the substrate. The third is a variable loop, forming another wall of the active site crevice and being responsible for substrate recognition. In the structures of eukaryotic and some prokaryotic LMWPTPs, an aromatic residue such as tryptophan is located at the variable loop to interact with the phenyl ring of the tyrosine phosphate. Thus, this loop is conveniently called W-loop. Nevertheless, the study on the structure of E. coli Wzb (EcWzb) uncovered another type of W-loop in prokaryotic LMWPTPs, which lacks this important aromatic residue and thus recognizes substrate in a different way (23Lescop E. Hu Y. Xu H. Hu W. Chen J. Xia B. Jin C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19570-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Noticeably, this study also showed that the W-loop type is a good marker to classify LMWPTPs. Indeed, the phylogenetic analysis confirmed that LMWPTPs can be divided into two categories, in agreement with the W-loop forms they have (23Lescop E. Hu Y. Xu H. Hu W. Chen J. Xia B. Jin C.

Hereafter, we would name the two categories of LMWPTPs as group I and II, prototyped by mammalian LMWPTPs and EcWzb, respectively. Interestingly, VvWzb is different from any structurally known LMWPTP by harboring a unique short sequence insertion in the W-loop, excluding VvWzb from either group (Fig. 2A). It is unclear if this could challenge the current classification paradigm of LMWPTP family. It also remains to know if the unique insertion would endow VvWzb with some new structural and enzymatic features. Herein, we report crystal structures of free VvWzb, VvWzb complexed with benzylphosphonate, and VvWzbC9A complexed with phosphate. The structural and enzymatic analyses of VvWzb shed new insight into the classification and catalytic mechanism of the LMWPTP family. Our study also provides critical structural information for antivirulence drug design against V. vulnificus. VvWzb crystallized in the space group P212121, with two protein molecules in one asymmetric unit. The two molecules formed a dimer in the crystal, with an interface area of about 900 Å2. However, this seems to be a crystallographic dimer, since VvWzb existed as a monomer in solution, indicated by gel filtration (Fig. S1). The structural model was built in good quality (Table 1). VvWzb adopts a typical LMWPTP α/β fold (Fig. 2B). In the middle is a twisted parallel β-sheet formed by four β-strands in the sequence of β4-β3-β1-β2; flanking the central β-sheet are five α-helices, with α4, α3 at one side and α1, α2, α5 at the other. The P-loop (between β1 and α1), D-loop (between β4 and α5), and W-loop (between β2 and α2) cluster together to form the active site crevice (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the W-loop of VvWzb is longer than any known LMWPTP structure, due to a “40EKSR43” insertion (Fig. 2A). The W-loop adopts an extended conformation and protrudes from the protein body. The region harboring the unique insertion forms a small β-hairpin including two short β-strands (β1’ and β2’).Table 1Crystallographic statisticsParameterVvWzbVvWzb-benzylphosphonateVvWzbC9A-phosphateData collection statistics X-ray sourceBL19U1BL19U1BL18U1 Wavelength (Å)0.97880.97880.9792 Space groupP21 21 21P1P21 21 21 Unit-cell dimensions (Å or °)a = 47.32, b = 48.74, c = 117.32a = 44.11, b = 51.01, c = 68.59a = 60.97, b = 68.30, c = 132.96α = 90.00, β = 90.00, γ = 90.00α = 101.85, β = 95.56, γ = 103.79α = 90.00, β = 90.00, γ = 90.00 Resolution (Å)58.66−1.711 (1.740−1.711)48.14−2.785 (2.833−2.785)66.48−1.211 (1.232−1.211) Unique reflections29,957 (1506)13,744 (689)161,631 (7689) Completeness (%)99.5 (99.7)97.9 (97.9)95.7 (92.6) Mean I/sigma(I)19.2 (2.3)16.4 (2.3)17.9 (2.2) Multiplicity12.6 (12.9)3.6 (3.6)13.6 (13.9) Rmerge (%)8.5 (118.8)4.7 (56.8)7.8 (107.7) Rmeasure (%)8.8 (123.8)5.5 (66.6)8.1 (111.8) Rpim (%)2.5 (34.3)2.9 (34.5)2.2 (29.7) CC1/2 (%)99.9 (78.8)99.9 (81.1)99.9 (93.3)Refinement statistics Resolution range (Å)58.66−1.7148.14−2.7929.72−1.211 Rwork/Rfree (%)a∼5% of the reflections were selected randomly for calculating Rfree.19.9/22.318.6/22.614.3/16.9 Modeled residuesA: −1 to 146B: −1 to 146A: 1−146B: 0−146C: 1−146D: 1−146A: 1−146B: 1−146C: −2 to 146D: −2 to 146 Ligands2 Cl−4 benzylphosphonate4 phosphate ions, 1 glycerol Water molecules270None679 rmsd bond lengths (Å)0.0100.0100.002 rmsd bond angles (°)1.021.120.59 Ramachandran outliers000PDB code7DHD7DHE7DHFValues in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.a ∼5% of the reflections were selected randomly for calculating Rfree.

In the presence of benzylphosphonate, a compound that mimics the phenylphosphate moiety of the substrate phosphotyrosine, VvWzb and VvWzbC9A crystallized in space groups P1 and P212121, respectively. Both crystals contained four protein molecules in one asymmetric unit. The dimeric form observed in the free VvWzb crystal did not show up again, and instead two adjacent molecules were covalently crosslinked via a disulphide bond formed by the Cys61 residues of both molecules. We were able to model one benzylphosphonate molecule (with occupancy of 1 and B-factor of 82.8, 142.8, 109.6, or 89.9 Å2) for each of the four protein chains in the wild-type (WT) structure (Figs. 2C and 3A). However, only phosphate ions were identified in VvWzbC9A structure, judged by the unambiguous electron density (Figs. 2D and 3B). The source of the phosphate ion was not defined, presumably from benzylphosphonate degradation or contamination. The overall structures of VvWzb-benzylphosphonate and VvWzbC9A-phosphate are similar to that of free VvWzb, except that the W-loop underwent significant conformational changes to fold toward the active site in both structures (Fig. 2, C and D). Like other LMWPTPs, the active site crevice of free VvWzb is composed of the P-loop (residues Cys9−Ser16), D-loop (residues Lys115−Gln123), and W-loop (residues Ile37−Lys47) (Figs. 2A and 4A). The P-loop, containing the catalytic motif 9CVGNICRS16, with Cys9 as the catalytic nucleophile, forms the bottom part of the crevice. The residues Asp119, Tyr121, and Arg122 of the D-loop are stacked together above the P-loop to form a wall of the crevice, and the W-loop forms the opposite wall. The W-loop of VvWzb, which is longer than any known LMWPTP by harboring a four-residue insert (40EKSR43), bulges out, with residues Ser42, Arg43, and Leu44 located at the tip region and residue Glu40 pointing toward the active site. Compared with the D-loop wall, which is relatively orthogonal to the P-loop bottom, the W-loop wall seems to be laid flat. In such a configuration, the active site crevice of free VvWzb is wide and shallow, being readily accessible for the substrate (Fig. S2). Due to the presence of Glu40, the W-loop wall region of the crevice is negatively charged. In the absence of ligand, the supposed phosphate-binding site is occupied by a chloride ion and a few water molecules; they interact with the P- and D-loop residues via extensive hydrogen bonding (Fig. 4A). In VvWzb-benzylphosphonate complex, the substrate-mimicking benzylphosphonate is located at the bottom of the active site crevice. Its phosphonate group forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the P-loop, including the main chain amide groups of the residues Val10, Gly11, Asn12, Ile13, Cys14, and Arg15, as well as the sulfhydryl group of Cys9 and the side-chain guanidine group of Arg15. The benzyl group of benzylphosphonate is flanked by residues Val10 of the P-loop and Tyr121 of the D-loop and further stabilized by Leu44 of the W-loop and Ile13 of the P-loop via hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4B). Compared with the free structure, the W-loop undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement from an open to a closed conformation. Consequently, Glu40 is no longer oriented toward the active site cavity but turns outside. Instead, side chains of Ser42 and Leu44 turn to face the active site, forming the W-loop wall. In addition, side chains of Asp119 and Tyr121 of the D-loop also made small local conformational changes to interact with the ligand (Fig. 4, A and B). All these conformational changes significantly reconfigure the active site crevice, which is narrower and deeper in shape as well as more positively charged compared with that of free VvWzb (Fig. S2). VvWzbC9A-phosphate shares a similar active site structure with the VvWzb-benzylphosphonate complex. Mutating Cys9 to an alanine residue that has a short and uncharged side chain allowed the phosphate ion to burry deeper in the active site than the phosphonate moiety of benzylphosphonate (Fig. 3C). As a result, the hydrogen bonds between the phosphate ion and the P-loop residues are generally shorter than those observed in VvWzb-benzylphosphonate, suggesting a stronger binding. Among these interactions, two hydrogen bonds contributed by the main-chain NH and the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser16 are not observed in the VvWzb-benzylphosphonate complex. Overall, the structure of VvWzbC9A-phosphate mimics that of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate, judged by the position and orientation of the phosphate ion (28Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Crystal structures of a low-molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its complex with the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Zhang M.

Crystal structure of bovine low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl phosphatase complexed with the transition state analog vanadate.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At the distance of about 3.5 Å to the phosphorous atom, we identified a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with Asp119 (Fig. 4C). This water molecule is assumed to be activated by Asp119 and functions as a nucleophile in the dephosphorylation reaction of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate. The phosphate ion does not interact directly with the D- and W-loop residues; however, the conformations of these loops are similar to those observed in VvWzb-benzylphosphonate complex, suggesting that the phosphate ion alone is sufficient to induce the conformational changes of the D- and W-loops. The electrostatically repelling between Glu40 and the phosphate ion is supposed to be an important driving force for the structural rearrangement of the W-loop. Overall, the shape and charge distribution of the active site crevice are similar to that in the VvWzb-benzylphosphonate complex. As expected, a number of known LMWPTPs were identified by the Dali server to be structurally similar to VvWzb. Generally, VvWzb shares more similarity in structure and sequence with the EcWzb-prototyped group II LMWPTPs (rmsd of aligned Cα atoms of 0.8–0.9 Å2, sequence identity of 52–58%) than the group I LMWPTPs prototyped by mammalian LMWPTPs (rmsd of aligned Cα atoms of 1.4–1.9 Å2, sequence identity of 22–37%). In addition, arsenate reductases were also identified to be structurally similar to VvWzb (rmsd of aligned Cα atoms of about 2.1 Å2, sequence identity of about 23%), supporting the proposal that LMWPTP originated from prokaryotic arsenate reductase (20Caselli A. Paoli P. Santi A. Mugnaioni C. Toti A. Camici G. Cirri P. Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase: Multifaceted functions of an evolutionarily conserved enzyme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1864: 1339-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We chose two typical LMWPTPs, group II prototype EcWzb (PDB ID: 2WJA, sequence identity of 57% to VvWzb) and group I prototype BPTP (PDB ID: 1DG9, sequence identity of 29% to VvWzb) for comparison to understand the similarity and difference between VvWzb and other LMWPTPs (Fig. 5). All structures are in ligand-bound forms. Overall, structures of VvWzb, EcWzb, and BPTP could be well aligned for the regulatory secondary structures, with relatively large variations mainly occurring in the loop regions (Fig. 5A). We focused on the comparison of the active site crevices, which directly determine the substrate specificity and catalytic power. The P-loops of VvWzb, EcWzb, and BPTP contain the motifs “CVGNICRS”, “CTGNICRS,” and “CLGNICRS”, respectively. Despite the sequence variation at the second position of the catalytic motif, the P-loops of all structures are well superposed in space, in agreement with the conserved phosphate-binding function of this loop. Regarding the D-loop, VvWzb shares more similarity with EcWzb than with BPTP. VvWzb and EcWzb contain one tyrosine residue followed by an arginine residue in the D-loop, while BPTP contains two tyrosine residues (Tyr131 and Tyr132) (Fig. 5B). These two adjacent tyrosine residues are generally found in group I LMWPTPs, endowing their D-loops with a phosphorylation-mediated regulatory function (33Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases: Small, but smart.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on the D-loop has also been observed in group II LMWPTP (34Nadler C. Koby S. Peleg A. Johnson A.C. Suddala K.C. Sathiyamoorthy K. Smith B.E. Saper M.A. Rosenshine I. Cycling of Etk and Etp phosphorylation states is involved in formation of group 4 capsule by Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2012; 7e37984Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and could occur in VvWzb as well, due to the similar D-loop compositions. In group I LMWPTPs, the D-loop can undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding (35Stehle T. Sreeramulu S. Löhr F. Richter C. Saxena K. Jonker H.R.A. Schwalbe H.

A set of four foreign policy attitudes are explained upon individual- and regional level socio-economic and demographic correlates, of which poverty is the main focus, being represented here by several objective, subjective, uni- and multidimensional indicators. An indicator of deprivation is derived from a group of poverty indicators by the method Item Response Theory. Deprivation, subjective poverty, ethnicity and the Russian media influence are found to be associated with negative attitudes toward all foreign policies, while satisfaction with economic conditions in the country and a positive attitude toward refugees are both associated with positive attitudes toward all foreign policies."
https://openalex.org/W3119131971,"ETV6 is an E26 transformation specific family transcriptional repressor that self-associates by its PNT domain to facilitate cooperative DNA binding. Chromosomal translocations frequently generate constitutively active oncoproteins with the ETV6 PNT domain fused to the kinase domain of one of many protein tyrosine kinases. Although an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, the propensity of the ETV6 PNT domain to polymerize via the tight head-to-tail association of two relatively flat interfaces makes it challenging to identify suitable small molecule inhibitors of this protein–protein interaction. Herein, we provide a comprehensive biophysical characterization of the ETV6 PNT domain interaction interfaces to aid future drug discovery efforts and help define the mechanisms by which its self-association mediates transcriptional repression. Using NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations, along with amide hydrogen exchange measurements, we demonstrate that monomeric PNT domain variants adopt very stable helical bundle folds that do not change in conformation upon self-association into heterodimer models of the ETV6 polymer. Surface plasmon resonance–monitored alanine scanning mutagenesis studies identified hot spot regions within the self-association interfaces. These regions include both central hydrophobic residues and flanking salt-bridging residues. Collectively, these studies indicate that small molecules targeted to these hydrophobic or charged regions within the relatively rigid interfaces could potentially serve as orthosteric inhibitors of ETV6 PNT domain polymerization. ETV6 is an E26 transformation specific family transcriptional repressor that self-associates by its PNT domain to facilitate cooperative DNA binding.

ETV6 is a modular transcriptional repressor of the ETS (E26 transformation specific) family for which head-to-tail polymerization of its PNT (or SAM) domain facilitates cooperative binding to tandem DNA sites by its ETS domain (1Lopez R.G.

The defining DNA-binding ETS domain is conserved among all ETS transcription factors, whereas the PNT domain is present in approximately one-third of ETS paralogs (3Hollenhorst P.C. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J. Genomic and biochemical insights into the specificity of ETS transcription factors.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 437-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Unlike the monomeric PNT domains of most ETS factors, the ETV6 PNT domain self-associates in a head-to-tail fashion to form an open-ended, left-handed helical polymer (4Kim C.A. Bowie J.U.

The only other known self-associating PNT domains in the ETS family are those of Drosophila Yan (6Qiao F. Song H. Kim C.A. Sawaya M.R. Hunter J.B. Gingery M. Rebay I. Courey A.J. Bowie J.U.

Schindler J.W. Valk P.J.M. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H.

Although reported to recruit corepressors such as mSin3A, SMRT, and N-CoR (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which ETV6 regulates transcription require further investigation. Polymeric DNA-bound ETV6 is proposed to cause localized chromatin compaction to block access of the transcriptional machinery to target genes. This speculative model is based on the observation that the repeat distance of the helical polymer formed by the PNT domain is comparable to the width of the nucleosome core particle (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). ETV6 also has preeminent roles in cancer. Frequently, chromosomal translocations fuse gene fragments encoding the PNT domain of ETV6 with the kinase domain of one of many diverse receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) or to the DNA-binding domain from one of several transcription factors (14Bohlander S.K. ETV6: A versatile player in leukemogenesis.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Known receptor PTK fusion partners of ETV6 include PDGFβ, JAK2, FGFR3, and NTRK3. The resulting constitutively active self-associated oncoproteins have been linked to over 40 human leukemias, as well as fibrosarcomas, breast carcinomas, and nephromas (14Bohlander S.K.

Owing to its presence in numerous fusion oncoproteins, the ETV6 PNT domain is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (15De Braekeleer E. Douet-Guilbert N. Morel F. Le Bris M.-J. Basinko A. De Braekeleer M. ETV6 fusion genes in hematological malignancies: A review.Leuk. Res. 2012; 36: 945-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, its propensity to form long insoluble polymers via the tight head-to-tail association (KD ∼ nM) of two relatively flat interfaces (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) hinders identification of suitable small molecule inhibitors (17Gerak C.A.N. Zhang S.M. Balgi A.D. Sadowski I.J. Sessions R.B. McIntosh L.P. Roberge M. A multipronged screening approach targeting inhibition of ETV6 PNT domain polymerization.SLAS Discov. Adv. Sci. Drug Discov. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1177/2472555220979599Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These interfaces, termed the ML- and EH-surfaces (mid-loop and end-helix, respectively), lie roughly on opposite sides on the globular PNT domain (Fig. S1). Each is composed of a hydrophobic patch encompassed by polar and charged side chains. The introduction of an ionizable residue into either hydrophobic patch yields a monomeric PNT domain as judged by several techniques including equilibrium ultracentrifugation and native gel electrophoresis (10Mackereth C.D. Schärpf M. Gentile L.N. MacIntosh S.E. Slupsky C.M. McIntosh L.P. Diversity in structure and function of the Ets family PNT domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1249-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Examples include the V112E or V112R mutations that disrupt the EH-surface or the A93D mutation that disrupts the ML-surface. Two such mutant PNT domains with complementary wild-type interfaces can still form a heterodimer. The availability of these monomeric and heterodimeric forms of the PNT domain facilitates studies of ETV6 self-association. In the case of the ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the introduction of monomerizing mutations blocked the ability of EN to polymerize, to activate its PTK, and to transform NIH3T3 cells (18Tognon C.E. Mackereth C.D. Somasiri A.M. McIntosh L.P. Sorensen P.H.B. Mutations in the SAM domain of the ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric tyrosine kinase block polymerization and transformation activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4636-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when co-expressed, the isolated PNT domain had a dominant-negative effect on EN-transformed cells (18Tognon C.E. Mackereth C.D. Somasiri A.M. McIntosh L.P. Sorensen P.H.B. Mutations in the SAM domain of the ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric tyrosine kinase block polymerization and transformation activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4636-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that weakening polymerization by disrupting a peripheral intermolecular salt bridge (K99-D101) also abrogated the ability of EN to transform NIH 3T3 cells (19Cetinbas N. Huang-Hobbs H. Tognon C. Leprivier G. An J. McKinney S. Bowden M. Chow C. Gleave M. McIntosh L.P. Sorensen P.H. Mutation of the salt bridge-forming residues in the ETV6-SAM domain interface blocks ETV6-NTRK3-induced cellular transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27940-27950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies demonstrated that inhibiting PNT domain polymerization is indeed a viable therapeutic strategy against ETV6-driven cancers. Understanding the mechanisms of PNT domain polymerization will yield insights in the transcriptional repression properties of ETV6 and the oncogenic properties of ETV6 fusions. In particular, defining structural and thermodynamic differences between monomeric and heterodimeric forms of the PNT domain and determining “hot spot” regions for self-association are both important for delineating the mechanisms underlying polymerization and for developing strategies to inhibit this process. Herein, using NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the structures of monomeric ETV6 PNT domain variants do not change significantly upon mutation or self-association into heterodimers. Amide hydrogen exchange (HX) measurements confirmed that the monomeric PNT domain is very stable in solution. Protection against exchange increased upon heterodimerization for amides clustering near the self-association interfaces. Complementary alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed several hot spot regions within these ML- and EH-surfaces. These residues partake in both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and can serve as starting points for targeted rational drug design. The NMR spectroscopy can give insights into the thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural mechanisms of protein–ligand interactions. A particularly convenient approach is to use 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra to monitor the titration of a 15N-labeled protein with an unlabeled, and hence NMR silent, ligand such as another protein (20Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Amide chemical shifts are highly sensitive to even subtle environmental changes, and thus an interaction with the unlabeled species can usually be detected through chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of the labeled protein. Amides exhibiting CSPs typically cluster around the protein–ligand interface, yet may also be distal if binding causes longer range (allosteric) structural changes (20Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). To begin this interrogation, purified samples of uniformly 13C/15N-labeled ETV6 fragments (residues 40–125; Table S1) that contain either an A93D mutation or V112E mutation (henceforth described as the A93D-PNT or V112E-PNT domains, respectively) were prepared for NMR spectroscopic characterization. Under neutral pH solution conditions, the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains yielded well-dispersed NMR spectra indicative of stably folded structures (Fig. 1A). However, the latter showed some propensity to self-associate, and improved spectra were obtained at a sample pH value of 8.0. Presumably, this reflects the deprotonation of E112, which may have an anomalously high pKa value when buried at the polymer interface (21Nauli S. Farr S. Lee Y.-J. Kim H.-Y. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymer-driven crystallization.Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2542-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Poulos S. Agah S. Jallah N. Faham S. Symmetry based assembly of a 2 dimensional protein lattice.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0174485Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the more alkaline conditions resulted in some loss of signal intensity because of base-catalyzed HX. Upon addition of the unlabeled V112E-PNT domain to the 15N-labeled A93D-PNT domain, many amides exhibited CSPs in the slow exchange regime (Figs. 1B and S2). That is, at an intermediate titration point, separate 1HN-15N peaks corresponding to the unbound (monomeric) and bound (heterodimeric) forms of the labeled protein were observed. This is consistent with the previously reported KD value of ∼2 nM for the high-affinity binding equilibrium (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Comparable results were observed for the reciprocal titration of the unlabeled A93D-PNT domain to the 15N-labeled V112E-PNT domain (Fig. 1B). Although the oligomerization states of the PNT domains in these experiments were not directly determined, the results are entirely consistent with previous studies showing that the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains are monomeric when separated and heterodimeric when combined (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Through a combination of scalar and NOE correlation experiments, NMR signals were assigned from most main chain 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei of the V112E-PNT and A93D-PNT domains in their monomeric forms and as heterodimers with their unlabeled partners (Figs. S3–S6). Utilizing the motif identification from chemical shift algorithm (23Shen Y. Bax A. Identification of helix capping and β-turn motifs from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 52: 211-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the secondary structural elements for the four species were predicted from these chemical shifts. In each case, four distinct helical regions were detected (Fig. 1C). These coincide well with the four α-helices (H1: R63-E76; H2: G91-L94; H3: K99-R105; H4: G110-K122) identified in the X-ray crystal structures of the self-associated ETV6 PNT domains (PDB: 1JI7 and 1LKY) by PDBsum (24Laskowski R.A. Jabłońska J. Pravda L. Vařeková R.S. Thornton J.M. PDBsum: Structural summaries of PDB entries.Protein Sci. 2018; 27: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Matching two short N-terminal 310-helices observed in these crystal structures, residues A52-L54 and, to a lesser extent, P58-Y60 also have chemical shifts indicative of helical character. In contrast, such diagnostic chemical shifts were not seen for residues S84-T86 even though they are classified as a forming a 310-helix in a subset of the monomer subunits of PDB file 1LKY. This minor discrepancy may arise because these residues are within an extended, solvent exposed polypeptide segment between helices H1 and H2. Amides in this region have chemical shift-derived random coil index-squared order parameter values (RCI-S2, a proxy for backbone dynamics (25Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar)) indicative of increased flexibility relative to the well-ordered helices (Fig. 1C). Most importantly, these analyses demonstrated that the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains have very similar secondary structures in their monomeric and heterodimeric forms. Thus, the proteins in solution do not undergo any significant conformational changes upon mutation or association into the structures previously characterized by X-ray crystallography. Armed with chemical shift assignments, the amide 1HN-15N CSPs resulting from PNT domain dimerization were readily calculated. Of note, residues in the 15N-labeled A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains that experienced the greatest spectral perturbations cluster within the EH- and ML-surfaces, respectively (Fig. 2). This confirms that, as seen by X-ray crystallography, the two monomerized PNT domains indeed associate in solution through their wild-type interfaces. In their original studies, the Bowie group obtained crystals of the V112E-PNT domain (PDB: 1JI7, C2 space group, three monomers in the asymmetric unit) (13Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Despite burial of E112, the monomers assembled in the crystal lattice via their ML- and EH-surfaces to form an extended helical polymer with an approximate 65 screw symmetry (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, they determined the structure of a heterodimer composed of a A93D-PNT domain bound to a V112R-PNT domain via their complementary wild-type interfaces (PDB: 1LKY, P1 space group, 3 heterodimers in the asymmetric unit) (5Tran H.H. Kim C.A. Faham S. Siddall M. Bowie J.U. Native interface of the SAM domain polymer of TEL.BMC Struct. Biol. 2002; 2: 5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no longer polymeric within the crystal lattice, a model built from PDB: 1LKY using appropriate monomers subunits with native interfaces closely matched the polymeric structure of PDB: 1JI7 with the V112 E substitution. Thus, the latter serves as a reliable experimental structure of the ETV6 PNT domain polymer. The NMR spectroscopic studies presented above indicate that the secondary structures and binding interfaces of the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains in solution closely resemble those observed by X-ray crystallography. However, the PNT domain in a complexed form may have subtle structural differences relative to a monomeric form. To examine this possibility, a variant with both A93D and V112 E mutations was generated and found to crystallize in 2.8 M sodium acetate at pH 7.0. Its structure was solved to 1.86 Å resolution using molecular replacement (Table S2). The A93D-V112E-PNT domain crystallized in the space group P6522 with two monomers in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3B). Most importantly, the presence of both monomerizing mutations prevented any intermonomer interactions within the crystal lattice via the ML- and EH-surfaces. Rather, nearest neighbor contacts were via alternative interfaces that are not relevant to polymerization of the wild-type PNT domain. Regardless of differing crystallization conditions and mutations, the structure of the A93D-V112E-PNT domain closely resembles those previously determined for other ETV6 PNT domain variants. Using the DALI server to compare one subunit from this structure with a A93D-PNT domain subunit from PBD entry 1LKY, a total of 77 residues were aligned with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) value of 0.7 Å and Z-score of 16.8 (26Holm L. Sander C. DALI: A network tool for protein structure comparison.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). However, a few subtle differences can be seen upon detailed comparison (Fig. 3C). For example, residues N-terminal to helix H1 have variable conformations. This is consistent with their RCI-S2 scores indicating a degree of flexibility (Fig. 1C). Not unexpectedly, several surface residues adopted different side chain rotamer conformations, whereas residues within the interior hydrophobic core of the PNT domain superimposed well. Most importantly, the local structural features of the ML- (including residue 93) and EH- (including residue 112) surfaces do not differ despite the presence or absence of monomerizing mutations or their association upon heterodimer or polymer formation. Thus, interactions of the ETV6 PNT domain do not contribute to any discernible conformational changes between its monomeric, heterodimeric, or polymeric forms. Amide HX is a useful technique to characterize protein structure, stability, and dynamics, as well as identifying ligand-binding interfaces (27Paterson Y. Englander S.W. Roder H. An antibody binding site on cytochrome c defined by hydrogen exchange and two-dimensional NMR.Science. 1990; 249: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 28Dyson H.J. Kostic M. Liu J. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange strategy for delineation of contact sites in protein complexes.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Identification of protein – protein interfaces by decreased amide solvent accessibility.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14705-14710Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Through a continuum of local to global conformational fluctuations, main chain amide hydrogens are constantly exchanging with the hydrogens of solvent water (30Skinner J.J. Lim W.K. Bédard S. Black B.E. Englander S.W. Protein hydrogen exchange: Testing current models.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If a labile amide proton exchanges for a deuteron, it will become silent for 1H-detected NMR, and thus, its signal will disappear from an 15N-HSQC spectrum. The rate at which it disappears is determined by its structural features (e.g., hydrogen bonding and solvent accessibility), as well as the experimental conditions (e.g., pH and temperature). To account for the latter, the observed exchange rate constant can be compared with the predicted rate constant for a random coil polypeptide with the same sequence and under the same conditions. The ratio of the predicted versus observed rate constants is the protection factor (PF). To gain further insights into the ETV6 PNT domain dynamics, NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the amide PFs of its monomeric and heterodimeric forms. By comparing the spectra recorded after 3 days of exchange (Fig. 4A), it is immediately obvious that more amides were protected from HX in the heterodimeric versus monomeric species. Exchange rate constants for most amides were determined by fitting their time-dependent 1HN-15N signal intensities to single exponential decays. These values were converted into the PFs summarized in Figure 4, B and C and tabulated in Table S3. The monomeric A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains exhibited very similar patterns of amide HX. All residues N-terminal to Y60 and most of those in interhelical regions exchanged rapidly under these experimental conditions. This is consistent with their surface exposure and general lack of intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions (Table S3). Conformational flexibility of these residues was also indicated by their RCI-S2 values (Fig. 1C). Conversely, amides within or near the four α-helices showed substantial protection from HX. In particular, W69 and L70 in helix H1 and L116 and L117 in helix H4 of both proteins exchanged very slowly, with several of these residues having log(PF) values >7. Under the commonly observed EX2 conditions, with pH-dependent bimolecular kinetics, PFs reflect the residue-specific free energy changes, ΔGHX = 2.303RTlog(PF), governing local or global conformational equilibria leading to exchange (31Krishna M.M.G. Hoang L. Lin Y. Englander S.W. Hydrogen exchange methods to study protein folding.Methods. 2004; 34: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Assuming that these most protected amides exchange through global or near-global structural fluctuations, these HX data provide an estimation of the unfolding free energy for each monomeric PNT domain of >40 kJ/mol. Such a value is consistent with the view that, even without polymerizing, the ETV6 PNT domain adopts a very stable folded conformation. This further indicates that the A93D and V112 E mutations prevent polymerization without disrupting the structure or stability of the monomeric PNT domain. Heterodimerization resulted in increased HX protection for many residues in both the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains (Fig. 4, B and C). Indeed, several amides in both proteins did not exchange significantly even after 3 months in D2O buffer and thus have log(PF) > 8.5 (and ΔGHX > 48 kJ/mol). Although global stabilization upon heterodimer formation is expected, many of the residues with at least a 100-fold increase in HX protection localized around the complementary interfacial regions of the two PNT domains (Figs. 4D and 5, A and B). These are exemplified by amides within or near the wild-type ML-surface of the V112E-PNT domain (N90, K92, A93, L96, T98, D101, F102) and the wild-type EH-surface of the A93D-PNT domain (F77, V112, L113, Y114). Given that the structures of the A93D-PNT and V112E-PNT domains do not change significantly upon heterodimerization, the increased protection of interfacial residues against HX may result from their local stabilization against conformational fluctuations allowing exchange. Alternatively, if exchange occurs predominantly through transient monomers, then the increased protection of amides in the heterodimer would reflect the equilibrium population distribution of these two species (27Paterson Y.

Polylactosamine forms a lectin recognition site and also acts as a platform for presenting diverse additional modifications (e.g., terminal cell-surface antigens); it therefore plays important roles in cell adherence, development, and immunity. Two new papers present a detailed structural and mechanistic investigation of β1-3-N-acetylgucosaminyltransferase 2, a key enzyme in antennae synthesis.

The resulting insights will also help decipher other members of GT31, the single largest human glycosyltransferase family. The disaccharide repeat [-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-]n is an extremely common recurring motif in eukaryotic glycans. Termed poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine, or polylactosamine, this motif occurs in both N- and O- linked glycoproteins as well as in glycolipids. For example, in complex N-glycans, the core mannose can be decorated with up to five GlcNAc residues, each of which can potentially be extended into a linear chain of polylactosamine (Fig. 1A); which GlcNAc residues are extended varies by tissue and developmental stage. These extended “antennae” can be modified by branching off additional polylactosamine chains, by the addition of modifying groups including sulfate (e.g., to form keratan) and fucose, and/or capped with sialic acids, or surface antigens (including ABO, HNK-1, or Lewis X antigens) (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G. Kinoshita T. Packer N.H. Prestegard J.H. Schnaar R.L. Seeberger P.H. Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, New York, NY2017Google Scholar). Polylactosamine is directly recognized by many lectins including galectins (2Arthur C.M. Baruffi M.D. Cummings R.D. Stowell S.R. Evolving mechanistic insights into galectin functions.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1207: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), while simultaneously serving as a scaffold for presenting critical cell surface markers; it therefore plays an important role in diverse cellular processes, including development, cell adherence, and immune function. Glycans are synthesized by the sequential addition of monosaccharide units from nucleotide phosphate donors by enzymes known as glycosyltransferases (GTs). GTs occur in four distinct folds (namely GT-A through GT-D) and are further divided into homology-based families (currently, GT1–GT111). Individual GT families will transfer a specific monosaccharide with either inversion or retention at the anomeric carbon center (3Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Polylactosamine synthesis requires the alternating action of two GTs: The Gal is added by β-1-4-galactosyltransferase (B4GAL), while the GlcNAc residue is added by β1-3-N-acetylgucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT). B3GNTs are classified as inverting GTs in family GT31 and are predicted to have a GT-A fold (4Petit D. Teppa R.E. Harduin-Lepers A. A phylogenetic view and functional annotation of the animal β1,3-glycosyltransferases of the GT31 CAZy family.Glycobiology. 2020; 25: 3389Google Scholar). In humans, B3GNT has seven isoforms termed B3GNT2–B3GNT8; these differ in their tissue distribution and substrate preferences, with many having specialized roles. B3GNT2 is a widely expressed, membrane-anchored, Golgi-resident enzyme that appears to be the most important homolog in elongating polylactosamine (5Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J.-I. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22032-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To date, however, challenges of working with these enzymes have resulted in many key aspects of their biochemistry—including their structure, substrate recognition modes, and catalytic mechanism—being little understood. In a pair of papers published in JBC, Hao et al. (6Hao Y. Créquer-Grandhomme A. Javier N. Singh A. Chen H. Manzanillo P. Lo M.-C. Huang X. Structures and mechanism of human glycosyltransferase β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GNT2), an important player in immune homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kadirvelraj et al. (7Kadirvelraj R. Yang J.-Y. Kim H.W. Sanders J.H. Moremen K.W. Wood Z.A. Comparison of human poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine synthase structure with GT-A fold glycosyltransferases supports a modular assembly of catalytic subsites.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) report the structure of the GT domain of B3GNT2, coupled with an in-depth analysis of the enzyme’s mechanism. Usefully, the groups used different approaches at several key junctures, so the papers provide nicely complementary insights. At the level of protein organization, the structures confirm a GT-A (single Rossmann domain) fold, but showed a number of B3GNT-specific modifications (Fig. 1B). Along with three disulfide bonds, the structure shows N-glycosylation at three sites, with the Asn219-anchored GlcNAc2 disaccharide packing in a cleft and likely critical for protein stability. B3GNT2 also has a unique N-terminal helical subdomain, as well as a long loop insertion (HV2) that forms most of the acceptor binding site. Finally, B3GNT2 is dimeric, while most GTs are monomeric. The active sites are on the same dimer face, but too widely separated to span different antennae on a single glycan. One might speculate that having paired, widely spaced membrane anchored tethers helps orient B3GNT2 optimally for substrate encounters. GT reaction mechanisms can be difficult to study because labile nucleotide sugars and weak substrate binding can make capturing substrate complexes very challenging (3Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Kadirvelraj et al. (7Kadirvelraj R. Yang J.-Y. Kim H.W. Sanders J.H. Moremen K.W. Wood Z.A.

Of particular interest is the acceptor binding site. In B3GNT2, only the two terminal saccharide residues make significant contacts with the protein, consistent with its activity being largely independent of substrate chain length (5Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J.-I. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22032-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This binding site is built from extensions of three loops, with most contacts coming from a greatly elongated hypervariable loop 2. Using detailed comparisons to other GT-A structures, Kadirvelraj et al. (7Kadirvelraj R. Yang J.-Y. Kim H.W. Sanders J.H. Moremen K.W. Wood Z.A. Comparison of human poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine synthase structure with GT-A fold glycosyltransferases supports a modular assembly of catalytic subsites.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) argue that GT-As generally evolve recognition to acceptors by extending and restructuring these hypervariable loops, allowing an enormous variety of acceptors to be recognized. To complement these structures, Hao et al. (6Hao Y. Créquer-Grandhomme A. Javier N. Singh A. Chen H. Manzanillo P. Lo M.-C. Huang X. Structures and mechanism of human glycosyltransferase β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GNT2), an important player in immune homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed (using SPR) that both the donor and acceptor exhibit weak, fast-on fast-off binding. Combined with a detailed kinetics analysis, these data strongly suggest a sequential binding mechanism. Kadirvelraj et al. (7Kadirvelraj R. Yang J.-Y. Kim H.W. Sanders J.H. Moremen K.W. Wood Z.A.

Structures and mechanism of human glycosyltransferase β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GNT2), an important player in immune homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assayed in cell function, assessing the ability of B3GNT2 active site residue variants to restore polylactosamine cellular expression. Together, these structures, mutagenesis, and enzymology experiments give a detailed window into the mode of substrate recognition and mechanism of this enzyme. While these works are specifically focused on B3GNT2, GT31 is the largest family of GTs in humans (with 25 members) (4Petit D. Teppa R.E. Harduin-Lepers A. A phylogenetic view and functional annotation of the animal β1,3-glycosyltransferases of the GT31 CAZy family.Glycobiology. 2020; 25: 3389Google Scholar), and only the UDP complex structure of one other member is known. These papers therefore provide a “Rosetta stone” for understanding multiple enzymes with a variety of functions. Most immediately, there are six additional B3GNTs with varied biological roles and distinct acceptor substrate specificity. For example, B3GNT5 only synthesizes lactotriaosylceramide (5Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J.-I. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22032-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), while B3GNT7 synthesizes keratan and strongly prefers sulfated substrates (8Kitayama K. Hayashida Y. Nishida K. Akama T.O. Enzymes responsible for synthesis of corneal keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30085-30096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These differences imply extended and/or modified paralog-specific recognition sites. Modeling based on these structures will allow key motifs and residues mediating such specificity to be identified. Finally, B3GNT2 pairs with B3GNT8 to form heterodimers that are more active than either enzyme alone (9Seko A. Yamashita K. Characterization of a novel galactose beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta3Gn-T8): the complex formation of beta3Gn-T2 and beta3Gn-T8 enhances enzymatic activity.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); the structural and enzymatic basis of this synergy represents an intriguing subject for future investigations.

https://openalex.org/W3091890131,"Rhodopsin is a canonical class A photosensitive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), yet relatively few pharmaceutical agents targeting this visual receptor have been identified, in part due to the unique characteristics of its light-sensitive, covalently bound retinal ligands. Rhodopsin becomes activated when light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal into an agonist, all-trans-retinal (ATR), which enables the receptor to activate its G protein. We have previously demonstrated that, despite being covalently bound, ATR can display properties of equilibrium binding, yet how this is accomplished is unknown. Here, we describe a new approach for both identifying compounds that can activate and attenuate rhodopsin and testing the hypothesis that opsin binds retinal in equilibrium. Our method uses opsin-based fluorescent sensors, which directly report the formation of active receptor conformations by detecting the binding of G protein or arrestin fragments that have been fused onto the receptor's C terminus. We show that these biosensors can be used to monitor equilibrium binding of the agonist, ATR, as well as the noncovalent binding of β-ionone, an antagonist for G protein activation. Finally, we use these novel biosensors to observe ATR release from an activated, unlabeled receptor and its subsequent transfer to the sensor in real time. Taken together, these data support the retinal equilibrium binding hypothesis. The approach we describe should prove directly translatable to other GPCRs, providing a new tool for ligand discovery and mutant characterization."
