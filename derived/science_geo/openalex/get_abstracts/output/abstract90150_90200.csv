https://openalex.org/W2024280594,"A domain of DNA designated N-myc is amplified 20- to 140-fold in human neuroblastoma cell lines but not in cell lines from other tumor types. N-myc has now been found to be amplified in neuroblastoma tissue from 24 of 63 untreated patients (38 percent). The extent of amplification appears to be bimodal, with amplification of 100- to 300-fold in 12 cases and 3- to 10-fold in 10 others. Amplification was found in 0 of 15 patients with stage 1 or 2 disease, whereas 24 of 48 cases (50 percent) with stage 3 or 4 had evidence of N-myc amplification. These data indicate that N-myc amplification is a common event in untreated human neuroblastomas. Furthermore, N-myc amplification is highly correlated with advanced stages of disease (P less than 0.001) and with the ability to grow in vitro as an established cell line, both of which are associated with a poor prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W1978386737,"Transplantation of pronuclei between one-cell-stage embryos was used to construct diploid mouse embryos with two female pronuclei ( biparental gynogenones ) or two male pronuclei ( biparental androgenones ). The ability of these embryos to develop to term was compared with control nuclear-transplant embryos in which the male or the female pronucleus was replaced with an isoparental pronucleus from another embryo. The results show that diploid biparental gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos do not complete normal embryogenesis, whereas control nuclear transplant embryos do. We conclude that the maternal and paternal contributions to the embryonic genome in mammals are not equivalent and that a diploid genome derived from only one of the two parental sexes is incapable of supporting complete embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1967152593,The magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum is a forebrain nucleus of passerine birds that accumulates testosterone and makes monosynaptic connections with other telencephalic nuclei that control song production in adult birds. Lesions in the magnocellular nucleus disrupted song development in juvenile male zebra finches but did not affect maintenance of stable song patterns by adult birds. These results represent an instance in which lesions of a discrete brain region during only a restricted phase in the development of a learned behavior cause permanent impairment. Because cells of the magnocellular nucleus accumulate androgens these findings raise the possibility that this learning is mediated by hormones.

https://openalex.org/W2053374394,"DNA replication in mammals is temporally bimodal. ""Housekeeping"" genes, which are active in all cells, replicate during the first half of the S phase of cell growth. Tissue-specific genes replicate early in those cells in which they are potentially expressed, and they usually replicate late in tissues in which they are not expressed. Replication during the first half of the S phase is, therefore, a necessary but not sufficient condition for gene transcription. A change in the replication timing of a tissue-specific gene appears to reflect the commitment of that gene to transcriptional competence or to quiescence during ontogeny. Most families of middle repetitive sequences replicate either early or late. These data are consistent with a model in which two functionally distinct genomes coexist in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2080269085,"A Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription factor that is specific for at least one of the heat-shock genes has been isolated (designated HSTF for heat-shock transcription factor). This factor is required for active transcription of an hsp 70 gene in addition to RNA polymerase II and another general transcription factor, the A factor. Footprint analysis of the HSTF on the hsp 70 gene reveals that it binds specifically to a 55 bp region upstream from the TATA box. Both coding and noncoding DNA strands are completely protected from DNAase I cleavage by the HSTF . HSTF binding occurs in the apparent absence of RNA polymerase II. The HSTF is present in both heat-shocked and nonshocked cells, although it is more transcriptionally active when isolated from heat-shocked cells. The previously described B factor (an RNA polymerase II transcription factor that binds to the TATA box), isolated from nonshocked cells, is significantly reduced in both binding and transcriptional activity in heat-shocked cells. The potential role of the HSTF and the B factor in the activation of heat-shock gene transcription is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2075673909,"6-Sulfidopeptide-containing leukotriene-like immunoreactivity was synthesized in gerbil forebrains after bilateral common carotid occlusion and reperfusion. At 5, 10, or 15 minutes of ischemia, concentrations increased significantly and became more marked on reperfusion. Immunoreactivity was highest in forebrain gray matter and was below the detection limit of the assay in brain regions remote from the zone of ischemia. In vitro experiments with vascular cells and organ cultures of cerebral arteries indicate that the cerebral blood vessel wall is not a major source of biosynthetic activity in the brain. These experiments demonstrate leukotriene biosynthesis by the brain. Because synthesis occurs during ischemia and reperfusion and because leukotrienes are potent vasoconstrictors and promoters of tissue edema, they may play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2053550995,"Most mammalian cells, such as fibroblasts, continuously internalize part of their surface membrane by endocytosis, and then later return it to the cell surface. This cyclical process is initiated by coated pits in the plasma membrane. These pits collect specific receptors plus lipid for internalization, but exclude other proteins. On a motile cell, the sites of endocytosis (randomly located on the cell) and those of membrane return (located at the front of the cell) are not coincident. This causes a bulk flow of lipid plus receptors in the plasma membrane, away from the front of the cell. Large objects on the cell surface are swept to the rear of the cell by this flow, a process called capping. Cells may use this polarized endocytic cycle to move."
https://openalex.org/W1969580462,"Neural activity generates increases in extracellular K+ concentration, [K+]0, which must be regulated in order to maintain normal brain function1. Glial cells are thought to play an important part in this regulation through the process of K+ spatial buffering2–4: K+-mediated current flow through glial cells redistributes extracellular K+ following localized [K+]0 increases. As is the case in other glia, the retinal Müller cell is permeable almost exclusively to K+ (ref. 5). Recent experiments6–8 have suggested that this K+ conductance may not be distributed uniformly over the cell surface. In the present study, two novel techniques have been used to assess the Müller cell K+ conductance distribution. The results demonstrate that 94% of all membrane conductance lies in the endfoot process of the cell. This strikingly asymmetric distribution has important consequences for theories concerning K+ buffering and should help to explain the generation of the electroretinogram."

https://openalex.org/W1971989809,"Progressive accumulation of a cytotoxic metabolite, galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), was found in the brain of the twitcher mouse, a mutant caused by genetic deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Similar abnormal accumulation was also found in the brain of the genetic galactosylceramidase deficiency disease in the dog and in human patients (globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease). Galactosylphingosine was absent in the brains of normal and heterozygous mice. The finding provides support for the psychosine hypothesis as the biochemical pathogenetic mechanism of globoid cell leukodystrophy. Analogous mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis of other genetic lysosomal diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2067770662,"In vitro pharmacological studies demonstrated that exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) relaxes the smooth muscle cells of cat cerebral arteries, whereas substance P constricts them. Ultrastructural-immunocytochemical techniques show that a VIP-like substance is present in the large granular vesicles of nonsympathetic nerve axons and terminals in the cerebral arterial walls. These results provide strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that a VIP-like substance is the transmitter for vasodilation in cerebral blood vessels."

https://openalex.org/W1607077699,"Two polypeptides of Mr approximately 29,000 and 27,000 have been identified in human erythrocyte membranes that cross-react specifically with affinity purified antibodies to chicken gizzard tropomyosin. The cross-reacting polypeptides are quantitatively retained on the membrane after cell lysis if millimolar concentrations of magnesium are included in the lysis and wash buffers, indicating that they are membrane-bound proteins under physiological conditions. Milligram quantities of these immunoreactive polypeptides have been purified to greater than 95% purity from a low salt extract of membranes by DEAE-chromatography, precipitation at pH 4.4, and heating to 85 degrees C to denature contaminants. Physical similarities of the erythrocyte protein to other tropomyosins include (a) amino acid composition (b) anomalous migration of the Mr approximately 29,000 and 27,000 polypeptides on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels in the presence of 6 M urea to apparent Mr approximately 43,000 and 38,000, respectively (c) arrangement of chains as dimers of Mr approximately 60,000 based on cross-linking studies and calculation of molecular weight from hydrodynamic values (Rs = 5.9 nm, sedimentation coefficient = 2.5 S; partial specific volume = 0.72 cm3/g) and (d) highly asymmetric shape, based on a frictional ratio of 2.07. Binding of erythrocyte tropomyosin to muscle F-actin saturates at one tropomyosin molecule (Mr approximately 60,000) to 6-7 actin monomers and is highly cooperative with a Hill coefficient of about 2.8, similar to muscle tropomyosins. Binding also exhibits a high degree of cooperativity as a function of the magnesium concentration with a transition between no binding and complete binding between 1 and 2 mM MgCl2. Increasing the magnesium concentration from 2 to 10 mM increases the apparent affinity of tropomyosin for actin from approximately 2.6 X 10(6) M-1 to approximately 2.7 X 10(7) M-1 without effect on the Hill coefficient. The tropomyosin polypeptides comprise about 1% of the erythrocyte membrane protein and are present in a ratio of one Mr approximately 60,000 tropomyosin molecule to 7-8 actin monomers, an amount almost sufficient to coat all of the F-actin on the membrane. These data are consistent with the association of two tropomyosin molecules with each of the short actin filaments (12-17 monomers long) thought to exist in the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton. The erythrocyte tropomyosin could function to mechanically stabilize these actin filaments as well as play a role in regulating the interaction of spectrin with actin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1494584625,"Gelatin coupled to Sepharose has been used to isolate [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides of Mr = 47,000, 56,000, 62,000, and 65,000 from the 12,000 X g supernatant of detergent extracts of mouse embryo parietal endoderm cells. The polypeptides can also be recovered from various established cell lines which synthesize type IV procollagen, and in these cells the Mr = 47,000 polypeptide is the major gelatin-binding component. Several lines of evidence, including the results of continuous labeling and pulse-chase experiments, show that the polypeptides are not derived by proteolytic cleavage of larger precursors and are distinct from fragments of fibronectin. The Mr = 47,000, 62,000, and 65,000 polypeptides all contain N-linked oligosaccharide side chains, as judged by their labeling with [3H]mannose and their sensitivity to tunicamycin. The Mr = 62,000 and 65,000 polypeptides can be resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis into species with different isoelectric points, and the Mr = 47,000 has a pI of 7.5-8.0. None of the gelatin-binding polypeptides appear to accumulate in the culture medium, and the Mr = 47,000, 62,000, and 65,000 species are labeled in a lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of intact cells, suggesting that they are associated with the cell surface. Only the Mr = 47,000 glycoprotein binds to native type IV collagen. Possible functions for these surface components in vivo are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2020532584,The ability of clonally derived lines of B16F1 and B16F10 melanoma cells to form experimental metastases in C57BL mice after intravenous injection was examined. Luria- Delbruck fluctuation analysis was applied to the results obtained with parallel subclones grown to small population sizes before testing for metastatic ability. The analysis demonstrated that variant cells capable of forming experimental metastases were generated in B16F1 cell populations at an effective rate of about 1.3 X 10(-5) per cell per generation while in B16F10 cell populations the effective rate of production was about 5 X 10(-5) per cell per generation. These results are consistent with a dynamic heterogeneity model of tumor progression. They suggest that the majority of cells in both lines are effectively nonmetastatic and that the higher metastatic ability of the B16F10 population may be due in part to a higher rate of generation of metastatic variants.

https://openalex.org/W1512725913,"A kinetic scheme is proposed for the action of cobra venom phospholipase A2 on mixed micelles of phospholipid and the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, based on the dual phospholipid model. (formula; see text) The water-soluble enzyme binds initially to a phospholipid molecule in the micelle interface. This is followed by binding to additional phospholipid in the interface and then catalytic hydrolysis. A kinetic equation was derived for this process and tested under three experimental conditions: (i) the mole fraction of substrate held constant and the bulk substrate concentration varied; (ii) the bulk substrate concentration held constant and the Triton X-100 concentration varied (surface concentration of substrate varied); and (iii) the Triton X-100 concentration held constant and the bulk substrate concentration varied. The substrates used were chiral dithiol ester analogs of phosphatidylcholine (thio-PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (thio-PE), and the reactions were followed by reaction of the liberated thiol with a colorimetric thiol reagent. The initial binding (Ks = k1/k-1) was apparently similar for thio-PC and thio-PE (between 0.1 and 0.2 mM) as were the apparent Michaelis constants (Km = (k-2 + k3)/k2) (about 0.1 mol fraction). The Vmax values for thio-PC and thio-PE were 440 and 89 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively. The preference of cobra venom phospholipase A2 for PC over PE in Triton X-100 mixed micelles appears to be an effect on k3 (catalytic rate) rather than an effect on the apparent binding of phospholipid in either step of the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2049327162,"Vegetal pole cells of Xenopus morulae contribute progeny to all three germ layers, but from the midblastula stage onward they contribute only to the endoderm. We have investigated whether this restriction in fate reflects cell determination by implanting labeled vegetal pole cells into the blastocoels of host embryos and asking which structures later include labeled progeny. Single vegetal pole cells from the morula and also from the midblastula stage can contribute progeny to all germ layers. At the early gastrula stage the cells can contribute only to the endoderm. Thus the restriction of fate in the midblastula does not reflect cell determination. However, the cells do become determined by the beginning of gastrulation."

The latter were purified, and about 10% of these complexes are formed by nine fibers attached to the connecting piece. Of these fibers, two are shorter than the other seven and presumably correspond to fibers 3 and 8 (Fawcett, D.W. (1975) Dev. Biol. 44, 394-436). Electron microscopy confirmed the purity of the isolated outer dense fibers and revealed their characteristic irregular cross-sectional shape. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed six major polypeptides (Mr = 87,000, 30,400, 26,000, 18,400, 13,000, and 11,500) with a high content of serine, aspartic and glutamic acids, proline, cysteine, leucine, and tyrosine. Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate a close structural relationship between the components of 30,400 and 26,000 Da. The six major components of the fibers are phosphorylated at serine residues. These results indicate that the major components of rat sperm outer dense fibers are a unique family of phosphoproteins."

The remaining sequences, including a processed pseudogene, are dispersed to at least four other autosomes.

Prenatal haloperidol did not affect testosterone concentrations in fetuses. Maternal administration of apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, and of α-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, also demasculinized male offspring. In both experiments other behaviors and developmental milestones were unaffected. Perinatal haloperidol, apomorphine, and α-methyl-p-tyrosine did not lower testosterone in adulthood. These drugs may act directly on neurons that control masculine behavior without lowering testosterone prenatally or in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1587265394,"A kinetic analysis of the dual phospholipid model for cobra venom phospholipase A2 (Hendrickson, H. S., and Dennis, E. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5734-5739) was applied to the activation of phospholipase A2-catalyzed hydrolysis of a thiol ester analog of phosphatidylethanolamine (thio - PE) in Triton X - 100/phospholipid mixed micelles by various phosphorylcholine-containing activators. Activation of thio-PE hydrolysis by didecanoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) was found to be a function of the surface concentration of activator rather than bulk concentration. Its presence did not affect the initial binding of enzyme to phospholipid in the micelle surface as determined kinetically. After initial binding of enzyme to the surface, the activation appears to be due to enzyme-lipid binding in the surface. Activation does not appear to affect the affinity of the enzyme for phospholipid substrate, but rather affects the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme as characterized by the value of Vmax. The monomeric phospholipid dibutyryl-PC, when used as an activator at 57 mM (bulk concentration), also showed effects of surface dilution with Triton X-100, which would not be expected unless the lipid is incorporated into the micelles to some extent at these high concentrations. A thiol ester analog of phosphatidylcholine, thio-PC, was less effective than didecanoyl-PC as an activator, but appeared to be more effective than decylphosphorylcholine. A conformational change of the enzyme upon binding of the activator, after enzyme is bound to substrate at the interface, is discussed as a possible mechanism for this activation."
https://openalex.org/W1514050370,"Three monoclonal antibodies, 1F11, 1G11, and 2F5, were developed toward rabbit microsomal cytochrome P-450 1. Each was linked to Sepharose in order to indirectly immunoprecipitate microsomal proteins. All three antibodies bind polypeptides from solubilized microsomes that exhibit the same electrophoretic mobility as P-450 1. However, 2F5 recognizes an additional microsomal protein that exhibits a relative electrophoretic mobility between that of P-450 1 and 3b that does not appear to be P-450 2. 1G11 also reacts with several microsomal proteins that include both P-450 1 and P-450 3b. These results indicate that at least three electrophoretically distinct forms of microsomal P-450 share one or more antigenic determinants with P-450 1. Binding studies demonstrate that each antibody can react independently with P-450 1, indicating that the three antigenic determinants recognized by the respective monoclonal antibodies are spatially distinct and nonoverlapping. Reconstituted P-450 1 isolated from rabbit liver microsomes that exhibit 10-fold higher progesterone 21-hydroxylase than most preparations of liver microsomes obtained from outbred New Zealand White rabbits catalyzes this reaction with relatively high rates compared to that exhibited by microsomes or to that catalyzed by five electrophoretically distinct forms of P-450. Both the 1F11 and 2F5 antibodies extensively inhibit the liver microsomal 21-hydroxylation of progesterone. When the 1F11 antibody is used to indirectly immunoprecipitate the antigens it recognizes in microsomes displaying a high rate of progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity, a single electrophoretic band corresponding in mobility to P-450 1 was observed."

The cellular content of FE was measured quantitatively by flow cytometry. Binding of FE occurs in the nanomolar concentration range, an indication of the high affinity of the labeled estradiol. Competition of FE for binding sites is observed with estrogens, but not with progestins, androgens, or glucocorticosteroids, indicating the specificity of FE binding. In contrast to other estrogen receptor assays, this new technique requires a small sample size (about 5000 cells) and permits the assessment of heterogeneity in estrogen receptor expression among tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055563751,"After spinal transection in ammocoetes (lamprey larvae) 4 to 5 years old, functional recovery is accompanied by a limited regeneration in which axons grow as far as 5 millimeters beyond the scar. In axotomized giant interneurons labeled intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase 16 to 120 days after transection, 74 percent of regenerating neurites grew in their normal projection pattern, rostal and contralateral to the cell body. One third of the neurites originated anomalously from posterior dendrites. Despite their initial abnormal orientation, 80 percent of these neurites looped contralaterally and rostrally to assume the normal projection path. The directional specificity persisted when giant interneurons were located in islands formed by double simultaneous cord transection. This limited regeneration seems to be characterized by directional selectivity that cannot be attributed to nonspecific influences, such as a tendency of neurites to grow in an already established direction or a trophic effect of the zone of injury."
https://openalex.org/W1658125108,"The influence of the intracellular glutathione status on bile acid excretion was studied in the perfused rat liver. Perturbation of the thiol redox state by short term additions of diamide (100 microM) or hydrogen peroxide (250 microM) or t-butyl hydroperoxide (250 microM) led to a reversible inhibition of biliary taurocholate release without affecting hepatic uptake; inhibition amounted to 45% for diamide and 90% for the hydroperoxides. Concomitantly, the bile acid accumulated intracellularly. Bile flow increased from 1.3 to 2.0 microliters X min-1 X g liver-1 upon infusion of taurocholate (10 microM); the latter value was suppressed to 1.2 microliters X min-1 X g liver-1 by the addition of t-butyl hydroperoxide (250 microM). Similarly, the hepatic disposition of another bile constituent, bilirubin, was suppressed by 70% upon addition of hydrogen peroxide. While the addition of hydrogen peroxide inhibited also the endogenous release of bile acids almost completely, endogenous bile flow was much less affected, decreasing from 1.3 to 1.0 microliters X min-1 X g liver-1. Measurement of [14C]erythritol clearance showed bile/perfusate ratios of about unity both in the absence and presence of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting canalicular origin of the bile under both conditions. In livers from Se-deficient rats low in Se-GSH peroxidase (less than 5% of controls), hydrogen peroxide inhibited taurocholate transport substantially less, providing evidence for the involvement of glutathione in mediating the inhibition observed in normal livers. The percentage inhibition of taurocholate release and intracellular glutathione disulfide (GSSG) content were closely correlated. The addition of t-butyl hydroperoxide caused a several-fold increase of biliary GSSG release, whereas biliary GSH release was even decreased. The results establish a role of glutathione in canalicular taurocholate disposition."
https://openalex.org/W1532714707,"Measurements of enzyme activity, rates of protein synthesis, and mRNA activity suggest that the induction of beta-glucuronidase in mouse kidney in response to androgen is regulated at a pretranslational level. Following an initial lag period, the rate and extent of induction follow the rules of simple turnover kinetics and can be described in terms of a zero order rate constant for acquisition of mRNA activity (ka) and a first order rate constant for loss of activity (kb). Genetic variation in kb, described here for the first time, alters the half-time and extent of induction. Variation in kb is independent of previously described variation in ka and, unlike changes in ka, is not associated with change in the lag time. The DNA sequences determining kb, like those determining ka, are genetically linked to the structural gene for beta-glucuronidase. Following the removal of androgen, beta-glucuronidase activity, rate of synthesis, and mRNA activity all decline rapidly with half-lives of 1-2 days. Even in the most rapidly inducing strains, this is significantly faster than the half-time for induction determined by kb. Furthermore, genetic variation in kb does not affect the rate of de-induction. These facts suggest that kb may not describe the turnover of beta-glucuronidase mRNA, but rather the turnover of another step in the induction process."
https://openalex.org/W1560629524,"Human deoxynucleotidyltransferase was used to produce mouse monoclonal antibodies. Three different assays were used to screen for transferase antibodies and antibody-producing hybridoma cells: an enzyme binding assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a terminal transferase-specific antibody cytochemical procedure that allows visualization of the homogeneity of the hybridoma clones producing antibodies to transferase. Of the 12 mouse hybridoma clones isolated, seven produce IgG1 and five produce IgG2a immunoglobulins. Only one of these monoclonal antibodies is inhibitory to human transferase activity. Four of the monoclonal antibodies react with transferase peptides after separation on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the remainder appear to recognize only native determinants on the human enzyme. Cross-reactivity studies with purified calf thymus enzyme show that although four of the monoclonal antibodies bind to native enzyme, none react with calf thymus transferase peptides after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting structural differences within the cross-reactive determinants. A more general survey on the affinity of these monoclonal antibodies to human transferase for the enzyme from other species using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrates that none of the monoclonal antibodies reacts with chicken thymus transferase. The affinity of binding for transferase from other mammals to this panel of monoclonal antibodies varies with the clones as expected, but few bind as strongly as the human enzyme. These results suggest that although antigenic determinants are conserved through evolution, fine structural changes within the determinants do occur."
https://openalex.org/W1531365925,"Post-mitochondrial supernatants from adult and neonatal mouse lung were each separated using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and fractions were assayed for cAMP-dependent kinase activity and photoincorporation of the analog, 8-azido-cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Although there is no significant developmental differences in the amount of kinase activity which elutes in these high salt or DEAE peak II fractions, such fractions derived from neonatal lung contain only half as much photodetectable regulatory subunit of the type II protein kinase isozyme (RII) as do corresponding fractions from the adult. Much of the kinase activity associated with these neonatal DEAE peak II fractions may actually be due to the type I holoenzyme. Significant amounts of photodetectable regulatory subunit of the type I protein kinase isozyme (RI) co-elute with this peak of type II kinase activity, and several lines of evidence suggest that much of this RI exists in a holoenzyme state. Incubation of these peak II fractions with cAMP prior to a second elution from DEAE-cellulose causes much of the RI to elute at lower salt concentrations characteristic of the free RI subunit. After sucrose gradient sedimentation of peak II fractions, RI cosediments with the peak of cAMP-dependent kinase activity. Finally, kinase activation by cAMP is biphasic, suggesting that both the type I and II holoenzymes contribute to the kinase activity in the type II peak. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of photolabeled proteins does not suggest any structural difference between RI subunits present in various DEAE fractions. The elution of the type I holoenzyme over a range of salt concentrations may be due to structural variations in the C subunit of the type I isozyme or possibly to the stable association of the type I holoenzyme with other molecules in the cell."

Comparison of the formation constants for hemoglobin and albumin, using standard competitive binding equations, indicated that the distribution ratio for pyridoxal between erythrocytes and plasma should be 6.5:1. This distribution was approximately the same as that observed when pyridoxal was incubated with whole human blood, suggesting that these two proteins are the primary determinants of the pyridoxal distribution in whole blood. With in situ perfused rat liver the uptake of [3H] pyridoxal from the perfusate was reduced by the inclusion of erythrocytes in the perfusate. This was reflected in the decreased production of 4-pyridoxic acid by the perfused liver from 3.8% to 1.2% of the dose by the addition of erythrocytes to the perfusate. The major labeled metabolites found in the liver were pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxamine phosphate, and 4-pyridoxic acid for both types of perfusion. In intact animals, reduction of the erythrocytes concentrations to hematocrits of 30-40% increased the recovery in the urine of 3H from administered [3H] pyridoxal from control values of 27-35% to 40-50% of the dose within 48 h. Half of the label in urinary metabolites was in 4-pyridoxic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2115102565,"We report on the preparation, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray crystallographic study of Fab fragments from monoclonal anti-p-azophenylarsonate antibodies. Several crystalline forms were obtained with the Fab fragment from the R19.9 monoclonal antibody as well as with the complex between the hapten p-aminobenzenearsonic acid and Fab R19.9. The crystals of this hapten-Fab complex are similar to but not always isomorphous with the native Fab crystals. All the native and complex crystals were obtained using polyethylene glycol 6000 as crystallizing agent. Some of these crystalline forms diffract to a 2-A resolution or beyond and are suitable for high resolution x-ray diffraction analysis. A possible interpretation of hapten binding to crystalline Fab fragments from R19.9 and from the R9.3 monoclonal anti-p-azophenylarsonate antibody, implying conformational changes, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069605638,"The effect of serum on the rate of substrate oxidation by dissociated brain cells in vitro was examined. At a serum protein concentration of approximately 0.55 milligram per milliliter, oxidation of [6-14C]glucose to 14CO2 was decreased more than 50 percent. Oxidation of [3-14C]-3-hydroxybutyrate and [U-14C]glutamine was decreased much less. Serum from cows, rats, horses, and humans produced similar effects, as did serum from young and old animals and from both sexes. The effect on [6-14C]glucose oxidation was proportional to serum protein concentration, and significant inhibitory activity was obtained with dialyzed serum. Heating (80 degrees C for 10 minutes) significantly reduced the inhibitory activity. These results suggest the presence of a factor in serum that can preferentially decrease glucose oxidation. Such a factor would have profound implications for metabolic regulation in vivo and for studies of cells in vitro in which serum is included in the growth medium."

Lethally x-irradiated CM-S cells from various passages and clones, representing different stages in the progression of the transformed growth phenotype, were tested for their ability to affect the survival and proliferation of normal human cord or adult blood leukocytes in co-culture. One clone, CM-SM, which is tumorigenic in athymic mice, consistently immortalized umbilical cord mononuclear cells but did not immortalize adult peripheral blood leukocytes. Six autonomous monocyte-like diploid cell lines were obtained and all were found to be of cord origin. Three lines were tumorigenic in athymic mice. Attempts to immortalize human leukocytes with cell-free supernatants from CM-S cells were unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W1499956674,"The addition of a purified mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase enzyme preparation to complex I (NADH-CoQ reductase) results in a significant increase in the NADPH-AcPyAD+ transhydrogenase activity of the complex without influencing the NADH-AcPyAD+ transhydrogenase activity. When subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of complex I, the purified transhydrogenase enzyme preparation was found to co-migrate with the Mr = 130,000 (130K) subunit of the NADH-CoQ reductase. Loss of the NADPH-NAD+ transhydrogenase activity of complex I following limited tryptic digestion was associated with a corresponding loss of the 130K subunit from the complex. These results suggest that the 130K subunit of complex I is the specific peptide responsible for the catalysis of the NADPH-NAD+ transhydrogenase activity observed in complex I. Studies have been carried out testing the influence of photoaffinity pyridine nucleotide probes on the NADPH-NAD+ transhydrogenase activity catalyzed at three levels of resolution, i.e. a homogeneous transhydrogenase preparation, a partially resolved membrane preparation (complex I), and an intact mitochondrial membrane preparation (EDTA particles). Such studies have revealed arylazido-beta-alanyl NADP+ (N3'-O-(3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl)NADP+) to be a potent inhibitor and an active site-directed reagent for NADPH-NAD+ transhydrogenation at all three levels of resolution. On the other hand, arylazido-beta-alanyl NAD+ (A3'-O-(3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-amino]propionyl)NAD+ does not produce a significant degree of inhibition of NADPH-NAD+ transhydrogenase activities prior to or following photoirradiation. Nevertheless, the NAD+ analogue has been found to specifically label, covalently, the transhydrogenase protein following photoirradiation of an enzyme-analogue mixture. Arylazido-beta-alanyl NAD+ can as well function as a substrate during transhydrogenation by virtue of being able to accept a hydride ion from NADPH. An interpretation of the observed nucleotide photoprobe specificity for interaction at the active site for transhydrogenation is advanced. In this interpretation, an ordered binding of substrate involves an initial NADP(H) (or NADP+ photoprobe) interaction with a hydrophobic region at the transhydrogenation site. This initial reactivity is followed by a positioning of NAD(H) (or the NAD+ photoprobe analogue) above or periphery to the NADP(H) nucleotide present at the active site region. Supportive evidence for this model for transhydrogenation is presented and discussed."
