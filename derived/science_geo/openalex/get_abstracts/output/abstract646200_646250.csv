https://openalex.org/W2999950615,"Bound states in the continuum (BICs) represent localized modes with energies embedded in the continuous spectrum of radiating waves. BICs were discovered initially as a mathematical curiosity in quantum mechanics, and more recently were employed in photonics. Pure mathematical bound states have infinitely-large quality factors (Q factors) and zero resonant linewidth. In optics, BICs are physically limited by a finite size, material absorption, structural disorder, and surface scattering, and they manifest themselves as the resonant states with large Q factors, also known as supercavity modes or quasi-BICs. Optical BIC resonances have been demonstrated only in extended 2D and 1D systems and have been employed for distinct applications including lasing and sensing. Optical quasi-BIC modes in individual nanoresonators have been discovered recently but they were never observed in experiment. Here, we demonstrate experimentally an isolated subwavelength nanoresonator hosting a quasi-BIC resonance. We fabricate the resonator from AlGaAs material on an engineered substrate, and couple to the quasi-BIC mode using structured light. We employ the resonator as a nonlinear nanoantenna and demonstrate record-high efficiency of second-harmonic generation. Our study brings a novel platform to resonant subwavelength photonics."

Liu et al. now show that m 6 A is also cotranscriptionally added onto various chromosome-associated regulatory RNAs (carRNAs) in mammalian cells. Disruption of m 6 A modification of these RNAs increases their abundance and promotes gene transcription by increasing the chromatin accessibility. Thus, m 6 A serves as a switch to regulate carRNA levels by tuning nearby chromatin state and downstream transcription. Science , this issue p. 580"
https://openalex.org/W2999219571,"A finer record of biodiversity We have pressing, human-generated reasons to explore the influence of environmental change on biodiversity. Looking into the past can not only inform our understanding of this relationship but also help us to understand current change. Paleontological records depend on fossil availability and predictive modeling, however, and thus tend to give us a picture with large temporal jumps, millions of years wide. Such a scale makes it difficult to truly understand the action of environmental forces on ecological processes. Enabled by a supercomputer, Fan et al. used machine learning to analyze a large marine Paleozoic dataset, creating a record with time intervals of only ∼26,000 years (see the Perspective by Wagner). This fine-scale resolution revealed new events and important details of previously described patterns. Science , this issue p. 272 ; see also p. 249"

Correlated light and electron microscopy approaches can help. Hoffman et al. combined cryogenic super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and focused ion beam–milling scanning electron microscopy to visualize protein-ultrastructure relationships in three dimensions across whole cells. The fusion of the two imaging modalities enabled identification and three-dimensional segmentation of morphologically complex structures within the crowded intracellular environment. The researchers observed unexpected relationships within a variety of cell types, including a web-like protein adhesion network between juxtaposed cerebellar granule neurons.

Hull et al. ran several temperature simulations based on different volcanic outgassing scenarios and compared them with temperature records across the extinction event. The best model fits to the data required most outgassing to occur before the impact. When combined with other lines of evidence, these models support an impact-driven extinction. However, volcanic gases may have played a role in shaping the rise of different species after the extinction event. Science , this issue p. 266"
https://openalex.org/W3000050177,"Negative checkpoint regulators (NCRs) temper the T cell immune response to self-antigens and limit the development of autoimmunity. Unlike all other NCRs that are expressed on activated T lymphocytes, V-type immunoglobulin domain-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) is expressed on naïve T cells. We report an unexpected heterogeneity within the naïve T cell compartment in mice, where loss of VISTA disrupted the major quiescent naïve T cell subset and enhanced self-reactivity. Agonistic VISTA engagement increased T cell tolerance by promoting antigen-induced peripheral T cell deletion. Although a critical player in naïve T cell homeostasis, the ability of VISTA to restrain naïve T cell responses was lost under inflammatory conditions. VISTA is therefore a distinctive NCR of naïve T cells that is critical for steady-state maintenance of quiescence and peripheral tolerance."

This flexibility lets them slide in and out of chemical bonds; so, for instance, they can snip a bond between carbon and boron and then stitch a carbonfluorine bond in its place. Planas et al. now report that bismuth can also orchestrate such bond-swapping events. They implement a fully catalytic cycle for fluorination of aryl boronates, in which bismuth hops between its +3 and +5 oxidation states. Science , this issue p. 313"

These phonons can have wavelike properties under certain conditions, which increases the thermal conductivity of the material. Machida et al. found that making graphite samples thin expands the hydrodynamic regime from cryogenic to room temperatures. The researchers measured an extremely high thermal conductivity in the very thin graphite samples, which may be important for a variety of electronics applications. Science , this issue p. 309"

Fleishman et al. observed a bright solar flare with a microwave interferometer, allowing them to map the magnetic field in the solar corona and monitor how it changed during the flare. They found a large drop in the local field strength over 2 minutes, releasing enough magnetic energy to power the entire solar flare. Determining the origin of this energy will help to predict how strong future solar flares may be and their potential space weather impacts on Earth. Science , this issue p. 278"
https://openalex.org/W3000473137,"The parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the associated viruses it transmits are responsible for most instances of honey bee colony losses in the United States. As such, beekeepers utilize miticides to control Varroa populations. Widespread resistance has developed to the miticides fluvalinate and coumaphos. However, Varroa has largely maintained susceptibility to amitraz despite a long and extensive use history. Anecdotal reports of reduced amitraz effectiveness have been a widely discussed contemporary issue among commercial beekeepers. Amitraz resistance was measured by in vitro bioassays with technical amitraz as well as Apivar® efficacy tests. Amitraz resistance was evaluated in commercial beekeeping operations in Louisiana, New York, and South Dakota with a long history of amitraz use. This research shows that amitraz remains an effective Varroa control product in many operations. However, apiaries across operations displayed a wide range of amitraz resistance from no resistance to high resistance that resulted in Varroa control failure. The resistance ratios from in vitro amitraz bioassays were correlated with reduced Apivar® efficacy, demonstrating bona fide cases of Varroa control failures due to amitraz resistance. Therefore, amitraz resistance monitoring protocols need to be developed. A resistance monitoring network should be established to ensure the sustainability of miticide use for Varroa control."

https://openalex.org/W2999359515,"Wing shapes take flight Birds can dynamically alter the shape of their wings during flight, although how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Matloff et al. found that two mechanisms control the movement of the individual feathers. Whenever the skeleton moves, the feathers are redistributed passively through compliance of the elastic connective tissue at the feather base. To prevent the feathers from spreading too far apart, hook-shaped microstructures on adjacent feathers form a directional fastener that locks adjacent feathers. These features are found across a range of bird sizes; however, because the detachment of the hooks is noisy, they are notably absent in silent fliers, such as barn owls. Science , this issue p. 293"
https://openalex.org/W2999115128,"We investigate the presence (and the influence) of disinformation spreading on online social networks in Italy, in the 5-month period preceding the 2019 European Parliament elections. To this aim we collected a large-scale dataset of tweets associated to thousands of news articles published on Italian disinformation websites. In the observation period, a few outlets accounted for most of the deceptive information circulating on Twitter, which focused on controversial and polarizing topics of debate such as immigration, national safety and (Italian) nationalism. We found evidence of connections between Italian disinformation sources and different disinformation outlets across Europe, U.S. and Russia, featuring similar, even translated, articles in the period before the elections. Overall, the spread of disinformation on Twitter was confined in a limited community, strongly (and explicitly) related to the Italian conservative and far-right political environment, who had a limited impact on online discussions on the up-coming elections."

https://openalex.org/W3000106921,"HIV-1 Tat is essential for HIV-1 replication and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological complications. Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV-1 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high-affinity rhodamine-dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA-AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome-resident two-pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium-mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. TPCs might represent a novel therapeutic target against HIV-1 infection and HIV-associated neurological complications."

Four vegan pet foods were assessed (three for dogs and one for cats). The comparisons were made in a descriptive manner. All foods met the minimum recommendations for macronutrients. Arachidonic acid was not reported in any food label. Regarding the FEDIAF recommendations, one food for dogs had low calcium, another had low potassium and a third had low sodium. The cat food presented potassium content lower than recommended. The Ca:P ratio did not meet the minimum recommendation of FEDIAF (2019) and AAFCO (2019) in any of the dog's foods analyzed, and the cat food also did not present the minimum recommendation based on FEDIAF (2019). Copper concentrations exceeded the legal limit in all foods. Zinc concentrations exceeded this limit in two foods (one for dogs and one for cats) and iron levels exceeded the legal limit in one dog food. One of the dog foods did not meet the minimum recommendation for methionine and the cat food did not meet the minimum recommendation for arginine. In addition, when the amount of nutrients consumed by animals with low energy requirements was simulated, in addition to the same non-conformities described above, it was observed that the cat food does not meet the minimum recommended of protein and taurine in unit/Kg0.67. It was concluded that all foods analyzed had one or more nutrients below the recommended levels and some presented zinc and copper excess, therefore, these foods should not be recommended for dogs and cats, because dietary deficiencies found may lead to health risks for dogs and cats. Furthermore, manufacturers should review their formulations to ensure the nutritional adequacy of these foods."

https://openalex.org/W2999320199,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it is associated with different neurological disorders. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the gut-brain-axis has a central function in the perpetuation of IBS, and for this reason, it can be considered a possible therapeutic target. N-Palmitoylethanolamine-oxazoline (PEA-OXA) possesses anti-inflammatory and potent neuroprotective effects. Although recent studies have explained the neuroprotective properties of PEA-OXA, nothing is known about its effects on the gut-brain axis during colitis. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism and the effect of PEA-OXA on the gut-brain axis in rats subjected to experimental colitis induced by oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Daily oral administration of PEA-OXA (10 mg/kg daily o.s.) was able to decrease the body weight loss, macroscopic damage, colon length, histological alteration, and inflammation after DSS induction. Additionally, PEA-OXA administration enhanced neurotrophic growth factor release and decreased the astroglial and microglial activation induced by DSS. Moreover, PEA-OXA restored intestinal permeability and tight junctions (TJs) as well as reduced apoptosis in the colon and brain. In our work, we demonstrated, for the first time, the action of PEA-OXA on the gut-brain axis in a model of DSS-induced colitis and its implication on the secondary effects associated with colonic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3000307982,"Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of major pathogens worldwide. Modelling their population dynamics and mapping their distribution can contribute effectively to disease surveillance and control systems. Two main approaches are classically used to understand and predict mosquito abundance in space and time, namely empirical (or statistical) and process-based models. In this work, we used both approaches to model the population dynamics in Reunion Island of the 'Tiger mosquito', Aedes albopictus, a vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, using rainfall and temperature data. We aimed to i) evaluate and compare the two types of models, and ii) develop an operational tool that could be used by public health authorities and vector control services. Our results showed that Ae. albopictus dynamics in Reunion Island are driven by both rainfall and temperature with a non-linear relationship. The predictions of the two approaches were consistent with the observed abundances of Ae. albopictus aquatic stages. An operational tool with a user-friendly interface was developed, allowing the creation of maps of Ae. albopictus densities over the whole territory using meteorological data collected from a network of weather stations. It is now routinely used by the services in charge of vector control in Reunion Island."

In numerous published studies ethanol use has been shown to be an environmental risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development; however, the influence of ethanol exposure on normal colon epithelial cell biology remains poorly understood. We investigated the potential molecular effects of ethanol exposure in normal colon 3D organoids in a small pilot study (n = 3) using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. We identify 1965 differentially expressed genes and 2217 differentially accessible regions of chromatin in response to ethanol treatment. Further, by cross-referencing our results with previously published analysis in colorectal cancer cell lines, we have not only validated a number of reported differentially expressed genes, but also identified several novel candidates for future investigation. In summary, our data highlights the potential importance for the use of normal colon 3D organoid models as a novel tool for the investigation of the relationship between the effects of environmental risk factors associated with colorectal cancer and the molecular mechanisms through which they confer this risk."
https://openalex.org/W2999533821,"Identifying strategies to maintain seafood supply is central to global food supply. China is the world’s largest producer of seafood and has used a variety of production methods in the ocean including domestic capture fisheries, aquaculture (both freshwater and marine), stock enhancement, artificial reef building, and distant water fisheries. Here we survey the outcomes of China’s marine seafood production strategies, with particular attention paid to the associated costs, benefits, and risks. Benefits identified include high production, low management costs, and high employment, but significant costs and risks were also identified. For example, a majority of fish in China’s catches are one year-old, ecosystem and catch composition has changed relative to the past, wild and farmed stocks can interact both negatively and positively, distant water fisheries are a potential source of conflict, and disease has caused crashes in mariculture farms. Reforming China’s wild capture fisheries management toward strategies used by developed nations would continue to shift the burden of production to aquaculture and could have negative social impacts due to differences in fishing fleet size and behavior, ecosystem structure, and markets. Consequently, China may need to develop novel management methods in reform efforts, rather than rely on examples from other large seafood producing countries. Improved accounting of production from fisheries and aquaculture, harmonization and centralization of historical data sets and systematic scientific surveys would improve the knowledge base for planning and evaluating future reform."
https://openalex.org/W2998909501,"Objectives Low genetic diversity can lead to reduced average fitness in a population or even extinction. Preserving genetic connectivity across fragmented landscapes is therefore vital to counteract the negative consequences of genetic drift and inbreeding. This study aimed to assess the genetic composition and consequently the conservation status of a nationwide sample of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Denmark. Methods We applied an adaptation of the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) technique to 178 individuals from six geographically distinct populations. We used a Bayesian clustering method to subdivide individuals into genetically distinct populations. We estimated individual observed (iHO), observed (HO), and unbiased expected (uHE) heterozygosity, inbreeding coefficient (FIS), percentage of polymorphic loci (P%) and tested for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). We used linear models to test for potential anthropogenic effects on the genetic variability of hedgehogs with iHO, uHE, P% and FIS as response variables, and assessed the demographic history of the population. Results The Danish hedgehog population is composed of three genetic clusters. We found a mean P% of 54.44–94.71, a mean uHE of 0.126–0.318 and a mean HO of 0.124–0.293 in the six populations. The FIS was found to be significantly positive for three of the six populations. We detected a large heterogeneity of iHO values within populations, which can be due to inbreeding and/or fragmentation. FIS values decreased with increasing farmland density, but there was no significant association with human population or road density. Conclusions We found a low level of genetic variability and evidence for genetic substructure and low effective population size, which are all consequences of habitat fragmentation. We failed to detect signs of a recent population bottleneck or population increase or decline. However, because the test only identifies recent changes in population size, we cannot reject the possibility of a longer-term decline in the Danish hedgehog population."

In sum, both the molecular mechanism of PCSK9-LDL binding and the physiological significance remain undefined. We have previously mapped critical LDL-binding determinants in vitro to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the N terminus of the PCSK9 prodomain (18Kosenko T. Golder M. Leblond G. Weng W.

A recent study demonstrated the existence of structural flexibility in the prodomain IDR whereby a mAb preferentially bound to a transient α-helix (29Ultsch M. Li W. Eigenbrot C. Di Lello P.

Herein, we provide direct evidence demonstrating a functional role of such transient helical conformation in PCSK9-LDL association. Furthermore, computational modeling indicated an intramolecular interaction between the CHR domain and helical conformation of the prodomain IDR. This prompted an assessment of natural PCSK9 mutations at or near this predicted interdomain interface. Our analysis revealed several FH-associated mutations in the CHR domain that greatly diminished (R469W and F515L) or abolished (R496W) the ability of PCSK9 to bind LDL in vitro. These data provide molecular insight into disease-causing mutations in the pathogenesis of FH and suggest that LDL association exerts an overall inhibitory effect on circulating PCSK9 activity. Fig. 1B shows the crystal structure of PCSK9 in complex with the EGF-A domain of LDLR (27Kwon H.J. Lagace T.A. McNutt M.C. Horton J.D. Deisenhofer J.

We have previously mapped important LDL binding determinants to the N-terminal 21 amino acids in the IDR (18Kosenko T. Golder M. Leblond G. Weng W. Lagace T.A. Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation.J. Biol.

Two sequences of interest are a highly acidic tract (aa 32–40; EDEDGDYEE) and an adjacent hydrophobic segment (aa 41–45; LVLAL) (Fig. 1B), both of which are evolutionarily well-conserved in mammals as well as other vertebrates (30Holla Ø.L.

To test potential roles in LDL binding, plasmids encoding human PCSK9 with a deletion of residues 33–40 (leaving Gln-31 and Glu-32 intact for signal peptide cleavage) or replacement of the hydrophobic stretch and a neighboring Arg-46 residue with a glycine-serine linker were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Secreted WT and mutant PCSK9 proteins present in the conditioned medium were then incubated with isolated human LDL particles followed by Optiprep density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate LDL-bound and unbound PCSK9. Deletion of the acidic tract (Δ33–40) nearly abolished PCSK9-LDL binding, whereas replacement of the hydrophobic residues with the Gly/Ser 41–46 linker reduced binding by >60% (Fig. 2, A and B), suggestive of a functional overlap between these sequences. As recently reported (29Ultsch M. Li W. Eigenbrot C. Di Lello P. Lipari M.T. Gerhardy S. AhYoung A.P. Quinn J. Franke Y. Chen Y. Kong Beltran M. Peterson A. Kirchhofer D. Identification of a helical segment within the intrinsically disordered region of the PCSK9 prodomain.J. Mol.

Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol.

Helical wheel modeling revealed characteristics of an amphipathic α-helix (AH) for these residues, with a relatively polar face and an opposing face consisting of aromatic (Tyr-38) and nonpolar amino acids (Leu-41, Val-42, and Leu-45), giving the helix a directional hydrophobic moment (Fig. 2D) (32Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. The helical hydrophobic moment: a measure of the amphiphilicity of a helix.Nature. 1982; 299 (7110359): 371-37410.1038/299371a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Because the putative N-terminal helix is predicted to have amphipathic characteristics, a random coil-to-helix conformation change may be triggered in an amphipathic environment of a membrane surface, such as that present on lipoproteins. Therefore, we performed assessments of the secondary structure that this motif forms in aqueous versus membrane-mimetic conditions. Synthesized peptides corresponding to residues 37–47 (DYEELVLALRS) were dissolved in phosphate buffer or in buffer containing n-dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles, a widely used membrane mimetic that can induce α-helical conformation in peptides with inherent amphipathic properties (33MacRaild C.A. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. The structure and interactions of human apolipoprotein C-II in dodecyl phosphocholine.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15209504): 8084-809310.1021/bi049817lCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CD spectra revealed that the motif remained in a random coil conformation in aqueous buffer but in the presence of DPC micelles adopted a distinctly helical conformation (Fig. 3A). Proline is a potential helix breaker due to a combination of steric constraints and the inability of the backbone imino group to participate in hydrogen bond formation. Accordingly, an A44P substitution in a prodomain-derivative peptide prevented a shift to helical conformation in the presence of DPC micelles (Fig. 3B). To test the influence of peptide backbone conformation on LDL binding, we introduced proline residues at two separate positions in the putative helix (L41P and A44P) in full-length recombinant PCSK9 (Fig. 4A). In each case, proline substitution inhibited the ability of secreted PCSK9 to bind to LDL by >90% (Fig. 4B), supporting an important structural role of helical conformation in the prodomain N terminus. We have previously characterized that uptake of PCSK9 into cells is largely dependent on its cell surface interaction with LDLR (2Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Secreted PCSK9 decreases the number of LDL receptors in hepatocytes and in livers of parabiotic mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116 (17080197): 2995-300510.1172/JCI29383Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of secreted WT PCSK9 to the culture medium of HEK293 cells overexpressing LDLR resulted in robust cell uptake, whereas PCSK9 uptake was very low in nontransfected cells (Fig. 4C). Both PCSK9 proline variants also displayed LDLR-dependent cell uptake (Fig. 4C), indicating that these proteins were not misfolded or otherwise grossly defective. In subsequent experiments, we focused on functional effects of the A44P mutation in PCSK9 because the methyl side chain of alanine is nonreactive and less likely to be directly involved in protein function. To more quantitatively assess the effect of the A44P mutation in full-length PCSK9, we performed a steady-state binding analysis in which fluorescent dye-labeled WT PCSK9 was incubated with LDL in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled WT PCSK9 or PCSK9-A44P. For comparison purposes, we also included PCSK9 lacking the N-terminal 21 residues (Δ31–52), which is defective in LDL binding (18Kosenko T. Golder M. Leblond G. Weng W. Lagace T.A.

Competition binding curves showed that the PCSK9-A44P mutant had a >5-fold decrease in LDL binding affinity compared with WT PCSK9 (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas Δ31–52-PCSK9 affinity for LDL was more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of WT PCSK9 (Fig. 5A). We also assessed the affinity of PCSK9-A44P for the purified LDLR extracellular domain (LDLR-ECD), which was decreased ∼20% compared with WT PCSK9 (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, when added to the medium of cultured HepG2 cells, PCSK9-A44P was able to mediate dose-dependent degradation of cell surface LDLRs at levels comparable with WT PCSK9 (Fig. 5D), in agreement with a recent study (29Ultsch M.

https://openalex.org/W3000580744,"Voltage-gated sodium channels comprise an ion-selective α-subunit and one or more associated β-subunits. The β3-subunit (encoded by the SCN3B gene) is an important physiological regulator of the heart-specific sodium channel, Nav1.5. We have previously shown that when expressed alone in HEK293F cells, the full-length β3-subunit forms trimers in the plasma membrane. We extend this result with biochemical assays and use the proximity ligation assay (PLA) to identify oligomeric β3-subunits, not just at the plasma membrane, but throughout the secretory pathway. We then investigate the corresponding clustering properties of the α-subunit and the effects upon these of the β3-subunits. The oligomeric status of the Nav1.5 α-subunit in vivo, with or without the β3-subunit, has not been previously investigated. Using super-resolution fluorescence imaging, we show that under conditions typically used in electrophysiological studies, the Nav1.5 α-subunit assembles on the plasma membrane of HEK293F cells into spatially localized clusters rather than individual and randomly dispersed molecules. Quantitative analysis indicates that the β3-subunit is not required for this clustering but β3 does significantly change the distribution of cluster sizes and nearest-neighbor distances between Nav1.5 α-subunits. However, when assayed by PLA, the β3-subunit increases the number of PLA-positive signals generated by anti-(Nav1.5 α-subunit) antibodies, mainly at the plasma membrane. Since PLA can be sensitive to the orientation of proteins within a cluster, we suggest that the β3-subunit introduces a significant change in the relative alignment of individual Nav1.5 α-subunits, but the clustering itself depends on other factors. We also show that these structural and higher-order changes induced by the β3-subunit do not alter the degree of electrophysiological gating cooperativity between Nav1.5 α-subunits. Our data provide new insights into the role of the β3-subunit and the supramolecular organization of sodium channels, in an important model cell system that is widely used to study Nav channel behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2999348766,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting 45 million people worldwide, ranking as the 6th highest cause of death. Throughout the development and progression of AD, over 90% of patients display behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), with some of these symptoms occurring before memory deficits and therefore serving as potential early predictors of AD-related cognitive decline. However, the biochemical links between AD and BPSD are not known. In this study, we explored the molecular interactions between AD and BPSD using protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks built from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) genes that were related to AD and two distinct BPSD domains, the Affective Domain and the Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, Disinhibition, and Aggression (HIDA) Domain. Our results yielded 8 unique proteins for the Affective Domain (RHOA, GRB2, PIK3R1, HSPA4, HSP90AA1, GSK3beta, PRKCZ, and FYN), 5 unique proteins for the HIDA Domain (LRP1, EGFR, YWHAB, SUMO1, and EGR1), and 6 shared proteins between both BPSD domains (APP, UBC, ELAV1, YWHAZ, YWHAE, and SRC) and AD. These proteins might suggest specific targets and pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of these BPSD domains in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2999378413,"Using a common experimental framework, this paper addresses both the question of the short-term and the long-lasting effects of temporary monetary and non-monetary incentive mechanisms on increasing individual contributions to the public good. The results show that both punishments and rewards significantly increase contributions compared to the baseline, but that monetary sanctions lead to the highest contributions, whereas non-monetary sanctions lead to the lowest contributions. The four types of incentives display long-lasting effects, i.e., contributions do not go back to baseline levels directly after the withdrawal of the incentives. However, rewards appear to have much stronger persistent effects than sanctions, revealing some sort of delayed reciprocity."
https://openalex.org/W3000221405,"Selectins are key to mediating interactions involved in cellular adhesion and migration, underlying processes such as immune responses, metastasis, and transplantation. Selectins are composed of a lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, multiple short consensus repeats (SCRs), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. It is well-established that the lectin and EGF domains are required to mediate interactions with ligands; however, the contributions of the other domains in mediating these interactions remain obscure. Using various E-selectin constructs produced in a newly developed silkworm-based expression system and several assays performed under both static and physiological flow conditions, including flow cytometry, glycan array analysis, surface plasmon resonance, and cell-rolling assays, we show here that a reduction in the number of SCR domains is correlated with a decline in functional E-selectin binding to hematopoietic cell E- and/or L-selectin ligand (HCELL) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Moreover, the binding was significantly improved through E-selectin dimerization and by a substitution (A28H) that mimics an extended conformation of the lectin and EGF domains. Analyses of the association and dissociation rates indicated that the SCR domains, conformational extension, and dimerization collectively contribute to the association rate of E-selectin–ligand binding, whereas just the lectin and EGF domains contribute to the dissociation rate. These findings provide the first evidence of the critical role of the association rate in functional E-selectin–ligand interactions, and they highlight that the SCR domains have an important role that goes beyond the structural extension of the lectin and EGF domains.

https://openalex.org/W3000571044,"Telomerase plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by maintaining telomere homeostasis, a hallmark of cancer. However, the mechanisms by which telomerase is reactivated or upregulated during tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) regulates the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Ectopic expression or physiological activation of YAP increases hTERT expression, whereas knockdown of YAP decreases the expression of hTERT. YAP binds to the hTERT promoter through interaction with the TEA domain family transcription factors and activates hTERT transcription. Furthermore, sustained YAP hyperactivation promotes telomerase activity and extends telomere length, with increased hTERT expression. In addition, we show that hTERT expression is positively correlated with YAP activation in human liver cancer tissues. Together, our results demonstrate that YAP promotes hTERT expression, which could contribute to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2998936827,"In environments where glucose is limited, some pathogenic bacteria metabolize host-derived sialic acid as a nutrient source. <i>N</i>-Acetylmannosamine kinase (NanK) is the second enzyme of the bacterial sialic acid import and degradation pathway and adds phosphate to <i>N</i>-acetylmannosamine using ATP to prime the molecule for future pathway reactions. Sequence alignments reveal that Gram-positive NanK enzymes belong to the Repressor, ORF, Kinase (ROK) family, but many lack the canonical Zn-binding motif expected for this function, and the sugar-binding E<i>X</i>GH motif is altered to E<i>X</i>GY. As a result, it is unclear how they perform this important reaction. Here, we study the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> NanK (<i>Sa</i>NanK), which is the first characterization of a Gram-positive NanK. We report the kinetic activity of <i>Sa</i>NanK along with the ligand–free, <i>N</i>-acetylmannosamine–bound and substrate analog GlcNAc–bound crystal structures (2.33, 2.20, and 2.20 Å resolution, respectively). These demonstrate, in combination with small-angle X-ray scattering, that <i>Sa</i>NanK is a dimer that adopts a closed conformation upon substrate binding. Analysis of the E<i>X</i>GY motif reveals that the tyrosine binds to the <i>N</i>-acetyl group to select for the ""boat"" conformation of <i>N</i>-acetylmannosamine. Moreover, <i>Sa</i>NanK has a stacked arginine pair coordinated by negative residues critical for thermal stability and catalysis. These combined elements serve to constrain the active site and orient the substrate in lieu of Zn binding, representing a significant departure from canonical NanK binding. This characterization provides insight into differences in the ROK family and highlights a novel area for antimicrobial discovery to fight Gram-positive and <i>S. aureus</i> infections."
https://openalex.org/W2999301996,"Human infections with avian influenza viruses including H5, H7 and H9 hemagglutinin subtypes occur at a low rate. Among human infections with H7 viruses, regional outbreaks with H7N2, H7N3, H7N7 and H7N9 have been documented. Early in 2018, a human infection with a novel H7N4 avian influenza virus was reported in Jiangsu, China. This study is aimed at understanding the probable origin and molecular features of this emerging H7N4 virus. Genomic segments encoding hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of H7Nx and HxN4 viruses were compared with this H7N4 strain by alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the human H7N4 virus probably originated from multiple reassortments of avian H7N7 and H8N4 viruses for its HA and NA, respectively, and likely a regional uncharacterized virus for its internal segments. Our data excluded that circulating avian H9N2 viruses were the origin of the H7N4 internal segments, unlike the human H5N1 and H7N9 viruses that both had H9N2 backbones. This index case provided a unique opportunity to examine viral mutations by directly comparing the human isolate with its closest viral relatives isolated from avian species from the patient's farm, which may suggest critical mutations required for viral adaptation in humans. Whole-genome scanning was performed and the sequences of the human and related avian H7N4 isolates were compared. Mutations in PB2 (E627K), PB2 (K683T), PB1-F2 (N47S), HA (N283D), HA(K321E), NA(A137V), NA(K296R) and M2 (C19Y) were identified in the human isolate while no mutations were found in PB1, NP, NS1, and NS2 of the human H7N4 compared to the avian H7N4 viruses. Our data in this report provide further evidence for the genesis of this novel H7N4 virus with a multi-reassortment model and show molecular changes that might be responsible for the transmission of this virus from chickens or ducks to and subsequent replication in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2999698114,"Besides being regulated by G-protein–coupled receptors, the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins is modulated by many cytoplasmic proteins. GIV/Girdin and DAPLE (Dvl-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine) are the best-characterized members of a group of cytoplasmic regulators that contain a Gα-binding and -activating (GBA) motif and whose dysregulation underlies human diseases, including cancer and birth defects. GBA motif–containing proteins were originally reported to modulate G proteins by binding Gα subunits of the Gi/o family (Gαi) over other families (such as Gs, Gq/11, or G12/13), and promoting nucleotide exchange in vitro. However, some evidence suggests that this is not always the case, as phosphorylation of the GBA motif of GIV promotes its binding to Gαs and inhibits nucleotide exchange. The G-protein specificity of DAPLE and how it might affect nucleotide exchange on G proteins besides Gαi remain to be investigated. Here, we show that DAPLE's GBA motif, in addition to Gαi, binds efficiently to members of the Gs and Gq/11 families (Gαs and Gαq, respectively), but not of the G12/13 family (Gα12) in the absence of post-translational phosphorylation. We pinpointed Met-1669 as the residue in the GBA motif of DAPLE that diverges from that in GIV and enables better binding to Gαs and Gαq. Unlike the nucleotide-exchange acceleration observed for Gαi, DAPLE inhibited nucleotide exchange on Gαs and Gαq. These findings indicate that GBA motifs have versatility in their G-protein–modulating effect, i.e. they can bind to Gα subunits of different classes and either stimulate or inhibit nucleotide exchange depending on the G-protein subtype.

At the molecular level, heterotrimeric G proteins switch between “on” or “off” states depending on their guanine nucleotide–binding status. In the inactive state, GDP-bound Gα subunits associate tightly with obligate Gβγ dimers, which in turn serve to prevent spurious nucleotide exchange by working as guanine nucleotide–dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (3Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. GTPase activity of the stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, Gs. Accumulation and turnover of enzyme-nucleotide intermediates.J. Biol.

The Gαβγ trimer is the substrate for the guanine nucleotide–exchange factor (GEF) activity of GPCRs, which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα and the subsequent dissociation of Gβγ. Both Gα-GTP and free Gβγ become active signaling species that engage their own set of effectors to propagate downstream signaling. Gα subunits are classified into four families depending on sequence conservation and the effector targets that they modulate: Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, and G12/13 (5Wettschureck N. Offermanns S.

Based on the above, it is evident that the amplitude and duration of G-protein signaling is highly dependent on the regulation of nucleotide handling by Gα. In this regard, it has become increasingly clear that G-protein activity is controlled by a complex network of regulators that expands beyond GPCRs and Gβγ.

https://openalex.org/W2998933448,"Background In Sunamganj there are fewer than four skilled providers per 10,000 population and just 27% of births are assisted by a skilled attendant. We evaluate a private community skilled birth attendant (P-CSBA) model, developed through the GSK-CARE Frontline Health Worker Programme, designed to address this gap and report on changes in service utilization and health outcomes from baseline to three years post-baseline. Methods This analysis presents the results of a pre-post cross sectional design. A baseline survey (n = 1800) was conducted using a multistage cluster sampling approach. Three years post-baseline a second cross-sectional survey (n = 1755) was conducted across the same project area. To describe demographic characteristics of the study participants descriptive statistical techniques were used as appropriate. Logistic and multiple logistic regression, controlling for a comprehensive set of covariates, were used to assess odds ratios for key maternal health behaviors and outcomes. Results Birth planning and the use of key maternal health services improved from baseline to follow-up. There was a dramatic increase in the proportion of respondents reporting skilled attendance at birth (aOR: 2.18, p = .001). Women also reported significantly fewer complications during the prenatal (aOR: .30, p<.001), labor and delivery (aOR: 0.41, p<.0001) and postnatal periods (aOR: 0.32, p<.0001). Conclusion Private-sector approaches, when coupled with robust efforts to strengthen and collaborate with the public sector, can work successfully to deliver services in underserved communities. The success of this model lends credence to the growing appreciation that reaching our development targets will require governments to work in partnership with private sector actors and highlights the potential of private-public partnerships as we drive towards universal health coverage."

https://openalex.org/W3000337105,"Siberian wild rye (Elymus sibiricus L.), an allotetraploid species, is a potentially high-quality perennial forage crop native to temperate regions. We used fluorescently conjugated oligonucleotides, representing ten repetitive sequences, including 6 microsatellite repeats, two satellite repeats, and two ribosomal DNAs, to characterize E. sibiricus chromosomes, using sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization assays. Our results showed that microsatellite repeats (AAG)10 or (AGG)10, satellite repeats pAs1 and pSc119.2, and ribosomal 5S rDNA and 45S rDNA are specific markers for unique chromosomes. A referable karyotype ideogram was suggested, by further polymorphism screening, across different E. sibiricus cultivars with a probe mixture of (AAG)10, Oligo-pAs1, and Oligo-pSc119.2. Chromosomal polymorphisms vary between different genomes and between different individual chromosomes. In particular, two distinct forms of chromosome E in H genome were identified in intra- and inter-populations. Here, the significance of these results, for E. sibiricus genome research and breeding, and novel approaches to improve fluorescence in situ hybridization-based karyotyping are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2998825450,"Introduction The view that we are in the midst of a global diabetes epidemic has gained considerable ground in recent years and is often linked to the prior ‘obesity epidemic’. This research explored how the diabetes epidemic was represented in United Kingdom (UK) news over the same time period that the obesity epidemic was widely reported. The research was motivated by a sociological interest in how postmodern ‘epidemics’ synergise with each other amidst broader political, economic, moral and sociocultural discourses. Method We analysed three time-bound samples of UK news articles about diabetes: 1993 (n = 19), 2001 (n = 119) and 2013 (n = 324). Until now, UK media has had the least attention regarding portrayal of diabetes. We adopted an empathically neutral approach and used a dual method approach of inductive thematic analysis and deductive framing analysis. The two methods were triangulated to produce the findings. Results Framing of diabetes moved from medical in 1993 to behavioural in 2001, then societal in 2013. By 2001 obesity was conceptualised as causal to diabetes, rather than a risk factor. Between 2001 and 2013 portrayals of the modifiable risk factors for diabetes (i.e. diet, exercise and weight) became increasingly technical. Other risk factors like age, family history and genetics faded during 2001 and 2013, while race, ethnicity and culture were positioned as states of ‘high risk’ for diabetes. The notion of an ‘epidemic’ of diabetes ‘powered up’ these concerns from an individual problem to a societal threat in the context of obesity as a well-known health risk. Discussion and conclusion Portraying diabetes and the diabetes epidemic as anticipated consequences of obesity enlivens the heightened awareness to future risks in everyday life brought about during the obesity epidemic. The freeform adoption of the ‘epidemic’ term in contemporary health discourse appears to foster individual and societal dependence on biomedicine, giving it political, economic and divisive utility."
https://openalex.org/W2998858456,"Introduction Some patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) exhibit elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 with excessive inflammatory reactions or with repeating relapse. To date few reports pertaining to clinical implications of elevated serum IL-6 in IgG4-RD patients have been published. The aims of the current retrospective study were to investigate the clinical implications of elevated serum IL-6 in IgG4-RD patients, and to examine whether IL-6 can predict the activity and/or relapse of the disease. Materials and methods We examined the clinical picture at the onset of 43 patients who were diagnosed with IgG4-RD in our hospital and were able to measure serum IL-6 before steroid treatment. Results The median level of serum IL-6 was 2.2 pg/mL. There was a significant correlation between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (r = 0.397, p = 0.008), hemoglobin level (r = -0.390, p = 0.010) and albumin level (r = -0.556, p < 0.001). When 43 patients were divided into two groups by using a cut-off IL-6 of 4 pg/mL, the high IL-6 group showed higher age, lower albumin, higher CRP and higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (age p = 0.014, albumin p = 0.006, CRP p <0.001, AST p = 0.009). Hepatic swelling and splenomegaly were significantly more prevalent in the high IL-6 group than it was in the low IL-6 group (liver p < 0.001, spleen p = 0.020). Biliary tract involvement tended to admit more in the high IL-6 group (p = 0.060). Conclusion Serum IL-6 level at the onset of IgG4-RD may be significantly correlated with clinical inflammatory parameters and it may also be associated with involvement of the bile duct, liver, and spleen."
https://openalex.org/W3000071588,"The length of anchorage zone of an anchor bolt affects the distribution of axial force and shear stress therein. Based on a shear–displacement model, the load distribution of anchor bolts in the elastic deformation stage was analysed. Moreover, the mechanical response of threaded steel anchor bolts with different anchorage lengths was explored through pull-out test and numerical simulation. The results showed that axial force and shear stress were negatively exponentially distributed within the anchorage zone of anchor bolts in which there were the maximum axial force and shear stress at the beginning of the anchorage zone. In the elastic deformation stage of the anchorage, the longer the anchorage length, the more uniformly the shear stress was distributed within the anchorage zone and the larger the ultimate shear stress; however, there was a critical anchorage length, which, when exceeded, the ultimate shear stress remained unchanged. The calculation formula for the critical anchorage length was deduced and a reasonable anchorage length determined. The research result provides an important theoretical basis for rapid design of support parameters for anchor bolts."
https://openalex.org/W3000076072,"Recent studies aiming to facilitate mathematical skill development in primary school children have explored the electrophysiological characteristics associated with different levels of arithmetic achievement. The present work introduces an alternative EEG signal characterization using graph metrics and, based on such features, a classification analysis using a decision tree model. This proposal aims to identify group differences in brain connectivity networks with respect to mathematical skills in elementary school children. The methods of analysis utilized were signal-processing (EEG artifact removal, Laplacian filtering, and magnitude square coherence measurement) and the characterization (Graph metrics) and classification (Decision Tree) of EEG signals recorded during performance of a numerical comparison task. Our results suggest that the analysis of quantitative EEG frequency-band parameters can be used successfully to discriminate several levels of arithmetic achievement. Specifically, the most significant results showed an accuracy of 80.00% (α band), 78.33% (δ band), and 76.67% (θ band) in differentiating high-skilled participants from low-skilled ones, averaged-skilled subjects from all others, and averaged-skilled participants from low-skilled ones, respectively. The use of a decision tree tool during the classification stage allows the identification of several brain areas that seem to be more specialized in numerical processing."
https://openalex.org/W3000152828,"Insulin secretion by pancreatic islet β-cells is regulated by glucose levels and is accompanied by proton generation. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is present in pancreatic β-cells and extremely selective for protons. However, whether Hv1 is involved in insulin secretion is unclear. Here we demonstrate that Hv1 promotes insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells and glucose homeostasis. Hv1-deficient mice displayed hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance because of reduced insulin secretion but retained normal peripheral insulin sensitivity. Moreover, Hv1 loss contributed much more to severe glucose intolerance as the mice got older. Islets of Hv1-deficient and heterozygous mice were markedly deficient in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion. In perifusion assays, Hv1 deletion dramatically reduced the first and second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Islet insulin and proinsulin content was reduced, and histological analysis of pancreas slices revealed an accompanying modest reduction of β-cell mass in Hv1 knockout mice. EM observations also indicated a reduction in insulin granule size, but not granule number or granule docking, in Hv1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, Hv1 loss limited the capacity for glucose-induced membrane depolarization, accompanied by a reduced ability of glucose to raise Ca2+ levels in islets, as evidenced by decreased durations of individual calcium oscillations. Moreover, Hv1 expression was significantly reduced in pancreatic β-cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, indicating that Hv1 deficiency is associated with β-cell dysfunction and diabetes. We conclude that Hv1 regulates insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis through a mechanism that depends on intracellular Ca2+ levels and membrane depolarization. Insulin secretion by pancreatic islet β-cells is regulated by glucose levels and is accompanied by proton generation. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is present in pancreatic β-cells and extremely selective for protons. However, whether Hv1 is involved in insulin secretion is unclear.

Islets of Hv1-deficient and heterozygous mice were markedly deficient in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion. In perifusion assays, Hv1 deletion dramatically reduced the first and second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Islet insulin and proinsulin content was reduced, and histological analysis of pancreas slices revealed an accompanying modest reduction of β-cell mass in Hv1 knockout mice. EM observations also indicated a reduction in insulin granule size, but not granule number or granule docking, in Hv1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, Hv1 loss limited the capacity for glucose-induced membrane depolarization, accompanied by a reduced ability of glucose to raise Ca2+ levels in islets, as evidenced by decreased durations of individual calcium oscillations. Moreover, Hv1 expression was significantly reduced in pancreatic β-cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, indicating that Hv1 deficiency is associated with β-cell dysfunction and diabetes. We conclude that Hv1 regulates insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis through a mechanism that depends on intracellular Ca2+ levels and membrane depolarization. Insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is precisely regulated by glucose homeostasis.

A decrease in insulin secretion may be caused by a single- or multiple-step defect in the trafficking cycle of insulin granules, including granule biogenesis from the trans-Golgi network, subsequent maturation, recruitment to the plasma membrane, exocytosis, and endocytosis. Glucose metabolism by pancreatic β-cells accompanies proton generation, which implies a mechanism of intracellular pH-regulation behind insulin release stimulated by the sugar (9Pace C.S. Tarvin J.T.

The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is extremely selective for protons and has no detectable permeability to other cations (13Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E.

Hv1 is activated at depolarizing voltages and sensitive to the membrane pH gradient (13Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E.

In our previous study, we identified that Hv1 is present in human and rodent pancreatic islet β-cells as well as β-cell lines (17Zhao Q. Che Y. Li Q. Zhang S. Gao Y.T. Wang Y. Wang X. Xi W. Zuo W. Li S.J. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells and regulates insulin secretion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 468 (26559003): 746-75110.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.027Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism of Hv1 for insulin secretion of pancreatic islet β-cells is not known. In this study, we discovered a regulatory mechanism for Hv1 in the modulation of β-cell insulin secretory function. Our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that Hv1-deficient mice exhibit hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance because of abnormally decreased insulin secretion. These data provide direct genetic evidence that Hv1 regulates biphasic insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in mice, implying a potential link between Hv1 and the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. To assess the effect of Hv1 knockout on glucose homeostasis, glucose and insulin levels were measured in 4-month-old mice in a fasted state. The body weight curves of control (WT, Hv1+/+), heterozygous (Hv1+/−), and homozygous (KO, Hv1−/−) littermates were almost similar (Fig. 1A), but the blood glucose levels in the fasted state were markedly higher in heterozygous (9.45 ± 0.39 mmol/liter, n = 13, p < 0.001) and KO (9.75 ± 0.52 mmol/liter, n = 13, p < 0.001) mice compared with WT mice (6.3 ± 0.2 mmol/liter, n = 10) (Fig. 1B), whereas the fasting insulin levels in these three genotypes were not significantly different (Fig. 1C). To qualitatively estimate the effect of Hv1 on insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell function, we calculated Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (an index of insulin resistance), HOMA-β (an index of insulin secretory function), and HOMA-IS (an index of insulin sensitivity) from the corresponding glucose and insulin levels (18Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P. Rudenski A.S. Naylor B.A. Treacher D.F. Turner R.C. Homeostasis model assessment: insulin resistance and β-cell function from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in man.Diabetologia. 1985; 28 (3899825): 412-41910.1007/BF00280883Crossref PubMed Scopus (23360) Google Scholar). The results showed that loss of Hv1 had a tendency for insulin resistance (Fig. 1D) because of decreased insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1F). The calculated results also showed that Hv1 deficiency significantly affected β-cell secretory function (Fig. 1E), which is involved in hyperglycemia. To evaluate the impact of Hv1 on disposal of a glucose load, i.p. glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were performed. Compared with WT mice, KO and heterozygous mice 4 months of age showed significantly higher glucose levels following an i.p. glucose load (2 g/kg of body weight) (Fig. 1, G and H). The corresponding serum insulin levels were significantly lower in Hv1-deficient mice throughout the IPGTT after glucose challenge compared with WT mice, providing evidence for an insulin secretion defect in response to glucose (Fig. 1, I and J). Thus, Hv1-deficient mice exhibit impairment in their ability to dispose of a glucose load because of an insulin secretion defect. To explore the possibility that the observed glucose intolerance was a result of peripheral insulin resistance, we performed i.p. insulin tolerance tests (IPITTs) in KO mice 4 months of age. We found that insulin administration lowered blood glucose levels in WT and Hv1-deficient mice to a similar extent, indicating that Hv1 deficiency does not impair peripheral insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1K). Taken together, these data are compatible with the notion that loss of Hv1 results in impaired glucose tolerance because of an insulin secretion defect in vivo. To examine the age-dependent effect of Hv1 on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, we performed IPGTTs and IPITTs in 2- and 6 month-old WT and KO mice as described above. The fasting blood glucose levels in KO mice (9.7 ± 0.31 mmol/liter, n = 10, p < 0.001 for 2 month-old mice; 10.63 ± 0.47 mmol/liter, n = 10, p < 0.001 for 4-month-old mice) were also significantly higher than in WT mice (6.42 ± 0.27 mmol/liter, n = 10 for 2 month-old mice; 6.3 ± 0.2 mmol/liter, n = 10 for 4 month-old mice) (Fig. 2A). There was almost no difference in the blood insulin levels in the fasted state between 2- and 6-month-old KO mice (Fig. 2B). The HOMA parameters calculated from the corresponding blood glucose and insulin levels showed a potential tendency for insulin resistance in 2- and 6-month-old KO mice (Fig. 2, C and E) and significant dysfunction of β-cells (Fig. 2D). The IPGTT showed more serious glucose intolerance in 6-month-old KO mice than in 2-month-old KO mice (Fig. 2, F and G), whereas WT mice showed no glucose intolerance at different ages. Although serum insulin levels in response to glucose in both 2- and 6-month-old KO mice were markedly lower than in WT mice (Fig. 2H), the IPITT showed no obvious insulin resistance in 2- and 6-month-old KO mice (Fig. 2I), indicating that hyperglycemia in Hv1-deficient mice is not caused by abnormal insulin sensitivity or T2D. To delineate the role of Hv1 in insulin secretion, we performed insulin secretion assays using isolated islets from WT, Hv1+/−, and KO mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, 16.7 mm glucose–induced insulin secretion was significantly reduced by 51% (n = 8, p < 0.001) and 78% (n = 8, p < 0.001) in Hv1+/− and KO islets compared with WT islets (n = 8). Basal insulin secretion (at 2.8 mm glucose) in Hv1+/− and KO islets was also significantly reduced by 60% (n = 8, p < 0.001) and 80% (n = 8, p < 0.001) compared with WT islets (n = 8). Direct depolarization elicited by an increase in extracellular K+ (60 mm KCl) also reduced insulin secretion by 59% (n = 8, p < 0.001) and 65% (n = 8, p < 0.001) in Hv1+/− and KO islets compared with WT islets (n = 8) (Fig. 3A), indicating that knockout of Hv1 prevents K+-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Together, these data indicate that loss of Hv1 in islets inhibits insulin secretion. Next we examined Hv1 function in biphasic GSIS by static incubation and perifusion assays from pancreatic islets. In static incubation assays, we measured the amounts of first-phase (within the first 10 min) and second-phase (within the following 20 min) insulin secretion stimulated by 16.7 mm glucose in isolated islets in WT and KO mice. As shown in Fig. 3B, Hv1 deficiency strikingly impaired both first- and second-phase in GSIS. In an area under the curve (AUC) analysis (Fig. 7B), the AUC in KO islets was significantly decreased by 60% (p < 0.05) compared with that in the WT, which was consistent with Fig. 3A. Insulin secretion in the time windows of 0–10 min and 10–20 min in Fig. 3B was calculated as the first phase and second phase (Fig. 3D). The same results also occurred in perifusion assays. GSIS in KO mice was markedly decreased in the first and second phase (Fig. 3E). Our results clearly demonstrate that loss of Hv1 inhibits insulin secretion in the first and second phase. We also investigated the effect of Hv1 on insulin granule biogenesis. Insulin and proinsulin content in KO islets was reduced by 17% (n = 8, p < 0.001) and 25% (n = 8, p < 0.01), respectively, compared with WT islets (n = 8) under basal conditions (2.8 mm glucose) (Fig. 3, F and G). The ratio of insulin to proinsulin content, however, was indistinguishable between KO and WT islets (Fig. 3H), suggesting that insulin synthesis, but not insulin maturation, is abnormal in KO islets. Proinsulin secretion was barely detectable under basal conditions (2.8 mm glucose) in WT, Hv1+/−, and KO islets (data not shown). In the presence of 16.7 mm glucose, proinsulin secretion was reduced by 59% (n = 8, p < 0.001) and 78% (n = 8, p < 0.001) in heterozygous and KO islets compared with WT islets (n = 8) (Fig. 3I). However, the ratio of insulin to proinsulin secretion in Hv1+/− and KO islets in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose was not different from WT islets (Fig. 3J). The ratio of insulin secretion to insulin content was remarkably reduced in islets of Hv1+/− and KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3K). These results suggest that no significant accumulation of proinsulin occurred in KO islets and that the significant reduction in insulin secretion is not completely caused by insulin granule biogenesis. To determine whether Hv1 deletion affects islet development, we conducted immunohistological studies. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic sections from WT, Hv1+/−, and KO mice at 4 months of age showed relatively normal islet architecture in each case, with β-cells concentrated in the core and α-cells located mainly in the periphery (Fig. 4A), whereas the morphology of isolated islets cultured overnight from KO mice was not overtly different from WT islets (data not shown). On the other hand, the number of the isolated islets per pancreas was not significantly different between WT and KO mice (data not shown), which is consistent with the result from the immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4B). However, the average islet size, calculated from isolated islets (Fig. 4C), and islet area to total pancreas area (Fig. 4D), analyzed by immunohistochemistry of pancreatic sections, were decreased in KO mice compared with WT and Hv1+/− mice. Quantification of total β-cell mass displayed a genotype-dependent difference. β-Cell mass was decreased by 13% (n = 6, p < 0.05) in KO mice compared with WT mice (n = 6), as measured by morphometric analysis of insulin-positive islet cells (Fig. 4E). Total pancreatic insulin content in KO mice was also decreased by 11% (n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4F), the same as the result obtained from isolated islets (Fig. 3F). These results show that KO mice have sufficient β-cells and insulin, indicating that the in vivo phenotype is not due to gross developmental defects. Insulin is stored in large dense-core secretory granules in β-cells and released via granule exocytosis upon stimulation. The correct size, number, and docking to the cell membrane of insulin granules are necessary for insulin secretion in β-cells (19Lang J. Molecular mechanisms and regulation of insulin exocytosis as a paradigm of endocrine secretion.Eur. J.

We used TEM to investigate whether loss of Hv1 disturbed vesicle distribution in β-cells. The ratios of small vesicles (<300 nm) and large vesicles (>400 nm) were increased by 4-fold and decreased by 47% in KO mice compared with WT mice, respectively, but the ratio of the medium vesicles (300–400 nm) showed no significant difference (Fig. 4, G and H). However, the total number of vesicles in β-cells in KO mice was the same as that in WT mice (Fig. 4I). This result might explain why there is a difference in insulin content between KO and WT mice (Fig. 3F). Docking of insulin granules plays an important role in regulating insulin secretion (20Zhao A. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Brissova M. Benninger R.K. Xu Y. Hao Y. Abramowitz J. Boulay G. Powers A.C. Piston D. Jiang M. Nagamatsu S. Birnbaumer L. Gu G. Gαo represses insulin secretion by reducing vesicular docking in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2010; 59 (20622165): 2522-252910.2337/db09-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A detailed quantitative electron microscopy analysis of β-cells was performed to study docked granules. The number of secretory granules close to (<100 nm) the cell membrane in β-cells in KO mice was similar to that in WT mice (Fig. 4J), indicating that loss of Hv1 does not affect granule docking in β-cells. We further investigated the expression of syntaxin1A (Stx1a), vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), proteins related to insulin secretion, in isolated islets from WT and KO mice (21Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs: engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7 (16912714): 631-64310.1038/nrm2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 22Gustavsson N. Lao Y. Maximov A.

Their expression levels were slightly down-regulated, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4K). The reduced membrane fusion protein suggests that lack of Hv1 may affect fusion of insulin granules with the plasma membrane. Glucose stimulates insulin secretion by induction of Ca2+-dependent electrical activity, which triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. Glucose-stimulated calcium (GSCa) signaling and GSIS show similar trajectories (23Qureshi F.M. Dejene E.A. Corbin K.L. Nunemaker C.S. Stress-induced dissociations between intracellular calcium signaling and insulin secretion in pancreatic islets.Cell Calcium. 2015; 57 (25861744): 366-37510.1016/j.ceca.2015.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, GSCa can be used to assess the physiological response of islets to glucose stimulation. Ca2+ imaging is advantageous because it provides high temporal precision of real-time changes in response to stimuli at the level of the individual islet (24Dula S.B. Jecmenica M. Wu R. Jahanshahi P. Verrilli G.M. Carter J.D. Brayman K.L. Nunemaker C.S. Evidence that low-grade systemic inflammation can induce islet dysfunction as measured by impaired calcium handling.Cell Calcium. 2010; 48 (20800281): 133-14210.1016/j.ceca.2010.07.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 5, A and B, are representative curves and average graphs of GSCa over time for islets isolated from WT and KO mice, respectively. The baseline, amplitude, timing, and duration of the biphasic response to glucose stimulation were calculated according to Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 5C, the mean value of cellular Ca2+ levels for baseline under basal conditions was increased by 12% in KO islets compared with the WT, suggesting that elevated [Ca2+]i under low glucose does not lead to increased insulin release. After stimulation, both WT and KO islets displayed a large spike in calcium influx, and the mean values for peaks showed difference between KO and WT islets (Fig. 5D). However, the mean duration was decreased by 32% in KO islets compared with the WT (Fig. 5E), and the time to peak was decreased by 31% (Fig. 5F), suggesting that loss of Hv1 results in dissociation between calcium signaling and GSIS. In pancreatic β-cells, the increase in [Ca2+]i occurs with Ca2+ entry across voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels activated by membrane depolarization (6Rorsman P. Renström E. Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic β cells.Diabetologia. 2003; 46 (12879249): 1029-104510.1007/s00125-003-1153-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To confirm whether the change in calcium signaling by knockout of Hv1 is coupled to membrane polarization, the membrane potential difference was monitored with DiBAC4(3) fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 5, G and H, isolated islet β-cells from WT mice were depolarized significantly more than isolated islet β-cells from KO mice after glucose stimulation, indicating that Hv1 deficiency impairs glucose-induced membrane depolarization. Thus, the reduction in insulin secretion by Hv1 deficiency is involve in electrical activity and [Ca2+]i signaling. To assess the effect of Hv1 on cytosolic pH in β-cells, cytosolic pH was evaluated by BCECF fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 6A, the pH in KO β-cells was lower about 0.1 than that in WT β-cells at both 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose conditions. When we changed the glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mm, there was a slight synchronous reduction in pH in WT and KO β-cells (Fig. 6A). The pH under steady-state basal (2.8 mm) and high-glucose (16.7 mm) conditions in KO β-cells was also slightly lower compared with the corresponding WT β-cells, but there were no significant differences between them (Fig. 6B), indicating that knockout of Hv1 has no a significant effect on cytosolic pH in β-cells stimulated by glucose. PMA is a well-known activator of Hv1 and has been used extensively for Hv1 function studies (25Ramsey I.S. Ruchti E. Kaczmarek J.S. Clapham D.E. Hv1 proton channels are required for high-level NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production during the phagocyte respiratory burst.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19372380): 7642-764710.1073/pnas.0902761106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Decoursey T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (12663866): 475-57910.1152/physrev.00028.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We measured PMA-induced insulin secretion in isolated islets from WT and KO mice. As shown in Fig. 6E, in the presence of 5 μm PMA, insulin secretion in isolated islets from WT mice increased 6.3-fold compared with the absence of PMA, whereas insulin secretion in KO islets was significantly decreased by 61% (p < 0.001) compared with WT islets. To estimate the effect of PMA on cytosolic pH, the change in fluorescence intensity at 488 nm excitement was observed with addition of PMA solution. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity for KO β-cells was significantly reduced compared with that of the WT (Fig. 6, C and D), indicating that PMA results in a decrease in cytosolic pH. To further determine the relationship between Hv1 and insulin secretion, WT and KO mice were treated with STZ to induce diabetes. We found that fasted blood glucose levels after STZ injection in KO mice were always higher than in WT mice (Fig. 7A), and the IPGTT also showed higher blood glucose levels in STZ-treated KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 7B). These data show that STZ-treated KO mice seem to be more sensitive to diabetes induction. The insulin content at 2.8 mm glucose was decreased by 91% in β-cells of STZ-treated WT mice (Fig. 7C), whereas insulin secretion stimulated by 16.7 mm glucose was reduced by 97% (Fig. 7D), which is a serious insulin deficiency. Immunohistochemical analyses of islets in control and STZ-treated WT mice using anti-insulin and anti-Hv1 antibodies also showed that the mean optical density of insulin- and Hv1-positive areas in S"

This study investigated the impact of rejection intensity and rejection sensitivity on social approach behavior.121 female participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions differing in the degree of induced rejection (inclusion, medium rejection, severe rejection). Thereafter they were asked to interact with an unknown person during a touch-based cooperative task.Participants high in rejection sensitivity sought significantly less physical contact than participants low in rejection sensitivity. Individuals in the medium rejection condition touched their partners more often than those in the included condition, while no difference between included and severely rejected participants could be observed.The results suggest that the intensity of rejection matters with regard to coping. While participants in the medium intensity rejection condition aimed to 'repair' their social self by seeking increased contact with others, severely rejected participants did not adapt their behavior compared to included participants. Implications for therapy are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2999727365,"Habituation, defined as the reversible decrement of a response during repetitive stimulation, is widely established as a form of non-associative learning. Though more commonly ascribed to neural cells and systems, habituation has also been observed in single aneural cells, although evidence is limited. Considering the generalizability of the habituation process, we tested the degree to which organism-level behavioral and single cell manifestations were similar. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells that overexpressed an optogenetic actuator were photostimulated to test the effect of different stimulation protocols on cell responses. Depolarization induced by the photocurrent decreased successively over the stimulation protocol and the effect was reversible upon withdrawal of the stimulus. In addition to frequency- and intensity-dependent effects, the history of stimulations on the cells impacted subsequent depolarization in response to further stimulation. We identified tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive native K+ channels as one of the mediators of this habituation phenotype. Finally, we used a theoretical model of habituation to elucidate some mechanistic aspects of the habituation response. In conclusion, we affirm that habituation is a time- and state-dependent biological strategy that can be adopted also by individual non-neuronal cells in response to repetitive stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3000717116,"We explored the contributions of the Family Health Days (FHDs) concept, which was developed by the Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) and UNICEF as a supplementary quarterly outreach program in addition to strengthening the routine expanded program for immunization (EPI), with the aim to increase coverage, through improved access to the unimmunized or unreached and under-immunized children under 5 years.A cross-sectional descriptive study of the Uganda MOH, Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) and UNICEF in house FHDs data was conducted covering six quarterly implementations of the program between April 2012 and December 2013. The FHDs program was implemented in 31 priority districts with low routine vaccination coverage from seven sub-regions in Uganda in a phased manner using places of worship for service delivery.During the six rounds of FHDs in the 31 districts, a total of 178,709 and 191,223 children received measles and Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT3) vaccinations, respectively. The FHDs' contributions were 126% and 144% for measles and 103% and 122% for DPT3 in 2012 and 2013, respectively of the estimated unreached annual target populations. All implementing sub-regions after two rounds in 2012 attained over and above the desired target for DPT3 (85%) and measles (90%). The same was true in 2013 after four rounds, except for Karamoja and West Nile sub-regions, where in some districts a substantial proportion of children remained unimmunized. The administrative data for both DPT3 and measles immunization showed prominent and noticeable increase in coverage trend in FHDS regions for the months when the program was implemented.The FHDs program improved vaccination equity by reaching the unreached and hard-to-reach children and bridging the gap in immunization coverage, and fast tracking the achievement of targets recommended by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) for measles and DPT3 (85% and 90% respectively) in implementing sub-regions and districts. The FHDs is an innovative program to supplement routine immunizations designed to reach the unreached and under immunized children."

They face no penalties for shoddy work, which often delays public disclosure. Science found that faulty results and trial registrations—which have the effect of temporarily keeping data secret—are rampant. And although most big pharma companies generally follow the letter of the law, they often game the system, experts say, by failing to register many of the trials they use to gain federal approval for new drugs."
