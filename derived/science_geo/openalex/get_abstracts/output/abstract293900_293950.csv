https://openalex.org/W2085886084,"I have explored some of the interactions between research on higher mental processes over the past decade or two and laboratory experiments on simpler cognitive processes. I have shown that, by viewing experimentation in a parameter-estimating paradigm instead of a hypothesis-testing paradigm, one can obtain much more information from experiments-information that, combined with contemporary theoretical models of the cognitive processes, has implications for human performance on tasks quite different from those of the original experiments. The work of identifying and measuring the basic parameters of the human information processing system has just begun, but already important information has been gained. The psychological reality of the chunk has been fairly well demonstrated, and the chunk capacity of short-term memory has been shown to be in the range of five to seven. Fixation of information in longterm memory has been shown to take about 5 or 10 seconds per chunk. Some other ""magical numbers"" have been estimated-for example, visual scanning speeds and times required for simple grammatical transformations-and no doubt others remain to be discovered. But even the two basic constants discussed in this article-short-term memory capacity and rate of fixation in long-term memory-organize, systematize, and explain a wide range of findings, about both simple tasks and more complex cognitive performances that have been reported in the psychological literature over the past 50 years or more."

This record can be correlated point by point with the isotopic records of previously analyzed Atlantic and Caribbean cores, leading to the construction of a generalized temperature curve for the entire Brunhes epoch."
https://openalex.org/W2078911764,An in vitro study in which isolated prothoracic glands of the Bombyx silkworm were cultured has provided definite evidence that the prothoracic gland is the site where molting hormone is synthesized. The hormone behaved very similarly to free ecdysone on thin-layer chromatography. Analysis by liquid chromatography and mass fragmentography revealed that the hormone is identical with alpha-ecdysone.

Energy depletion does not seem to cause this yearly torpor cycle, and a photoperiodically controlled rhythm that enables the birds to automatically conserve energy in early evening for possible metabolic expenditures required later in the winter night is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2069684768,"Western bumblebees fly straight while homing by polarized light, but zigzag when they use landmarks. That flight difference was used to determine the roles of the dorsal ocelli and parts of the compound eyes in homing. Polarized light and ocelli can prolong foraging at twilight, when landmarks are no longer visible."

Some of these filaments contain enlarged cells which are interpreted as akinetes. A new species and genus, Petraphera vivescenticula, is proposed for this microfossil, which is morphologically similar to the living cyanophyte genus Raphidiopsis. This would constitute the first known occurrence of cell diversification in the Precambrian with an age of about 2.2 x 10(9) years."

https://openalex.org/W1975440732,"Ordered protodolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, has been synthesized at 100Â°C by reaction of metastable precipitated carbonates with aqueous magnesium-bearing solutions. Initial reaction products have expanded crystallographic cells, attributed to the presence of structural water. Longer reaction time produces a protodolomite approaching ideal composition and exhibiting order reflections in x-ray powder patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2161851308,The capacity for phosphate absorption by marsh plants is negatively correlated with the soil temperature of the habitat of origin. Species and races from thermally fluctuating environments achieve greater compensatory changes in the phosphate absorption rate through temperature acclimation than their counterparts from more stable environments.
https://openalex.org/W2088447038,Highly deformed Pleistocene mudstones from the inner wall of the Aleutian Trench and from the continental rise of the Gulf of Mexico show incipient slaty cleavage defined by the orientation of platy and elongate detrital minerals parallel to the axial surfaces of folds.

https://openalex.org/W1615086200,"To summarize, we must make greater use of coal, an energy resource that the nation has in great abundance, if we are to approach our former position of self-sufficiency in energy production. The first step is to move immediately to replace the oil and gas used in electric generating plants with coal and to require that coal be used in fossil fuel electric plants planned or under construction in the next few years. The technology to remove sulfur and particulates from the stack gases is at hand, and therefore environmental regulations can be met. Producing and transporting the required increased tonnages of coal are problems that can be met with appropriate incentives to the coal and transportation industries. Improved mining technology would be helpful but is not a requiremlent. Oil and gas from coal should be in significant commercial production in about a decade. Underground, or in situ, gasification of coal, now in field tests, looks promising as a practical process for recovering the energy from coal, especially in deep or thick beds that cannot be mined efficiently. Recoverable methane occurs in coal beds in the United States in an amount approximately equal to the total reserves of natural gas-about 260 trillion cubic feet. This large reserve of natural gas should be exploited as quickly as possible. Only minor investments in exploration and modest advances in technology are required. Finally, as coal production is expanded. adequate planning and the most modern technology should be used to ensure that coal is extracted with maximum recovery and with minimum damage to the environment."
